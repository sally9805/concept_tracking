EDUCATIOiNPLL TOPICS . THE attention of the public has of late been repeatedly called to the constitution of the Corporation of Yale College and the theoretical and practical interpretation of the several instruments by which the rights and duties of its members are defined . It has been either urged or argued by persons whose opinions have very properly some claim to public attention , that the interpretation of these documents which has universally prevailed , has been erroneous , and that the way is now laid open for important deviations from those traditions of theory and practice which have been held for nearly 200 years ; or , if these traditions should be respected , that it is imperatively demanded by the interests of the institution that material changes should be made in its Charter . The appeal has even been made to the public and to the guardians of the college , suggesting that the eleven members of the Corporation , who are now clergymen , should vacate the whole or a part of their seats in favor of laymen , either at once or by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vacancies which may occur , by clergymen non-resident in Connecticut ; or should ask an addition to their charter by which an additional number of laymen should be secured to the Corroration . In ordinary circumstances , it would seem unadvisable that this general subject or any of these proposals should be discussed by the writer , but the circumstances are such at present as seem to require of his sense of public responsibility and personal selfrespect , that his serious judgment in regard to some of these questions , should be given to the public . For cleurness and convenience I shall consider two points of inquiry . First , is the generally received construction of the Charter of the College the correct construction , or so far probably the correct construction as imperatively to require us to adhere to it in our practice while these statutes remain un // changed ; and Second , ought we to seek for a change in the Charter in any of the ways which have been proposed . The first , sometimes called the original Charter of the College , was enacted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is rugged and indefinite , but as to the most important particulars its meaning is unambiguous and unquestioned . It has been contended , indeed , that the Colonial Legislature which enacted this instrument , had no authority under English law to grant any act of incorporation , and that for this reason this instrument may be dismissed as of no legal significance as to the rights which it would confer or the duties which it would impose . This point we need not discuss , it being entirely irrelevant and non-essential . It is enough for us to know that the body which gave the first Charter had authority as ample as the body which gave the second or third , i. e. , which enacted the law of 1723 , or that of 174*i . All that we need notice is that in 1792 , an addition to a previous act or acts , was made by the Legislature of Connecticut then posscssing unquestioned sovereignty , and that by this act an important addition was also made to what had been recognized as the Charter of Yale College , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Yale College is recognized as modified by the act of 1792 " and is confirmed as a part of the organic law or constitution of the State of Connecticut . If there was authority in the colony of Connecticut to confer corporate powers in 1745 , as the acts of 1792 and 1818 both imply , there was equal authority in 1 701 . The only question which is material is whether the act of 1745 displaced or repealed the preceding acts . That question we will defer for a moment while we inquire what rights were conferred and what duties were imposed by the first Charter , 1 . e. , by the Act of 1701 . We answer , " full liberty , right and privilege . . . to erect , form , direct , order , establish , improve and at all times in all suitable ways for the future to encourage the school , etc . " To whom were these rights imparted ? to ten ministers whose names are given , " being reverend ministers of the gospel and inhabitants within said colony . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given to all whom they should associate with themselves , not exceeding the number eleven or at any time less than seven- " provided also that persons nominated or associated from time to time to fill up said number be ministers of the gospel , inhabiting within this colony and above the age of forty years. ** // The Act of 1723 is of no importance to the question before us . It fixed the number of trustees who should constitute a quorum , provided for the removal of a non attending , non-resident , or incapacitated member , and also fixed the age of a trustee at 30 instead of 40 years . It also enacted that the person who should be elected rector should thereby become a trustee . In 1745 an Act was passed which it has been customary to call the present charter . As known by its title , however , it is " An Act for the more full and complete establishment of Yale College in New Haven and for enlarging the powers and privileges thereof . " It incorporates within itself all the principal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , omitting no one except that no qualifications are stated to be requisite in the persons named as trustees . It is claimed that this act displaced , and in effect , repealed all the previous acts and is to be regarded as the only foundation and beginning of the present corporate life of the college , and that as such it should be interpreted as an instrument by itself , through its own language without any reference to the pro visions or language of previous acts . It is not claimed that there is any formal repeal of the previous acts such as is common if not universal in similar cases , but it is claimed , notwithstanding , that there was a designed omission of a provision which had previonsly been regarded as the most vital condition of the success of the college . The originators of this theory , not content with this legal view of the case , also contend that this fancied new departure in the history of the college , and that this modified constitution of its Board of Trustees is to be explained by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President , who from the beginning to the end of his administration , was in constant and active conflict with the more liberal party in the State . They would have us believe that the President , who in 1742 consented to the expulsion of David Brainerd for his excessive zeal against the representatives of clerical and college authority , was privy in 1745 to a charter , which without its being noticed , took forever away what had been regarded as one of the most important securities of the college and of the church against threatened evil . This romantic theory is most effectually dissipated of the last shred of plausibility by a sentence which we find in a manuscript essay by President Clap , which is in the archives of the collage . This essay was a draft used in the preparation of his printed Essay , " On the Religious // Constitution of Colleges , 1754 , " and the manuscript itself could not have been written earlier than 1753 . The author is arguing in support of the position that Yale College is in its very nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adduces as reason No. 2 , " As the important officers of it are chosen of the ablest ministers in the several parts of the colony . " This shows that the thought was farthest from his mind that any member of its Corporation could be other than a Connecticut clergyman , and that it is simply incredible that in 1745 , Legislature , Corporation and President Clap himself , devised and accomplished this revolutionary change in this charter , by which a layman not resident in Connecticut could be a Fellow or the President of Yale College , and so skillfully that no one except those privy to it had dreamed it had been effected till after more than a century and a quarter . That he was of another mind as late as 1766 , is evident from a passage in his history of the college , pp. 75 , 76 , published in that year , in which , after enumerating the securities providing for the orthodoxy of the President , Fellows , the Professor of Divinity , and Tutors , he observes , " That there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of the civil order , i. e. , the laity , except his most excellent majesty , who by the Act of Union is obliged to consent to the Westminster Confession of Faith , " etc . If any more proof were needed in respect to his never-ceasing care that every possible precaution should be taken for the formal orthodoxy of President , Fellows , Professors and Tutors , it is to be found in the action of the President and Fellows in 1753 , which imposed the Savoy Confession and the Saybrook Platform upon every one of these officials . If now we leave these general considerations and return to the charter itself of 1745 and compare it with the acts of 1701 and 1723 we find that not a single provision that bears upon the question can admit any other construction than that the later Acts suppose that the earlier are still in force and imply and refer to them . The later never repeals the earlier , it simply makes it more explicit and supplies its defects , omitting a single provision which was so obvious as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible , is still nearer to the point is a special feature of the act of 1792 , which was the outcome of the liberal policy of President Stiles in finally overcoming the acrimony that had been aroused against the C*Alege under its former Presidentwhich liberal policy has been of late erroneously antedated by // some forty or fifty years . This is the modification* which was effected in the charter by which eight civilians were admitted as members of the Board by virtue of their civil offices , while by the same instrument provision is made for the perpetuation of the original eleven by their own election , thus continuing the arrangement by which in the language of President Clap in 1753 , " the important officers of it are chosen of the ablest ministers in the Colony . " We find also that in 1818 , " the charter of Yale College as modifled by the agreement with the corporation thereof in pursuance of an Act of the General Assembly passed May , 1792 , is hereby confirmed . " These facts seem not only to justify but to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this corporation are defined and conceded in a series of acts supplementing one another and to some extent modifying one another , the principal of which were passed in 1701 , 1723 , 1745 , 1792 , 1818 , 1819 , 1872 , and that all concur in requiring that eleven members of this body , the President included , must be ministers of the gospel , resident in Connecticut , who as Trustees are elected by vote of their own members , inasmuch as the statute of 1792 declares that " every such vacancy shall forever hereafter be supplied by them and their successors , by election in the same manner as though this act had never passed . " From all of these data we conclude that the evidence is ample and decisive that the successors , of the original trustees are compelled to elect as their associates and successors , clergymen and residents of Connecticut , one of whom must be the President . There are graduates and friends of the college who accept this conclusion who contend that some or all of these provisions should be changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fewer , to be elected in place of some or all of the clergymen . Others contend that clergymen , not residents of Connecticut should be made eligible . Others , that in either event the practice of electing clergymen other than Congregational should be introduced , in order to secure representatives from other denominations of Christians . Much is also made of the fact , that in view of the rapid development of the several schools of the University it is absolutely necessary that the Corporation should become more efficient in the direction and control of these schools in order to give greater unity and efficiency to the whole academical body . It is either asserted or assumed that the graduates have the right and the duty to control the University through its cor // poration and that the prospect is encouraging , that under the operation of the present system this control will soon pass into the hands of clerical non-graduates . In reference to the first of these suggestions we present a few reasons why the unbroken tradition of the College should be maintained which gives to members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust . Aside from these general reasons , we name one or two special reasons why this is especially true of Yale College . Of this College in comparison with every other it has been eminently true that each of its several departments has been vivified and controlled by its Faculty , while all have been held together and accredited by its corporation . In the Academical Department the Faculty have for the last 70 years largely determined its policy , propose*l changes in the subjects and methods of instruction , nominated officers and to a very large extent , actively and efficiently exerted themselves for the increase of its endowments . Most if not all of the efforts which have been made for the collection of its funds have been inspired , directed and made efficient by the officers of this department . From the first formal effort in 1831 , to the last which began in 1871 , which was more or less distinctly assumed by the graduates , and in many independent efforts to the present time they have have been personally efficient and successful . Some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to conlmunicate with any person who might properly be applied to for aid . Many of the large donations to the treasury of this department and indeed to some of the other departments may be traced to their personal activity . The same has been eminently true of the Medical and Theological departments , and of the Sheffield Scientific School , all of which may be said to be the creations of their respective Faculties . The Department of Law has been in another sense the creation of its Faculty , it having for a long time been regarded and managed as a private enterprise , seeking and finding countenance in the University . The School of Fine Arts owed its original endowments to the countenance and coöperation of a few members of other Faculties before it had any faculty of its own . The School of Philosophy or the Graduate Department has done excellent work for small classes through its associated Faculty , to whose zeal and perseverance its slow but certain growth is to be almost entirely ascribed . It is not surprising that in these independent growths there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mutual relationship , and especially that their connection with the Corporation should fail of theoretical symmetry or subordination , or that there should be an apparent rather than a real waste of force and perhaps of money in the founding of chairs of instruction and the distribution of functions . That these rather apparent than real defects of this sort which are certain to be outgrown , should be ascribed to a defect in the administration or organization of the Corporation may well occasion some surprise . For his colleagues in the Corporation the President thinks it proper to say that there has never been an unwillingness to give advice or express sympathy when there has been occasion for either , however unwise it may have been thought to obtrude it when it would be unwelcome ; and for himself , that he has never declined to preside at the meetings of the several Faculties , but has always been present when his presence was desired , and has uniformly been consulted in respect to any important act or measure of administration in every one of them . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of subordinate boards of management and trust which has been adduced as an evidence that the administrative capacity of the corporation is unequal to its present responsibilities may be distinctly traced to insinuations against this capacity made some sixteen or seventeen years ago , which were similar to those which are urged at the present time . These insinuations consisted of unfavorable if not contemptuous suggestions as to the competency of a corporation made up of country ministers to manage property with skill and success , and as the result of these wise or unwise suggestions , two or three financial boards came into being , for the benefit of the college . It was an example of the irony of truth , that the treasurer of this very corporation after the expiration of some twenty years of the most trying financial events should receive the most unqualified commendation from a severe yet truthful and competent critic who had every opportunity to judge and was not in disposed to judge severely . We have allowed to ourselves a longer digression than perhaps we ought in order to explain one or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ College . We urge for reasons both general and special , that its constitution ought not to be changed . Nothing could possibly have been more unfortunate during the history of this College for the last twenty-five years // than to have been under the control of a well-meaning but officious board of trust . Nothing could be more injurious to its future prosperity than a vei-y serious change in the functions or disturbance of the relative independence of its several Faculties , whether it respects the Corporation or one another . The efforts for a greater theoretical and practical unity to be successful must be put forth from within each separate Faculty and be adjusted to corresponding efforts and desires from the co*rdinate departments . It is believed that the several Faculties are united in this opinion , however great may be the variety of opinion as to what each may desire or claim . There are not a few general reasons why a board such as we have at present may be regarded as fulfilling the conditions of ideal perfection as satisfactorily as most human organizations . This may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the several functions which are essential to the growth of a single school of science or letters , or the combination of several in a great University . Among these are conspicuous , ( 1 ) the determination and endorsement of its policy in respect to the kind of education or culture which is to be given ; ( 2 ) The selection of its officers ; and ( 3 ) The raising and management of its funds . We urge that a College or University Corporation can not be expected to originate action in any one of these forms except the last . It may do much to countenance and criticise , arrest and modify action in the other two forms which we have named , and in these efforts it may be eminently useful . We also contend that for the discharge of these several functions , the board , as at present constituted of Connecticut clergymen of a single denomination , associated with the two highest officials of the State and with six gentlemen chosen by and of the graduates in all parts of the country , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any human organization . Let this corporation be altered according to any of the ideals proposed , let it consist of laymen only , or of laymen and clergymen in reversed proportions and let them be distributed widely through the several States and represent the several ages and tastes of the graduates , and let them meet often and remain long in conclave , they would frequently find themselves helpless in the elimination of general principles , the determination of special details or the election of professors and teachers . Their uncertainty , timidity or rashness would be none the less serious or inevitable were all of them elected as individuals // or by groups , with the recurring excitements and occasional scandals which are not unknown in University canvasses in England and this country . In raising funds such a body might do something , by those of its members who should enter upon the work with individual zeal , as has been demonstrated in the case of Princeton College by the splendid results which have been wrought out by the inspiration and skill of two or three wealthy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundreds of thousands in endowments . Something has been done in this way for Yale , but the effective inspiration in this direction has oftener come from members of its Faculty . I dwell on this point at length because it is no more than just to the present and future members of the Corporation , as also to the several Faculties , that some settled and rational conclusions should be reached in regard to what may be expected from this body in the development of the University . Let me say , then , that the revising , the confirming , or denying functions of the Corporation are of the greatest possible value when exercised with respect to such questions as its members are competent to decide , and as they reflect the queries and doubts as well as the convictions and desires of the public in respect to the influence and success of the instructors , the morality and the industry of the students , and the general policy of the institution . So , too , in the election of its permanent officers , it is of immense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be had  --  a knowledge which is entirely of another sort than that gained by public notoriety , or private testimonials , both of which so often impose upon great corporations made up of men who are too much oppressed by professional cares or public responsibilities to give more than a fleeting thought to the subjects before them and who dismiss every questiQn which they decide , once for all , as soon as it is disposed of . No class of men seems on the whole better fitted to act with efficiency and success as members of such a Corporation than studious and thoughtful clergymen , who first of all are in a condition to know one another , and second , have the leisure and opportunity to know the college directly and indirectly , who also keep in some active sympathy with learning and science and culture and progress , whose Christian vows and professional duties train and inspire them to live for their fellow men and to recognize as supreme the eternal verities of Christian Philosophy . There are a few so // called cities in Connecticut , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eminent in other professions . The writer of this article may be pardoned for expressing the opinion that a man may be learned , sagacious , and wise , even if he is a clergyman in the country . Those who have had the great blessing of a training in the household of such a clergyman , and have seen and measured men elsewhere have no question in respect to this point . A few young men who ought to know better may say flippant things about country clergymen , while they abound in their flatteries of popular preachers in the city , but older men who know men , understand that not a few of those who live apart from the world of news and excitement , are the best informed as to the men and measures which give character to University life . To fulfill all the conditions of successful administration the majority of the members of such a board ought not to be remote from one another in residence . They ought to meet one another frequently and on terms of familiar confidence . I may add that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that its clerical members should belong to the same religions denomination . Beside other reasons which might be given this seems decisive , that this is their best security against a sectarian bias in administration . It is notorious that there are no arenas which are so favorable for sectarian influences and intermeddling as those colleges and universities which are controlled by corporations which consist of representatives of different denominations . Some very successful State universities controlled by relatively permanent Boards of Regents are notoriously embarrassed by this disturbing influence . I do not have in mind a college which is avowedly denominational , whether it be Baptist or Congregational or Episcopal or Methodist or Presbyterian . Yale College was Congregational in its . origin , and for a long time was Congregational in its aims and administration . It is still Congregational in its worship , and in whatever ecclesiastical relations it retains by its Theological Seminary , but it is not consciously administered for or controlled by any special relations to the Congregational denomination as such . I have nothing to object to such colleges as are properly called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do not care to discuss nor to question . On the other hand , Yale College is in a definite and an intelligible sense a Christian college . In saying this I bring no reproach against those institutions which // do not call themselves Christian or which make it their boast to have no religious position or exert no positive religious influence . But the guardians of Yale College wish it distinctly to be understood that Yale College is not at present and does not propose for the future to become an institution of that description . The great majority of its graduates and friends and patrons do not desire that it should be moved from its ancient foundations . Some of the more recent of its graduates may talk flippantly of the religion of the college , but their underlying convictions will soon come to the surface and assert their authority sooner than they imagine . As they see more of the world and know more of themselves , especially if they have sons to educate , whatever may be their own position , they will prefer that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundations . At a time when so many of the more recent colleges and universities which a few years since made a boast of their greater religious freedom , confess the necessity of a more positive recognition of practical Christianity , Yale can hardly be expected to depart from the old Christian ways and Christian belief in which it has stood so strongly from the first . Nor will it seriously lose in its resources or its friends by a positive Christian influence . The men who will give most willingly and most liberally to its funds are generally men of decided Christian convictions , who are sensitive to any suspicion of a want of earnest faithfulness in the college for which their bounty is asked . But whatever may be the consequences , we are prepared to say with Dr. Thomas Arnold , " It is not necessary that this should be a school of 300 or 150 boys , but it is necessary that it should be a school of Christian gentlemen . " There is another and if possible a graver aspect to this general subject . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis of ethical and religious faith and which are now so freely called in question , or so flippantly and scornfully denied . Let it be conceded that the utmost liberty should be conceded to each individual teacher to assume whatever philosophy of man and human history he may accept , it still remains the duty of a great University to declare to all its pupils , the philosophical reasons for that faith in human duty and in Christian Theism in which our present Christian civilization has had its roots and has attained its growth , and by which alone it can stand . To neglect or deny the obligation , to defend and enforce // these truths , under any plea , however specious , is to be faithless to the individual men who are entrusted to its care , and to the generation of which they are to be the instructors and guides . The more arrogant are the claims and the more contemptuous the air of those who are not content to disbelieve for themselves , but must also teach their pupils that modern Science has no place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more imperative is the obligation that the contrary should be demonstrated from chairs devoted to a Theistic Philosophy . The great majority of our patrons are very properly intensely and perhaps morbidly sensitive as to whether atheistic Agnosticism or scientific Theism , Naturalistic or Christian History , a Christian or Secular Ethics , shall leaven the minds of our pupils and control the atmosphere of the University . No better security can be furnished than that which is furnished by a Corporation constituted like our own . So far as I know there is no desire on the part of any one of our several Faculties , of any considerable change in the constitution of the Corporation . They have adjusted themselves to the relations in which they are placed , and have endeavored to meet the responsibilities which are laid upon themselves . They would welcome large additions to our funds , and often wonder that ampler gifts do not flow into the treasury of an institution which seems so rich in the number and resources of its graduates , but they have long since learned that their own efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own . It seems to be assumed that if the representation from the alumni was largely increased , both absolutely and relatively , their responsibility for larger pecuniary endowments would at once be acknowledged and responded to by a very large nuitiber of wealthy graduates . The fact is overlooked that at present a large majority of the Corporation are graduates , and have access to very many of their wealthy friends . I may add that in the workings of the present system the most entire harmony has prevailed among its members . For fourteen years , the clerical and elected members have acted with unbroken unanimity and cordial good feeling . They have been represented in equal numbers on the financial committee , upon which the most important responsibilities are imposed . Scarcely a ripple of irritation or animosity has been discerned or suspected . The amplest opportunity has been allowed of suggestion and encouragement to the duties and labors possible to the members of either class . The // clerical members have been as eager to propose and further any project for the increase of funds as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see how the enlargement of the number of the latter should make any essential difference in these particulars , especially when we consider that the possibility of such efforts has been constantly before the minds of many , if not of all its members , and made a matter of earnest and thoughtful consideration . To raise money in large or small sums , requires special gifts , much patient and exclusive attention . It has not often happened that twenty-four men could be discovered by the happiest chance , who should join these gifts to the other qualifications which are properlyrequired in members of such a board . The evils attendant upon annual elections , especially if personal feeling or some imagined or real question of principle or policy is involved , are too obvious to be overlooked or denied . Were the men who form our constituency nearer one another in residence or in age , or interested in the personal or local claims of the candidates , or acquainted with many of the questions at issue which concern the policy of the institution , there would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its interests to the shifting and uncertain results of a series of annual elections . But it is easy to see that with the best intentions there might be serious mistakes , and that after a few years , if this body should assume any other function than that of raising money , the institution itself would have no fixed policy , and its claims to the respect of the community would be greatly weakened . With the very best intentions on the part of its graduates , it would fail to command the respect of the artificers and directors of its fortunes . Its annual gatherings would be the scenes of strife and debate . Its venerable halls would be arenas for demagogues and academic politicians , and its academic decorum and friendly festivities would cease to give satisfaction or to command respect . It is believed that the good sense and good feeling of our graduates will incline them to desire that none of these evils may be repeated on a more extensive scale . The graduates to whom the future of the college is entrusted will certainly hesitate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would seem also as though ampler facilities for a representation of the wishes of the graduates and the ventilation of their opinions and also for their organized co&amp;peration with the Corporation and the several Faculties for raising money , could not easily
