txt Mr. W. G. Wills 's new English version of " Faust " was produced at the Lyceum Theatre this evening before just such an audience as might have been expected to assemble in Mr. Irving 's handsome theatre to do honor to an occasion so important . The house was crowded , and there was ajam at the pit doors all day long . All the notable first-nighters were in their places . The performance was received with demonstrations of applause rare even for the Lyceum , but how much of this was due to the wonderful scenic arrangements and how much to the intrinsic merit of Mr. Wills 's resetting of the Faust legend is at this late hour bard to say . The story is a tolerably close condensation of Goethe 's immortal work , the variations from the original being principally in the direction of sardonic humor introduced to lighten Mr. Irving 's part . As Mephistopheles Irving wears the conventional vermilion cloak and doublet , and the inevitable cock 's plume , but his face is cleanshaven . Mr. H. B. Conway as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alexander , pleasantly remembered in the United States , in the character of Valentine , made a tremendous hit , and his one short scene will be the best remembered passage in the play . As the fair-haired Margaret Miss Ellen Terry was stronger than even her most ardent admirers expected her to be , but the effect of her performance was rather depressing , so uniform was the gloom , so keen was the spectators ' sense of the lees : of the merry element in the favorite actress 's character . It has been Mr. Irving 's aim in preparing the setting for Mr. Wills 's play to impart to all the stage pictures something of the spirit and tone of Albert Durer 's paintings . He made a long visit to Nuremberg last Summer , and studied the old town and its treasures , and the results of his visit were shown to-night in many features of the splendid production . Mr. Wills has not struck out into new fields in adapting the story of " Faust " to the Lyceum stage . His play , indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in English . American playgoers who remember the exouisite literary workmanship of " Charles I. , " " The Man o ' Airlie , " " Eugene Aram , " and " Olivia " know what qualities the English dramatist has brought to bear upon the composition of his latest work , but the theme , chosen for him by Mr. Irving , is one upon which many others have attempted to construct an effective English play without success . The first scene of the drama is Faust 's chamber . Mephistopheles does not appear , however , until he crosses the stage in the Kermess ? scene , and the compact is made in Faust 's laboratory , Mephistopheles having donned the doctor 's gown to deceive his pupils . The youth , Wagner , is made one of Faust 's pupils . The fourth scene is Auerbach 's cellar , where some of Berlioz 's " Damnation of Faust " music is utilized . In the street scene , next shown , Margaret sings the ballad of the King of Thule , and the kissing lovers are disturbed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Valentine and his death . The Walpurgis Night revels surpass any spectacular effort hitherto made at the Lyceum . Indeed , - the mounting of the whole play is indescribably ingenious . The picture which closes the drama is one of marvelous beauty , and it introduees effects never before seen on the stage . The scone is Margaret 's prison cell . At one side of the stage is a rude stone cross , at the foot of which the betrayed girl lies dead . From the cross extending diagonally to the opposite dorDer of the stage there is an ascending host of angels . The picture held the spectators spellbound because of its striking beauty and originality . The incidental music was composed and arranged by Hamilton Clarke . The audience to-night was , undoubtedly . pleased with the play ; but it is questionable if Mr. Wills 's work has sufficient vitality and emotional strength to warrant a long run . In fact , it is no more than fair to say at once that if the play has a long run the credit of it will belong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
