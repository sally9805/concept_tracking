THE CONTRIBUTORS ' CLUB . More Re- * WONDER if we shall ever marks on arrive at fixed principles of Realism . art , or if the question between the realists and the idealists or romanticists is to be , like the Eastern Question in European politics , an " eternal " one . The war of opposed opinions is carried on with special liveliness in the field of literature , neither side admitting defeat or check . In the mean time artists continue to create , and each work of true art is safe to certify itself in the long run . I wonder what some of our earlier writers of fiction would have called themselves , if these conflicting theories had been brought face to face in their day as in ours . IDid they work on any conscious theory , or simply follow the native bent of their minds ? Miss Austen said of herself that she worked on a bit of ivory two inches wide , with so fine a brush as to produce little effect with much labor . The works of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong , striking , even startling , that there seems little in common between them and Miss Austen 's quiet tales , whose characters are nowise remarkable either for exalted virtue or deep depravity , are placed in no unusual situations , and come to no tragic ends . Yet if these nicknames mean anything , we should class Jane Austen among the realists . Of course there are degrees of power among the disciples of any school of art . Miss Austen was not great , though Mr. Lewes pronounced her such . Charlotte Bront* , in a letter to Lewes , modestly but firmly expressed her disagreement with this judgment upon an author who , however " shrewd and observant , is totally devoid of poetry and elevation . " While in her own work Charlotte Bront6 drew largely on her narrow experience of life , she maintained the rights of the imagination . " We suffer reality to suggest , never to dictate , " she remarks in the same letter . Her novels are surely no models of literary execution , though Jane Eyre , the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few defects . It may be called melodramatic ; it lends itself , no doubt , to burlesque like that of Bret 's Harte 's Condensed Novels ; yet after all there is present in it a // good sense and a good taste , embodied in the heroine , that saves it from pure sensationalism . And the work of her original , powerful imagination , evident in every page , - an imagination that was never inactive , burning with a clear flame , lighting up and peopling with its own visions the obscure solitude of Charlotte Bront* 's existence , - what a contrast it presents to that of Miss Austen 's well - ordered mind , practical and keen rather than fine or subtle , alert to seize on salient marks of character and the humorous aspects of common life , and hitting them off with such light and easy touches that a careless reader fails to do justice to a cleverness that gives itself no airs . Her limitations are very apparent ; the author 's mental and moral quality is much the same as that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons of discreet judgment and kindly disposition rather than large intelligence and generous soul . In the eighteenth century " good sense " was highly prized ; in Miss Edgeworth 's stories it ranks almost as the highest of virtues . Unless good sense predominate , the most generous traits count for little . What model young women Caroline and Rosamond Percy and Belinda Portman are ! The strength of mind they display in forming a matrimonial engagement is nothing less than heroic . Yet somehow Miss Edgeworth contrives to impress us with a belief in the real existence even of such paragons as Caroline and Count Altenberg . Miss Edgeworth was a more ambitious artist than Miss Austen ; she used a larger canvas , and crowded it with figures , sometimes much too full for good management of their action . The excess of the didactic element in her novels injures them , and in this respect they are inferior to Miss Austen 's ; yet it was through their moral quality that they exercised so strong an influence on her contemporaries , who measured them by a lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having seen the unsettling ef fect of the French Revolution , recognized the value of Miss Edgeworth 's sound views on matters of sentiment and conduct . In the work of both of these novelists there is a noticeable absence of the slightest reference to religion . The literary artist may not contradict the facts of observation , but surely he should transcend them if he is to give us the truth of human nature and life ; for truth is a universal , and the actual fact of observation is always a particular , a part which exists only as related to other particulars or portions of the whole . A keen eye and a good memory alone do not arrive at truth . The imagination lifts to a plane whence facts are seen to group and arrange themselves in rational relations , and on the discoverer 's mind there flashes the light of a great induction , such as that in which Newton saw the law or truth of gravitation . How shall we name the greatest artists the world has known ? Was Shakespeare a realist or an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question seem a futile one with regard to any of the highest masters in art ? The theory a writer holds of his art may bave a certain effect upon his production , to make or mar it , but I am disposed to think that his theory is rather the outcome of his faculty , and that he works more independently of theory than he himself is aware , and according to his native gift , - in short , not as he will , but as he must , work . The homely proverb about the proof of the pudding comes to my mind very often : if the productions of some of our most convinced realists , those who proclaim and maintain their faith most loudly , are the result of their theory , then so much the worse for the theory , for the novels of these gentlemen are the most insipid pudding ever offered us . George Sand avowed herself an idealist , and so does Mr. Stevenson ; George Eliot never gave out any theory of her art , and neither does Thomas Hardy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in style , but alike unmistakable in quality and worth , and it may be labeled with any adjective the critics choose to give . German Opera - I echo most emphatically and the voice , the Warning Voice lifted up by a member of the Club at our last meeting . When the German opera was first introduced into America , there was no limit to the enthusiasm of the musicloving population of the great cities . But after a time discreet criticisms began to appear in the most advanced journals . The orchestra was sometimes complained of as too loud , and the principal singers were found to be not quite perfect in their art . It is significant to note that the fault found with the voices was on account of the unevenness of the tones , the marked break between the registers , the disagreeable prominence of guttural sounds in the lower range ; and these ruinous errors are entirely due to the method . Nowadays voices are pushed hack and pressed down instead of being brought forward and held high . The best singers of Wagner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old Italian school and developed through the practice of Italian opera . But , unfortunately , these singers are dying out , and their successors have neither their training nor their practice to fortify them against the demands of " the music of the future . " It is the fashjon to assert that " Italian opera is dead , " and this in face of the fact that the greatest living singer sings only in Italian opera . It is an absurd assertion , for there will always be voices for which florid music is better suited than any other , and there will always be listeners who prefer brilliant execution to heavy recitative . Patti will never want for an audience , nor will any other singer who is perfect in her art . The trouble is that the increasing popularity of German opera has caused a proportionate carelessness in the rendering of the works of the rival school , and therefore it is no wonder that the public prefer Lohengrin in full glory to Lucia indifferently performed . Des Teufels Antheil was recently given in the Royal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sing florid music , Carlo Broschi 's trills and runs , which make that role so attractive , were omitted ! One of the daily papers acknowledged that the omission was a rather daring innovation , but excused it on the ground that " we Germans do not care much for colorature . " What made the incident still more surprising was the fact that only a short time previous to this maimed performance Lucca had sung the role in her most brilliant manner to a crowded and enthusiastic house . In the same theatre , Robert der Teufel was given not long ago with the part of Isabella omitted ! Think of it , - Robert without the Guaden aria ! The following anecdote will illustrate the indifference of the extreme Wagnerites to thorough vocal culture . One of the most prominent devotees of the Wagner cult in Germany was recently extolling the capacities of Marianne Brandt as an interpreter of Wagner , when a bystander ventured to interpose an adverse criticism respecting that artist 's voice ; whereupon the music director hastened to exclaim , " Oh , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to sing ! " and then proceeded in his eulogy of her great dramatic power , her immense capacity for expression . Now when a thorough musician claims preeminence for a singer who " does n't know how to sing , " it is high time to stop and see whither this infatuation is tending . The man was more nearly right than most admirers of the new school of music would be willing to allow . Very few of the younger singers know how to sing ; and at all the great musical centres there is an immense number of disappointed aspirants , pupils who have broken down before finishing their studies , de'butantes // who have been forced to retire after a short and unsuccessful probation , artists who possess all the acquirements belonging to their profession excepting the voice , which has either been spoiled by wrong training or worn out by excessive demands upon its power . The Wagnerites are accustomed to assert that Wagner 's music does not injure the voice . But this pleasing delusion will not bear the test of experience . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh from his summer vacation , to such rOles as Severus or Don Ottavio , and then hear him again after he has been through the Nibelungen Cyclus , and there will no longer be the slightest question as to the effect of Wagner 's music upon the voice . Vogl has the advantage of a perfect method added to the gift of an organ exceptionally strong . Yet the tired sound does not leave his voice for weeks afterwards , and there is no doubt that his power will fail prematurely in consequence of the tremendous strain so frequently applied . The injury from which a powerful male voice can not protect itself falls with still greater force upon the more delicate female organ . Kilt is not only the great volume of sound required which does harm , but the abrupt transitions , the long leaps , the extended compass , are also cruel in their unnatural demands upon vocal endurance . Of all the artists who have attempted the rOle of Ortrud upon the Munich stage during the last decade , Frau Yogl and Frau Reicher-Kindermann are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that is , without any change of register , any descent into guttural tones in the lower range . Frau Yogl ( Frau ReicherKindermann died young , after a brief career ) deserves universal recognition for her excellent method , her smooth , true tones , her entire avoidance of the faults of the new school . She and Frau Joachim are almost the only prominent German singers who render alto parts with the mellow tones which were formerly considered indispensable to the lower range . The Yogl pair , with Frau Wekerlin ( whose voice is like an organ , capable of sounding through and above even the orchestra and chorus of a Wagner opera ) and Gura , whose thorough culture and depth of expression are rarely equaled , constitute the glory of the Munich stage at the present date . The younger members of the company are all crude , all more or less spoiled by bad training , especially by persistent use of the guttural chest tones in their lower notes , which involves thinness in the middle range and sharpness in the high tones . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the music school , or pupils of one or another of the famous teachers of the day , have the same faults and the same deficiencies , and altogether the musical outlook is discouraging . It may be asked , Who and where are the good teachers , the adherents to the true method , the saviours of the perishing human voice ? Alas , that is a question more easily asked than answered . The good teachers , like the good singers , are dying out , and we may be thankful if there are enough left to hand down the old traditions against the time when these shall be appreciated and followed . Certain it is that the teachers who are at present the most celebrated are not true to those traditions ; otherwise their " stars " would be more brilliant and more enduring . Strakosch , who trained Adelina Patti , and partially trained Nikita , was master of the old Italian method , and there was a teacher in Stockholm who knew the secret ; but both these are dead , as is also Teschner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Prague , has no superior in the art . Stockhausen , in Frankfcrt , an Italian professor in Paris ( Sbolcia ? ) , Madame Lanier , of Geneva , belong to the good // old school . There was at least one such teacher in London a few years ago , and one in Boston , and one in New York , whose names deserved to be carved in gold upon imperishable stone , but which are unknown to the writer . One of the most prominent professors of vocal culture in Paris recently said , " There is one thing I do know : I know how to train a voice . I have spoiled enough voices in my time to know how to avoid spoiling them now . " Such a teacher is more to be trusted than one who is still engaged in the spoiling process . But best of all is to find one who knows from the beginning what is to be done and what to be refrained from in the delicate task of developing the human voice . Happy the would-be singer who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who yields to the pressure of his day and generation , and wastes his time and his money to the destruction of his glorious gift . As preventive of disaster , it may be suggested , as a general rule , to avoid any teacher who begins instruction by explaining the mechanism of the throat and the division of the registers , or who requires loud , strong tones before the voice is developed , or who allows the voice to descend into guttural tones upon the lower notes . To discover a teacher in our day who does not commit all these blunders is a hard task , in which it only remains to wish the seeker good-speed . The color My tea-gown was made of *at was not gray cashmere , and it was trimmed with yards and yards of " old rose " ribbon ; my cousin Pamela had been a serious , literal person , with pale brown hair combed smoothly back of her ears . The tea-gown was pronounced in effect ; my cousin Pamela was neutral , and yet the gown forever reminded me of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is not the colors . They are not suggestive of a character neutral and unaggressive ! It was not the cut of the gown , because cousin Pamela 's waists were rigid , the skirts voluminous . I puzzled over the matter , and then I discovered that , after all , the suggestion was in the colors , - in the psychological effect of one on the other , the pink on the gray . As contraries carry suggestions , what the pink was to the gray , that had life not been to cousin Pamela . She was a pink gray , and was trimmed with blue . That made all the difference in the world to her . There are colors that stand up for themselves , as , for instance , yellow ; and there are colors which depend on others , as there is a shade that is olive-green if brown is used with it , or brown if you put it against green . Then there are other colors which depend on the kind of lighting they get , so that stores must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be shown by gaslight . There are also the daylight colors : blue or *pink in the sunshine ; green , yellow at night ; and as the twilight grows , what becomes more black than does red ? It is easy to see how colors vary , and how they depend on conditions . There is a philosophy which discourses upon all this , but with that we just now have nothing to do . Here it is that colors differ from tones . A tone is an honest , uncompromising creation . Given so many vibrations , and you will get the tone you want , be it day or night , light or dark , noisy or still . If the medium be but true , and " untempered " by the hand of the tuner , A is A , and not G , and A sharp is not B fiat . Colors are evasive , and have to be held to their promises , but tones travel in paths of truth . My cousin Pamela was not consciously evasive , but I see now how subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the world . Never was there a more simple-minded , sincere woman , but she was not well placed . She // was not the shade of gray she appeared to be , and so did not harmonize . I think that in spite of her quiet character every one felt there was a discordant element around her , and I remember the family used to explain and account for her . Yet I am sure there was nothing to explain or account for in her character , certainly not in her life . It was the blue with which her life was surrounded that brought out false effects . It made her character barren and cold where it should have been gently joyous . When she died , people thought of her as they might of a nun , and the clergyman said at her funeral that she had led a life of seif-abuegation . I do not think so . She missed much , but she surrendered very little . She was one of the women who can not make lives for themselves , but who take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on bran bread , it becomes me to get wheat ; but if , like a young bird , I sit still and open my mouth for whatever comes , I must thrive as I can . There was no question of cousin Pamela 's industry or devotion , and she took a great interest in people and in details . Thus she lived in the life of others . She was like the traveler who stays at home and reads stories of foreign lands . After a time he knows more of Africa than the African does , but no ship ever sets sail with him as passenger for the African shores . So cousin Pamela had opinions upon all she heard about , but there was little that her own experience ever touched . She was always interested in our affairs , living with us as she did . And it was easy to be interested in us , we were so merry , so much alive . My father and mother were exactly the same age , and had married young ; and when I came to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took my place , and nothing was different between us , except that they had their friends and I had lovers . The play went on around cousin Pamela , but she never dreamed of going on the stage , nor indeed of sitting in the audience . She busied herself about the wings , and saw the wrong side of the scenery . She fancied she knew how everything looked ; but how could she , when the actors turned their backs on her , and the property-man was ever in her mind ? Yet by her orderly supervision of affairs she helped keep the centre of gravity in its place ; and I know of no greater cause of disturbance than the allowing of the centre of gravity to shift about . Everything pulls wrong , and readjustments are difficult . Cousin Pamela knew that our view of life differed from her own ; of course she made her own the standard of comparison , and was often sorry for us , but we took her for granted . We thought her old in years , and she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great deal , and stood for themselves . You had to surrender a good many things , but you did not care , because you did not want to do them . Being sick governed the whole case . As for age , she really was not much older than my parents , but she counted her years , and not her strength . In the circle to which she belonged , people " settled " early . From fifteen to twenty they went up-hill , from fifty to death they went down ; and so there was a long level of thirty years , when unmarried women or women without children were middle-aged . And I am not sure that this is not a most comfortable division of life . You leave the fever and fret of youth , and have not come to the indifference of age . On such a plateau we should be serene , and there should be little force lost in friction . Perhaps cousin Pamela settled herself early because she had no thought of marrying . She had had her little dream , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love with her minister . She viewed him as a saint in the pulpit , and a suffering widower at home . What the odor is to the rose , so , to her , were his sermons to his character , and she spent // long hours , when she was busy with her needle , dreaming of all she could do to make him happy . After a while she came to know him personally , and love died from starvation . The seed was sown on a rock , and there was no nourishment for it . He was commonplace , selfish , and uninteresting , and the glamour faded before such facts . After this , she had no thought of love ; she was too busy thinking of all she had to do . People take it for granted that old maids must have histories , that every human being must go through a given experience ; but hearts often sleep from birth to death . It is as foolish a mistake as to suppose that all married people who are content are so because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and very few of us can sing in the pitch it gives . Cousin Pamela sighed sometimes , remembering , but she had lost nothing ; she had had nothing . One of the shaping tenets of her life was her resolution in holding on to the position of a lady . She drew the line between the lady and the working-woman on the question of payment . A lady could do anything that was necessary , because work degraded no one , but a lady was never paid . It was payment that degra&amp;ed . What my mother gave her in clothing cousin Pamela accepted as her due , but not as wages . She gave her services for protection , and because it became her , as a member of the family , to be useful . This was cousin Pamela as we knew her , but she was in truth something different , because she was forever being explained . Why should so simple a character need explanation ? I believe that if her soul was in death sown by us as wheat , in its new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or perhaps even a palm-tree , and so in the other life we shall never recognize her ! That is why she was so curious in many ways , and what we thought eccentricities in her were the hints given by an un developed , suppressed creature . If she haAl had a fond mother , who would have placed her in a hot-house atmosphere , and then expected things of her , who can tell what she might have been ! I come back to it , - her life should have been trimmed with old rose , and not with blue . My parents and I found blue most satisfactory and becoming , but it made our poor cousin lead-colored . It killed the sensitive gray of her character , and I am sure we never saw her as she was . I fear she never knew herself , - not in this life . A Day on the - Mr. Bradford Torrey , disMountain. coursing in his happiest vein of the charms of An Old Road ( Atlantic Monthly , November , 1887 ) , allowed himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s conceit of those persons who can not be content to hold familiar intercourse with Nature along the beaten paths , but must be ever scrambling through trackless woods or keeping tally of the miles they traverse . I have my own favorite wood paths , and Mr. Torrey 's delightful essay brought them all to mind , with their border of " mosses , ferns , and flowers shy That hide like gentle nuns from human eye To lift adoring perfumes to the sky . " But the forest has also its spell ; at the risk of treachery to my cherished Wordsworthian traditions , and of classification in the Byronic category , I must confess to " a pleasure in the pathless woods , " and a passionate delight in the exercise of tramping . To start off on a clear August morning , with all the hours till sunset lying before one like a shining river , that dances and ripples , and curves away round the hill to a fairy-land of the unknown ; and to return at night with the hours rolled up and stored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through all one 's bones , and a physical content which is almost equal to the mental gain of having made one 's peace with the universe , - that is // a day 's pleasure as rounded and complete as the Alpha of dawn and the Omega of slumber can make it . I passed one such day in wandering over a shaggy New Hampshire mountain , which lay stretched at length like some uncouth animal , with its lower ridges , for the most part densely wooded , extended like broad , rough paws . I went on and on , with that restlessness which comes to one with the breath of the mountains , when motion seems a prime condition of enjoyment , and there is a synthetic pleasure in passing beautiful scenes with a mere glance , and obliterating details in the stark impression of loneliness and freedom . I came upon a little woodland dell between two ridges , wide and shallow , with sharply defined walls ; on one side a steep wooded ascent , and on the other a perpendicular ledge of rock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot where shade and silence were held as in a vessel . The trees were old and apart ; there was no underbrush ; the ground showed mossy dimples in which one would naturally look for a spring , but no spring gathered in its bosom the moisture of the dell , or interrupted with its tinkle the perfect silence . The ravine itself , in its transparent freshness and coolness , was like a hidden forest pool . The only living thing I saw there was a shy , olive-backed thrush , who appeared for an instant , and flew noiselessly away , accentuating , as it were , by his vanishing the absence of life . From the greenness and cloistered loveliness of the little dell it was a transition almost as abrupt as sceneshifting which brought me , after a short climb , to an open summit of granite , with a bright vein of quartz running across it , and a large white bowlder perched like a cairn upon the highest point . The sun shone brilliantly on the bare rock ; the wind blew with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two hawks , circling in the air at the bend of the little mountain , strengthened the *impression which it gave of heights and austerity . On one side the outlook was over undulations of forest ; on the other was a view which was not unlike the ideal landscape in the first section of a school geography : a river starting from a background of mountains , and advancing through a valley sprinkled with trees and farmhouses , past a town , under a bridge , and round a little island . At one point , where it widened to a circle , the river had suddenly caught the sun 's glance , and flashed back its rays like a mirror . Near by to the northward , across a wooded ravine , rose the massive forehead of old Shaggy - Top , a rounded granite cliff , with a mane of fuzzy pine-trees ; not a path anywhere , - only tangles of scrub pine and larger forest . I planned an attack , and struck into the woods . Half-way up the cliff I found the fragrant fern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recesses under waterfalls , growing high and dry in the blaze of a hot sun and in the lee of a projecting rock , its odor , faintly suggestive of mignonette , as sweet as in the ipoist haunts where it is usually found . And farther up , in the scant soil of a narrow ledge , was a little colony of delicate blue harebells , a flower which I had not seen in the valley below , and did not see again during the entire summer . From whence had its seeds been tossed to that high window-garden ? In the woods at the top of the mountain the ground was carpeted with deep , soft moss , of a light green hue , on which the leaves of the wood sorrel made everywhere a delicate starry pattern . The moss covered many a pitfall , where the roots of the trees had decayed and left deep hollows ; but the feet move to a new measure in the woods , and take account of such dangers as quickly as the eyes . There is a curious , almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel that we // have a right to it in New England . And away in the heart of the woods , in a slight depression of the mountain-top , I found a little lake , lying tranquilly amid its marsh , with red-tinged pitcher plants in profusion , and thick , low bushes of a grayish-green tint , which gave a sort of minor tone to the landscape . That was Dream Lake , and very soft and dreamy it looked in the afternoon light . A hare started from the marsh grass and ran ; there were tracks in the soft black earth which I tried to identify as deer tracks . The marsh had a look of secrecy deeper than the mystery of the woods . I chose as my homeward guide the brook which flowed from the lake , knowing that it was sure to go down , and pretty certain to seek the direction of the river . And down it went , merrily , in little falls and rapids ; then , slackening its pace , it loitered and dallied in a sombre ravine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I trudged for some distance , walking of necessity on one side of my heels , and trying , by hugging the slope , to cut off some of the windings of the brook , which was always within hearing . I rejoined it at last , and suddetily my companion took a short leap , then a longer one . Scrambling and sliding down the steep bank , I gained a ledge of rock which projected across the stream , and found myself midway down a cascade , where a slender stream of water poured over a precipice which slanted abruptly above and below me . Close by , a feathery birch stood out from the rock , and , looking under its plumes , I could see the familiar mountains and the familiar road , perhaps a mile off by an air-line . A mile more of level road , restful and pleasant after the roughnesses of forest and brookside , was to end my long , happy tramp . A Dakota - As the time for blizzards Blizzard , comes round again , I propose to invite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , southern Dakota . To prepare the minds of the members , let me recall our experience of last January . We knew before we got out of bed , in this little government schoolhouse , that the most awful storm we had ever witnessed was imminent . Liia drew the curtain back from the window by the bed to see if it were time to get up , and her exclamation brought me to the window at once . The sky was inky . In a few minutes the storm began , and in half an hour from this time it was at its height . Lilia ventured a few yards out of the front door at its beginning , and was near not getting back . The wind struck her with such violence as to bring her head down to a level with her knees , and take away her breath . She said she was near falling on her face , and she knew that if she fell she would not get up again . She got to the house , bent at the angle into which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one moment 's abatement or lull , during the whole day and far into the night , when we fell asleep . At first the little frame building creaked and shivered like a ship at sea , and we wondered how anything constructed by the hand of man could stand against that wind . After the first half hour , it was impossible to distinguish the sound of groaning timbers , for the ears were filled with the rush of the elements . It was like the roar and surging of a mighty ocean . We were glad that we were not the first inhabitants , for we should have thought the earth had slipped her orbit and was rushing through space , or that the Last Judgment was about to be ushered in . Being in the house , we could see out a few yards on one side , - the side from which the storm did not come . On the other three sides , the snow beat and came in ( though the house is close and tight ) , and went half-way across the school-room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , from the drying-rope stretched across the room , and festooned the maps on the walls , and finally blocked up the windows till they were as impenetrable as snow-banks . It was a comfort to us to believe , as we then did , that this greatest of all the blizzards had set in as early in other camps as in ours , and that no human being was exposed to its fury . No sun had risen over our heads on that day , and we had rung no school-bell ; we could not know that bells were ringing from many a prairie school-house , and that the fair promise of the day was luring men , women , and children to their doom . We were gazing , awestruck but calm , from our window , and saying that we wished for a photographer to picture forth the arctic interior of a government school-house in a Dakota blizzard , and for an artist , great in portraying Nature 's moods , to immortalize on canvas the tempest-tossed prairie without . On the afternoon preceding this destructive day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind was so great that it lifted up from the boundless prairie the accumulated drifts of weeks , and carried them along in great waves , so that the whole earth seemed in motion and rising heavenward . The outline of these vast billows and the intervening troughs , as seen against the horizon , was the most impressive sight that had ever met our eyes . On the morning of the 13th , the mercury registered twenty-five degrees below zero , and the wind was blowing cruelly . The drifts between us and the village were so deep that we thought it unsafe to ring for the children . But they came over the half mile , through drifts waist-deep to large children , and the two faithful policemen , Stiff Arm and Cut Foot , came to see how we had got through the blizzard . ( Cut Foot 's name was a sore trouble to us when first we came to these Indians . When I called him or spoke of him , Cut Throat seemed invariably to slip off my tongue . Lilia objected seriously , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several private rehearsals that I finally got the right name fixed in my head . ) The school-room was not to be thought of on that bitter day , and we brought the children and the policemen into our bedroom to thaw out . We run the mercury up to one hundred and ten degrees within two feet of the stove ; at a distance of eight feet , it was ninety-five degrees lower . Not one of the children uttered a sound of complaint , but the big tears rolled silently down the swollen cheeks of one of the little girls when the genial warmth of the room began to make her comfortable . Presently the third policeman , One Feather , rode up from the Agency , fifteen miles distant . His nose was badly frosted , and his usually thin face was swollen past recognition . As he had assured us , on our first coming , that he wished to be a " sister " to us , we put him in the warmest corner . Our fifteen - mile - off neighbor , the young teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask if we could give him a bed for the night . He had been trying all day to get to his camp , and had consumed four hours in traveling one mile and a half . His plucky little Indian pony dragged the wagon through the heavy drifts by main force , the wheels not turning , and the horse waddling where he could not walk . The faithful creature was quite exhausted . A sheet of ice inclosed his nose , and an icicle more than a foot long hung from it . This gentle animal , during the blizzard of the 12th , not only broke his halter , but pawed down a thick *stable door , with hinges a foot long . His master went out into the storm to see how he was faring . He spent two hours in looking for him , though he was only a few yards from him . When found , he was a mass of ice , his eyes nearly closed by it , and a giant icicle hanging from his // nose .
