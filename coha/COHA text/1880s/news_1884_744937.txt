txt A Portuguese sailor named Joseph Antonio , who arrived at the Mariners Home in this city a day or two ago from New-York , in which City he landed on Dec. 26 on board the schooner Hope Gower ; a Philadelphia vessel , from Mexico , tells a most extraordinary and sensational story about transactions which he witnessed while on the high seas , A reporter found him at the Mariners ' Home to-day , - and after some preliminary talk the old sailor was gradually drawn out , and his story was found to be a most remarkable one . Briefly told , it is sub- . stantially as follows : " My name is Joseph Antonio , and I am a Portuguese , belonging in the Western Islands . I shipped as steward on board the schooner Hope Gower , Capt . Allen , from Philadelphia , on Sept. 29 ; at Pensac.ola . Another seaman at the same time was shanghaied ' on board the Gower from a . German bark and we were both assigned to duty , he going before the mast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was told , was returning from a Mexican port , where she had discharged cargo of coal , and had ? put into Pensacola to await orders . Almost immediately after going aboard orders were received to go to Mexico ? 1 could never remember the name of the port  --  and take a cargo of mahogany ' for New-York . We immediately set sail , and after being out three or four days the mate ordered one seaman , a Frenchman named Antoine , to bring up , a bucket of water from the hatch . When the seaman came on deck he accidently spilled . s.ome of the water upon the floor , and this so exasperated the mate that he struck the seaman several blows on the face and causing . blood to flow from his nose . On the following morning ( Friday ) when about 300 miles from Pensacola , the Frenchman , after receiving his rations , took his turn at the watch . This was about 7:30 o'clock . About 8 o'clock I saw the mate , who had a lamp in his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did so , he ordered the Frenchman to follow him . As soon as they went down the hatches , which up to this time had been left open , were closed , and I thought this a very strange affair , especially so when the Frenchman did not come on deck again . I knew that some of the crew were in the hold when the mate and . the Frenchman went down . The Captain all this time , I know , was not with them , as . I saw him aft , near the man at the wheel . ' Soon after going below the mate and crew returned , but the Frenchman did not come back and the hatches were not opened . About seven bells , or at 11:30 o'clock , some one asked where the Frenchman was , and the remark was made significantly : " Perhaps he is asleep in the hole forward . " The hatches were then opened and a rope was hauled up , and to my horror suspended at the end of the rope as it was drawn up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noose adjusted about his neck . He was laid upon the deck , and after the entire crew had gathered about , the body was picked up and pitched overboard . When the vessel put into the Mexican port papers were furnished to the American Consul to the effect that the seaman had hanged himself while on the trip from - Pensacola , but it does not seem that the Consul was told that when the body was hauled on deck the hands were lashed behind the body . I had no chance to go ashore , and when 1 landed in New-York I was paid off and discharged , and . when leaving the vessel the Captain said to me : Steward , take care of yourself . ' I came directly to Boston , and have informed the Judge of the United States Court . " THE TIMES 'S correspondent found United States Commissioner Hallett at his home , No. 31 Chestersquare , late to-night . He said that Antonio had appeared before him and had testified to the facts substantially as published above ; ' that the officials had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affair was being investigated by the Commissioner in the latter city . He was extremely indignant because the press had : got news of the affair , and told the reporter that - if he had known that Antonio was going to - tell about-it and talk with a neWspaper man he would have locked him up as a witness . He . said that if , on investigation , it appeared that there - was any truth in ; the story , the publication of the facts would tend to defeat the ends of justice .
