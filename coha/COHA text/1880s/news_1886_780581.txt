She hireo a small room in the roar of the second floor on Dec. 3 , and the housekeeper , Mrs. Buell , noticed that she went out many times during the evening and returned with men . Mrs. Noll is a woman about 30 years old and not particularly goon-looking . Her conduct was such that the housekeeper notified her a few days ago that she would be reauired to give up her room on the 1st proximo . Langbein was a constant visitor to the woman and appeared to be infatuated with her . He called on her at 9 o'clock last night , and found in her room with her a young , shorthaired fellow who was known to her as Johnny . Mrs. Noll says that she does not know his other name .

The bullet entered the right cheek , and ranging upwared entered the brain . Langbein was a very promising young man , and his relatives had no knowledge of his connection with the woman in whose presence he shot himself . The body was still in the woman 's room at 1 o'clock this morning , awaiting the arrival of the Coroner .
