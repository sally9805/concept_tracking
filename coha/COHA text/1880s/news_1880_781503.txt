txt The forthcoming number of Mr. POOR 'S " Manual of Railroads of the . United States , " containing statistics for the year 1879 ; and comparisons with the figures for preceding years , will furnish substantial evidence of renewed progress and improvement in the business of inland transportation . The recovery from the depression which followed the panic of 1873 is significantly shown , and is specially important as an indication of reviving prosperity in general business . The total mileage at the end of last year was 86,497 , an increase of 4,721 . This is by far the largest increase since 1873 , and has been exceeded only in the three years preceding . that date . The advance in the volume of freight traffic during the last six years has been greatly out of proportion with the extension of track , and the most interesting feature of the change appears in a reduction of rates instead of any considerable increase of receipts . In his introduction Mr. POOR selects for illustration thirteen leading lines , not including the Baltimore and Ohio , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for use in the comparisons . The mileage of these in 1873 was 11,438 , and in 1879 , 13 , - 821 , an increase of 20.83 per cent . But the bulk of freight moved by them advanced from 45,557,002 tons to 67,092,549 tons , an increase of 47.27 per cent . At the same time the receipts from this source were only 3.84 per cent . greater in 1879 than six years before , or $116,311,452 , against $112,004,648 . The practical result appears in a reduction of the average rate per ton per mile from 1.77 to 1.02 cents . In the case of the NewYork Central and Hudson River Road , while the amount of freight moved increased from 5,512,124 to 9,015,755 tons , the receipts therefrom show a slight falling off , the charge per ton per mile having come down from 1.57 to .81 cent . This is a. beneficial change of no small moment , and one that is likely to go on as the volume of traffic increases without entailing a correspohding enhancement of the cost of carrying it . The freight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constituted in 1873 about one-third , and in 1879 about onefourth , of . those of all the railroads of the country . Another significant fact shown in the tables of the " Manual " is the reduction in debts in 1879 as compared with the preceding year . It is mainly the result of the reorganization of bankrupt roads , and the transformation of indebtedness into capital stock . This process is represented to be now nearly completed , so that the wrecks of the . panic and the depression have been pretty much cleared out of the way . The aggregate decrease of funded debt during the one year was $15,251,851 , and of floating debt $25,367,504 , while the increase of capital stock . was $187,708,068 . Notwithstanding the reduction of debt , there was an increase in the amount of interest paid of $9,077,006 , the average rate having been 4.91 , or .27 per cent . higher than the year before . This of itself is a slight indication of proved financial " condition , as well as an increased value of bond investments . Dividends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent. , against 2.34 the year previous . The increase in the total amount paid for dividends was $8,052,102 , so that while the increase in gross earnings as compared with 1878 was $38,909,648 , and that in net earnings $32,341,557 , the amount paid for interest and dividends advanced $17,129 , - 106 , which implies that running expenses are far from being enhanced in the same ratio as receipts . From all this it is clearly to be inferred that as the business of the country grows , the volume passing over the old esttiblished lines of railroad increases in much greater ratio than does the cost of carrying it , and the result appears not only in the better and stronger condition of the companies , but also and chiefly in reduced rates for freight . The bearing of this tendency on the foreign trade of the country and its general prosperity in the future is as important as it is obvious . It is interesting to note the development of the railroad business of the country by sections , and especially the backwardness of the Southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are indications of progress even there ; but it is a noteworthy fact that the gross earnings of all the railroads of that vast and naturally favored section last year were but a trifle greater than those of the six little States of New-England , while the aggregate of dividends earned was less than one-third as great . Here are the figures of gross earnings for the four sections of the country , leaving out the Pacific roads : New-England States , $41,329,825 ; Middle States , $170,310,846 ; Southern States , $43,917,284 ; - Western States , $232,379 , - 646 ; Pacific coast States , $10,721,157 . The aggregate amount paid in dividends compares as follows : NewEngland , $7,256,205 ; Middle , $24,335,164 ; Southern , $2,131,770 ; Western , $23,561,262 ; Pacific coast , $584,104 . Making proper allowance for difference of area , length of history , and stage of development , significant conclusions might be drawn from these figures regarding the degrees of energy and enterprise which characterize these sections , the causes of which would constitute an intricate but interesting study .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
