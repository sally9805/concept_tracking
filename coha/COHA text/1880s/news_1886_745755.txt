txt The Governor has in his hands three important bills relating to the gas supply in this city . They are the fruit of a long and careful study of the subject by legislative committees , experts , and citizens . They were drawn in the interest of the people who have been plundered by a combination of grasping monopolies , and the votes by which they were passed show that the influence of rich and powerful corporations coma accomplish nothing against the overwhelming tide of popular approval . The Reilly bill was passed by the unanimous vote of the Senate and a majority of 117 to 1 in the Assembly . The Thomas bill found only one adverse vote in the Senate and only one in the Assembly . The Murphy Commission bill was unanimously supported in the Senate , and in the Assembly it was passed by a vote of 87 to 2 . The first reduces the price of gas in this city to $1 25 ; the second authorizes the incorporation of new companies to sell gas here for a price not exceeding $1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organize and go into business under its provisions ; and the third creates a commission whose duty it shall be to supervise the operations of gas companies and confine them within the limits of a good law . Small defects in these bills , if there be any , can be easily remedied next year . As they stand they are work of which the Legislature may well be proud . While they primarily serve the people , at the same time they protect capital that is or may be actually invested in the gas business . That the maximum price fixed in the bills is sufficient is shown by the testimony and reports submitted by the committees , by the willingness of capitalists to risk $2,500,000 under the conditions prescribed , by abundant evidence from experts and practical gasmakers , and by the recent attempts of existing companies in New York to make contracts for long terms at $1 25 . Probably the Governor will take great pleasure in signing these three excellent measures .                @ @ @ @ @
