txt " Jack " Hazzard , Teller of the Fort Pitt Bank , is missing . One Of his last official acts on Saturday was to have check cashed at the Allegheny National Bank for $5,000 . Tnis is nothing unusual , since it is a common occurrence for Cashiers and Tellers to pass checks current at neighboring banks for such currency as may not be in plenitude in their own institutions . Then it is understood that while passing the check over the Allegheny National Bank counter it was done with the statement that " Twenties and tens were scarce " The transactions did not excite the least comment . The check appeared at the Clearing House on Monday and excited the natural comment on being dishonored . Mr. Hazzard , who drew the cheek and collected upon it , was absent , and only after the Clearing . House management met and laid down the rules it was decided that the Fort Pitt Bank must bear the burden . Mr. Hazzard could nowhere be found , and no trail could be secured other than that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was supposed to have crossed the Canaaian border to the provinces . This he did not do , however , without leaving a reminder of his shortcomings in the shape of a note in which he said he had appropriated $1,000 previously , making the total $0,000 , and inclosed was a judgment note for the amount covering the deficiency . Coupled with this is an intimation that on oven date with the cashing of the check at the Allegheny National cheeks were cashed at other banks . This , however , the officials of the bank in which he was employed deny . D. Leet Wilson , Cashier of the Fort Pitt Bank , said this afternoon : " The amount is only $6,000 and the bank is fully secured . His bondsmen are liable , and he has property of his own . I ca n't understand what made him go away , for if he wanted $6,000 I could have got it for him this afternoon . The books were audited last night , and we found the amount was only $6,000 . " Mr. Hazzard , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valued at something over $6,000 . He is not above 35 years and is unmarried . He was Secretary of the Bankers and Bank Clerks ' Association , and was always a leading spirit in any movement for the betterment of the younger members of the bankers ' fraternity.
