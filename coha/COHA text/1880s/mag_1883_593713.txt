IN the preparation of " Dr. Grimshawe s Secret , " - a novel by Nathaniel Hawthorne , which his son is about to make public ,  --  Mr. Hawthorne seems to have written , in the way of notes and preliminary studies , enough matter to cover about sixty magazine pages , or in the neighborhood of one hundred and eighty pages of an ordinary book . He would then appear to have written out , or sketched out , more fully the main work ,  --  but even the latter evidently failed to meet with his own complete approbation . How far the notes and preliminary studies were embodied in , or in any way used in , the main novel , we can not tell , for we have not yet seen the latter . The preliminary notes and studies for " Dr. Grimshawe " are in two different groups , of very different character . One group ( in the possession of Mrs. Rose Hawthorne Lathrop , and now appearing in " The Atlantic Monthly " ) seems to consist of passages written out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about equal length , consists of notes only . These last have been placed in our hands by Mr. Julian Hawthorne , with the privilege of using here a large part of the material . Beginning with the first of the notes , as he has copied them out , and going on to the end , we see the idea of an extremely striking and eminently characteristic romance growing to full proportions from the earliest and slightest suggestions . We not only see this , but we see it with an intimacy VOL . XXV. - 4i. that is fairly startling . These notes for " Dr. Grimshawe " furnish an actual vision of the minutest workings of Hawthorne 's mind while engaged in the preparation of this book . It is as if the modem processes of instantaneous photography had been at that time fully perfected and brought to bear upon the very brain of the great romancer , while it was in its most rapid , at times even most furious action . It is a record of everyflii ; zg that was passing through his mind at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most trifling andsuperficial . His most serious , and his lightest mood are chronicled with the same exact fidelity . The record is of unique and incalculable value , because it is a complete revelation of the artistic principles and methods of one of the subtlest ' artists that ever lived . It is , in fact , a full and clear recipe for the making of a Hawthorne romance . " Something high and noble must be put into the man , together with morbidness and poison " - ( that is a Shaksperean touch ! ) . " Gather all sorts of picturesqueness about these characters and circumstances , and mystify about the old man and his spider . " The Lord of Braithwaite Hall " must have picturesque characteristics , of course ; something that , fixes strange and incongruous necessities upon him , making him most miserable under a show of all possible glory and splendor and grace and gayety . " " He might , as one characteristic , have an ice-cold right hand ; but this should be only emblem- // atic of something else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preternaturality . It can be softened down to any extent , however wild in its first conception . " In reading this unconscious record we are once more impressed by what we may call the mastery of Hawthorne over the situation , - with his deep ethical insight and the healthy cheerfulness of his mind while dealing with the most tragic and painful themes . He knows the artistic effect of the somber , but it must not be too somber . Elsie must glimmer " through the story , and illuminate it with a healthy , natural light . " The story is to open in America-in Charter street , Salem . Living together in the same house are the old doctor , with his gigantic and venomous spider , the boy Etheredge , who is to connect the American with the English part of the story , and the girl Elsie . In England there are the Lord of Braithwaite Hall , who is the Italian-English successor to the title , the old pensioner , who is the true heir , Etheredge grown to manhood , and others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " The great gist of the story ought to be the natural hatred of men and the particular hatred of Americans to an aristocracy ; and , at the same time , doing a good degree of justice to the aristocratic system by depicting its grand , beautiful , and noble characteristics . " Again : " It must be shown , I think , throughout , that there is an essential difference between English and American character , and that the former must assimilate itself to the latter , if there is to be any union . " We leave untouched the very interesting first half of the notes ( except for the few words quoted in the preceding paragraph ) , and , beginning about the middle , give our readers ( with two slight omissions ) all of the last half of the series . Editor of The Century Magazine . THIS wretched old pensioner keeps recurnng to me , insisting that I have not sufficiently provided for him , nor given him motive enough  --  or any , indeed . At present , therefore , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his death-hour , and work backward from that . He has been smitten with death in the old manor-house , surrounded by Etheredge , Elsie , the Warden , the ItalianEnglishman , and other personages of the drama . The scene takes place in the stately hall of the mansion , surrounded by antique associations of arms or furniture , carvings , etc . The old man , as his last moment draws on , becomes invested with a strange aspect and port of dignity and majesty . At the same time the development of the plot is taking place . Up to this hour , the probabilities have seemed to strengthen that Etheredge is the heir of the estate and name ; but , at the very last , a slight circumstance shall be counterchanged , which shall at once make it evident that the old pensioner is the true heir , and the spirit of his ancestors shall display itself . * * * He may be a sort of reformer , whose principles are entirely against hereditary distinction . The object of the book , to find the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will suit . This at last turns out to be the coffin of a young lady , which , being opened , it proves to be filled with golden locks of her hair . But this quest must be merely incidental . Under the hair , or upon it , is a roll of obliterated writing . This nonsense must be kept subordinate , however . Twont do . Crambo , Mary Mumpson , Cunkey , Miss Blagden , Miss Ingersoll , Mr. Roberts , Marshall Rynders , President Buchanan of this United States . * * * Take the old man from his earliest original : the family name had been changed in America ; his ancestor was the second son of the old family , and was thrust out of the paternal mansion ; there are conflicting testimonies wherefore . One account says that he was a wild and bloody religionist , and , with his own hand , beheaded the king , and got the bloody footstep by treading in a pool of his blood on the scaffold . Another account bears that he was a Quaker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bloody footstep came from his being violently and wounded thrust from his paternal home . Others say it was of much earlier time . Well , this race turns up in America with some vague traditions among themselves of their descent ; they are not Quakers ; at least , have ceased to be so long before the epoch of this story ; but still something of the spirit of their peaceful ancestor has remained in them throughout this length of time . They keep up their traditions . At length there is born an imaginative one , who marries early in life , and loses his wife ; his affections being thus balked , he leaves his son under the charge of a friend ( the Doctor ) , and goes to England to enter upon a quest into his lineage . He becomes slightly insane , and , getting more and more engaged in this delusive enterprise , he remains abroad all the rest of his life , in poverty , in solitude ; meanwhile his son has grown up , married , and left a daughter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doctor 's death , he divides his property between the girl and Etheredge ; and the girl , as soon as she is at her own disposal , comes // abroad in quest of her grandfather , to whom the Doctor 's papers have given her a clew . The Doctor , an old , humorous bachelor , had likewise adopted another child , a boy , who struck his fancy in an alms-house , whither he had come , attended by an old woman . He does this partly because the name is that of the family to which his friend really belonged . This boy is really the descendant of the third son of the old family , but he imagines himself to be the descendant of the old bloody footstep man , in respect to whom he adopts the wicked version of the story . He also has inherited traditions of noble descent , together with certain documents , which carry proofs of his birth far upward to the original emigrant , who really came over in quest of his lost brother , because he is penitent for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family arrangement , it was necessary to find him . But he met with impediments , such as being carried away by the Indians , etc. , and ultimately settled in Virginia , whence the family emigrated to New England . Before he goes to England ( the present representative I mean ) , he gets his pedigree authenticated , showing , through all vicissitudes , that he is descended from the second brother . This he holds in his possession , and is ready to display it on occasion . Meanwhile , the family in England is represented by a descendant of the youngest brother . There have been traditions of other heirs ; and messengers , at various times , have been sent over to America in quest of them , and in hope to find that there were none now existing . Also , by the J of the family , there is an old custom of keeping a place at the family board , and a bed-chamber ready . The old man ? Yes ! I can not consent to such a degradation of his character as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He must all along have been conscious that it was his right ; but a peculiar philosophy has taught him that he must not take it . No , there must be some specific cause ; a curse , for instance , imposed upon his race if they ever assert their right . Why ? Something that should have made his rank and station hateful to him-that might be ; but how might that hate-feeling be continued to his descendants ? So that they should prefer poverty and obscurity to name and high position . True . This pensioner is the first one , for two centuries , who has known of his descent ; the knowledge of it came to him through the Doctor 's researches , and he went to England to investigate it , with a desire to know his relatives and hereditary seat , but not to claim them . The Doctor must have a great agency in these doings , both of the pensioner and 435 Etheredge , making tissues of cobweb out of men s life-threads ; he must have the air , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called so ; and even after his death , his influence must still be felt . Hold on to this . A dark , subtle manager , for the love of managing - like a spider sitting in the center of his web , which stretches far to east and west . Who is he then ? What interest had he in this ? Some speculative and philosphical interest , if any , and he dies before it is gratified . I doubt whether twill do , but his enterprises go on after his death , and produce strange effects without him to control them . He shall have stretched out his hand to England , and be operating these , making people his puppets who little think they are so . He must have traveled over England in his youth , and there have fallen in love and been jilted by a lady of this family ; hence his spite against the family , and his determination to ruin it . He shall have sought out , with all his might , an heir , and educated Etheredge for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know . Perhaps the Doctor himself might be an English misanthrope , who had a spite against this family . He must be somebody who knows all about the English part of the family ; and he has some plot against them in full concoction , calculated to take effect years hence , when he suddenly dies ( perhaps of the poison of his great spider ) , and leaves his plot to operate as it may , by itself . Make his character very weird indeed , and develop it in dread and mystery , with as much of the grotesque as can be wrought into it . He may himself be a member of the family* possibly the heir . He shall have meant Etheredge as his tool , certainly ; but , in the end , he shall prove to have no ancestry ,  --  an American son of nobody , evolving the moral that we are to give up all those prejudices of birth and blood which have been so powerful in past ages ; at any rate , there shall be but vague reasons to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be a rebuke to him for giving up the noble principle that a man ought to depend on his own individuality , instead of deriving anything from his ancestors . The pauper must be the true heir . Then why should not the Doctor have made him out to be so ? True . He shall have made a mistake , owing to his lack of acquaintance with the traditions of this pauper , with whom they shall have been a family secret ; but his interest and imagination shall have been awakened by what the Doctor said , so that he shall have gone to England to investigate the matter . It is a snarled skein , truly ; but I half fancy there is a way to unravel the threads , by dint of breaking one or two . // The lady whom the Doctor loved shall have died ; the Doctor shall have treasured up a single lock of golden hair , which Etheredge , from some fanciful reason or other , brings with him to England . On opening a coffin with the silver key , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locks , with the same peculiarity as this . The owner of the estate shall have betrayed the Doctor , and won his lady 's love from him ; so he , brooding along , shall have resolved to avenge himself in this way . The coffin , full of golden locks , shall be a symbol that there was nothing in this womannothing of her but her golden hair . and other external beauty , and that a wise man threw himself away for that emptiness . He may himself ( the Doctor ) have been the proprietor of the estate . How ? - why ? - what sense ? He shall have been at deadly enmity with the holder of it , and , being a wicked man and unscrupulous , shall have contemplated these means of avenging himself . Long after his death , Etheredge shall have found the papers which seem to him to prove his claim . The great spider shall be an emblem of the Doctor himself ; it shall be his craft and wickedness coming into this shape outside of him ; and his demon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of it . This shall be his venom , which has been gathering and swelling for thirty years ; for , in all that time , those who knew the spider and the Doctor earlier , shall have seen the one was growing more swollen with spite , and the other with venom . It must be an unsuccessful and ill-treated passion that first caused this : he having loved the woman whom Braithwaite won from him and married . He shall have known the family tradition that there was an heir of the estate and title extant in America , and shall set out with the purpose of finding him . Then , when he can not find out this heir , he bethinks himself that it will be yet sweeter revenge to substitute some nameless child for this longdescended heir ; and looking about ( being an unscrupulous man ) , he finds this boy , three or four years old , in the alms-house , without parents , of untraceable origin . Him he takes , educates , and the love that there is in him grows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , as for the girl ? Shall she also be a fihia *zuiiius ? or his own daughter ? or a granddaughter of the pensioner ? We must have her , and she must have a right in the book . Shall she be a niece of his ? Well , she need not be very rigidly accounted for , but may have been consigned to his care , as the last remnant of his own family , the child of a younger sister . So he shall have taken her , perhaps not loving her as his wayward nature does the boy , whom he will feel as if he had made with his own art and skill ,  --  but still tolerating her in his house . Now , the pensioner . He may have been , originally , a New England minister , or a religionist of some sort , who had an early dream of founding a sect of his own , deeming himself to have had a revelation . Or , being of a religious nature , he may have had a tradition in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long ago , who was of a most pious nature ; his life and footsteps he shall have sought out , and this search shall lead him in the track of the bloody footstep ; following which , he shall be led across the sea , and to the old mansion-house . There shall be a peculiar odor of sanctity for him in the spot where this saint and martyr was born and bred , and so he shall haunt around it , knowing of his claims , but entirely above asserting them , - at least , aside from them . All along he shall have in his possession the one thing that can prove his descent . What can that be ? Some traditionary secret that explains a mystery which has been mysterious for two centuries . The unlocking of some door that had been locked for centuries . Some coffer ? Could it not be contrived to have some antique , highly ornamented coffer treasured up in the old house , under the idea that it contained something of fatal importance to the family ? It shall have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his ancestors ; the other shall be the one that Etheredge found by the grave . On opening the coffer , it shall prove to be full of golden hair ; for it was the coffin of a beautiful lady , who , by that strange process , has turned all to that feature by which she lives in the family legend . The New England Government shall have prosecuted the first emigrant , as being a non-conformist to their creed ; possibly , they may have hanged him , though I hardly think so . Yet , if it will produce any good effect , hanged he shall be . What can he have had to do with the key of the lady 's coffin ? She must have been murdered then ? It shall have been supposed in the family that she disappeared with him , as she disappeared about the same juncture . Well , this mystery might be left to conjecture , without being definitely solved . It shall explain why the lady never appeared again , certainly . The lady had been beloved by two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other one had murdered her , and deposited her in this antique coffer , which was deposited in a secret chamber . At any rate , somehow or other , she shall be reposited in an antique coffer , or , it may be , in an old stone coffin ; I think the former , because of the silver key . The lady being murdered , the // elder brother , in horror , shall flee . No ; perhaps the brother shall mean to murder him , and shall thrust him out of the mansion with that purpose ,  --  he , and the younger brother ,  - -  and shall leave him for dead ; but he shall be conveyed away . The place where his body shall be thrown shall be the very one where Etheredge was shot down on his first arrival ; and he shall afterward dreamily recognize it by a description in the Doctor 's story . There must be discrepant traditions about all these things ; the pensioner having one side of the matter , and the Doctor , as derived from the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the death of the lady that he turns religion ist , gives up his rank , disappears from England , taking the key of the coffer with him , and leaving the dead body reposited there . He may have killed the lady Qut of jealousy , and gone off ; taking their child , a boy , with him , and have spent the rest of his life in penitence and humble strivings for heaven ; dying by the executioner in New England , not for his crime , but for his religion . The ensuing tradition in his family shall have turned aside the truth of his bloody footstep , which shall have been dyed in the blood of his wife . They shall think that he took his wife with him . Here is reason enough for his de'serting his home , extinguishing his name , and becoming a wild religionist . But there shall have been kept in the family an ancient document , in his writing , telling of these things , in some of them-telling of his birth ; yes , telling of all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know of the coffer , and shall have one of the keys of it , the other being the one that Etheredge has brought . Hammond , the agent of the old Doctor , shall be the one to discover , from his intimacy with the Doctor , the truth that Etheredge is not one of the old family , but a son of nobody , with all the world for his ancestry . To-morrow , arrange the chain of events . Open in the old house in Charter street ; describe it and its surroundings in a somber , grotesque kind of way . The old gentleman in his study , amid his spiders , must be first touched upon ; especially the gigantic spider , to which ( quietly and without telling the reader so ) ascribe demoniac qualities . Relieve the gloom by resting a little upon the beautiful boy and the cheerful girl . An old woman ( Hannah Lord , perhaps ) must be the only other member of the household . Perhaps , however , an English man-servant . The old gentleman is known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physic ; only he is thought to be learned and scientific , and he has this theory about cobwebswhich it shall be uncertain whether he is not 437 laughing at the world in it . Tell how he has found the boy in the almshouse ; for some reason has adopted him-which reason seems to be that he knows him to be the heir of an old family in England . Without directly telling the boy that he is the heir , he shall be in the habit of telling him stories about this family . He educates him in all gentlemanly qualities , teaches him fencing , gives him thorough clasSical teaching . He must be represented as acquiring a vast affection for the boy ,  --  passionate , engrossing , more than if he were his own son ; because of the peculiarity in the way of acquiring this child , it shall seem as if he had made himhe shall combine himself ( the boy shall ) with his intellectual purpose . Something high and noble must be put into the man , together with morbidness and poison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; growing up proud , ambitious , passionate ; the girl shall be the redeeming character , and a gentle light in the house ,  --  yet not too gentle either . She is a relative of the Doctor , who was brought to him a child of three years old , by an Englishman , who departed immediately-perhaps by somebody who died , and lies buried near the house . Early in the romance , introduce the story of the bloody footstep . Gather all sorts of picturesqueness about these characters and circumstances , and mystify about the old man and his spider . The reader must see reason to doubt very early , or to be puzzled , whether or no the boy is the heir ; and his mysterious origin must be so handled as to leave it uncertain whether the devil has not something to do with him . The girl 's character must be imbued with natural sunshine , which will seem queer from its being natural . When the romance is fully imbued with all this , introduce the visit of the Englishman . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ,  --  a man of business , an attorney , I think . He must still further mystify the matter . He shall talk about the fears and expectations in the English family of an heir ; the rumors they have heard ; and of some old document that has been discovered , about something that was hidden in the grave of the first emigrant , that contains something necessary to the development . So there shall be the scene of opening the grave , in the winter-time , as before . His demeanor toward the boy , and some words that fall from him , shall stealthily indicate , yet leave in doubt , the Doctor 's whole doings in this matter . Some light , too , should be thrown on the Doctor 's wrongs , which have induced this curious project of revenge . Something must be brought to the reader 's notice , even earlier than this , about the old // pensioner , though I do not see how . Perchance a religious character shall see the boy and girl together , and bless them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being incited to this by the name which the old Doctor has given the boy . Something in this man's presence-something holy and beautiful , apostolic , religiously noble- shall touch the boy , and remain in his memory through life . Perhaps the old Doctor should be present , and take some part in the conversation ; he shall not know the religionist , but something shall pass which shall indicate that the apostle knows something about the family history , though he and the Doctor shall not understand one another . Matters being sufficiently in train , the Doctor dies unsuddenly , and , it is suspected , by the bite of his great spider , who , being the devil , has probably got his soul . His death-scene shall make it appear that he had something on his mind which he had half a mind to reveal ; but yet he could not bear to give up a revengeful purpose of many years ; neither , at the moment of death , can he do what remains needful toward carrying it into execution . There is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much increase the mystification of the plot . It shall be mentioned , however , that his will makes Etheredge inherit an amount of property sufficient to educate and establish him in America ; there is likewise provision for the girl ; and here ensues an interval of perhaps fifteen years . There are among his papers much that seems to indicate Etheredge 's heirships , pedigrees , genealogies , coats-of-arms , what seem to be authenticated proofs of American descent , but nothing absolutely proved . The curtain next rises in England . It should be added to the last preceding part that more than one messenger came from England making inquiries which seemed to have reference to the heirship of the estate ; for the branch of the family heretofore in possession had died out , and a new heir had to be looked for , both for the estate and a dormant title . This heir shall have been found in a branch which had emigrated with the Stuarts , and become Italianized . This man , somehow or other-it need not be exactly indicated how - had got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose it is to assert his rights . He procures him to be dogged in his wanderings , and , finding that he comes to the estate , he hires ( Italian fashion ) an assassin to murder him on the precincts of the estate , in some place that shall have been described by the Doctor in his story . The old pensioner rescues him or finds him bleeding , conveys him to his apartments , where Eth eredge vaguely recognizes the holy presence that has never quite died out of his memory . Much suggestive conversation may ensue between them , at various times , mystifying , enlightening . Then the Warden is introduced , and Etheredge is taken into his house , as before . From the antiquarian and genealogical disclosures of the Warden , the books in his library , and a variety of ingeniously arranged circumstances , Etheredge is more and more confirmed in the idea that he is the heir . Yet various recollections of something ambiguous in the old Doctor 's conduct , and of his dying scene , shall make him hesitate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pride . He shall meditate making a confidant of the Warden , but shall hesitate , on account of the latter 's position in respect to the family . Hammond , the Doctor 's old agent , appears , and his demeanor shall throw Etheredge into still greater perplexity ; although it is possible that Hammond must more than strongly suspect the Doctor 's fraud . Possibly he may hint that money is necessary . He must startle Etheredge with the dread of something dishonorable . There must be various interviews with the girl , who has come back to England , and is living in respectability on what the Doctor left , in a poor way ,  --  perhaps as governess , or lady 's gentlewoman . Perhaps the Italian heir is in love with her . Then ensues the Warden 's grand dinner , where Etheredge ( now made an ambassador ) is the principal guest ; and here he meets the Italian heir , who recognizes him as perhaps a relative ( from his name ) , and invites him to the hall . Etheredge accepts the invitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ romance , much description and talk about old English dwellings , and the difference between English and American social life ; how we have given up certain delightful possibilities forever , and must content ourselves with other things . Meanwhile the Italian shall have made a plot to poison Etheredge , believing him to be truly the heir ; for perhaps Hammond may have played him false and betrayed his project , and it will be policy to murder him before he takes any public steps . Just at that time poison was as fashionable in England as it had ever been in Italy . This somehow comes to the knowledge of the girl , who tells it to the old pensionei , who interferes to prevent it . He comes to the Hall and is admitted , he being known to the heir as one who has much knowledge of the genealogy ; then he takes state upon himself , announces himself as the American heir , so long expected and , produces his proofs . At the same // time Hammond appears with his evidence of the Doctor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all kindred , and left in a truly American condition . The pensioner declines to take advantage of his rights . The Italian is rejected by the girl ; she is left to be the consolation of Etheredge . Something more tragical than this must be contrived ; the death of the Italian , I think . He can not comprehend the generosity of the pensioner , and drinks off the poison which he has prepared for Etheredge ; so that the pensioner shall be a lord in spite of himself ; which he must take very quietly . I think , before this denouement , the owner and Etheredge might be strolling through the house , and come to the great black coffer , about which there must have been traditions . He opens it with the silver key , and finds there the hair . This the more confirms the Italian in the belief that Etheredge is the heir . The girl , I think , shall have a sense of something false and wrong in Etheredge 's claim to the estate , etc. , and shall endeavor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall impress her as having to be the result . The shadow of the old Doctor must be so contrived as to fall over all the subsequent part of the romance , after his death ; so that he shall still seem to darkly live and act , though his revenge is balked . We must begin at the source . What was the motive of the original emigrant in leaving his inheritance , coming to America , and secluding his identity from the knowledge of anybody ? Well , thus : before the civil war , this personage was living in great happiness with his young wife , in his ancestral mansion ; but , being incited to jealousy ( whether truly or falsely , need not appear ) , he is supposed to have killed his wife and reposited her in a very curious old coffer , in a hiding-place of the mansion . He retains one lock of her golden hair to remember her by . He takes his boy with him , and goes forth from his mansion , leaving the blood-track on the threshold . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet must provide in some way for the ascertaining of his identity after two hundred years . How ? He leaves a narrative in a paper , which is preserved , and gets into the hands of the old Doctor . Meanwhile , the family in England do not know the truth of the story , nor what became of either husband , wife , or boy ; though , in some inscrutable way , a legend is propagated that they fled to America , and that there is left behind a coffer full of gold , buried somewhere about the house . One of the legends about this first emigrant shall be that adopted by the English family , and related in the Doctor 's legend of the bloody footstep . This shall represent him as a blood-thirsty man , whose foot has been wet by his king 's blood . Another shall be that of the pensioner , representing him as a saint . This shall have so much of truth in it , that he did , in New England , become a wild religionist , found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pensioner shall have taken up his religion , and become a preacher of . it ; but , it having been adapted to another state of the world , he has no success , and finally comes to the hospital . There has been handed down to him a tradition that he belongs to this family , and , out of a pious reverence for his ancestor , he has sought out the proofs of his descent , and has them with him . The name has been changed ; but there shall be an authentic certificate of old date , as to this change of name , which saves the old pauper 's rights . Etheredge , on the other hand , must have a series of seeming proofs , contrived by the Doctor , for the purposes of revenge ; they should seem to strengthen at every step , and become indubitable ; but , at the very last moment , most unexpectedly , they should crumble into nothings . Etheredge must discover , by means of Elsie , that the Doctor had contrived this plan . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper , signed and certified , which she was to oroduce on occasion ; but he could not bring himself to blacken his memory with Etheredge , whom he loved so well , by revealing it sooner . He was in hopes that Etheredge would never really take up the claim . At the last moment Elsie delivers the paper , of which she herself does not know the contents . It produces a violent effect on Etheredge , but he honorably resolves ( when the prize seems actually within his grasp ) to relinquish it . The Doctor shall have supposed the genuine race to be extinct , and , under this idea , shall have no hesitation in availing himself of proofs of descent which really belong to the pensioner . But Etheredge shall see reason to suppose that he is the real man ; and shall declare it , and assign over to him the proofs that he has heretofore thought made out his own claim . The old man must have no suspicion , I think , of the truth . The Warden shall have communicated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old man has made out in order to entitle him to the benefit of the hospital ; up to a certain point , it makes out his claim , and then the old Doctor 's proof joins on to it , and shows him to be the heir . One branch of the Amencan descent had become extinct ; this the old // Doctor finds out , but is not aware that another branch is represented by the old pensioner . THE life is not yet breathed into this plot , after all my galvanic efforts . Not a spark of passion as yet . How shall it be attained ? The Lord of Braithwaite Hall shall be a wretched , dissipated , dishonorable fellow ; the estate shall be involved by his debts , and shall be all but done up . He shall ( perhaps ) be in love with Elsie . Up to his death he must feel as if this American had come to thwart him and ruin him in everything , and shall hate him accordingly , and think he is doing well to kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marked character must be given to this fellow , as if he were a fiend , a man sold to the devil , a magician , a poisonbreather , a thug , a pirate , a pickpocket ; something that will look strange and outr* in that high position ; it must have picturesque characteristics , of course ; something that fixes strange and incongruous necessities upon him , making him most misef-able under a show of all possible glory , and splendor , and grace , and gayety . Could I but achieve this , I should feel as if the book were plotted otherwise , not . Something monstrous he must be , yet within nature and romantic probability-hard conditions ! A murderert wont do at all . A Mahometan-pish ! If I could only hit right here , he would be the center of interest . It will not do to have him a mere lay-figure : there might be good and evil in him . Something most abhorrent to the English he might be-as , for instance , a partaker in the massacres of India , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countrymen . A moral of the strange things that happen when the accident of birth puts people into places for which they are most unfit . Nothing mean must he be , but as wicked as you please . Shall he be preternatural ? Not without a plausible explanation . What natural horror is there ? A monkey ? A Frankenstein ? A man of straw ? A man without a heart , made by machinery ? - one who has to wind himself in order to go through the day ? Wicked as he must be , there shall still be relations between him and the pauper saint . What ? Shall there be an influence in the house which is said to make everybody wicked who inherits it ? Nonsense ! Remorse it must not be . A resurrection-man ? What ? what ? what ? A worshiper of the sun ? A cannibal ? a ghoul ? a vampire ? a man who lives by sucking the blood of the young and beautiful ? He has something to do with the old Doctor 's spider-theory ; the great spider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he left England , had contrived a plot of which this man is the victim . How ? He has been poisoned by a Bologna sausage , and is being gnawed away by an atom at a time . He shall need a young life every five years , to renew his own , and he shall have fixed upon Elsie for his next victim . Now for it ! How ? At any rate , he must have dreadful designs on Elsie-dreadful ! dreadful ! dreadful ! May it not be that the revenge of the Doctor has fallen on him ? No , no ! Let the real difference between him and other people be very small , but pile up upon it ! Ye Heavens A man with a mortal disease ? - a leprosy ?  --  a eunuch ?  --  a cork leg ?  --  a golden touch ? - a dead hand ? - a false nose ? - a glass eye ? The rumors of his devilish attributes may be very great ; but the circumstance itself may be comparatively trifling . Some damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inheritor of an otherwise extinct society of crime . He was initiated in Italy , * all his companions have died by the executioner , and he alone escaped . A Rosicrucian . A Cagliostro ? This wretched man ! A crossing-sweeper ?  --  a boot-black ? He comes of a race that is degenerate in a certain way ; rotten , yet retaining a brave outside . How ? It should be from some cause that had existed in the family for hundreds of years . It ca n't be . Some irremediable misfortune has got possession of this poor devil , and makes him an object of pity as well as horror . He has yielded to some great temptation , which particularly besets the members of his family . The unpardonable sin . He has looked into a Blue-Beard chamber . He had murdered , by slow poison , the former possessor of the estate ; he had buried him in a niche . T wo n't do . His forefather emigrated to the continent with King James , and settled in Italy , where he lost entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nondescripts . Upon this race was engrafted something that is proper enough to Italians , but becomes monstrous in Englishmen . Some one trait there must be that produces this terrible and weird effect . He might , as one characteristic , have an icecold right hand ; but this should be only emblematic of something else . He is in the habit of doing something horrible every day , which his previous life has made necessary to him . He might have a scar , which , in circumstances of desperation , grew blood-red . He may have done something , in this generation , which his ancestor had done in a former one . What ? This is a very hard pinch . His icy hand- what it may betoken ? That , on some occasion , he has done a deed with that // right hand which has driven the genial warmth out of it . The English shall hate this man , apparently because of his foreign birth and peculiarities ; but really there must be something repulsive about him . What ? The stench of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit can he have ? Perhaps that of having a young child , fricasseed , served up to him for breakfast every morning . Some strange East Indian habit he may have adopted ; and his unpopularity shall be an example of English prejudice . Do not stick at any strangeness , or preternaturality ; it can be softened down to any extent , however wild in its first conception . He may have had a taste of blood , and now feel a necessity for it- having poisoned people , or stabbed them with a poisoned dagger . His crime gives him an atmosphere disagreeable to other people ; but he himself does not suffer from it , except as it has made a necessity for him to have the luxury of committing crime still . In his Italian poverty he was reduced to great extremities , and found it needful to consort with certain great criminals , amongst whom he had a taste of crime , and found it racier and more ravishing than anything that virtue could supply . He was a member of Italian banditti . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that he served an apprenticeship to Calcraft , or was an amateur assistant of him . He has been reduced to the dregs of life ; had lived in a cellar , on offals . Alas me ! Virtuous , beautifully behaved , he may be in all respects except one , which shall throw a devilish aspect over him , and make the whole romance wild and weird . How ? how ? how ? The key of the romance ought to be here , in this one little peculiarity ; so it must have reference to the past . It must be something that he ca n't help doing ; some one trait of insanity . He drinks blood . He has a person concealed . No , it must be a great trait in his nature , coming from the past , in his blood . ' Pshaw ! This wretched man , still . A great pride of birth he must have , at bottom , vile varlet as he is ; and yet he has been raked from the very kennels of dirty crime . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cheese ; has wrapped his cloak about him in those keen Roman winds ; has wept , has grieved , has suffered , through all that sordidness , till suddenly raised to this delightful position . Once he had a great temptation to do a horrible thing . Of course he yielded . Agreeable , brilliant , witty , but heartless and worthless  --  a man of the world . All this amounts to just nothing . I do n't advance a step . He lives a solitary life . They avoid him . Why ? Partly because they do n't like him . Yet he should have companions , 44 ' methinks . No , only now and then a fellow as questionable as himself . He is one of those characters that only opportunity draws out , like the monsters that came to the surface of society during the French Revolution ; else hidden through the quiet centuries . What monsters of men have there been ? Raised to this high seat , there must be some vile peculiarity which he has brought with him , and can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while , have its gratification , though , as a general thing , his manners are unexceptionable . It might be derived from his Italian blood . If he could only get rid of this propensity , he would be a perfectly unexceptionable man . He struggles for it , but in vain . Elsie , perhaps , is in his secret , and wishes to help him . He fails ; she fails . A propensity for drink ? A tendency to feed on horse-flesh ? A love of toads ? A badge of the mud that has clung to him in the depths of social degradation in which he has been plunged ? Surely , there is some possible monster who would precisely fit into this vacant niche . The girl must , somehow , have a close relationship with him . He shall love her ; be capable of being redeemed by her . She knows this , and hesitates to let him fall . Finally , she is compelled to do so by the wild surge of his wickedness . Amen ! The thing ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be , carried to Italy , there fostered into something monstrous , and brought back to England . What ? The old bloody footstep business ? No , that wont do . But there must be something definite-no vague assemblage of characteristics . Widen the sweep of the net a little . Shall he be an impostor ? No ! What fantastic , yet real-seeming peculiarity can he have ? Supposing him to have once tasted blood , and got an appetite for it-how ? But that is vulgar . I think the family history must take hold of his evil imagination , and invite him to crime by the pestilence and contagion of a crime long past , which is dug up again and pollutes the moral air , as did the bodies dead long ago of the plague pollute it physically . T wont do . The union of British brutality with Italian subtlety has produced a refinement ofwickedness . Emblematized , how ? and how made picturesque ? This is despair , sure enough . Miss Mackintosh . McIntosh . James McIntosh , Esq . I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been , though there were dark hints about it ; that it had gone very low - into the kennel , even . But , if so , nothing of it was perceptible in his manner . His mother was a low Italian woman . She was now dead , though he was still young . He had come forward without // any vouchers for his former character , though with ample proofs of his being the heir of the family . He shall have inherited from his mother the old art of poisoning , and shall be in the habit of poisoning people for his private amusement , and experimentally . T wont do , of course . His character must be evinced in the course he takes with Etheredge , after getting him into the house . HERE I come to a stand-still ! What does he mean to do with Etheredge , having now got him into his house ? To poison him ? T wont do . To produce some effect on his mind , by means of spiders , and bookworms , and works of natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There might be an auction in the house , or preparations for one ; and then there should be a general rummage . Or there might be repairs going on , because parts of the house are ruinous and leaky . In either of these ways , the old cabinet may be found out . Or the priest and he , forming a friendship together ( which may be cordial and sincere , or otherwise ) , the former , who is in all his lordship 's secrets and has discovered some for himself ; lets him into one which he has discovered in his own apartment . It is a secret repository adjoining his room , in which is the cabinet . No ; the old pensioner is , on some occasion , brought to the house , where he tells , behind a panel in this room is a secret place , which he points out , and within it is this coffer , made of oak , or bronze , or what not . Well , all that nonsense might be easily enough arranged ; but what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is a member of a secret society in Italy , who have a hold upon him , which they strenuously assert ; and he thereby becomes most miserable . T wont do . He has a secret ulcer . Bah ! What does he do ? He makes a soup for Etheredge out of the bones of his long dead ancestors , spiced with the embalming out of the bowels of one of them , and he himself partakes . Very well . Oh , heavens ! I have not the least notion how to get on . I never was in such a sad predicament before . The old family , as far as refers to his lordship 's ancestors , was effete ; then came a vein of wickedness in , making him cunning and crafty , which he is beyond the depth of most men . There has been a spider 's web woven of old which inwreathes all who come near it ; and the great spider is the emblem of the person who did it . How can this be ? The priest finds the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ web must be a sort of chorus to the drama that is going on , reflecting it-a new spoke and complication of the web , contmually corresponding with every new devel opment . From a life of petty meannesses and shifts , he has come into this high position . And he brings one thing with himone chain attached - which threatens to throttle him , being about his neck . Oh , fie ! Now , here . The old Doctor 's spider 's web must , of course , have a signification . It signifies a plot in which his art has involved the story and every individual actor . He has caught them all , like so many flies ; nor are they set at liberty by the death of the magician who originally inthralled them . This is good as an unshaped idea ; but how is it to be particularized and put in action ? Thus , for instance : it must be an ancient story , certainly ; something coming down from the days of the bloody footstep - some business which was left unsettled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It must relate to property , because nothing else survives in this world . Love grows cold and dies ; hatred is pacified by annihilation . It might , indeed , have reference to the title . Perhaps it may . Could there be a document , a secret , somewhere in the old house , which each succeeding heir reads , and is immediately smitten with the insane purpose to achieve or obtain something there written and proposed ? What ? It refers to a treasure of the family , buried in a certain spot . That 11 not do . No ; we must get out of this idea . It awakens an unhallowed ambition and madness of lust for something that ought not to be-cannot be possessed . It speaks of a great beauty to be won , and she is found in the old coffer . It must be a mere delusion . The Doctor must then have an agent in England . This is Mountford , who has been taken possession of by the subtlety and force of the Doctor 's character , and continues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty years , for he had laid a command upon him . He has , therefore , a constant agency in all that takes place , or is hereafter to occur , in the English scene . Mountford must be an attorney in the vicinity of the Manor House . He is crafty and ingenious , but has not strength of mind , and has been subjected of old to the power of this old man , who knew some peccadillo of his , and took advantage of it thoroughly to subdue him . The Doctor had a deep purpose of revenge to subserve , it being , in part , to substitute another heir in place of the one then in possession . Mountford was to be his coadjutor in this . This man , deeply read in the secrets and history of the family , plays off all the different possessors of the property . Dying , the Doctor leaves this man to be an uncontrolled agent of the mischief which he himself had set on foot . Yet it shall turn out in // the end that Mountford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other personages . The representatives of this ancient and noble family had each been led to do some most unworthy thing . Could there be , through all these times , some person hidden in the old house ? Could the old Doctor himself be hidden there , being only supposed to be dead ? I do n't see this at present . The Doctor , by his subtlety , had saved this Mountford from the gallows . He held him in the bonds of love and fear . He had laid his commands on him , before leaving the country , to do continually some one act the constant repetition of which produces the strangest consequences . He has hidden some person , whom he wished to keep from the knowledge of the world , in a secret place of the old house , and has commanded this old fellow to feed and nourish and supply him with books , but never to let him out ; and , after the old man has been doing it for a few years , of course it is impossible that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true heir of the estate ? He might have disappeared suddenly , and been supposed to be murdered . On coming into the property and title , the present possessor shall have been made aware of this dreadful secret , and shall have adopted the guilt as his own . There shall be no cruelty in the treatment of the person , except just the solitary confinement . He might have committed some crime by which he shall be justly condemned to this punishment , had it been by a competent jurisdict.ion . There must be much talk about this person in the romance ; doubts whether he be dead , whether he may not have gone to America , so that the reproduction of him shall not strike the reader altogether unexpectedly . But the absurd impossibility of the thing ? Why so ? Should it be man or woman ? The woman whom the Doctor loved , and who was false to him ? This would be too shocking ? It should be the man who wronged him , if anybody . The Doctor , by some of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech , had paralyzed him in some way , and hidden him here ; and he himself goes to America to find out the true heir . This Mountford remains in the house . He is a sort of upper servant . An old priest 's chamber readily enough supplies the prison-place . This ghastly thing , without people 's well knowing why , has made the house horrible . The Doctor might have meant to poison him , but only succeeded in paralyzing him to a certain extent . There seems to be something in this ugly idea which may eventually answer the purpose ; but not as I see it now . 443 One great point must be the power of the old Doctor 's character , operating , long years after his death , just as when he was alive . The prisoner should have been very wicked , and worthy of his doom : seducing the Doctor 's young wife , and taking her home into his mansion ; the wife may have committed suicide , and been deposited in the old coffer , and have there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man of wonderful scientific skill . He had preserved a man that had been hanged , and thus got him in complete subjection to him ; the man had been unjustly accused of crime , but he was of a nature strongly impressible by another 's force of character . The Doctor had made him , as it were ,  --  created him anew ,  --  and he never could dream of being released from his authority . This man , by his recommendation , had been received into the Braithwaite family , with which the man of science was intimate . The Doctor had a beautiful wife , who was seduced by Mr. ( or Lord ) Braithwaite , and was taken by him to the old mansion . The Doctor finds them there ; the wife kills herself , and is buried in the coffer . The man is paralyzed , and kept in confinement , under the guardianship of the half-hanged worthy . The Doctor goes abroad , leaving matters in this state . There has been such an arrangement of incidents , that it appears as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , instead of coming home ; that had been his intention , and he had arranged matters with his stewards and agents as if for a long absence . He stays away a long , long time , indeed ; nothing is heard of him ; he has vanished ; and by and by another heir possesses the estate , after it has gone through a course of law and been assigned to him . It was at this period , perhaps , that the legal gentleman comes from London , to search for the grave . All these things being presupposed , the first part of the romance may stand pretty much as before shadowed out , with such deepening and darkening of the effect as will come from such presupposition ; but the lights must be made brighter in proportion . Then in England : Etheredge arrives , and takes up his abode in the hospital pretty much as now . The Doctor 's adherent must be pretty speedily brought forward , and must feel a strong interest in Etheredge , and be greatly moved on knowing ( which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and been the prot*g6 of the Doctor . He must be a very strange person in his habits and manners . The possessor of the estate must be described : an Italian , as already arranged . Since his accession , he has become // noted for strange and secluded habits . There must have been an heir previous to this one , who shall have died mad . He was a needy young man , suddenly exalted from the depths of poverty to this station . The old Doctor himself was mad . The warden must convey to Etheredge ( perhaps in the form of a story ) the aspect and fortunes of the family since the Doctor left England , now some thirty years ago . A striking point may be made , in respect to the simple and kindly and upright , loyal , obedient nature of the Doctor 's adherent . The possessor of the estate shall have learned , somehow , of the probability that an American heir was coining , with proofs that would oust him . He has gone through so much , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; so he endeavors to murder him on his first arrival . Afterward he invites him to his house , with indefinite purposes ; for sometimes he thinks of giving up the estate and the secret into his keeping , and be himself thus disburdened . He rather thinks he will poison him , or perhaps give the prisoner a companion . In the Doctor 's legend the existence of this secret chamber must be disclosed . The old pensioner must also speak of it , and perhaps tell a story about it . Elsie glimmers through the story , and illuminates it with a healthy , natural light . TRY back again . Raise the curtain as before , and discover the Doctor 's study in the old house at the corner of the Charter street burial-ground ; the Doctor is there , with two children . He himself is a mystery to his neighbors and the gossips of the town ; but he appears to be an Englishman of learning and science , and is held in much account by those who know him , and believed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , frequenting only the public libraiy ; not going to church or chapel ; sometimes walking on the sea-shore or in the country with the two children . The spider s to be much emphasized ; and , very soon , the analogy of a plot to be suggested by the web of the great spider . Indications are early given of a troubled spirit , of a passionate grief , or sense of wrong , cherished and fondled deep within his consciousness , and perhaps affecting his reason . The beauty of the boy , the innocent gayety and native tenderness of the girl , are much dwelt upon ; the fact of the boy 's having been taken by the Doctor from the alms-house , and being impressed by him with the idea that he comes of high English blood . Letters are mentioned as being sometimes received from England , and the idea must be conveyed that the Doctor is connected with some train of events going on there . Early the old pensioner is introduced , preaching or praying in the street , and taking some sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old Doctor . The visit of an Englishman occurs , and the search in the burial-ground , where the boy finds a key . Finally , the death of the Doctor , who , at his demise , appears troubled in mind , and to be in doubt whether or no to tell the boy some secret , but dies without doing so - leaving to the boy some property which he possessed here in America , and to the girl some hereditary property in England . Now , what has been the motive for this man 's leaving England and coming hither , and what was indicated by the spider 's web ? He had saved an imperfectly-hanged person , and made him morally a slave : so far , good ; and he thus has an instrument ready to assist him in perpetrateing any monstrosity . But what ? Then he has been deeply wronged by a gentleman in his neighborhood , a man of wealth and rank , against whom he vows and executes a dire revenge . How ? He must somehow subjugate that man , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his rank , and in spite of being himself an inhabitant of another country . In what way ? Some continual operation on his mind ; some constantly repeated impression , that makes him withdraw himself from society , and give himself up to one morbid way of life . What ? He broods over a coffin , in which his beloved 's ashes are inclosed ? Pish ! He has her concocted into a ring , which pinches his finger , giving him exquisite torment ! Ah ! somehow , he is thoroughly blighted by this Doctor 's means . Certainly ! This half-hanged villain serves him as faithfully as man may , obeying all his orders , except in just one apparently unimportant thing-in that one thing he obeys the Doctor . Very well ! He daily , in obedience to the Doctor 's instructions , pours a drop of a certain liquid into his wine . Indeed ! He subserves some wicked design of his , to his eternal ruin . Very right ! Any rich man may have such an attendant . He does not imprison his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Let it be with his own consent that he inhabits the secret chamber of the old mansion , and sometimes . prowls about the neighborhood . Vastly probable ! It should be some contrivance by which this man of wealth becomes powerless in his enemy 's hands , and for thirty years is constantly tortured , until torture becomes the necessity of his life . So easily said-so impossible to do ! Try back ! What had this gentleman // done ? He had seduced the young wife of this man ? I do n't like that . Or his daughter or sister ? Not much better , though the sister a little . Or , by his faithlessness , he had brought to the grave the young sister , the only thing in life that this abstracted man of science valued . That might do passably well for the offense . Then he turns all the resources of his art and ingenuity to avenge himself on this man and his whole race . How easy to say such things ! This man , whom he saved from hanging , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in reality he is doing the bidding of the Doctor . The death and ruin of this girl shall , by the Doctor 's contrivance , prove his misery , temporal and eternal . What shall I do ? He might have embalmed a member of the family in some new way , so that he shall appear life-like - to what good end ? The devil knows . I do n't . The girl continues to live with him ; no , she is dead . Some secret knowledge of the family he must have , by dint of which he counteracts all their prospects for good , and brings about their utter destruction . Pshaw ! It ought to be a knowledge of the history of the family , and the character of its successive representatives , that the Doctor perpetrates his mischief Somehow or other , a representative , long supposed dead , should be discovered to be still alive , either in confinement or strict voluntary seclusion . Etheredge should discover him , as he does now , and be present at his death . The family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him  --  or he may have imposed it on himself- as a penalty for some crime . What crime ? It wont do ! The Doctor has left his slave here to do mischief-one peculiar kind of mischief-what ? Is the secret chamber affair too absurd ? I fear it is : not only impossible , but , in a manner , flat and commonplace . Some old family trait must be prolonged into the present day- nothing else . The man whom the Doctor leaves behind must act the part of a household demon to the successive heirs ; and it may be quite in character for him to do it , as he is a hanged criminal . He is intensely evil , with nothing go'xl in him except his entire devotion to the Doctor ; and even that , by the facilities of wickedness which it offers the latter , may be intended to wile him onward to hell . Well ; then the Doctor has left an exceedingly wicked man to be the confidential servant of the family . This man must represent a demon . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the old . When the Doctor went abroad he took measures to get this man into the service of Braithwaite , in order to do all the mischief he could , under the Doctor 's guidance , and there must have 445 been one peculiar mode of evil which he specially had in view . XVhat ? Or perhaps he only meant him to be a household demon , with general aptitude for any mischief-be it murder or what not . I do not see the practicability of this . But this had better be the man 's character : he shall be as wicked as possible , and dominated by a perception of greater wickedness in the Doctor . He leaves him with a general understanding that he is to do all possible mischief and a special injunction to keep doing one particular thing . Well ; specify-I ca n't ; the unparticular things I may , or might , could , would , or should . Having always an agent of mischief at hand , there is ( a ) good deal of it done . All the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an obsequious demon . So far , good . There might even be a suspicion of absolute demonism on the part of the servant . Let there be a chapter devoted to the introduction of this important character , in which his qualities shall be mystified , exaggerated , idealized ; brought as near the preternatural as may be , and then quietly withdrawn almost within the limits of commonplace . The general features of the old English serving-man must be preserved , but he must be converted into a devil ; a butler he should be- or steward ? butler , I think . Boteler . A model of faithful service , too . A panderer for the young heir , etc. , etc. , etc . A great deal of grotesque fancy must be used in drawing this character . Oh , certainly ! Ekezi , lam satis est . I ca n't possibly make this out , though it keeps glimmering before me . But he has grown old in the house , with a sort of wicked fidelity difficult to describeor to imagine . The moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desires of his heart executed , there could be no way so sure of bringing him to hell . A man of great skill and resource . Come on ! Conceive such a man , established in the family , and wholly devoted to the Doctor , who has sworn eternal vengeance against the family . What is wanted to consummate that revenge ? Materials , and an opportunity . The material must be some long-standing trouble or hereditary predicament of the family . What ? A crime which is bequeathed to each generation , and of which this servant becomes the instrument . It would do magnificently , if it were not an absurdity . What is the crime ? Each son murders his father at a certain age ; or does each father try to accomplish the impossibility of murdering his successor ? This is not the right tack . One of the family to disappear of his own will , and to remain in seclusion : the story of " Wakefield " might afford some hint of it . He might do it from jealousy , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch // his beloved and suspected one . This old servant might be in the secret , and it should be done by the Doctor 's contrivance . So he should remain till the American came back and found him . He secludes himself from a morbid impulse , and finds himself caught , and can never get back again into society ; so that he has given up all the opportunities of life by that one act . The Doctor promotes it in the first instance , and makes it next to impossible for him to return into the world , in the next . The old servant is the agent who makes it impossible for him to get back , by the easiness of his keeping there . Is not this a glimpse ? There must be a motive , in the first place , strong enough to keep him secluded a week ; then , let him get out if he can . The fact would show that a strange repulsion-as well as a strong attraction - exists among human beings . If we get off ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vein of morbid singularity in this old family , of which the Doctor is aware . It is a very common thing - this fact of a man 's being caught and made prisoner by himself . When Etheredge comes , he should be led to the chamber , perhaps , by his acquaintance with the chamber as derived from the Doctor . But there must be a strong , original motive ; else , however natural , it will appear outrageously absurd . Now , what can be the motive ? He has fallen in love with , and tried to seduce , the Doctor 's young sister ; possibly he has seduced her , and she has died . There is a strong popular feeling on this point , and he is forced to seclude himself . Or he may , in the riot of his youthful blood , have committed an offense against the laws , for which it is convenient for him to go into temporary hiding , and he naturally betakes himself to the secret chamber of his own old mansion . The Doctor facilitates this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult for him to come forth . So there he is ; and he goes to America , leaving him in charge of this devoted servant . By and by he comes to dread the face of man , and to dread being seen by them ; and so he grows from youth to age . I think it should be vengeance for a crime . The seduction and death of the Doctor 's sister ; the Doctor , a terrible man , threatens vengeance . The Doctor contrives that a dead body shall be found , and taken to be that of Braithwaite . The crime alleged should be that of murder of the girl , but he shall not have meditated anything worse than a vicious connection . Each successive inheritor of the estate shall be duly taken into the secret , as before , and made wretched and guilty by it . It shall be something rather affecting the sanity of the old family ; and the moral shall be , these old families become insane . He might have seduced or broken the heart ( which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarrel ensues , in which he has reason to suppose that he has killed the Doctor , and that the law will be wreaked on him . He takes refuge in the secret chamber of the mansion , confiding himself to the care of the half-hanged man ; who , being a devoted adherent of the Doctor , acts according to his instructions , and so makes him a life-long prisoner . The Doctor , his family being disgraced , his affections outraged , chooses to vanish from life , and departs from America , leaving no record behind him-no knowledge of where he isexcept with the servant . He goes abroad with the purpose of pursuing his revenge upon the whole race of his enemy ; with this view , knowing the family history , he determines to rake up a false heir , who shall oust the present possessors . In the Romance , after the first two or three chapters , describing the Doctor and his surroundings , there must be introduced one in which this self-imprisoned man must be described-still young , cherishing purposes of coming out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Various tokens must be shown of what and whereabouts he is , and what his situation , but so as to rouse conjecture , not to satisfy it ; and a connection must be intimated between him and the plot signified by the Doctor 's spider 's web . The reader , like the prisoner himself ; may see no reason to suppose that he will not be at liberty at any moment ; indeed , the situation must be so imperfectly defined , that he shall seem at liberty now . Again , at an after-period , just before the Doctor 's death , or possibly just after his death ( or his death should be noticed , and an effect of it sugge*ted ) , and before the opening of the scene in England , the prisoner must be introduced , now some years older ; the effect of these imprisoned years must be developed ; his growing horror of the world , yet sometimes a passionate yearning to get back into it . Then again , in order to fill up the gap between the two parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years more . Show him with the marks of coming age , and his faculties growing torpid through disuse . Still have allusions to the Doctor and the spiders , etc . It must not be indicated , as yet , where the prisoner is , nor , perhaps , must it yet be quite certain that he is only self-confined . Again , after Etheredge has arrived in England , there must be another chapter , showing the pnsoner as he now is . There may be strong indications , now , that the prisoner is confined in the mansion-house ; and perhaps // one of the Warder 's stories may have led the reader to conjecture that it is a former possessor of the house . It must be so managed as to make the house awful . Finally , at whatever expense of absurdity , Etheredge must meet the man in his prison , as already seen . The surprise , disturbance , fear of man that has grown upon him , probably strike the life out of the poor olct cuss , after thirty ' years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all times be full of the Doctor-haunted by some impression of him ; but , except in this one part of his selfconfinment , there must be no intensity . He may be a young man of an exceedingly sensitive nature , who has fallen into one fault , sin , crime ; yet he might have been the flower of all the race , under happier circumstances . A poetic nature , able to console himself with imaginative reveries . Sometimes , a dreadful glimpse of the way in which he is spending life . A lack of animal spirits , of native energy . He has books and writing materials . Possibly there might be two motives for seclusion : one , disappointed love , a passion hopeless , wrecked ; the other , a sense of crime . The girl whom his shy nature ever loved , is dead ; he thinks that he has murdered her brother . So he secludes himself , at once afraid and aweary of the world . The devil becomes the turnkey at the prison-gate , and he is inevitably shut in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth . Throughout life , still a purpose to emerge . This runs through the Romance , like the vertebrae of the backbone . There should be a reference to it in everything , grave or gay . Now the girl . She has been sent out from England by the servant . Can that be the daughter of the Doctor 's sister ? That would make her too old . Well , merely a female relative , the only one of his race . Or could she belong to the old pensioner  --  a niece of his ? Only , in that case , how came she ever to be under the Doctor 's charge ? True . Might she be the daughter of this sister ? or might this be left in doubt , and only suggested by the fact of his taking charge of her , and feeling evidently a great interest in her ? * * This seems best . What is her situation when Etheredge finds her in England ? Can she have been brought back by the pensioner ? Or , can she have come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of her until she was sent over to the Doctor in America ? The old servant is the only person who has heretofore had anything to do with her . The Doctor has left her sufficient for her support , in a moderate way ; only she wants a position , it seems to me . Could she pos sibly be made a resident of the house ? I think not ; for it is requisite to give her a certain respectability of external position . An actress ? A rope-dancer ? An appurtenance of a wandering show ? It must be kept in mind that Etheredge is to marry her , which he can hardly do if she sinks below the level of respectability . She must be an artist , or may . A school-mistress ; a seamstress ? None of these . It is so desirable to connect her with the pensioner , that I do n't well see how to do anything else . He had met with her in America , and taken a great interest in her , she being still a child ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him ; or had come for that very purpose , among others . Perhaps he had had an interview with the old Doctor , shortly before the death of the latter , in which interesting matters had past ; and perhaps it was what he had learnt in this interview that the Doctor was ineffectually moved to communicate to Etheredge in his last moments . The pensioner might have satisfied the Doctor that he was the representative of the elder line . He confides her to him , and he takes charge of her . But , of course , the Doctor did not leave her dependent on the pensioner , while he was making Etheredge independent of the world ? But , somehow , the pensioner took charge of her , and brought her to England , and she was to him as a daughter . Her property had been embezzled , perhaps , and she was left to support herself as she could ; and the New England air had quickened her capacity in this respect . She has some peculiar little handwork which enables her to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Indian manufactures , with beads ? No . She sells Indian meal , done up in neat packages , for washing hands . Oh ! the devil . It shall not be told , at the close of the American part , that the girl is taken charge of by the pensioner ; but so it shall prove to be . Well , she can be received in England by an old maiden relative , where she may live in a narrow way , sketching and otherwise idly employing herself , and longing for the wide sphere that America opens to women . The owner of Braithwaite Hall has seen her and fallen in love with her , and , perchance , tried to ruin her ; but she rejects him . She comes often to see the pensioner at the hospital , and must be mixed up somehow with the story . The Braithwaite man might even have sought her for a wife , and it might be his jealousy that partly prompts to murder Etheredge , as he intends , though the fidelity of the serving man to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potion , and so introduce him to the hidden inhabitant of th' // Hall . This girl must be cheerful , natural , reasonable , beautiful , spirited , to make up for the deficiencies of almost everybody else . Something of wildness in her , intimating an origin not exactly normal , but yet nothing extravagant or unwomanly . The Indian bead-work may do . Now for the old pensioner-his origin , pursuit , biography . He is the descendant of the eldest branch of the family and its representative . According to his theory of matters , early in the King 's troubles with Parliament , his ancestor , being of a religious temperament , became a preacher of a reformed doctrine , very much like those of George Fox . On this account the family , who were then Catholics , rejected him and thrust him violently forth , some say wounded , so that the track of a Bloody Footstep was left behind him on the threshold . He disappears , going to America , where again he is persecuted by the Puritans , but founds a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his traditions , his unworldliness . The name was changed ( perhaps for that of his mother ) on his first being thrust out from his father 's family . On the other hand , showing the unreliability of tradition , the family at home have a legend that this person was a fierce and violedt religionist , that he fought outrageously agMnst the king , and was even so devilishly inimical that he was the masqued executioner who beheaded him . Always , afterward , his foot was liable to make a bloody track , as was evidenced , among other things , by the extant bloody foot-print on the threshold , when he was thrust forth from his father 's house by his horror-stricken family . They also say that he emigrated to America and made bloody tracks on the forest-leaves . Rumors of his existence , and of a family springing from him , remain in England almost to the present day . Messengers , from age to age , are sent in quest of him : for , if he left a still surviving race , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with claims to the estate and an ancient barony that has since fallen in ; for the line of the eldest son is extinct , though there is a lineage through two younger sons . This has given rise to the Doctor 's substitution of Etheredge . Well , the Pensioner inherits the religious spirit of his ancestor - a mild , gentle , sweet unyieldingness of character which has always distinguished this branch of the family : an apostolic character . The spirit of his fathers blossoms out in him more strenuously than in several preceding generations , and he is moved to preach ; but his doctrines have not enough quackery and humbug about them to make any mark in the world , for he merely preaches the purest Christianity . So he is not successful ; rather feeble , he may be pronounced by his auditors . At this period he encounters the Doctor and the two children . The Doctor is interested in him , asks him to his house , and talks with him . He reappears a little before the Doctor 's death . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge of some of the traditions of the family . He has made no impression on the world , being of too mild and meek a spirit , though he has the possibility of a martyr in him , as his forefather had . Perhaps his forefather was hanged by the Puritans ; I think so . At last , the little girl being committed to his charge , he takes her back to England , and , finding the hospital there , and being in a position to prove his claims , he takes up residence there . He knows his rights to represent the family ; but , being unworldly , having modeled himself on the character of his martyred ancestor , he will not accept worldly honors . Besides , there is a certain want of the practical in his nature that hinders such claims on his part , and he has no family motives to induce him . Perhaps he sometimes goes out preaching in England , though this is probably frowned upon by the Warden . Take the character of Cowper for this man : melancholic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not acceptable to his neighbors , though amiable . These little traits will give verisimilitude to the character . Weak , ineffectual , with bursts of great force at need ; a want of the practical element in his nature . He shall be conscious of something strange existent in the mansion-house . A delicacy of nature , coming from his former life , shall have taught him this . Possibly the wicked servant may have made some communications to him , knowing that he has been in communication with the Doctor , and reverencing , too , the holiness of his character . It is possible he may have met the self-imprisoned once , when he was straying abroad ; but I think not . There ought to be some scene contrived in which his conscientiousness should be very severely tested . Perchance he discovers the secret , and Braithwaite tries to frighten him into silence by threats of death ; or the unhanged villain might do it , but should finally let him go with the secret in his possession , influenced by the holiness of his character making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woods . This is worth working out . He might be a Fifth-Heavenly man ; that is to say , obedient to the higher law within himself and rejecting human law when t interfered .
