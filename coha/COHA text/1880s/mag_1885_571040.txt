ARTICLE 11. - PROFESSOR LEWIS R. PACKARD . IN the record of those who have lived an honorable life at Yale College and rendered an honorable service to the University , the name of Professor LEwIs R. PACKARD deserves a place . A scholar of no ordinary attainments , a teacher whose ability was recognized by the best of his pupils , a college officer of much efficiency and unselfish devotion to the highest interests of the institution , a Christian preacher fitted by his richness of thought and refined taste to meet the wants of cultured minds , he moved onward in his quiet academic career for a quarter of a century , gaining the respect of the entire community and giving to many the elevating thoughts and influences of true scholarly life . The best testimony to what he accomplished is found in the character and lives of those who enjoyed his instructions and his friendship ; and they are in all parts of the world and in all lines of useful working . Nothing can be added to what they already know , to tell them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory that here at his home , and in this Journal which has so often spoken of the life and thoughts of Yale College , a brief story respecting him should be told . There are friends here and everywhere , who will fill out its details from their own pleasant recollections . The birth-place of Professor Packard was the city of Philadelphia . The date of his birth was the 22d of August , 1836 . His father , the late Frederick A. Packard , Esq. , after spending the earlier portion of his mature life in Springfield , Mass. , where he was successfully engaged in the practice of the law , removed to Philadelphia in the year 1829 . The occasion of his change of residence was his election to the office of Secretary of the Amencan // Sunday School Union . He had long been an earnest and active Christian , devoted to the work of the Church , and recognized by all as a man of strong mind and eminent usefulness . No more efficient person could , probably , have been found in the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he was called . Regarding the invitation as a Divine summons to duty , he abandoned his profession , left the region of his early home , and devoted himself ever afterwards to the Sunday School work . He was a man who had many of the fiuier qualities of the old New England character . He had a striking and conimanding personal appearance , a vigorous intellect , delightful humor , the manners of ' a cultivated genlileman , the kindly spirit of a loving Christian . His wife , whom he married in 1822 , while he was a resident of Springfield , was Elizabeth D. Hooker , eldest daii ghter of Judge John Hooker of that city , and a descendant of the Rev. Thomas 1-looker , the first pastor of the First Church in Hartford . Of these parents Professor Packard was the youngest child . From them both he inherited mental powers of ' a high order , as well as the refined natui'e and virtuous disposition which belong to the nobler order of Christian families . His eai'ly childhood , and his boyhood until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Philadelphia . But as the time for his special preparation for the college coui'se arrived , his father deemed it best to give him the advantages of one of ' the more excellent schools of his own native State . Accordingly he was sent to Northampton , Mass. , to an institution of much repute which had been recently established there , and was then under the charge of Mr. Lewis J. Dudley , a scholar of high attainments and a teacher of marked ability . Here he remained until the summer of 1852 , when he entered Yale College . lie was , at that time , a youth of sixteen . He had a bright ; intelligent face , of more than usual beauty . His dark eye , regular and classic features , animated and eager look , honest and manly beating , arrested the notice and attention of all who saw him . He seemed to be one of the choice / spirits from among whom we could desire that the membership of our college classes might always be composed . Abundantly and thoroughly pi'epared for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a commanding position as a scholar . His mind worked with great quickness and great effectiveness . He readily mastered the difficulties which met him in any branch of his studies . He had clear insight , intelligent perception , vigorous // grasp , quiet enthusiasm , earnest desire for knowledge , a wide outlook into the illimitable field . His powers developed , as they do in the case of all bright-minded youths , in the years of his college course , but from the beginning he manifested clearly to those who watched his progress the same mental characteristics which were displayed in later life . It is not remembered that he was more successful in any one particular department of study than in others , but it is believed that , from an early period , he was deeply interested in the classical languages , and especially in the language of ancient Greece . His mind was of the peculiar order which made it natural that the life and history and literature of the Greek race should awaken his enthusiasm . As a student , he won the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not merely esteemed because he recited well , or because he learned what he had the opportunities to learn . He was successful , also , as a writer while in college , exhibiting the same neatness of style , the same calmness and clearness of thought , and the same thoroughness of research , in propoLetion to his years , which made him afterwards an interesting preacher . He was , moreover , a manly man among his fellows-thoughtful , earnest , upright , a man whose mind and soul impressed all with the thought that he was moving upward in his inner life , and was worthy of their regard . His college associates thoroughly respected him for his character . They prized his friendship , if they won it for themselves , and found in it a blessing which they could never cease to appreciate . Without striving for popularity or position , he gained some of the best rewards which the Academic course has to offer . He graduated with honor , acknowledged by all to be one of the ablest and most gifted members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he found his tastes and inclinations leading him to the quieter and more scholarly pursuits in life . Accordingly , he determined to continue his studies at the College for a year or more , as a resident graduate . He easily secured , on examiuntion , a graduate scholarship which afforded him a small income , and returned in the autumn of that year to pursue a further course , giving himself especially to the Greek language and to Mental and Moral Philosophy . At the close of the year , in the summer of 18b ' 7 , he sailed for Europe in company with a college friend . After a brief period of travel , he connected himself with the University of Berlin . There he spent a year , attend // ing lectures and still further pursuing Greek studies . The advantages and privileges of his foreign residence he greatly enjoyed , especially as he was associated with three or four of his most valued college friends , who happened to be in Germany at the same time . He had not , however , any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devoting himself to scholarship as his lif&amp;s employment . He was , oii the other hand , intending to enter the clerical profession , and to become a pastor of some church when his preparatory theological studies should be completed . For the carrying out of this purpose , he began the critical examination of the New Testament on his return to his home . In the autumn of 1859 , however , he received an invitation to become a tutor in Yale College , which he accepted , and thus the main work of his career , as later years proved , was determined for him . Two gentlemen connected with the instruction in the Greek department in the College-one of them , the late Professor James Hadley-had their minds turned especially towards him as one who might probably make a useful and valuable teacher , and at their suggestion he was elected to the tutorship . Four years afterwards , when he had abundantly proved his fitness for his work , Professor Hadley and the other members of the Faculty felt him to be , beyond doubt , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was then newly established , lie was chosen to the office at once by the Corporation , but was allowed the privilege of spending a year in Europe . At this time he went not only to Germany , but also to Greece . He had visited the latter country , indeed , in 1858 , but only as a passing traveler . He now became a resident there for a considerable period , and acquired a knowledge of the modern language , as well as of the region itself and its objects of interest to the scholar. , Upon his return in the autumn of 1864 , he immediately entered upon the duties of his new office , pursuing his own studies and instructing his classes in the ordinary routine of university life . In December , 1870 , he was married in Brooklyn , N. Y. , to Miss Harriet M. Storrs , the eldest daughter of the Rev. Dr. Richard S. Storrs , of that city , who with their only child , a daughter , made the life and joy of his household in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , always left it unwillingly and always returned to it with gladness . For a period of eight years following the beginning of his work in his professorship , he labored in his chosen field side by side with his older col // league , Professor iladley , until the death of the latter in 18*2 . He found in his colleague the genial , helpful , stimulating , inspiring , wise , generous friend , whom all the older officers of the College so well remember . The educating and strengthening influence of such an associate and friend could not be too highly appreciated . Professor Packard knew how to estimate it at its frill value , and to profit by it in the highest degree . Professor Hadley , on the other hand , found in his young friend one in whom he could confide  --  a scholar after his own heart , a careful , intelligent , enterprising , conscientious , ardent student , a man of Greek mind , as it were , and peculiarly suited to Greek culture . American scholarship has met with no greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffered through Professor Hadley 's death . He was a man whom it was a privilege and an inspiration to know . But , happily for the University , at the time of his death Professor Packard had been so long in service , that he was abundantly qualified to take the leading place in his department of study . He did not have that wide range of interest in studies of every sort , or that wonderful memory retaining everything once acquired for future and instant use , which characterized his colleague . But he had a knowledge of his own field which would have been creditable to any man , as well as that readiness to gain knowledge , or to give it , which marks the true scholar . He worked with and followed after one of the most many sided and remarkable men of the time . That he filled the place assigned to him well , is the testimony of all , now that his work is finished . It was no wrong or mistaken choice , when he was called by the trustees into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University sphere , a lover of learning for learning 's sake , a helpful guide for all who loved the ways of learning as he did himself . The life of a college teacher is a calm , quiet , uneventful life . The charm and glory of it are closely connected with the quietness of its course . To a certain class of refined and cultivated minds it is peculiarly attractive for this reason . It moves on with little of excitement , and when it ends there is but little to tell the world about it . But it requires no long observation or experience of human life to prove that usefulness is not measured by eventfulness ,  --  that the lessons and influences which move the souls of men and make many hearts better or nobler come forth* oftentimes , from those who are withdrawn in retirement // from the activities of the world . What the University gives to the young men who enjoy its privileges , is felt by them all to be one of the greatest and most wide-reaching blessings of their lives . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more manifest in its enduring results , than that which comes from association with a helpful , stimulating teacher . As a teacher , Professor Packard was both helpful and stimulating to the students whose minds were most open to receive the scholarly impulse . He was a faithful , accurate , careful , earnest investigator himself He studied conscientiously , with a critical judgment and a fair and honest spirit . Whenever he found his pupils acting in the same manner und with the same impulse as himself , he was ready to do everything in his power for them . When he had a class entirely made up of such persons , as was often the case with the graduate classes who selected his department of study , he was in the sphere for which he was peculiarly fitted . He labored for them unsparingly , and guided them with wisdom , with deep interest in their progress , and with gratifying success . What a good gift of fortune it would be for any college instructor worthy of his place , if he could find all the students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him in his chosen field . But alas ! the millennial period in this regard has not yet arrived . The good and the bad are still mingled together , and the teacher is obliged to come in contact with them both . What is to be done for the dull minds , for those who care little or nothing for particular studies , for the wilfully negligent , is ever a great question in the Academic life . For all these , espe cially for the last two classes , Professor Packard believed that the true method was to hold them strictly to the discharge of the assigned duties . As one of his most intelligent pupils has recently said , " He had no sympathy with evasion of work , and made the student feel that in teaching him he had a right to his best efforts . " By reason of the critical character of his mind , which seized upon minor details and made much of accuracy and finish with respect to them , he was impatient-no doubt , at times too impatient-of those who overlooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up for himself , was beyond the possibilities of many minds having different characteristics from his own . Their failures , therefore , grated upon his sensitive feeling . The minor things , which they could not appreciate , seemed great to his thought . He was , doubtless , unable to help them sometimes // as he might have wished , because he could not take their position , or leave the finer matters of which they had little knowledge for the broader and greater ones , which alone were open to their easy vision . No doubt the inferior teacher , when estimated by the standard of those who learn most quickly and with clearest insight , or the less accurate and penetrating scholar may , occasionally , be more helpful than one of higher powers than himself to students whose minds are not of the more active order . With less ability and taste for minute criticism , he may give the greater awakening and stimulating influence . But it is a most healthful thing for young men in college to have before them an example of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called to the stern and full discharge of every duty . No student ever passed a year under Professor Packard 's instruction without knowing what accuracy and thoroughness in learning are . No one ever failed to see in him a teacher who was as faithful himself as he asked his pupil to be , and one who would lead him carefully if he was only willing to follow . But if he would not follow-Professor Packard demanded the fulfillment of duty as a task , and thus often taught the lesson of faithfulness where the lesson in Greek was not willingly learned . " The living example , " says the writer to whom we have already referred , " which he presented of earnestness of purpose , conscientious discharge of duty , and thoroughness of work , has carried more with it in its influence upon a generation of young men toward manliness than would many books . " Professor Packard , as an officer of the College , was , with respect to the administration of its government a strict disciplinarian , a careful observer of all rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conduct , and disposed to require a similar observance on the part of others . As related to the welfare and prosperity of the institution , he was heartily devoted to its interests . It has been characteristic of the teachers in Yale College in the past , that they have thus consecrated their lives to its service , and have unselfishly labored for it with much of the same spirit with which men give themselves to the support of their households . To this fact arc , in no small measure , due the prosperity and success which have marked its history . Professor Packard belonged to the honorable line of those who have thus built up the University . To the best of his ability and knowledge , he worked for the highest style of education , for the truest scholarship , // and for the extermination of all show and pretense . He was full of confidence that , if the College could be made a home of sound learning , in the largest degree , and of solid mental and moral character , it would permanently secure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthusiast by nature . He was not much of a believer in the more ardent sort of enthusiasm . He was not even disposed to bestow commendation with great freedom , where , in his heart , he approved of what men around him did . But he pressed forward with energy all sincere and honest work , and desired the College to be full of such working . In his own studies , he was constantly moving forward through all his career . Though assailed by the power of an insidious and deadly disease , when he was not more than thirty-five years of age-at a time , thus , when most men begin their most vigorous working-he never wavered in his course or failed in his energy . He resisted the power of his malady to the utmost , rose manfnlly from every new and severe attack , sustained his courage in the darker and brighter hours alike , found his intellectual powers renewing their strength even while his physical energy was growing weaker  --  and for long years he pressed on in his acquisitions , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everywhere in the country as one of the most cultivated scholars in his own department . He was deeply interested in the work and success of the American Philological Association , and , a few years ago , was elected its president for the year . For the Transactions of that Assoeiation , as well as for this Journal , and for the American Journal of Philology and the Bibliotheca Sacra , he prepared , from time to time , a considerable number of valuable articles . Had his health allowed , he would doubtless have given evidence of his learning and ability by published books . Had he lived a few years longer , he would , notwithstanding the limitations which his health imposed , have carried out plans which he had already formed or thought of , and would have shown to the public what he had already manifested to his friends . He patiently labored when his strength was unequal to his work , and attained honorable results and fame , where less courageous men would have accomplished nothing . As has been already intimated , he made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which he would devote himself . Though he was turned aside from this work by his call to the College , he completed his theological studies while he was holding // the office of tutor , and received a license to preach . He began preaching almost immediately , and was successful and acceptable wherever he went . He occasionally occupied the College pulpit . His sermons were listened to attentively and gladly . They were fresh , original , thoughtful , like himself . They had the peculiar element in them which made them interesting to thoughtful men . The hearer found himself carried along without an effort , and felt at once that he was listening to a man who wrote from his own experience and his own thinking . He had none of the artifices of rhetoric and cared little for the graces of oratory , but he spoke as with the charm of the pleasing conversation of an intelligent and scholarly friend . The students , it is believed , always liked to hear him ; certainly the professors and older members of the congregation did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of public speaking , and the memory of him as a preacher is now a memory of years gone by . What has been already said of him in connection with his work and life has indicated largely what he was as a man . His mind was a strong one . It was especially characterized by clearness , ease and , if we may so express it , neatness in its working , careful scrutiny of details , minute criticism , severity and purity of taste , independence in thinking , intelligence , and a certain scholarly coloring . He had much of quiet humor , was appreciative of humor in others , knew the amusing side of life , and manifested a kind of playfulness , which was peculiar to himself and which even continued illness could not overcome . His mind , like his character , was thoroughly honest . There was no pretense about him , no show behind which the corresponding reality was wanting . Tie was as sparing in his commendation of himself as he was in his words of praise to others , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had a certain enthusiasm , but not of the fresh and bubbling sort-ardor in study , but no rush of ardor in common life , lie had , as has already been said , a Greek mind and spirit , and he moved most fitly in his own field . He asked for perfection in the little things of life , and not merely in the great things . He was not content with the wide outlook , but looked into every nook and corner . He loved art and music . To music he gave many hours in all his life , and found in it delight both for his mind and soul . In his character , he had the solid and strong foundations on which virtue and righteousness in the human soul rest . All who knew him well felt that they could be sure of // him . They felt that when he entered the Christian life he moved by the power of no momentary impulse , but by the force of an intelligent will . They were sure afterwards that he would not fail when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trial . He was not what we ordinarily call an emotional person ; he was rather the opposite . But he was true , sincere , consecrated to the right , a follower of the truth . He was adapted to pure friendship and won , in his college days and afterwards , many friends . He loved them , we think , more ardently than they ever knew . They loved him with an affection which survived the years . His face told the story of his mind and spirit . Its Greek beauty came forth anew after the fatal disease had finished its work and as he lay calmly in death waiting for the hour of his burial . The last year of Professor Packard 's life was mainly spent in Athens . From the time of the first proposal to establish an American School in that city for purposes , especially , of archeological research , he had taken great interest in the matter . He pressed its claims upon the attention of educated and benevolent persons in New Haven and elsewhere , and urged the authorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far it was possible for them to do so . A part of the merit of securing for the school an established and permanent existence belongs , no doubt , to him . He , certainly , worked for it faithfully and bore its welfare upon his heart . AB Professor Goodwin , of Harvard College , who had charge of the School during the first year of its existence , was about returning to his home , the general feeling of all Greek scholars interested in its success was that Professor Packard should become the head of it for the second year . He was accordingly appointed to the office in the spring of 1883 . With some hesitation and misgiving , he accepted the appointment . His friends felt that a year spent in Europe might , not improbably , be serviceable to his health . As for himself , he rather yielded to their views and wishes than admitted to his own mind similar hopefulness . But the call had come-the College had given him the required leave of absence-it might be the summons to duty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He ronsed his energy and courage to obey the call , and went forth bravely and manfully . Scarcely , however , had he passed beyond the sight of the American shores , when he was prostrated by a new attack of his malady , and his whole life abroad was one of severe struggle with disease and disappointJan. , // ment of his plans . He reached Athens , indeed , and remained there during the allotted time . He was ready for the work assigned him at any moment when his physical strength should be adequate to it . But he waited for the desired hour in yarn . He was scarcely able to get even a sight for himself of anything which interested him as a scholar , much less to give the aid , which he would so gladly have given , to the students who had gone to Greece to be with him . During this period , however , as oftentimes within the last fourteen years of his life , his will poxver rose triumphant over its enemy . The friends who had known him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind and heart , as they had watched him throughout his whole career . But the manliness , the wonderful heroism of his will they had never imagined , until they saw its manifestation of itself in the later years , or heard of it as exhibited in the struggle and disappointments of the last year . It was the grandest thing , perhaps , in all his life , but a thing which could not be fully known to others , or even to himself , until the fiery trial called it forth . The calm , critical , undemonstrative , truthful scholar was a hero when the hour-yes , when the slowly moving hours of a long year-demanded it . He fought a long-continued battle and a hard one , but he never faltered . Recovering his strength in some measure as the later spring months came on , he sailed for home when the annual School session in Athens had reached its end , and safely arrived in New York near the close of the month of June in the present year . His health seemed to improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but soon after the middle of September he had an alarming attack of illness , and from that time he gradually failed , though with intervals of hopefulness , until the 26th of October , when lie died . By the arrangements of the college studies , during the past few years , only the Junior and Senior classes had met him as an instructor . As he had been absent for the year previous to his death , the classes whose acquaintance he had formed were already graduated , and he was consequently unknown to most of the students now within the college walls . The members of nearly thirty classes , however , who preceded those of the present year , have been familiar with him either as a teacher or a f*llowstudent . To any of them , who might have seen him two weeks before his life came to its ending , he would have appeared-not in his face , indeed , and in his failing strength , but in his spiritas // he did in the former years . lie had the same cheerfulness , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mode of expressing his thought , the same readiness to do and suffer what might be necessary without complaining , the same apparent belief that a *nnn should be manly and not speak of it , the same feeling towards his friends , which he manifested ten or twenty years before . We could not persuade ourselves , after a half-hour 's conversation with him in which he seemed ready for a longer struggle and hopeful for life , that the end was in reality so very near as it was . But it came suddenly and without his being conscious of it . It came just after midnight on Sunday morning . The peacefulness of the Lord 's day seemed the fitting close of the long conflict with fatal disease . The enemy , from whom victory had been wrested many times before by the power of a courageous soul , had at last triumphed , but , in the hour of its triumph , the heroic spirit was at rest .                   @ @
