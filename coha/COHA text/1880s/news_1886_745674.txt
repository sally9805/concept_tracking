txt The remarkably ingenious application of the cat to theatrical advertising , recently made in Chicago , opens up a field of usefulness for that hitherto impracticable domestic animal . A long and painful experience has led philosophers to assume that the civilized cat has no place in political economy , except to benefit incidentally those persons who sell bootjacks , court plaster , and remedies for insomnia . The cat toils not , neither does he spin nor catch mice , and though from time immemorial a fixture in every kitchen he has skillfully concealed the fact that he possessed the slightest value . On the other hand , theatrical managers have for years been sufferers from chronic inability to get enough free advertising of their wares , and the time finally came when the enormous incident of an actress losing a twenty-thousanddollar paste necklace , or a leading man being stricken with a disastrous cold in the head , barely excited a five-line paragraph in the columns of a metropolitan newspaper ; and free beer was found to have no influence on the brutally keen discrimination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild West . So , while every household groaned under its wealth of useless cats , managers groped through a famine of advertising dodges unaware that within easy reach lay a device more precious than a gold mine . Like most great discoveries , the Chicago cat system of advertising , as originally planned , is primitive and extravagant . It is stated that Manager HOOLEY turned loose 2,000 simultaneous cats from his stage door , each with a blue ribbon about its neck bearing a printed reference to his show . This involved a reckless expenditure of ribbon and press work , to say nothing of the waste implied in the gratuitous scattering of cats . Admitting , on the authority of our telegraphic advices , that the cats only cost $5 a hundred , and assuming that the ribbon was 2 cents a yard and ' the presswork cheap , it will readily be seen that the outlay must have been considerable . t Now , an advertisement expressed in cats can not be stereotyped by any means at present known to typographical science , and hence each edition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cats ? or be deferred until an army of boys can search the town and bring back the old type , or cats , to be used again . By either method a vast amount of money will be involved , and the natural wear and tear of the cats themselves will add to the difficulty . . A manager therefore who contemplates a nightly change of bill and a daily eruption of readable and attractive cats will be forced to thoughtfully consider the relative questions of demand and supply and secure a more rapid means for the production of material than that already familiar to the wakeful citizen . It can not be denied that the invention , although at present crude and wasteful , is one of great promise . As a means of attracting public attention to some of our amusements , particularly in the line of migratory light opera , the cat has natural qualities which can not but recommend him . He will occupy fences now inaccessible to the bill stickers , and make himself and the show equally notorious . Besides , the advertising cat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are persons of a sordid and somnolent turn , who would rather go to bed than spend a dollar and a half to witness a bad performance . By flooding a town with his cascade of dramatic cats the manager will put sleep out of the question and compel the public either to come to his theatre or go mad . A slight drawback to the success of the scheme will appear when advertising cats belonging to rival managers undertake to settle their private differences in a cloud of fur ' and profanity on some fence claimed as common property . In that case both the advertisements and eats would be seriously mixed , and the inquiring citizen who had determined to go to a particular theatre would be unable to ascertain whether he was to see SALVINI or a circus . It is not alone as a means of advertising , however , that the cat will now have a distinguished place in our theatres . He might prove of considerable value in the orchestra , and cheaply supplant the baldheaded performers who now fill in the entr'actes with agony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvement on some of the orchestras employed at our popular places of amusement , and certainly could not be worse .
