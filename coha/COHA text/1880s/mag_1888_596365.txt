ILLUSTRATIONS BY FREDERIC REMINGTON . IT P to i88o the country Uthrough which the Little Missouri flows remained as wild and almost as unknown as it was when the old explorers and fur traders crossed it in the early part of the century . It was the last great Indian hunting ground across which Grosventres and Mandans , Sioux and Cheyennes , and even Crows and Rees wandered in chase of game , and where they fought one A TEXAN COWBOY. another and plundered the small parties of white trappers and hunters that occasionally ventured into it . Once or twice generals like Sully and Custer had penetrated it in the course of the long , tedious , and bloody caiopaigns that finally broke the strength of the northern Horse Indians ; indeed , the trail made by Custer 's baggage train 15 to this day one of the well-known landmarks , for the deep ruts worn by the wheels of the heavy wagons are in many places still as distinctly to be seen as ever . In 1883 a regular long-range skirmish took place just south of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both sides , while about the same time a band of Sioux plundered a party of buffalo hunters of everything they owned , and some Crows who attempted the same feat with another party were driven off with the loss of two of their number . Since then there have been in our neighborhood no stand-up fights or regular raids ; but the Indians have at different times proved more or less troublesome , burning the grass , and occasionally killing stock or carrying off horses that have wandered some distance away . They have also themselves suffered somewhat at the hands of white horse-thieves . Bands of them , accompanied by their squaws and children , often come into the ranch country , either to trade or to hunt , and are then , of course , perfectly meek and peaceable . If they stay any time they build themselves quite comfortable tepees ( wigwams , as they would be styled in the East ) , and an Indian camp is a rather interesting , though very dirty , place to visit . On our ranch we get along particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they shall be treated as fairly as if they were whites : we neither wrong them ourselves nor allow others to wrong them . We have always , for example , been as keen in putting down horse-stealing from Indians as from whites - which indicates rather an advanced stage of frontier morality , as theft from the " redskins " or the " Government " is usually held to be a very trivial matter compared with the heinous crime of theft from " citizens . " There is always danger in meeting a band of young bucks in lonely , uninhabited country - those that have barely reached manhood being the most truculent , insolent , and reckless . A man meeting such a party runs great risk of losing his horse , his rifle , and all else he has . This has happened quite frequently during the past few years to hunters or cowboys who have wandered into the debatable territory where our country borders on the Indian lands ; and in at least one such instance , that took place two years ago , the unfortunate individual lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frontiersman of any experience can generally " stand off " a small number of such assailants , unless he loses his nerve or is taken by surprlse . My only adventure with Indians was of a very mild kind . It was in the course of a solitary trip to the north and east of our range , to what was then practically unknown country , although now containing many herds of cattle . One morning I had been traveling along the edge of the prairie , and about noon I rode Maniton up a slight rise and came out on a plateau that was perhaps half a mile broad . When near the middle , four or five Indians suddenly came up over the edge , directly in front of me . The second they saw me they whipped their guns out of their slings , started their horses into a run , and came on at full tilt , whooping and brandishing their weapons . I instantly reined up and dismounted . The level plain where we were was of all places the one on which such an onslaught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , or where there is much cover , a white man is at a great disadvantage if pitted against such adepts in the art of hiding as Indians ; while , on the other hand , the latter will rarely rush in on a foe who , even if overpowered in the end , will probably inflict severe loss on his assailants . The fury of an Indian charge , and the whoops by which it is accompanied , often scare horses so as to stampede them ; but in Manitou I had perfect trust , and the old fellow stood as steady as a rock , merely cocking his ears and looking round at the noise . I waited until the Indians were a hundred yards off , and then threw up my rifle and drew a bead on the foremost . The effect was like magic . The whole party scattered out as wild pigeons or teal ducks sometimes do when shot at , and doubled back on their tracks , the men bending over alongside their horses . When some distance off they halted and gathered together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone , ostentatiously dropping his rifle and waving a blanket over his head . When he came to within fifty yards I stopped him , and he pulled out a piece of paper - all Indians , when absent from their reservations , are supposed to carry passes - and called out , " How ! Me good Indian ! " I answered " How , " and assured him most sincerely I was very glad he was a good Indian , but I would not let him come closer ; and when his companions began to draw near , I covered him with the rifle and made him move off , which he did with a sudden lapse into the most canonical Anglo-Saxon profanity . I then started to lead my horse out to the prairie ; and after hovering round a short time they rode oW while I followed suit , but in the opposite direction . It had all passed too quickly for me to have time to get frightened ; but during the rest of my ride I was exceedingly uneasy , and pushed tough , speedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on the level . However , I never saw the Indians again . They may not have intended any mischief beyond giving me a fright ; but I did not dare to let them come to close quarters , for they would have probably taken my horse and rifle , and not impossibly my scalp as well . Towards nightfall I fell in with two old trappers who lived near Killdeer Mountains , and they informed me that my assailants were some young Sioux bucks , at whose hands they themselves had just suffered the loss of a couple of horses . However , in our own immediate locality , we have had more difficulty with white desperadoes than with the redskins . At times there has been a good deal of cattle-killing and horse-stealing , and occasionally a murder or two . But as regards the last , a man has very little more to fear in the West than in the East , in spite of all the lawless acts one reads about . Undoubtedly a long-standing quarrel sometimes ends in a shooting-match ; and of course savage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be it remarked , that , inasmuch as the men are generally drunk , and , furthermore , as the revolver is at best a rather inaccurate weapon , outsiders are nearly as apt to get hurt as are the participants . But if a man minds his own business and does not go into barrooms , gambling saloons , and the like , he need have no fear of being molested ; while a revolver is a mere foolish incuinbrance for any but a trained expert , and need never be carried . Against horse-thieves , cattle-thieves , claimjumpers , and the like , however , every ranchman has to be on his guard ; and armed collisions with these gentry are sOmetimes inevitable . The fact of such scoundrels being able to ply their trade with impunity for any length of time can only be understood if the absolute wildness of our land is taken into account . The country is yet unsurveyed and unmapped ; the course of the river itself , as put down on the various Government and railroad maps , is very much a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts - as by my ranch - ten or fifteen miles , or more , away from where these maps make it . White hunters came into the land by i88o ; but the actual settlement only began in 1882 , when the first cattle-men drove in their herds , all of Northern stock , the Texans not passing north of the country around the head-waters of the river until the following year , while until 1885 the territory through which it ran for the final hundred and fifty miles before entering the Big Missouri remained as little known as ever . Some of us had always been anxious to run down the river in a boat during the time of the spring floods , as we thought we . might get good duck and goose shooting , and also kill some beaver , while the trip would , in addition , have all the charm of an exploring expedition . Twice , so far as we knew , the feat had been performed , both times by hunters , and in one instance with very good luck in shooting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men on a raft , made the spring preceding that on which we made ours , had been less successful ; for when a score or so of miles below our ranch , a bear killed one of the two adventurers , and the survivor returned . We could only go down during a freshet ; for the Little Missouri , like most plains ' rivers , is usually either a dwindling streamlet , a // mere slender thread of sluggish water , or else a boiling , muddy torrent , running over a bed of shifting quicksand , that neither man nor beast can cross . It rises and falls with extraordinary suddenness and intensity ; an instance of which has just occurred as this very page is being written . Last evening , when the moon rose , from the ranch veranda we could see the river-bed almost dry , the stream having shrunk under the drought till it was little but a string of shallow pools , with between them a trickle of water that was not ankle deep , and hardly wet the fetlocks of the saddle-band @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without any rain having fallen near us , but doubtless in consequence of some heavy cloudburst near its head , tbe swift , swollen current was foaming brim high between the banks , and even the fords were swimming-deep for the horses . Accordingly we had planned to run down the river sometime towards the end of April , taking advantage of a rise ; but an accident made us start three or four weeks sooner than we had intended . In i886 the ice went out of the upper river very early , during the first part of February ; but it at times almost froze over again , the Vot . XXXVJ. - 6. bottom ice did not break up , and a huge gorge , scores of miles in length , formed in and above the bend known as the Ox-bow , a long distance up-stream from my ranch . About the middle of March this great Ox-bow jam came down past us . It moved slowly , its front forming a high , crumhling wall , and creaming over like an immense breaker on the seashore : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plowed down the riverbed long before it came in sight round the bend above us . The ice kept piling and tossing up in the middle , and not only heaped itself above the level of the banks , but also in many places spread out on each side beyond them , grinding against the cottonwood trees in front of the ranch veranda , and at one moment bidding fair to overwhelm the house itself . It did not , however , but moved slowly down past us with that look of vast , resistless , relentless force that any great body of moving ice , as a glacier , or an iceberg , always conveys to the beholder . The heaviest pressure from the water that was backed up behind being , of course , always in the middle , this part kept breaking away , and finally was pushed on clear through , leaving the river so changed that it could hardly be known . On each STANDING OFF INDIANS . // bank , and for a couple of hundred feet out from it into the stream , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of its length , at least as far as its course lay through lands that we knew ; and in the narrow channel between the sheer ice-walls the water ran like a mill-race . At night the snowy , glittering masses , tossed and heaped up into fantastic forms , shone like crystal in the moonlight ; but they soon lost their beauty , becoming fouled and blackened , and at the same time melted and settled down until it was possible to clamber out across the slippery hummocks . We had brought out a clinker-built hoat especially to ferry ourselves over the river when it was high , and were keeping our ponies on the opposite side , where there was a good range shut in by some very broken country that we knew they would not be apt to cross . This boat had already proved very useful and now came in handier than ever , as without it we could take no care of our horses . We kept it on the bank tied to a tree , and every day would carry it or slide it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little tumbling and scrambling on our part , lower it gently into the s ITt current , pole it across to the ice on the farther bank , and then drag it over that , repeating the operation when we came back . One day we crossed and walked off about ten miles to a tract of wild and rugged country , cleft in every direction by ravines and cedar canyons , in the deepest of which we had left four deer hanging a fortnight before , as game thus hung up in cold weather keeps indefinitely . The walking was very bad , especially over the clay buttes ; for the sun at midday had enough strength to thaw out the soil to the depth of a few inches only , and accordingly the steep hillsides were covered by a crust of slippery mud , with the frozen ground underneath . It was hard to keep one 's footing , and to avoid falling while balancing along the knife-like ridge crests , or while clinging to the stunted sage brush as we went down into the valleys . The deer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but when we reached the place we found nothing save scattered pieces of their carcasses , and the soft mud was tramped all over with round , deeply marked footprints , some of them but a few hours old , showing that the plunderers of our cache were a pair of cougars - " mountain lions , " as they are called by the Westerners . They had evidently been at work for some time , and had eaten almost every scrap of flesh ; one of the deer had been carried for some distance to the other side of a deep , narrow , chasm-like gully across which the cougar must have leaped with the carcass in its mouth . We followed the fresh trail of the cougars for some time , as it was well marked , especially in the snow still remaining in the bottoms of the deeper ravines ; finally it led into a tangle of rocky hills riven by dark cedarclad gorges , in which we lost it , and we retraced our steps , intending to return on the morrow with a good track hound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next morning one of my men who was out before breakfast came back to the house with the startling news that our boat was gonestolen , for he brought with him the end of the rope with which it had been tied , evidently cut off with a sharp knife ; and also a red woolen mitten with a leather palm , which he had picked up on the ice . We had no doubt as to who had stolen it ; for whoever had done so had certainly gone down the river in it , and the only other thing in the shape of a boat on the Little Missouri was a small flat-bottomed scow in the possession of three hard characters who lived in a shack or hut some twenty miles above us , and whom we had shrewdly suspected for some time of wishing to get out of the country , as certain of the cattle-men had begun openly to threaten to lynch them . They belonged to a class that always holds sway during the raw youth of a frontier community , and the putting down of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , west of the Missouri , has been settled very recently , and every town within it has seen strange antics performed during the past five or six years . Medora , in particular , has had more than its full share of shooting and stabbing aifrays , horse-stealing and cattle-killin ONE OF THE BOYS . // 43 But the time for such things was passing away ; and during the preceding fall the vigilantes - locally known as " stranglers , " in happy allusion to their summary method of doing justice - had made a clean sweep of the cattle country along the Yellowstone and that part of the Big Missouri around and below its mouth , Be it remarked , in passing , that while the outcome of their efforts had been in the main wholesome , yet , as is always the case in an extended raid of vigilantes , several of the sixty odd victims had been perfectly innocent men who had been hung or shot in company with the real scoundrels , either through carele. sness and misapprehension or on account of some personal spite . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or unjustly - of being implicated both in cattle-killing and in that worst of frontier crimes , horse-stealing : it was only by an accident that they had escaped th' clutches of the vigilantes the preceding fall . Their leader was a well-built fellow named Finni an who had long red hair reaching to his shoulders , and always wore a broad hat and a fringed buckskin shirt . He was rather a hard case , and had been chief actor in a number of shooting scrapes . The other two were a halfbreed , a stout , muscular man , and an old German , whose viciousness was of the weak and shiftless type . We knew that these three men were becoming uneasy and were anxious to leave the locality ; and we also knew that traveling on horseback , in the direction in which they would wish to go , was almost impossible , as the swollen , ice-fringed rivers could not be crossed t all , and the stretches of broken ground would form nearly as impassable barriers . So we had little doubt that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew there was then no boat left on the river , and as the country along its banks was entirely impracticable for horses , we felt sure they would be confident that there could be no pursuit . Accordingly we at once set to work in our turn to build a fiat-bottomed scow , wherein to follow them , Our loss was very ani oying , and might prove serious one if ye vere long prevented from crossing over to look after the saddle-band ; but the determining MOUNTAIN LIONS AT THE DEER CACHE . // motive in our minds was neither chagrin nor anxiety to recover our property . In any wild country where the power of the law is little felt or heeded , and where every one has to rely upon himself for protection , men soon get to feel that it is in the highest degree unwise to submit to any wrong without making an immediate and resolute effort to avenge it upon the wrong-doers , at no matter what cost of risk or trouble . To submit tamely and meekly to theft , or to any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the offense , in a place where self-reliant hardihood and the ability to hold one 's own under all circumstances rank as the first of virtues . Two of my cowboys , Seawall and . Dow , were originally from Maine , and were mighty men of their hands , skilled in woodcraft and the use of the ax , paddle , and rifle . They set to work with a will , and , as by good luck there were plenty of boards , in two or three days they had turned out a first-class flat-bottom , which was roomy , drew very little water , and was dry as a bone ; and though , of course , not a handy craft , was easily enough managed in going down-stream . Into this we packed flour , coffee , and bacon enough to last us a fortnight or so , plenty of warm bedding , and the mess kit ; and early one cold March morning slid it into the icy current , took our seats , and shoved off down the river . There could have been no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two companions , Seawall and Dow . They were tough , hardy , resolute fellows , quick as cats , strong as bears , and able to travel like bull moose . We felt very little uneasiness as to the result of a fight with the men we were after , provided we had anything like a fair show ; moreover , we intended , if possible , to get them at such a disadvantage that there would not be any fight at all . The only risk of any consequence that we ran was that of being ambushed ; for the extraordinary formation of the Bad Lands , with the ground cut up into gullies , serried walls , and battlemented hilltops , makes it the country of all others for hiding-places and ambuscades . For several days before we started the weather had been bitterly cold , as a furious blizzard was blowing ; but on the day we left there was a lull , and we hoped a thaw had set in . We all were most warmly and thickly dressed , with woolen socks and underclothes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that we felt we could bid defiance to the weather . Each carried his rifle , and we had in addition a double-barreled duck gun , for water-fowl and beaver . To manage the boat , we had paddles , heavy oars , and long iron-shod poles , Seawall steering while Dow sat in the bow . Altogether we felt as if we were off on a holiday trip , and set to work to have as good a time as possible . The river twisted in every direction , winding to and fro across the alluvial valley bottom , only to be brought up by the rows of great barren buttes that bounded it on each edge . It had worn away the sides of these till they towered up as cliffs of clay , marl , or sandstone . Across their white faces the seams of coal drew sharp black bands , and they were elsewhere blotched and varied with brown , yellow , purple , and red . This fantastic coloring , together with the jagged irregularity of their crests , channeled b ) T the weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as their barrenness and the distinctness with which they loomed up through the high , dry air , gave them a look that was a singular mixture of the terrible and the grotesque . The bottoms were covered thickly with leafless cottonwood trees , or else with withered brown grass and stunted , sprawling sage bushes . At times the cliffs rose close to us on either hand , and again the valley would widen into a sinuous oval a mile or two long , bounded on every side , as far as our eyes could see , by a bluff line without a break , until , as we floated down close to its other end , there would suddenly appear in one corner a cleft through which the stream rushed out . As it grew dusk the shadowy outlines of the buttes lost nothing of their weirdness ; the twilight only made their uncouth shapelessness more grim and forbidding . They looked like the crouching figures of great goblin beasts . Those two hills on the right Crouched like two hulls locked horn in horn in fightWhile to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kindled through a cleft : The hills , like giants at a hunting , lay Chin upon hand , to see the game at haymight well have been written after seeing the strange , desolate lands lying in western Dakota . All through the early part of the day we drifted swiftly down between the heaped-up piles of ice , the cakes and slabs now dirty and unattractive looking . Towards evening , however , there came long reaches where the banks on either side were bare , though even here there would every now and then be necks . where the jam had been crowded into too narrow a spot and had risen over the side as it had done up-stream , grinding the bark from the big cottonwoods and snapping the smaller ones short off . In such places the ice-walls were sometimes eight or ten feet high , continually undermined by the restless current ; and every now and then overhanging pieces would break off and slide into the stream with // great water beast . Nor did we dare to go in too close to the high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thaw from the grip of the frost , kept rolling and leaping down their faces and forced us to keep a sharp lookout lest our boat should be swamped . At nightfall we landed , and made our camp on a point of wood-covered land jutting out into the stream . We had seen very little trace of life until late in the day , for the ducks had not yet arrived ; but in the afternoon a sharptailed prairie fowl flew across stream ahead of the boat , lighting on a low branch by the water 's edge . Shooting him , we landed and picked off two others that were perched high up in leafless cottonwoods , plucking the buds . These three birds served us as supper ; and shortly afterward , as the cold grew more and more biting , we rolled in under our furs and blankets and were soon asleep . In the morning it was evident that instead of thawing it had grown decidedly colder . The anchor ice was running thick in the river , and we spent the first hour or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for white-tail deer , of which there were many tracks ; but we saw nothing . Then we broke camp - a simple operation , as we had no tent , and all we had to do was to cord up our bedding and gather the mess kit - and again started down-stream . It was colder than before , and for some time we went along in chilly silence , nor was it until midday that the sun warmed our blood in the least . The crooked bed of the current twisted hither and thither , but whichever way it went the icy north wind , blowing stronger all the time , drew steadily up it . One of us remarking that we bade fair to have it in our faces all day , the steersman announced that we could nt , unless it was the crookedest wind in Dakota ; and half an hour afterward we overheard him muttering to himself that it was the crookedest wind in Dakota . We passed a group of tepees on one bottom , marking the deserted winter camp of some Grosventre Indians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months previously on a trading expedition . It was almost the last point on the river with which we were acquainted . At midday we landed on a sand-bar for lunch ; a simple enough meal , the tea being boiled over a fire of driftwood , that also fried the bacon , while the I ) read only needed to be baked every other day . Then we again shoved off . As the afternoon waned the cold grew still more bitter , and the wind increased , blow-45 ing in fitful gusts against us , until it chilled us to the marrow when we sat still . But we rarely did sit still ; for even the rapid current was unable to urge the light-draught scow down in the teeth of the strong blasts , and we only got her along by dint of hard work with pole and paddle . Long before the sun went down the ice had begun to freeze on the ham dles of the poles , and we were not sorry to haul on shore for the night . For supper we again had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bulberry bushes late in the afternoon . A man doing hard open-air work in cold weather is always hungry for meat . During the night the thermometer went down to zero , and in the morning the anchor ice was running so thickly that we did not care to start at once , for it is most difficult to handle a boat in the deep frozen slush . Accordingly we took a couple of hours for a deer hunt , as there were evidently many white-tail on the bottom . We selected one long , isolated patch of tangled trees and brushwood , two of us beating through it while the other watched one end ; but almost before we had begun four deer broke out at one side , loped easily oQ evidently not much scared , and took refuge in a deep glen or gorge , densely wooded with cedars , that made a blind pocket in the steep side of one of the great plateaus bounding the bottom . After a short consultation , one of our number crept round to the head of the gorge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up it on each side , thus completely surrounding the doomed deer . They attempted to break out past the man at the head of the glen , who shot down a couple , a buck and a yearling doe . The other two made their escape by running off over ground so rough that it looked fitter to be crossed by their upland-loving cousins , the black-tail . THE CAPTURE OF THE GERMAN . // This success gladdened our souls , insuring us plenty of fresh meat . We carried pretty much all of both deer back to camp , and , after a hearty breakfast , loaded our scoxv and started merrily off once more . The cold still continued intense , and as the day wore away we became numbed by it , until at last an incident occurred that set our blood running freely again . We were , of course , always on the alert , keeping a sharp lookout ahead and around us , and making as little noise as possible . Finally our xvatchfulness was rewarded , for in the middle of the afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as we came round a bend , we saw in front of us the lost boat , together with a scow , moored against the bank , while from among the bushes some little way back the smoke of a camp-fire curled up through the frosty air . We had come on the camp of the thieves . As T glanced at the faces of my two followers J was struck by the grim , eager look in their eyes . Our overcoats were off in a second , and after exchanging a few muttered words , the boat was hastily and silently shoved towards the bank . As soon as it touched the shore ice I leaped out and ran up behind a clump of bushes , so as to cover the landing of the others , who had to make the boat fast . For a moment we felt a thrill of keen excitement , and our veins tingled as we crept cautiously towards the fire , for it seemed likely there would be a brush ; but , as it turned out , this was almost the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was as tame as possible . The men we were after knew they had taken with them the only craft there was on the river , and so felt perfectly secure ; accordingly , we took them absolutely by surprise . The only one in camp was the German , whose weapons were on the ground , and who , of course , gave up at once , his two companions being off hunting . We made him safe , delegating one of our number to look after him particularly and see that he made no noise , and then sat down and waited for the others . The camp was under the lee of a cut bank , behind which we crouched , and , after waiting an hour or over , the men we were after came in . We heard them a long way off and made ready , watching them for some minutes as they walked towards us , their rifles on their shoulders and the sunlight glinting on the steel barrels . When they were within twenty yards or so we straightened up from behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shouted to them to hold up their hands-an order that in such a case , in the West , a man is not apt to disregard if he thinks the giver is in earnest . The half-breed obeyed at once , his knees trembling as if they had been made of whalebone . Finnigan hesitated for a second , his eyes fairly wolfish ; then , as I walked up within a few paces , covering the center of his chest so as to avoid overshooting , and repeating the command , he saw he had no show , and , with an oath , " HANDS us ! " - THE CAPTURE OF FINNIGAN. // let his rifle drop and held his hands up beside his head . It was nearly dusk , so we camped where we were . The first thing to be done was to collect enough wood to enable us to keep a blazing fire all night long . While Seawall and Dow , thoroughly at home in the use of the ax , chopped down dead cottonwood trees and dragged the logs up into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who were huddled into a sullen group some twenty yards oft ; just the right distance for the buckshot in the double-barrel . Having captured our men , we were in a quandary how to keep them . The cold was so intense that to tie them tightly hand and foot meant , in all likelihood , freezing both hands and feet off during the night ; and it was no use tying them at all unless we tied them tightly enough to stop in part the circulation . So nothing was left for us to do but to keep perpetual guard over them . Of course we had carefully searched them , and taken away not only their firearms and knives , but everything else that could possibly be used as a weapon . By this time they were pretty well cowed , as they found out very quickly that they would be well treated so long as they remained quiet , but would receive some rough handling if they attempted any disturbance . Our next step was to cord their weapons up in some bedding , which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the men take off their boots - an additional safeguard , as it was a cactus country , in which a man could travel barefoot only at the risk of almost certainly laming himself for life - and go to bed , all three lying on one buffalo robe and being covered by another , in the full light of the blazing fire . We determined to watch in succession a half-night apiece , thus each getting a full rest every third night . I took first watch , my two companions , revolver under head , rolling up in their blankets on the side of the fire opposite that on which the three captives lay ; while I , in fur cap , gontlets , and overcoat , took my station a little way back in the circle of firelight , in a position in which I could watch my men with the absolute certainty of being able to stop any movement , no matter boxy sudden . For this night-watching we always used the double-barrel with buckshot , as a rifle is uncertain in the dark ; while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men lying down , a person who is watchful may be sure that they can not get up , no matter how quick they are , without being riddled . The only danger lies in the extreme monotony of sitting still in the dark guarding men who make no motion , and the consequent tendency to go to sleep , especially when one has had a hard day 's work and is feeling really tired . But neither on the first night nor on any subsequent one did we ever abate a jot of our watchfulness . LAKE OFF YOUR BOOTS ! " // Next morning we started down-stream , having a well-laden flotilla , for the men we had caught had a good deal of plunder in their boats , including some saddles , as they evidently intended to get horses as soon as they reached a part of the country where there were any , and where it was possible to travel . Finnigan , who was the ringleader , and the man I was especially after , I kept by my side in our boat , the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rather leaky , and with only one paddle . We kept them just in front of us , a few yards distant , the river being so broad that we knew , and they knew also , any attempt at escape to be perfectly hopeless . For some miles we went swiftly down-stream , the cold being bitter and the slushy anchor ice choking the space between the boats ; then the current grew sluggish , eddies forming along the sides . We paddled on until , coming into a long reach where the water was almost backed up , we saw there was a stoppage at the other end . Working up to this , it proved to be a small ice jam , through which we broke our way only to find ourselves , after a few hundred yards , stopped by another . We had hoped that the first was merely a jam of anchor ice , caused by the cold of the last few days ; but the jam we had now come to was black and solid , and , running the boats ashore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GUARD AT NIGHT find out what'the matter was . On climbing a hill that commanded a view of the valley for several miles , the explanation became only too evident- as far as we could see , the river was choked with black ice . The great Ox-bow jam had stopped and we had come down to its tail . We had nothing to do but to pitch camp , after which we held a consultation . The Little Missouri has much too swift a current ,  - -  when it has any current at all ,  --  with too bad a bottom , for it to be possible to take a boat up-stream ; and to walk , of course , meant abandoning almost all we had . Moreover we knew that a thaw would very soon start the jam , and so made up our minds that we had best simply stay where we were , and work downstream as fast as we could , trusting that the spell of bitter weather would pass before our food gave out . The next eight days were as irksome and monotonous as any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combining the functions of a sheriff with those of an arctic explorer . The weather kept as cold as ever . During the night the water in the pail would freeze solid . Ice formed all over the river , thickly along the banks ; and the clear , frosty sun gave us so little warmth that the melting hardly began before noon . Each day the great jam would settle down-stream a few miles , only to wedge again , leaving behind it several smaller jams , through which we would work our way until we were as close to the tail of the large one as we dared to go . We had to be additionally cautious on account of being in the Indian country , having worked down past Killdeer Mountains , where some of my cowboys had run across a band of Sioux-said to be Tetons  --  the year before . Very probably the Indians would not have harmed us anyhow , but as we were hampered by the prisoners , we preferred not meeting them ; nordidwe , though we saw plenty of fresh signs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just made a grand hunt all down the river , and had killed or driven off almost every head of game in the country through which we were passing . As our stock of provisions grew scantier and scant- // SHERIFf 'S WORK ON A RANCH . ier , we tried in vain to eke it out by the chase ; for we saw no game . Two of us would go out hunting at a time , while the third kept guard over the prisoners . The latter would be made to sit down together on a blanket at one side of the fire , while the guard for the time being stood or sat some fifteen or twenty yards off . The prisoners being unarmed , and kept close together , there was no possibility of their escaping , and the guard kept at such a distance that they could not overpower him by springing on him , he having a Winchester or the double-barreled shot-gun always in his hands cocked and at the ready . So long as we kept wide-awake and watchful , there was not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and understood perfectly that the slightest attempt at a break would result in their being shot down ; but , although there was thus no risk , it was harassing , tedious work , and the strain , day in and day out , without any rest or let up , became very tiresome . The days were monotonous to a degree . The endless rows of hill- bounding the valley , barren and nake , stretched along without a break . When we rounded a bend , it was only to see on each hand the same lines of broken buttes dwindling off into the distance ahead of us as they had dwindled off into the distance behind . If , in hunting , we climbed to their tops , as far as our eyes could scan there was nothing but the great rolling prairie , bleak and lifeless , reaching off to the horizon . VOL . XXXVI. -7 . We broke camp in the morning , on a point of land covered with brown , leafless , frozen cottonwoods ; and in the afternoon we pitched camp on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same stiff , dreary trees . The discolored river , whose eddies boiled into yellow foam , flowed always between the same banks of frozen mud or of muddy ice . And what was , from a practical standpoint , even worse , our diet began to be as same as the scenery . Being able to kill nothing , we exhausted all our stock of provisions and got reduced to flour , without yeast or baking*powder and unleavened bread , made with exceedingly muddy water , is not , as a steady thing , attractive . Finding that they were well treated and were also watched with the closest vigilance , our prisoners behaved themselves excellently and gave no trouble , though afterward , when out of our hands and shut up in jail , the halfbreed got into a stabbing affray . They conversed freely with my two men on a number of indifferent subjects , and after the first evening no allusion was made to the theft , 01 anything connected with it ; so that an outsider overhearing the conversation would never have guessed what our relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only , did Finnigan broach the subject . somebody had been speaking of a man whom we all knew , known as " Calamity , " who had been recently taken by the sheriff on a charge of horsestealing . Calamity had escaped once , but was caught at a disadvantage the next time ; // nevertheless , when summoned to hold his hands up , he refused , and attempted to draw his own revolver , with the result of having two bullets put through him . Finnigan commented on Calamity as a fool for " not knowing when a man had the drop on him " ; and then , suddenly turning to me , said , his weather-beaten face flashing darkly : " If I d had any show at all , you d have sure had to fight , Mr. Roosevelt ; but there was n't any use making a break when I 'd only have got shot myself ; with no chance of harming any one else . " I laughed and nodded , and the subject was dropped . Indeed , if the time was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our prisoners , who had nothing to do but to lie still and read , or chew the bitter cud of their reflections , always conscious that some pair of eyes was watching them every moment , and that at least one loaded rifle was ever ready to be used against them . They had quite a stock of books , some of a rather unexpected kind . Dime novels and the inevitable " History of the James Brothers "  --  a book that , together with the " Police Gazette , " isto be found in the hands of every professed or putative ruffian in the West - seemed perfectly in place ; but it was somewhat surprising to find that a large number of more or less drearily silly " society " novels , ranging from Ouida 's to those of The Duchess and Augusta J. Evans , were most greedily devoured . Our commons grew shorter and shorter ; and finally even the flour was nearly gone , and we were again forced to think seriously of abandoning the boats . The Indians had driven all the deer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they were not plentiful . A flock of geese passed us one morning , and afterward an old gander settled down on the river near our camp ; but he was over two hundred yards off ; and a rifle-shot missed him . But when the day was darkest the dawn appeared . At last , having worked down some thirty miles at the tail of the ice jam , we struck an outlying cow-camp of the C Diamond ( C K* ) ranch , and knew that our troubles were almost over . There was but one cowboy in it , but we were certain of his cordial help , for in a stock country all make common cause against either horse-thieves or cattle-thieves . He had no wagon , but told us we could get one up at a ranch near Killdeer Mountains some fifteen miles off , and lent me a pony to go up there and see about it - which I accordingly did , after a sharp preliminary tussle when I came to mount the wiry bronco . When I reached the solitary ranch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prairie schooner and two tough little bronco mares , driven by the settler " A SHARP PRELIMINARY TUSSLE . " // himself a rugged old plainsman , who evidently could hardly understand why I took so much bother with the thieves instead of hanging them off-hand . Returning to the river the next day , we walked our men up to the Killdeer Mountains . Seawall and Dow left me the following morning , went back to the boats , and had no further difficulty , for the weather set in very warm , the ice went through with a rush , and they reached Mandan in about ten days , killing four beaver and five geese on the way , but lacking time to stop and do any regular hunting . Meanwhile I took the three thieves in to Dickinson , the nearest town . The going was bad , and the little mares could only drag the wagon at a walk , so , though we drove during the daylight , it took us two days and a night to make the journey . It was a most desolate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was a mere bleak waste of blackened earth , and a cold , rainy mist lasted throughout the two days . The only variety was where the road crossed the shallow beadwaters of Knife and Green rivers . Here the ice was high alpng the banks , and the wagon had to be taken to pieces to get it over . My three captives were unarmed , but as I was alone with them , except for the driver , of whom I knew nothing , * had to be doubly on my guard , and never let them come close to me . The little mares went so slowly , and the heavy road rendered any hope of escape by flogging up the horses so entirely out of the question , that I soon found the safest plan was to put the prisoners in the wagon and myself walk behind with the inevitable Winchester . Accordingly I trudged steadily the whole time behind the wagon through the ankle-deep mud . It was a gloomy walk . Hour after hour went by always the same , while I plodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggling with a sense of dogged , weary resolution . At night , when we put up at the squalid hut of a frontier granger , the only habitation on our road , it was even worse . I did not dare to go to sleep , but making my three men get into the upper bunk , from which they could get out only with difficulty , I sat up with mx- back against the cabindoor and kept watch over them all night long . So , after thirty-six hours ' sleeplessness , I was most heartily glad when we at last jolted into the long , straggling main street of Dickinson , and I was able to give my unwilling companions into the hands of the sheriff .
