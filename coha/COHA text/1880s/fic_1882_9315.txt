CHARACTERS . Ernest Archibald . Virginia Berkeley , a young widow , his cousin . Note : 1Kb Main text Scene : A drawing-room in a country house , prettily furnished . Door from hall , R. 2 E. Door to next room , L. U. E. Through large French windows at the back is seen a flower-garden ; in the distance , a view of the Hudson . Large table a little to the left of C. , with a chair on each side . Jardinire , with flowers , in the window R. Mantelpiece at L. 1 E. Ernest Archibald Ernest Archibald stands by the mantelpiece , looking rather mournfully at a photograph in a velvet frame . He sighs in a mild and subdued way , and his inspection appears to yield him but a limited amount of satisfaction . After a moment , however , he breaks the silence and opens the play by soliloquizing : If I dared ! But I do n't dare . I did n't dare before the advent of the late-lamented Berkeley ; and now that he has come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the position . If she was formidable as a girl , she 's only doubly terrifying as a widow . O Cousin Virginia ! Cousin Virginia !  --  hello , Cousin Virginia ! The tone of his sentimental apostrophe suddenly changes , and his last repetition of the name is simply a surprised salutation , addressed to a young lady who has just entered the room R. 2 E. The young lady has bright eyes and an air of entire self-possession , which , in conjunction with a mischievous smile , give a faint hint of the reason why Ernest had n't dared . And the general appearance of the young lady sufficiently explains why he felt badly about it . Virginia Berkeley carries on her arm a traveling-shawl , and in her hand an extremely small work-basket , of which luggage her host proceeds to disembarrass her . Ernest . Ernest Archibald Why , my dear Virginia , we did n't expect you so soon ! Let me take your shawl  --  and that work-basket . How did you get here ? Virginia . Virginia Berkeley Ernest , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone to the station to meet you . Virginia . Virginia Berkeley What ! did she think I was going to take that hot , stuffy railroad to ride twenty miles ? As you would say , not much ! I drove up from Peekskill in the phaeton . John is putting my pony in the stable at this moment . Pony 's tired  --  which reminds me that I am too . But you do n't offer me a chair . You stand still and look at me , just as you 've done for twenty years , ever since we were small children in pinafores . Your pinafore was dirty : mine was clean . You used to stare at me then : you do now . I do n't see that it has ever done you any good . It is very complimentary , but I should prefer a chair . Ernest . Ernest Archibald I do n't know why you want a chair when I am present . You always sit down on  --  Virginia , Virginia Berkeleyseverely . Ernest ! No slang , if you please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ! You have picked out the only uncomfortable chair in the room , but never mind  --  it will do . Ernest . Ernest Archibald Virginia , how long are you going to stay here ? Virginia , Virginia Berkeleypromptly . One week . But , if the prospect alarms you already , you may go somewhere else . Well , why are you looking at me now ? Ernest . Ernest Archibald I 'm not looking at you . Virginia . Virginia Berkeley What are you looking at , then ? Ernest , Ernest Archibaldhesitatingly . I 'm looking at your dress . Virginia , Virginia Berkeleyabsently . Oh , yes . I 've left off my mourning . Ernest , Ernest Archibaldinvoluntarily . Hop-l ! Virginia . Virginia Berkeley Ernest ! What do you mean by that extraordinary remark  --  to characterize it mildly ? It is the first sign of animation you have given . I have no objection to vivacity , but the form it takes is a little peculiar . Ernest . Ernest Archibald Now look here , Virginia ; you did n't care a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whom do you mean  --  what do you mean  --  are you insane , Ernest ? Ernest . Ernest Archibald I mean the late-lamented . Oh , do n't look indignant and offended . It was your mother 's marriage ; not yours . I do n't say anything disrespectful of the late Berkeley  --  no , far from it . I 've had a high regard for him ever since he died and left you your freedom and his fortune and a pony-phaeton . But , alive , he was a decided bore ! Virginia . Virginia Berkeley Ernest ! Ernest . Ernest Archibald Yes . a bore ! He bored me ! Virginia . Virginia Berkeley You ? Ernest . Ernest Archibald Yes ! For  --  because  --  you know . Virginia . Virginia Berkeley Great heavens , Ernest ! it is n't possible that you 're trying to make love to me ! Ernest , Ernest Archibaldsomewhat taken aback . Is n't it ? Virginia . Virginia Berkeley How long since you got that idea into your head ? Ernest . Ernest Archibald Well , I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much of it . I meant to tell you that  --  that  --  for a long time I 've been  --  Virginia . Virginia Berkeley Well , what ? Ernest . Ernest Archibald Er  --  er  --  sighing  --  Virginia , Virginia Berkeleyhighly amused . Sighing ? Sighing ? Oh , ha-ha-ha-ha-ha ! Sighing ? O Ernest , dear ; do tell me next time you sigh  --  I should so like to see you sighing . Continuation of ha-ha 's . Ernest . Ernest Archibald Oh , confound it ! Virginia ! do n't laugh so . Let me speak . Virginia . Virginia Berkeley Certainly  --  oh , certainly . I 'd like to see how you do it . Take care ! you 're not the first , you know . If you do n't introduce some novel effect into your courtship , you 've no chance at all . Come , let 's hear you sigh . Ernest , Ernest Archibaldconfidentially , to vacancy . Not the first . I should think not ! Perhaps this would be a good situation to exit on . Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Archibald Well , then  --  I love you ! Virginia . Virginia Berkeley Doubtless . Proceed . Ernest . Ernest Archibald I  --  I  --  adore you . Virginia . Virginia Berkeley Could n't you adore me with a little variation of style ? Ernest . Ernest Archibald If you doubt that my love will last  --  Virginia . Virgi nia Berkeley I do n't . That 's just what I 'm afraid of . It 's a very stupid kind of love . Ernest . Ernest Archibald But I ask so little , Virginia . I do n't demand that you should love me  --  Virginia . Virginia Berkeley Now , that is really kind and considerate of you ! Ernest . Ernest Archibald When you left this house two years ago , Virginia , you were not so cruel to me . I was twenty years old  --  it was spring  --  and that was the last day of spring on which you left us . Do you not remember that time , my cousin ? Has the odor of your ball-bouquets overpowered the perfume of our woodland flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see you now : running down the long walks of the garden ; your dark hair flying behind you ; I can hear the clear ring of your voice as you called my name . Ah , what a grand air you had then ; though you were only a little girl just from boarding-school . I was sometimes almost afraid of you , but I always admired you  --  ay ! I loved you , though I did not know it . Virginia . Virginia Berkeley You were better off then than you are now . Ernest . Ernest Archibald I was ! for you were kinder . Those were the days when you used to say : " Cousin Ernest , come and make love to me ! " You do n't say that any more , now . Virginia . Virginia Berkeley I do not . But come , my poor Ernest , what folly this is ! If you would only stop loving me , I should like you so much better . Affection does n't improve your personal appearance , my dear . You make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though , you are spoiling my visit for me . I came here to have a good time ; to see you and my aunt ; and no sooner have I arrived than you begin talking to me in this disagreeable way . You must not make love to me . We are very good friends ; I love you as a cousin . Love , Ernest ! Why , it 's like taking a newspaper  --  I might discontinue my subscription at any time . But friendship  --  it is a precious book , that we read and re-read a hundred times , and never grow tired of . Why should we try to force our inclinations ? The love we seek would spoil that which we now enjoy . Come , you will be a good boy , and obey me . Ernest , Ernest Archibaldwith promptitude and decision . I will not . Virginia . Virginia Berkeleysurprised . What ? Ernest . Ernest Archibald I mean , I can not . I love you , and  --  Virginia . Virginia Berkeley Then I 'll go back to Peekskill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw your coachman pass the window just this moment . He is undoubtedly gone to the tavern , which is half a mile down the road . Virginia . Virginia Berkeley Then , if I 've got to stay , we 'll settle this at once . I hate you . I detest you . I shall always continue to hate and detest you ! Ernest . Ernest Archibald Virginia  --  cousin ! Virginia , Virginia Berkeleynot at all mollified . Do n't come near me . Ernest . Ernest Archibald But  --  Virginia . Virginia Berkeley No ! She arises , walks swiftly to the mirror , and removes her hat , which , being of the Gainsborough pattern , lends a rakish air to the wearer . Its removal enables her to look consistently languid , and she throws herself into a large arm-chair to the right of the table , and tries to pose for a martyr . The unfortunate Ernest pauses in a moody promenade from end to end of the room , and turns to address her . Immediate resumption of hostilities . Ernest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Berkeley I will not look there , sir . I am your victim . Do n't speak to me . You 've put me all out of sorts . Ernest , Ernest Archibaldon the left of the table . You must hear me ! My life is at your feet  --  Virginia looks down at the tiny tip of her shoe , resting comfortably on a brioche , as if to verify the assertion . Her lover , however , refuses to take any notice of this small outrage , and proceeds : I will make you the tenderest of husbands  --  Virginia , Virginia Berkeleystarting to her feet in horror . Husbands ! The audacity of the wretch ! Ernest . Ernest Archibald Well , suppose  --  Virginia , Virginia Berkeleytragically pacing the room . Leave me , sir ! I will bear this no longer . Ernest . Ernest Archibald At least , pardon me if I  --  Virginia . Virgi nia Berkeley There 's no if about it . You have . But I will not pardon you . Ernest , Ernest Archibaldimmovable . What a fool I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going . You see I 'm going . Virginia , Virginia Berkeleyunable to see anything of the sort . Then what are you stopping there for ? Ernest , Ernest Archibaldfrankly . To look at you . You are so deucedly pretty that way . Upon this he prudently retires through the left upper doorway just as Virginia returns to her arm-chair . Left alone , the young lady laughs quietly to herself for a moment , and then looks serious . Her cheeks flush , apparently with indignation , and she indulges in a brief and fragmentary soliloquy . Virginia . Virginia Berkeley The wretch ! With satisfaction I did well to laugh at him . With a slight touch of compunction Perhaps I laughed a little too much . With an air of judicial abstraction For , after all , he could n't help it . Softening Poor Ernest ! Quite melted Poor dear ! The left upper door softly opens , and the head of the exile appears . This movement seems to be inopportune on his part , for , as soon as his cousin perceives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youth enters , however , and advances to the fray . His reception is not encouraging . Virginia . Virginia Berkeley Ernest ! You back ? Ernest , Ernest Archibaldwith resolute cheerfulness . Yes . You see . Come , do n't be so tragic . I generally go when I 'm boun  --  I mean , when I 'm sent away . I went when you told me to . I saw it was best . Anger sat enthroned upon your bang . I went out on the lawn , and I had n't taken two steps before up flew a little bird  --  yes , a little bird ! He flew first right , and then left , and then he whistled three times . If that was n't an omen , I do n't know what is . It was an omen . And in obedience to it I return . Virginia , Virginia Berkeleypuzzled . But I do n't understand  --  Ernest . Ernest Archibald Oh , but I do . That little bird did n't whistle for nothing . He meant to say to me : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fellow , to give it up like this ! Because your cousin frowns and tells you to leave her when you say you love her , you quietly put on your hat and go ! Bah ! that 's the kind of thing you must expect in love . Go back and begin again . Go on worse than ever . She expects you  --  " Virginia , Virginia Berkeleyindignantly . She does not ! Ernest , Ernest Archibaldundisturbed . I 'm only telling you what the bird said . Talk to him . " Go back , old fellow , " he went on , " and try it again . " So I 'm back . Charge it to the dickey-bird . Virginia . Virginia Berkeley And you think your bird and your impudence will have any effect on me ? Ernest , Ernest Archibaldplacidly . Ca n't say . Hope so . Virginia , Virginia Berkeleyrising with a nervous start . Ernest ! you 'll drive me crazy  --  no , you wo n't  --  you 'll make me cry ! Oh , dear ! Why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ernest Archibald In your place ? Virginia . Virginia Berkeley Yes  --  no , that is . I do n't mean literally  --  that would be funny . Courtship with variations . Ernest , Ernest Archibaldmeditatively . In your place ! Virginia . Virginia Berkeley Well , yes ! In my place . And then perhaps you 'd find out , sir , that adoration may be torture to a woman . Of what do you suppose my heart is made , if you think I enjoy having you batter at its portal in this fashion ? She crosses L. Ernest . Ernest Archibald I suppose it 's made of some pretty tough material . Virginia . Virginia Berkeley You do ? Well , come , we 'll see how you like it yourself . I 'm going to convince you  --  this instant . It is I who will make love to you . She comes back to the table . Ernest . Ernest Archibald Good joke . Virginia . Virginia Berkeley You think so , do you ? Well , you 'll see . I am going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pity or remorse . You shall be the lady fair , and I the enamored knight . And take care of yourself , my lady ! Ernest . Ernest Archibald Good idea . Virginia . Virginia Berkeley Yes , but  --  one thing . I want to gain some substantial results by this operation . Ernest . Ernest Archibald If you go about your business properly , you 'll gain me . I 'm a pretty substantial result . Virginia , Virginia Berkeleyseating herself on the left of table . Nonsense ! But see  --  the game is to close at dinner-time  --  at six o'clock . And from that time to the end of my visit here , you are not to say one single word of love to me . Do you promise ? Ernest . Ernest Archibald Yes  --  unless  --  Virginia . Vi rginia Berkeley Unless ? Ernest . Ernest Archibald Unless you ask me to . Virginia , Virginia Berkeleywith sarcastic merriment . I accept that condition . Unless I ask you to . Well , then  --  oh , one word more ! You  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You wo n't take any unfair advantage of your position ? Ernest . Ernest Archibald Certainly not . Virginia . Virginia Berkeley I mean  --  do n't introduce me to any type of lady that I have n't met before . Ernest , Ernest Archibaldemphatically . I wo n't . Do n't be afraid . I 'll take you for a model . Virginia . Virginia Berkeley Ladies do n't pay compliments , sir ! This wo n't do . We must have a forfeit . Every time you forget your rle of lady fair , you shall pay me  --  let us see  --  what have you in your pockets ? Ernest . Ernest Archibald Here are ten silver dollars . Virginia . Virginia Berkeley Do you want them ? Ernest . Ernest Archibald No , glad to get rid of them . Virginia . Virginia Berkeley Well , then , each time that you forget yourself , you shall pay me one of these ; proceeds to be devoted to the Home for Indigent and Venerable Females at Peekskill . I 'm one of the directors . There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some day we expect to get an Indigent and Venerable Female to put in it . So these are your forfeits . Ernest . Ernest Archibald All right . But what 's sauce for an Indigent and Venerable Female is sauce for a young and lovely one . What are you to forfeit to me if you forget that you are a gentleman ? Virginia . Virgi nia Berkeley Well , what ? What do you suggest ? Ernest . Ernest Archibald Hm ! Say  --  say , for instance , a kiss  --  Virginia Virginia Berkeleyenergetically negative . No ! no ! no ! no ! Ernest . Ernest Archibald Why not ? Virginia . Virginia Berkeley Do you estimate a kiss from me at one dollar only ? Ernest . Ernest Archibald By no means . Its value is not to be estimated . I do n't even attempt it . The dollar is merely a counter  --  an arbitrary representative of value . But if you are talking on a business basis , I know an old woman who could be induced to go to your Home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Virginia . Virginia Berkeley No ! Ernest . Ernest Archibald All right then . The fight is declared off , and the treaty abrogated . I shall return to my labors . Virginia . Virginia Berkeley Oh , dear , no ! I ca n't have that . And , anyway  --  there ca n't be any danger . I can rely on myself , on my skill , and my  --  Ernest . Ernest Archibald Charms . Virginia . Virginia Berkeley A compliment ! Pay me a forfeit . Ernest . Ernest Archibald Time 's not called yet . Virginia . Virginia Berkeley Never mind . I do n't want to bankrupt you so soon . You 'll lose your silver counters soon enough . But now  --  it 's all understood , is it ? The play is cast  --  we know our rles ? Then up goes the curtain . She touches a bell on the table . Now , then , let the company remember their cues . Rising and bowing to an imaginary public . Ladies and gentlemen , " Courtship with Variations , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she reseats herself . The exponent of the opposing rle takes the chair on the other R. side of the table , and for a silent minute or two both appear to be absorbed in reflection . It is the truce before the battle . After another moment , Ernest steals a sly glance at his antagonist , and surprises her in the act of doing the same thing . After this , there is more silence , and considerable fidgeting in both chairs . At last Virginia whispers to herself , by way of relief : He 's got to speak , some time or other . He , however , does not seem to think so . Struck by a sudden idea , he reaches for the diminutive work-basket on the table , and placidly begins a wild travesty of crocheting . The owner of the basket looks on the ruin of her handiwork with some dissatisfaction , but does not venture to interfere . She once more takes refuge in soliloquy : Ten counters  --  ten kisses  --  it 's too much , by nine , at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work ! And with a desperate effort she rises and marches around behind the table , to the calm artist in crochet , who raises his eyes languidly and continues to tangle her worsted . She addresses him : Virginia . Virginia Berkeley Cousin , are you very clever ? Ernest , Ernest Archibaldlanguidly crocheting . Ra-ather ! Virginia . Virginia Berkeley Not exceptionally so , I suppose ? Ernest . Ernest Archibald Not more so than  --  his eye falls on his counters  --  most people . Virginia , Virginia Berkeleyleaning over the back of his chair . Well , if you 're clever at all , tell me why it is I am happy just at this very moment . Ernest , Ernest Archibaldfemininely bored . Oh , dear ! I 'm sure I do n't know . Virginia . Virgi nia Berkeley You do n't ! Well , I 'll tell you . I 'm happy because I have an opportunity of telling you that there are two things about you that I have always admired  --  your eyes . Ernest , Ernest Archibaldin a quiet aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let me lift your hair off your forehead  --  so ! Ah ! you look well so . Fine forehead , well-arched brows  --  how is it I never noticed them before ? Nose  --  straight . Greek type . Ernest . Ernest Archibald These are what you call compliments , I suppose ? Virginia . Virginia Berkeley I 'm always particular in the matter of noses . Let 's see . Chin  --  quite correct . Cheek-bones  --  not too high and not too low . Ernest . Ernest Archibald Sounds like a description for the benefit of the police . Virginia . Virginia Berkeley And your hand  --  quite a lady 's hand . Long and slender  --  and dimples , too ; upon my word , dimples ! Aside Oh , it 's no use . For this broadside of compliments proves a dead failure . The victim lies back in his chair and plies his crochet needles , complacently smiling . So far , he seemingly enjoys being wooed . Virginia sits down on the extreme left and meditates . Her eye lights on the jardinire in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She rises , crosses to the right-hand upper corner , and plucks a rose . Ernest , Ernest Archibaldsuddenly and ferociously . Yow-oo-oo ! Virginia , Virginia Berkeleyat the jardinire . What 's the matter ? Ernest . Ernest Archibald I 've stuck your inf  --  I mean your crochet needle into my hand . Virginia , Virginia Berkeleyunmoved by the catastrophe . Never mind , dear ; go on crocheting . Ernest , Ernest Archibaldaside . Damn crocheting ! Virginia , Virginia Berkeleycrossing back to him . Let me put this in your buttonhole , cousin , there !  --  ah , no ; that 's a little too red . We 'll tone it down . Crossing again to jardinire and back . Here 's a tuberose . Ah ! now you are  --  ravishing ! You are a picture ! Standing off to admire him . Ernest . Ernest Archibald I 'm a daisy , am I ? Virginia . Virginia Berkeley You are  --  oh ! what a daisy you are ! Clasping her hands . Ernest , Ernest Archibaldaside . Guying again ! Let us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Virginia Berkeley What is it now ?

Please  --  send for a doctor . Virginia , Virginia Berkeleywith masculine indifference . Nonsense , my dear child ; you 'll get over it  --  you 'll get over it . Ernest , Ernest Archibaldplaintively . Indeed , I wo n't . I feel worse now . Virginia . Virginia Berkeley Let 's see . Putting her hand on his forehead . Poor dear ! your head is hot  --  absolutely feverish ! Ernest , Ernest Archibaldunwarily . Yes  --  that 's it . Virginia , Virginia Berkeleyseizing her opportunity . Yes , dear .

Aloud Ernest , do you know of what I am thinking ? Ernest . Ernest Archibald Of nothing , probably . Virginia , Virginia Berkeley The impertinent fellow ! Aside , recollecting herself But no . It 's his part . That 's the way we women do . She returns to the attack . No , Ernest , I was thinking of your youth  --  of the happy days when we were children . Have you forgotten them ? Pensively We were always together then . We had no other friends . We lived a life apart from other children . You were my Paul , and I was your Virginia .

Aside What 's all this ? Virginia , Virginia Berkeleynervously . It is not impossible that  --  without knowing it  --  that my heart should cease to be insensible  --  that my laughter of this morning should change to tears before the evening . Even now , it seems to me , I tremble at the thought of the strange game we are playing . What if , in this jest , I should betray myself ? Growing more and more excited .

Virginia , Virginia Berkeleyexploding . And you dared ! You had the audacity ! Ah , now I believe you have been jesting from the first  --  this love you have always expressed  --  it was a jest , too ! Ernest , Ernest Archibaldlanguidly . You do n't think that . Virginia .

I 'm going  --  and I 'll never  --  never  --  see you again ! And she departs , L. U. E. , like a small feminine hurricane . Yet the bang of the door seems to cover something like a sob .

The game is over ! You remember the agreement . I exact strict adherence to the terms therein expressed . From this time until my departure , you are not to whisper one word of love to me . Ernest .

Virginia . Virginia Berkeley Excuse me , sir . You may be doing violence to your feelings in kissing me ; but I insist  --  I have my reasons . At this price I shall be finally freed from your importunities ; you shall fulfill your part of the bargain . Come , sir , treaties are made for the benefit of the victor .
