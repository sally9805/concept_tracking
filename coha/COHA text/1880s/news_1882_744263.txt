txt It is generally supposed , if we may judge from the comments on the subject , that the bill to renew the national bank charters , recently passed by the House , related principally to the currency . But this is not the case . The necessity for immediate action by the House arose partly , but only in part , from the connection of the banks with the currency . There had been such unreasonable delay by Congress that we had entered upon the last year of the charter term of a large number of banks without any provision for the renewal of their charters except that contained in the present law . Under that law it would be quite possible for all the banks to recommence their corporate existence , but they would be obliged to prepare for the redemption of all their outstanding notes by depositing an equal amount of legal tenders or coin in the Treasury . That would have made for a long time a very considerable . and probably dangerous contraction of the currency . But what would have been quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced distribution of the accumulated surplus , amounting to some $128,000,000 , and the liquidation , equally forced , - of the very large amount , over $900 , - 000,000 , of loans outstanding . Thus it will be seen that the bill was quite as necessary to the business community on account of the ordinary business of the banks as on account of the delicate relations which the banks sustain to the circulating medium . But the currency side of the question is , nevertheless , extremely important , and several of the amendments adopted in the House affecting the issue of the notes will undoubtedly be closely scanned in the Senate . The one requiring 90 days ' notice of the intention of depositing legal tenders and withdrawing bonds may be amended in the Senate so as to compel the bank , after giving such a notice , to carry it out and actually deposit the legal tenders . This is a change on which the opinion of bankers should be , and no doubt will be , sought . It does not seem likely to excite any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congressional critics by accepting without hesitation the original House amendment , and have generally behaved in a remarkably moderate and sensible manner , considering that they are " grasping monopolists " and " gold-bugs , " and other 1111-pleasing and disreputable sorts of objectionable , persons . The amendment relieving banks with capital of $150,000 or less from keeping more than $10,000 in bonds is of doubtful effect , and should be very carefully examined . It was adopted in the House after very little discussion , and that little rather superficial , and it seemed to commend itself to the majority mainly as a democratic provision , giving certain privileges to the smaller banks . It affects , however , so large a number of small banks , with so great an aggregate business , that it is suggested that the change may prove a serious one . If it should prove so , it is because the surrender of bonds would lock up currency in the same way that we have referred to in the case of liquidation under existing law . If notice were required of this intention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves . But the manner in which considerations like these are constantly arising shows that the connection between the Government and the banks is , to some extent , an arbitrary one , and interferes with that freedom which , in the long run , might be regarded as the safest , provided the freedom were real and the basis of banking entirely sound . We believe that on examination it will be found that the difficulty lies in the fact that while the Government has taken the most thorough precautions to make the banknotes redeemable , while it has retained in its own hands its own bonds of a face value over 11 per cent , greater than the notes , and while it has assumed the duty of redeeming the notes itself should it become necessary , it has not provided any plan by which the notes are actually redeemed . The very fact of the notes of all banks being equally good one with another in every part of the land and at all times makes their distribution so wide and so varied that it is physically impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and if a bank were to break to-day , its notes , so far from being presented for redemption , would go on circulating until they were worn out , and in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred would be in the hands of people who did not know what bank issued them . In one sense this is an ideal currency , but it is precisely this quality of it which makes the deposit of legal tenders to redeem banknotes practically a locking up of the cur-rency , In the plan submitted by Senator ALLISON for bank-notes not based on bonds the necessity of actual redemption was insisted on , thofigh no definite means of accomplishing it was suggested . In a like plan submitted in his speech of the 16th inst. by Mr. Hirwrrr in the House there is provision for a redemption fund in coin of 10 per cent . to be kept in the Treasury , and it is possible with this fund , the limitation of the issue to 90 per cent . of the capital , and the double lien on the bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that redeemability would be secured . That , again , is a point on which the careful opinion of experienced men should be sought . But it is evident that with the present plan of securing the notes the method of redemption is excessively clumsy and liable to produce bad consequences . if not abuse .
