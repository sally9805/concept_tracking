Well , I 'm glad it 's over . She and Routledge fell out about him , and while he remained here it seemed impossible to know what might happen . West . Lawrence Westbrook Laughing I certainly did not wish the count for a son-in-law ; and I 'm very glad my little girl had too much sense to be caught by his title . His character is not exactly what I like  --  ready to quarrel , a duelist !  --  and seeming to inherit but one ingredient of his ancestors ' chivalry , its courage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Mrs. Fanny Holcomb A better husband  --  who ? West . Lawrence Westbrook John Strebelow . Fanny . Mrs. Fanny Holcomb A noble gentleman , but he is old ; too old for a wife of eighteen . West . Lawrence Westbrook Not forty yet ! Fanny . Mrs. Fanny Holcomb But I 'm sure Lilian loves Harold Routledge . West . Lawrence Westbrook Pshaw ! I 'll bet she has forgotten him already . Boys and girls of eighteen have whims , not love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortable John Holcomb instead of romantic Alfred Harcourt . Yet you made a splendid wife , and a happy one . Fanny . Mrs. Fanny Holcomb Dryly . Sits L.H. Did I ? You judge by what you see , and all you see is the outside ; where a woman is concerned , the blindest thing on earth is a man . West . Lawrence Westbrook Well , well , sister , I 'm not going to sell the girl . We 'll talk of her again  --  after I 've had my breakfast . Exits R.U.D. Fanny . Mrs. Fanny Holcomb Solus Sell the girl ! No , not so much a pound , I suppose , but like other fathers , you 'll supply her a mentor where she wants a husband , and give her a stone where she asks for bread , on the plea that the stone is a diamond .

So you refused him ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , castle , chivalry , and all . It was so very funny to see him . Laughs Fanny . Mrs. Fanny Holcomb Looking at her steadily I thought you would . Lil . Lilian Westbrook You knew I would , when I laughed at him , which was from the door to Mount St. Vincent , and from Mount St. Vincent to the door again . He looked as if he 'd like to call me out . Laughs Fanny . Mrs. Fanny Holcomb This is the fourth offer you have refused in two weeks . Lil . Lilian Westbrook Is it ? I do n't want to marry . I 'm as happy as a lark , and just as gay . I 've done nothing but laugh all the morning . It was such fun . Laughs hysterically Fanny . M rs . Fanny Holcomb Rising and going to her , taking her by the waist Lilian , you are very miserable .

Mrs. Fanny Holcomb Sighing I know , dear ; I know ! Harold Routledge sails for Europe tomorrow . Lil . Lilian Westbrook Sobbing I 've tried so hard  --  so hard to forget him . I sent him back our engagement ring . I 've done all I could to drive him from my mind . I stayed up half the night , reading all his letters before I  --  I b  --  burned them . Fanny . Mrs. Fanny Holcomb My poor darling , listen to me ; I lost my poor Alfred just in the same way ! Do n't repeat my mistake ; write to Harold ; tell him to come to you . Lil . Lilian Westbrook Rising and crossing to R. quickly Never ! never ! If my heart were to break a thousand times over , I would not do that . It is his place to write to me . He was in the wrong .

Lilian Westbrook Demurely But , Aunt Fanny , he must not think I asked you to write . Fanny . Mrs. Fanny Holcomb Smiling Certainly not . Crossing to R. Lil . Lilian Westbrook And you 'll tell him I refused three other offers ! Fanny . Mrs. Fanny Holcomb Smiling Indeed I will . Lil . Lilian Westbrook And  --  ask him to  --  to call and see  --  and see you ! Fanny . Mrs. Fanny Holcomb Exactly . Lil . Lilian Westbrook Takes Fanny 's head in her hands and kisses it Oh , you darling , good aunt ! Fanny .

Lil . Lilian Westbrook You 'll let me see it ? Fanny . Mrs. Fanny Holcomb Certainly not . It is none of your business , you know . Laughs Lil . Lilian Westbrook With frank , hearty laugh this time Ah  --  oh ! Of course not  --  I forgot  --  I 'm so happy . Fanny . Mrs. Fanny Holcomb Heaven grant you may continue so , my darling . Exits R.U.D. , R.2.E . Lil . Lilian Westbrook Solus Will he come ? In affected doubt I rather think he will . I wonder how my eyes look  --  Goes to glass on mantel , L.H. Looks at herself ; touches up her hair ; turns from mirror I am pretty sure he will come . Enter Florence St. Vincent R.C.R. Flor . Florence St. Vincent Brown How de doo , Lilian ? Lil .

Lilian Westbrook To Mr. Brown ! Why , he is nearly seventy ! Flor . Florence St. Vincent Brown Exactly sixty-nine the twenty-eighth of last February . He says he 's only fifty-nine , but I know better . I would not marry him if he were only fifty-nine ; fifty-two years between us . There always ought to be some difference , you know . Lil . Lilian Westbrook Surely , Florence , you are not serious ; your father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florence St. Vincent Brown My father is delighted ! It is not every man that has a son-in-law old enough to be his father-in-law . My youngest son will be thirty-eight years old . When the minister pronounces me Mr. Brown 's wife , I 'll be a grandmother . Laughs One of my granddaughters is nearly as old as I am already . Brown is a millionaire three times over at least . Father is president of a life insurance company , and he knows about such things . He says the average life over seventy is about five years ; allow five years more , for untoward accident ; ten years , I 'll be only twenty-nine . That 's young , you know , for a rich widow . Lil . Lilian Westbrook Oh , Florence ! Marriage is not a joke . Flor . Florence St. Vincent Brown Then I should like to know what it is . Laughs I have n't been able to keep my face straight five minutes at a time since I told old Brown I 'd be his wife . Laughs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll speak to Mr. Westbrook , sir . Exits R.U.D.

Returns note to Westbrook West . Lawre nce Westbrook But  --  Bab . Babbage In great agitation Damn me , but I 'd rather see the firm of Babbage &; Westbrook go to the devil , than see the happiness of that girl sacrificed to it . Besides , your daughter , like your house , is encumbered . West . Lawrence Westbrook What do you mean ? Bab . Babbage I mean that Harold Routledge holds a mortgage on the property . West . Lawrence Westbrook But Lilian and Mr. Routledge have had a serious disagreement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A woman never quarrels with a man she does not love , and damn it , never tires of quarrelling with the man she does love . You have been married  --  I am married , we both know it . Enter Footman R.U.D. West . Lawrence Westbrook Let Miss Lilian know I wish to see her without delay . Foot . Footman Yes , sir . Exits R.U.D. West . Lawrence Westbrook I take a different view of my daughter 's happiness . I can hardly hope to avert the terrible calamity you announce through the wealth of Mr. Strebelow , though it may possibly so turn out . I certainly shall not ask him for a check convertible tomorrow in exchange for my daughter 's hand ; but with John Strebelow her future is safe , whatever comes to us . To give her to such a man is not to sacrifice , but to shield her from the storm . This is what I wish to do . If you care to hear the result , I will join you presently in the sitting room . Bab . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the credit of Babbage &; Westbrook can not be saved without the sacrifice of a young girl 's heart , I 'd rather see it crumpled to the dust , and act as assistant bookkeeper to a peanut stand for the rest of my natural life .

Lil . Lilian Westbrook With calmness evidently voiced So old a friend can not be otherwise than welcome . Streb . John Strebelow I was in hopes your father had placed me in a more  --  I mean a different light than that of a mere friend . Lil . Lilian Westbrook My father has handed me your note , Mr. Strebelow .

Lawrence Westbrook Embarrassed Certainly  --  certainly . Streb .

Florence St. Vincent Brown The Prince de Browne is in his usual health ; that is , he has the gout ; he is coming upstairs now . Brown has the gout in its most aristocratic form .

To Strebelow But with a man of your age and mine , you know , Strebelow turns to hide a laugh as Florence nudges Westbrook the energy and elasticity of nature soon overcome its force .

Harold Routledge Seated L. of R. table The resemblance is purely accidental . Seeing Mrs. Strebelow now after six years , I must admit that it does exist . I knew Mrs. Strebelow in our young days , and I dare say that memory unconsciously took the place of inspiration . Caro .

You recollect the scandal caused by his picture of the young Marquise de Pauliac ? Flor . Florence St. Vincent Brown Quickly crossing to R.C. A scandal about a marquise . Oh , do tell it . Strebelow down L.C. Mont . M. de Montvillais It is said that Rabiteau fell in love with her during her sittings , and she with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich old nobleman instead of to a poor artist . Rabiteau had his revenge . He bestowed upon her face an expression that seemed to tell the story . Flor . Florence St. Vincent Brown Eagerly What story ? Mont . M. de Montvillais The story of a broken heart . Of a woman bearing in her bosom a secret that must not live , yet can not die . A sadder story than that of the Spartan boy who let the cub eat his heart out ere he would reveal its guilty presence beneath his tunic . Some memory of this may have guided Rabiteau 's pencil , suggested by a passing look on Mrs. Strebelow 's face  --  a look of sorrow at the premature crushing of a new bonnet , perhaps , which memory idealized . Florence goes to Lilian . Lilian holds Florence as if for support . Harold 's eyes and hers meet . She turns away her head Streb .

But tell me you forgive me  --  for her sake  --  for her sake ! Streb . John Strebelow I have nothing to forgive but my blindness . I should have thought for both . I will do so now .

John Strebelow Rising and following her Do you not know your own heart ? Do n't sob so ; be calm . Lil . Lilian Westbrook I did love Harold Routledge , I believe , with the love of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engagement . I wrote him to come back to me the very day I accepted you .

Piteously What could I do ? He went away , and we were married . Regret at the pain the sudden blow must have given him remained with me long ; but our Natalie was born  --  my heart turned to her  --  to  --  Streb . John Strebelow I understand . Lil . Lilian Westbrook I could not understand . I never did ! Your kind love , your watchfulness , your devotion won upon my mother 's heart , but I feared to show it .

At rise of curtain , Babbage and Westbrook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bab . Babbage The papers are all right , old boy . This one is mine , and that one yours .

It takes but a single clip to cut the longest chain . Wipes his eyes West . Lawrence Westbrook In evident emotion , shakes hands with Babbage Staunch friend and partner of thirty years , I  --  I  --  Bab . Babbage That 's all right , Westbrook , all right . Do n't mind me . I 'm a stupid old fool , I suppose . Here goes ! Signs the papers in turn , hands one to Westbrook , putting the other in his pocket West . Lawrence Westbrook And now  --  Bab .

A number one , two copper-fastened , iron-bound , solid business men . Is that success ? West . Lawrence Westbrook If figures never lie ? Bab . Babbage Hm ! Figures are the biggest liars in the world . Give a boy a one dollar bill and tell him to multiply the amount of happiness he can get out of it by two millions five hundred thousand . He will hardly believe that you and I envy him the happiness he extracts from the first ten cents he spends , knowing he has enough left for the circus and all the side shows . Heigh-ho !

Lawrence Westbrook Reading outside of paper A warrantee deed to Lilian Westbrook Strebelow ! Opens paper , glances over it Grand Street property ! My dear Babbage , what do you mean ? This property is worth over half a million . We allowed that much for it in the division of our assets . Bab . Babbage It 's only the odd half million , old boy . You and I own five millions of dollars between us . Take it , Larry . Forgive me for bringing it up . But  --  but it 's been on my conscience for the last nine years . By rights , we owe it all to Lilian , poor girl ! I know it is n't money she needs . She has enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing but money to give her . It wo n't help her any , I know , but it may help to ease my conscience a little . It 's only the odd half million , Larry . West . Lawrence Westbrook Much affected Ah , old friend and wise partner , you seem better than I. Bab . Babbage There , there , old fellow , forgive me for bringing it up . But how is she today ? West . Lawrence Westbrook Just as she was yesterday , as she was last week , last month , last year , as she has been every day since John Strebelow gave her back to me in Paris with the words : " Take back your daughter , Mr. Westbrook and be it your task to soften to her memories of the past you made for her and me . " You know how I brought her home ; how John Strebelow made her practically mistress of the bulk of his fortune , now settled on their child ; how since then he has resided in Rome . I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Count de Carojac . Bab . Babbage And he never writes to you ? West . Lawrence Westbrook Never . But I believe he corresponds regularly with Fanny Holcomb . Oh , Babbage , had I but heeded your warning on that dreadful day ! Bab . Babbage We should not be sharing five millions today , but I should feel a happier and a better man . West . Lawrence Westbrook I 'd give every penny of it to bring Harold Routledge back to life , to compensate John Strebelow . Bab . Babbage The latter , at all events , is possible . West . Lawrence Westbrook How ? Bab . Babbage Listen . Just as sure as John Strebelow loves your daughter , just as sure your daughter now loves him , and hungers for him today . West . Lawrence Westbrook Would to heaven it were true . Bab . Babbage It is true . Since we commenced winding up our business , I have been here every day . I have repeatedly seen Lilian and Natalie together . I never heard them talk that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lilian did not tell the child how great and good her father is . Natalie writes to him regularly ; and Lilian oversees the correspondence . West . Lawrence Westbrook Eagerly How do you know this ? Bab . Babbage About a month ago , the day that Illinois Central bounded up to ninety-two and tumbled back to eighty-seven , Natalie came to me with a curious little letter in her hand , the day Perkins &; Johnson went under , you know , short on Erie and Wabash ; Pacific Mail went clean out of sight . Natalie asked me to put a little picture , as she called the stamp , on her letter and drop it into the box that goes to Rome . The letter was addressed to John Strebelow . It is exactly five weeks ago . Take my word for it , Lilian is trying to woo her husband , and the child is writing the love letters . West . Lawrence Westbrook Heaven grant it . But , Babbage  --  Holding out paper Bab . Babbage Well ? West . Lawrence Westbrook This gift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have my own way about that , old boy . It is a private speculation of my own .

Neat , is n't it ? Madame Raypangsay is so very artistic ! It is a very delicate matter for a dressmaker to guide a young widow through the various stages of her affliction with good taste : absolute wretchedness , deep grief , profound melancholy , Christian resignation , sentimental sadness . Bab . Babbage I trust your physician has hopes of yet pulling you through ? Flor . Florence St. Vincent Brown The immediate danger is past . First , he prescribed retirement from the world .
