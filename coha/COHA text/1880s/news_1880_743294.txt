txt Among recent inventions , there is none that has been welcomed by the public with more enthusiasm and hopefulness than the barber 's muzzle . As its name suggests , its design is to put an end to the terrible conversational powers of the barber , which devastate the civilized world , and , as POPE forcibly said , " make countless millions swear . " The barber 's muzzle is a light and easily portable machine , made of the best steel , and exceedingly strong . It is designed to be fastened by a strap upon the mouth of the barber , and when once in place prevents him from making the slightest articulate sound .. To be shaved by a barber thus securely muzzled would be a safe and , to a great extent , a painless operation , and were it brought into general use the deathrate in our large cities and the number of annual lunatics would be greatly decreased . The new muzzle is recommended by several distinguished scientific persons whose opinion is certainly ' entitled to respect . Prof. Harkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Your barber 's muzzle is a beautiful and valuable invention , which should be applied to every barber in the . land , " the Oshkosh Board of Health says : " We have tried it in our city , and the result has been a decrease of 11 per cent . in the weekly return of sudden and mysterious deaths ; " and the editor of the Winfield Bugle exclaims , with enthusiasm : " Go on in your noble work . ' The man who can muzzle one barber where two were unmuzzled before is a priceless benefactor of his race . " These are strong recommendations ; but , in spite of them , it is not yet certain that the plan of muzzling barbers is either practicable or desirable . It is a matter of history that certain able and ingenious rats once patelited a plan for defense against the . machinations of a particularly dangerous cat . A bell was procurred which was to be attached to the tail of the cat , whereby she would involuntarily give warning of her approach and enable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass-meeting of rats had adopted by acclamation a resolution approving warmly of this scheme , when tin aged rat of vast experience east a gloom over the assembly by asking by whom the : bell was to be attached to the cat . Now , there is no doubt that the barber 's muzzle will put an end to his conversation if it is placed over his mouth , but the question arises , who is to put the muzzle in position ? Of course , the barber will not muzzle himself , and , equally of course , ho will not meekly permit his customers to muzzle him . We thus perceive the weak point in the plan of muzzling the barbers . They will decline to be muzzled , and hence the ingenious muzzle will prove to be practically useless . Moreover , if we concede , for the sake of argument , that it is practicable to muzzle barbers , nevertheless , it may be boldly asserted that it is undesirable . There are circumstances in which it is necessary that the barber should have the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cry out : " Next gen'leman ! " or to remark : " Take a seat , Sir . Be ready for you in a moment , Sir . " It is also , in many eases , desirable , though not strictly necessary , that he should be permitted to ask . if his customers will have their hair trimmed short , or if they habitually wear it brushed behind or in front of their ears . The muzzled barber could ask none of these questions , and the result would be unsatisfactory and even worse . Without in the slightest degree underestimating the frightful consequences of unrestrained conversation by barbers , it may be assumed that were barbers to be strictly muzzled , we should soon find that we had merely substituted one evil for another . What is really needed is not a muzzle , but a sort of conversational brake , which can be applied by the customer whenever the barber 's freedom of speech verges upon license , and he betrays a tendency to indulge in the fatal conversation which has produced such wide-spread misery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the customer , who ? must be able to apply or release it instantaneously . Precisely how it shall be constructed and operated are matters of detail which may be safely left to the ingenuity of American inventors . When they distinctly understand the general nature of the required machine , they will probably be able to construct it in such a way as to render it readily available for the desired purpose . But the conversational brake is not along sufficient to render the barber innocuous . It would draw , so to speak , only one of his fangs . His power to talk his customers to the verge of death or insanity would vanish , . but his awful " tonic " would remain . He could not , indeed , urge it upon the public with words , but he could still hold it up in front of his customers , and . compel them to try it at the edge of the razor . The distinguished men who have recommended the barber 's muzzle seem to have entirely overlooked the fact that it does not pretend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be but little choice between tonic and conversation . The latter is more immediately fatal to mind and body , but the former , perhaps , produces more real suffering . There are men who have squandered fortunes in buying bottles of tonic which they hated and despised , at the request of barbers . There are thousands of young men who are prematurely bald and whose brains are slowly softening through the daily applications of a hundred different varieties of tonic . Philanthropists band themselves into societies to prevent the sale of ardent spirits , and the law regulates , with the strictest provisions , the sale of dynamite , but there is no law to suppress the tonic that depletes at once the pocket and the hair , and our philanthropists watch its devastations without lifting their voices in protest . ? Though the barber 's muzzle will suiely disappoint the hopes to which it has given rise , ? ts appearance in the market is , nevertheless , a hopeful sign . It shows that our inventors are aware of the giant evil of the age . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men to devise a more practicable remedy against the conversation of barbers , and . in time we shall see a great popular uprising against tonic , which will sweep that potent agency of evil from our fair land . When the day comes in which barbers cease to chatter and tonic is unknown , we shall be not far distant from paradise .
