FIVE chiefs of the woman-suffrage movement have joined forces to answer the article on " The Woman Question " in the " North American " for October . Their answer evades most of the points presented by us , repeats a series of well-known fallacies , and rests on a general base of argument which we had affirmed to be unsound and which the critics do not try to vindicate . We shall not follow them in detail , for the task of refuting their special errors is as needless as it would be easy . We will only classify some of their principal failings , and then touch in particular on such of the rest as may suggest a moral or serve as a text for observations on the subject in hand . They condemn all our reasons at once by saying that they are not original , which is perfectly true . What we wrote is nothing but an expression of the convictions , more or less distinctly shaped , of the great majority of sensible and thoughtful persons of both sexes . It is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has roused this coalition against it . The critics on their part stand only for themselves and the small following that they represent . Their reasons have all been familiar to many of us for a generation or more . We looked with interest through all the thirty-two pages of their fivefold philippic to find some fresh thought to enlarge or correct , as the case might be , our own ideas ; but we could see nothing but the same well-remembered faces . The company , it is true , had changed positions . Some , once conspicuous in the front , now kept in the background ; such , for instance , as the fair form of the " Purification of Politics by Woman , " whom we missed altogether till we descried her at last in a modest corner . On the other hand , there were some promotions in the group . Advocates of woman suffrage have never been backward in praising the private virtues of their sex ; but on this occasion they have // given them unusual prominence . In this , though their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them ; for we hold that these so-called private virtues , which in fact exercise an indirect but most powerful public influence , can not be extolled too highly . We denied , however , that these virtues could be transported into political life without losing their beneficent influence , and we maintained that , in the scramble of American politics , the worst and not the best side of women 's character would be thrown to the front . It was for our critics to show the contrary , and this they have entirely failed to do . They expatiate on the admirable qualities of women as mothers , teachers , hospital nurses , dispensers of charity , guides to taste , elevators and purifiers of society , and holders of a mighty power under and behind the superficial world ; but they neglect to show , what is alone to the purpose , that women under indiscriminate suffrage would be a useful or at least a harmless element in politics . One of them complains that we say nothing of Miss Florence Nightingale and other excellent women of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days of Montespan and Pompadour . We were giving examples of vicious female politicians ; but we did not mention either Montespan , Pompadour , or any other mistresses of sovereigns , because such instances would have been unjust . We might with great advantage have called attention to Miss Nightingale and her fellow workers , for cases like theirs are on our side . They were in no sense political women . It was in private life , *rithout seats in Parliament , and without votes to give seats to others , that they exercised their great and beneficent influence . Another of the critics , a gentleman of undoubted eloquence , pleads our cause in the following glowing tribute to the social power of women : " Take society , the only field where the sexes have ever met on terms of equality , the arena where character is formed and studied , the cradle and the realm of public opinion , the crucible of ideas , the world 's university , at once a school and a theatre , the spur and the crown of ambition , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power that gives government leave to be , and outruns the lazy Church in fixing the moral sense of the age . Who shall fitly describe the lofty place of this element in the history of the last three centuries ? And yet this is the realm of woman  --  the throne which like a conqueror she first founded and then filled . " Then why dethrone her and drag her down to the dirty ropes and wheels of the political machine ? The gentleman // himself has answered the question , for he says : " None so simple as to dream that we are increasing the influence of woman . That is already omnipotent. lYe would rather lessen it . " Therefore , he continues , " we do not only claim her right to vote , but e*eact it of her as a duty . " We may notice , by the way , that the critics differ strangely as to the reasons for demanding the ballot and the sort of improvement it is to bring about . While one thinks that women are " omnipotent , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote , others cry with emotion that they are slaves , whose shackles the ballot must strike off . One will have it that they are all-powerful sovereigns , and another likens them to the most helpless and degraded of the human race . Another trait of our critics is the skill with which they muster enemies into their service . Dr. Johnson is quoted in support of ideas which he would have spurned with wrath and scorn . Franklin is called to testify in behalf of what he would have regarded as absurdity . But the boldest invocation is to St. Paul , whose authority is cited in favor of " equal freedom for either sex . " We beg our critics to ponder the following text , in which the Apostle to the Gentiles sets forth his views : " Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection . But I suffer not a woman to teach , nor to usurp authority over the man , but to be in silence . " More than this he utters to the like effect , insomuch that certain friends of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been moved to reject and denounce not only St. Paul , but Christianity itself . Several of the five colleagues have found it convenient to quote us as saying what we did not say , and then denounce us for saying it . Sometimes the words ascribed to us are inclosed in quotationmarks , and sometimes their alleged meaning only is given . As one critic says that she has rehearsed our arguments " breathlessly , " we assume that breathlessness is answerable for these mistakes . Therefore we will stop to notice but one instance , and that , too , one in which we are quoted with entire verbal correctness . This is the quotation : " Many women will sell themselves ; many more would sell their votes . Three fourths of them , when not urged by some pressing need or contagious passion , would be moved not by principles but by personal predilections . " As we used these words they mean one thing ; as our critic uses them they mean another . We applied them to coarse and ignorant masses of women , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to apply them to the // flower of her sex ; and for so doing she holds us up to reprobation . Yet , though their sense is perverted , they are , as we have said , our very words . For this we are the more grateful , because our attention has been called to a recent number of a radical journal , of which the critic in question is an editress , and in which appeared a notice of our article bearing her initials and containing the following passage : " Mr. Parkman says if women had political rights three fourths of them would sell their charms ' to influence votes , and those who have no charms of their own will easily be aUc to use those of young girls . ' " The words italicized by us are inclosed in quotation-marks by the editress of the journal , and affirmed to be ours . She then comments bitterly upon them . The question is , where she got them . On examination the passage in quotation-marks proves to be made up as follows : First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North American " ; secondly , four words which we never used ; thirdly , nine words taken with variations from page 317 ; and , lastly , ten words which we never used ; and these fragments are so combined as to express views repugnant to decency and common sense . Now nothing is more effective in discussion than to hold up the opposing party as both vicious and absurd ; and herein we may congratulate our critic on an encouraging measure of success , for the foundling she has laid at our door has been widely exhibited through the popular press . Yet the advantages of her method are not unmixed , as it is less suggestive than could be wished of the " Purification of Politics by Woman. ** We have given categories of some of our critics ' weaknesses . Special cases remain in abundance ; and we will call attention to a few that may be worth noting . They say that , as a result of the total separation of feminine qualities and power from the sphere of government , the nations of the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this total separation has not existed . There have been queens and other feminine rulers of every degree of power , and some of the most atrocious of wars have been their work , from the days of Semiramis downward . Considering their opportunities , political women have achieved their full share of bloodshed and misery . The critics lay much stress on the case of Wyoming as supporting their views ; but the evidence here is contradictory , and that which seems most in their favor comes from successful candidates // who owed their election to female votes . Even if we accept it , it proves little or nothing in the embryonic condition of that thinly peopled Territory . That woman suffrage , even in Wyoming , is not a success , is argued by the fact that it has been found necessary to drop women from service on juries . Neither can any safe inference be drawn from the action of the English law permitting such women as hold property which there is no man to represent to vote in municipal elections . An eminent member of Parliament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor of a limited woman suffrage , but had ceased to do so because of the conduct , indecent in more senses than one , of the female remonstrants against the Contagious Diseases Act . Again , one of the chief arguments of the critics is , that government without the consent of the governed is opposed to inalienable right . But most women , including those of the best capacity and woi'th , fully consent that their fathers , husbands , brothers , or friends shall be their political representatives ; and no exhortation or teasing has induced them to withhold their consent . Nor is this surprising ; for a woman is generally represented in a far truer and more intimate sense by her male relative than is this relative by the candidate to whom he gives his vote , commonly without knowing him , and often with dissent from many of his views . Nothing is more certain than that women will have the suffrage if they ever want it ; for when they want it , men will give it to them regardless of consequences . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the wishes of the other sex is a national trait in America , though whether it would survive the advent of the female politician is matter for reflection . We venture to remind those who demand woman suffrage as a right , that , even if it were so , the great majority of intelligent women could judge for themselves whether to exercise it , better than the few who assume to teach them their duty . Here a question suggests itself . A small number of women have spent their time for several decades in ceaseless demands for suffrage , but they have lost their best argument in failing to show that they are prepared to use the franchise when they have got it . A single sound and useful contribution to one side or the other of any question of current politics  --  the tariff , specie payments , the silver bill , civil-service reform , railroad monopoly , capital and labor , or a half score of other matters-would have done more for their cause than years of empty agitation . Some of them have taken a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write a female orator is reported to be " stumping " the State of New York in behalf of the candidate who represents what is most corrupt in machine politics ; but stump-speaking needs nothing but assurance , fluency , and good lungs . What we want on the part of these reformers is , some little evidence of an inclination to study questions of government , and ability to form rational opinions upon them . Once more , the critics say that no reason can be given why women should not take a direct part in politics , except that they have never done so . There are other reasons and strong ones in abundance . But this particular one is nevertheless good . All usages , laws , and institutions have risen and perished , and risen and perished again . Their history is the history of mutability itself . But , from the earliest records of mankind down to this moment , in every race and every form or degree of civilization or barbarism , the relative position of the sexes has been essentially the same , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they only prove the rule . Such permanence in the foundation of society , while all that rests upon it has passed from change to change , is proof in itself that this foundation lies deep in the essential nature of things . It is idle to prate of the old time that has passed away and the new time that is coming . The " new time " can no more stir the basis of human nature than it can stop the movement of the earth . The cause of this permanence is obvious . Women have great special tasks assigned them in the work of life , and men have not . To these tasks their whole nature , moral and physical , is adjusted . There is scarcely a distinctive quality of women that has not a direct or indirect bearing upon them . Everything else in their existence is subordinated to the indispensable functions of continuing and rearing the human race ; and , during the best years of life , this work , fully discharged , leaves little room for any other . Rightly considered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is the root and stem of national existence , while the occupations of men are but the leaves and branches . On women of the intelligent and instructed classes depends the future of the nation . If they are sound in body and mind , impart this soundness to a numerous offspring , and rear them to a sense of responsibility and duty , there are no national evils that we can not overcome . If they fail to do this their part , then the masses of the coarse and unintelligent , always of rapid increase , will overwhelm us and our institutions . When these indispensable duties are fully discharged , then the suf // frage agitators may ask with better grace , if not with more reason , that they may begin to share the political work of men . Yet an element of revolt against these absolute conditions of human existence is one of the motive powers of the so-called woman's-rights movement . Such revolt , in whatever quarter and from whatever source it arises , carries with it the germ of its own destruction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the great law of increase will be overborne by those who are true to it , whether native or foreign , of high or low degree . The race of the offenders will fade and perish , and others will take their places . Nothing is more obvious than that many of the suffrage agitators are impatient of purely feminine work , and eager to imitate men ; and even those who are most forward to disclaim this imitation are apt to give practical contradiction to their words . Some of the enthusiasts among them regard the object of their longing , the ballot , as the destined agent of a sort of miracle in nature . The most pronounced case of this sort that we know is that of two maiden ladies who insist that , after a few years of voting , women will be as large and strong as men , and like them in other respects . A disposition to ignore differences of sex is so common that few persons can fail to observe it . Sometimes it takes curious forms . A few days ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Being on the examining board of a school in a country town , he asked the pupils what was meant by gender in nouns and pronouns . As they could not answer , he looked to the teacher for explanation , whereupon she said , with flushed cheeks and some sharpness , " Nothing is taught about gender in tkis school ! " We might continue indefinitely to comment on the positions of our critics ; but what is of more importance is to note some of the reasons that cause a certain number of excellent women to feel doubts as to whether they ought not to desire the suffrage . But , first , we beg to observe , that the fact of the capacities of women being different from those of men is no argument that they are less . As we would not have men do the work of women , so neither would we have women do the work of men ; though , as we once said before , there is much work that both can do-since their different domains are not separated by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we say that women are not suited to the sphere of government or of war , we limit them no more than we limit men when we *ay that they are unfit for many beneficent and noble employments // for which women are admirably suited . To say that the capacities of women are universal when those of men notoriously are not , is to say that women are the superiors of men . Many women of sense and intelligence are influenced by the fact that the woman-suffrage movement boasts itself a movement of progress , and by a wish to be on the liberal or progressive side . But the boast is unfounded . Progress , to be genuine , must be in accord with natural law . If it is not , it ends in failure and in retrogression . To give women a thorough and wholesome training both of body and mind ; to prepare such of them as have strength and opportunity for various occupations different from what they usually exercise , and above all for the practice of medicine , in which we believe that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious views of life and its responsibilities-are all in the way of normal and healthy development : but to plunge them into politics , where they are not needed and for which they are unfit , would be scarcely more a movement of progress than to force them to bear arms and fight . Others are influenced by the idea that to take a direct part in political affairs would have a steadying and sobering effect on women , as they suppose that it has had on men . But , if we except ancient democracies and mediaeval communes , both of which were notoriously unsteady and turbulent , men in general , or " the people , " took no part in politics till comparatively recent times , and there are nations even now where they continue to take none . Yet men were fully as steady and sober without politics as with them . Indeed , they are seldom less steady and sober than when under the influence of party politics . What really steadies them is the weight of responsibility and care involved in providing for the wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the exceptional women on whom like responsibilities are thrown by the death , illness , or misconduct of husbands , or by any other cause . In the better kind of women there is a form of self-sacrifice which , between the course that is agreeable and the course that is repugnant , disposes them to think that they ought to choose the latter . They have a feeling that because it is unpleasant it must be right . Many a woman is moved by this feeling who would be unmoved by temptation in the shape of ease or pleasure . Simply because her nature revolts from politics , she can not entirely rid he*-* self of an idea that it is her duty to take part in them . The inherited spirit of Puritanism may sometimes have a part in this illusion , // but it is chiefly due to the spirit of self-sacrifice beguiling conscience and judgment . Most of the matters with which government properly concerns itself , such as finance , agriculture , manufactures , tariffs , transportation , and war , are matters with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealing with which femJni.i*ne qualities have no particular place ; but there are some other subjects , also within the sphere of government , of which this can not be said . Chief among them are women 's prisons , reform-schools , and above all education . In this last many women are engaged , and all who have charge of children are directly interested in it . It is a subject on which they are rightfully and reasonably entitled to be heard , and it is very desirable that women of character and judgment should be heard . Therefore a recent law of Massachusetts empowers women to vote for members of school committees . Some of those who favored this measure certainly did so with a single eye to its ostensible object ; but those most forward to urge it were , as some of them openly avow , impelled by the hope that it would be an " entering wedge " of female political suffrage . Their tactics were to get the law passed , and then to tell other women that because it was passed it was their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be wished that women of sense and character should share in the conduct of schools , we do not believe that this is the way to accomplish the object . As soon as women at large can be induced to use the new right , ignorance and folly will rush in precisely where there is most need of shutting them out ; and sectarianism and Rome will reap their harvest at the expense of the pure interests of education . In short , those who favor this law without ulterior objects have sown a choking crop of tares with their wheat . We believe that the less women vote under it , and the sooner it is repealed , the better for everybody but the would-be female politicians . Such women as ought to influence education can do so , if they will , powerfully and without danger , by combined action from without . An American school committee would not disregard the suggestions of a body of women of recognized character , knowledge , and good intentions ; and , even if they did , public opinion and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason . In the present state of American politics men themselves can often influence public action better from without than from within . There is another motive , strongest with the best women , that may incline some of them to wish for a direct part in government . // It arises from that unhappy condition of a part of their sex which forms the most deplorable and most difficult problem with which humanity has to deal . But to introduce the social evil into party politics in a country governed by indiscriminate suffrage of both men and women , would be a calamity worse than the civil war . It would be to open sewers and cesspools , and poison the air with moral typhoid . Other questions of sex , as marriage , **yjorce and " free love , " would rush in with it . All that is foulest in the depths of society and the darkest lurking-places of the human heart would be stirred to infectious activity . Of this we have already seen premonitions . The evil is one against which any but the most careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increases or diminishes with changing social conditions , which laws can not control . It is not a subject to be dragged into popular assemblies or popular newspapers . Only the wisest and best of both sexes are fit to deal with it , and neither can deal with it alone . It is too complex , and presents alternatives too perplexing and too grave , not to require the most calm as well as most earnest deliberation . The hope of good lies in organized discussion in private , carefully maturing measures to be presented in a definite form , sustained by a weight of character free from every suspicion . In reading our five critics , a few considerations present themselves which deserve a moment 's attention . We have observed already that they rarely try to answer the reasons we have given against woman suffrage . In fact , they pass our chief positions by , silent and on tiptoe , as if they were lairs of lynxes , catamounts , wolverenes , or tiger-cats . Nevertheless , there is one brief remark of ours on which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We observed that the right to vote should not be separated from the ability to fight ; whereupon rises a general acclaim of reprobation , and our views are denounced as obsolete , mediaeval , and otherwise reprehensible . One critic feels that we are led astray by " that imaginary relation between two circumstances which leads the incautious thinker to link them together as cause and effect . " Another gives us some really curious statistics , tending to show that the professional classes have less bodily strength than the laboring classes , and that clergymen , in particular , are weak in the arm of flesh . Interesting as these statistics are , they have very little to do with the matter in hand ; and the remarks which follow on the hospital-work of women , and the // dangers of child .. bearing , have nothing to do with it whatever . It is singular that not one of our critics appears to see in the least the bearings of the proposition they denounce ; whence it may fairly be inferred that they have given no attention to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect justice that they do not care for what is practical ; yet it might have been well to look more closely at the positions of the opponent , if only that they might condemn him with knowledge of cause . The human race consists of two equal parts , the combatant and the non-combatant , and these parts are separated by the line of sex . It is true that some men are permanently disabled from fighting , and others may be disabled in one year or one mouth , and fit to bear arms in the next ; but the general fact remains , that men are the fighting half of humanity , and women are not . Fundamental laws are made in reference to aggregates of persons , and not to individual exceptions ; and it would be absurd to exact a surgeon 's certificate of military competency from every voter at the polls . It is enough that he belongs to a body which , as a whole , can and will fight . The question remains , What has this to do with voting ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above all in a government purely popular . Since history began no government ever sustained itself long unless it could command the physical force of the nation ; and this , whether the form of government was despotism , constitutional monarchy , or democracy . The despot controls the army which compels the people to obey ; the king and parliament control the force of the kingdom , and malcontents dare not rise in insurrection till they think they have drawn away an equal or greater share of it . Finally , the majority in a democratic republic feels secure that its enactments will take effect , because the defeated minority , even if it does not respect law , will respect a force greater than its own . But suppcse the majority to consist chiefly of women . Then legality would be on one side and power on the other . The majority would have the law , and the minority the courage and strength . Hence , in times of political excitement , when passions were roused and great interests were at stake , the majority , that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a standing army . Without such support the possession of the suffrage by the non-combatant half of the nation would greatly increase the chances of civil discord . Once in our history a minority rose against the majority , in the belief that it could outfight it . This would happen often if the // minority , as in the supposed case of woman suffrage , had not only the belief but the certainty that it could master the majority . It may not be creditable to human nature that if we would have a stable government it is necessary to keep the balance of power on the side of law ; but the business of government is to shape itself to the actual and not the ideal or millennial condition of mankind . There is another reason why the giving of the suffrage to women would tend to civil discord . In the politics of the future , the predominant if not the engrossing questions will be to all appearance those of finance and the relations of labor and capital . From the nature of their occupations , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these matters , and not well fitted to deal with them . They require an experience , a careful attention , a deliberation and coolness of judgment , and a freedom from passion , so rare that at the best their political treatment is full of difficulty and danger . If these qualities are rare in men , they are still more so in women , and feminine instinct will not in the present case supply their place . The peculiar danger of these questions is , that they raise class animosities , and tend to set the poor against the rich and the rich against the poor . They become questions of social antagonism . Now , most of us have had occasion to observe how strong the social rivalries and animosities of women are . They far exceed those of men . If , in the strife between labor and capital , which , without great self-restraint on both si*fVes , is likely to be a fierce one , women should be called to an active part , the effect would be like throwing pitch and resin into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring into the contest a wrathful jealousy and hate against the wives and daughters of the rich , far more vehement than the corresponding passions in their husbands and brothers . Another bad effect of extending suffrage to women would be to reduce each ballot to half its present value . The value of each is according to the influence it carries with it ; and the voter who feels his share of influence cut down one half is apt to feel his interest in the discharge of political duties diminished in similar proportion . A closely limited male suffrage brings nearly every voter to the polls ; under a universal male suffrage many fail to come , and their carelessness would redouble if the suffrage were diluted again by admitting all the women ; or , so to speak , if political stocks were watered till they were worth just one half to each stockholder . Then the office-seekers and their tools would be as busy as // ever ; while disinterested citizens would feel it hardly worth while to contribute their diminished mite to the result of an election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mean and the grasping . One of our critics thinks that , because we admit that our present political condition is bad , we ought to call upon women , high and low , to try their hands in it . But the fact that it is bad is no reason for making it worse . This last remark will pass , no doubt , as an effect of that " distrustful solicitude " which one of our critics contrasts with the more manly hopefulness " that " trusts all the virtue of the community to take care of all the vice of the community , " the moral being that indiscriminate suffrage should be given to women without looking too closely to consequences . But has the virtue of communities always taken care of their vice ? lias not the world been filled with triumphant wrong ; and have republics and democracies never fallen into anarchy and despotism ? What makes and saves nations is not the blind and fatuitous security which our friend calls " manly hopefulness , " an imbecile confidence that walks with eyes turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mire . That faith is manly which can see as well as dare , not that which dares because it can not see . It is by such manhood that liberties are won-by watching , forecast , and conflict , through year after year and age after age ; and by watching , forecast , and striving , they must be preserved . There is no more dangerous weakness in American nature than that sickly notion that we have only to believe , and let things take their course . The virtue of the community can take care of its vice if it will ; but it can not do so by hope alone , repeating in silver tones that all is well , as it sails into the darkness of the future without compass , or chart , or an eye to the peril before it . This is not manliness , it is childish folly . The virtue that would conquer must stand in arms , always vigilant , always bold , yet never rash . It can not sit with hands folded , lulled by such high-sounding nonsense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critics have failed to see , or seeing have chosen to ignore , that their chief reasons and ours are built upon foundations totally different . We have affirmed that their foundation is unsound . It was for them to prove the contrary . Instead of doing so , they have only repeated what they and their fellow suffragists think they can never say too often about principles , rights , and the Declaration of Independence . In short , they have neither defended their own base // of argument nor attacked ours . Their favorite method is a simple one . Out of certain utterances of past times they evolve ideas which the authors of those utterances never meant to convey ; then blow these ideas to their utmost inflation , call them principles , and demand that they shall be universally embodied in practice whether for good or evil . The real issue is this : Is the object of government the good of the governed , or is it not ? A late writer on woman suffrage says that it is not . According to her , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to everybody . Our critics do not venture either on this flat denial or this brave assertion , but only hover about them with longing looks . Virtually , they maintain that the object of government is the realization of certain ideas or theories . They believe in principles , and so do we ; they believe in rights , and so do we . But , as the sublime may pass into the ridiculous , so the best principles may be transported into regions of folly or diabolism . There are minds so constituted that they can never stop till they have run every virtue into its correlative weakness or vice . Government should be guided by principles ; but they should be sane and not crazy , sober and not drunk . They should walk on solid ground , and not roam the clouds hanging to a bag of gas . Rights may be real or unreal . Principles may be true or false ; but even the best and truest can not safely be pushed too far , or in the wrong direction . The principle of truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old that truth should not be spoken at all times ; and those whom a sick conscience worries into habitual violation of the maxim are imbeciles and nuisances . Religion may pass into morbid enthusiasm or wild fanaticism , and turn from a blessing to a curse . So the best of political principles must be kept within bounds of reason , or they will work mischief . That greatest and most difficult of sciences , the science of government , dealing with interests so delicate , complicated , and antagonistic , becomes a perilous guide when it deserts the ways of temperance . Our critics ' idea of government is not practical , but utterly unpractical . It is not American , but French . It is that government of abstractions and generalities which , as we once said before , found its realization in the French Revolution , and its apostle in the depraved and half-crazy man of genius , Jean Jacques Rousseau . The French had an excuse for their frenzy in the crushing oppression they had just flung off and in their inexperience of freedom . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been free , and our liberty is in danger from nothing but its own excesses . Since France learned to subject the ideas of Rousseau to the principles of stable freedom embodied in the parliamentary government of England and in our own republicanism , she has emerged from alternate tumult and despotism to enter the paths of hope and progress . The government of abstractions has been called , sometimes the a priori , and sometimes the sentimental method . We object to this last term , unless it is carefully defined . Sentiments , like principles , enter into the life of nations as well as that of individuals ; and they are vital to both . But they should be healthy , and not morbid ; rational , and not extravagant . It is not common sense alone that makes the greatness of states ; neither is it sentiments and principles alone . It is these last joined with reason , reflection , and moderation . Through this union it is that one small island has become the mighty mother of nations ; and it is because we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Hampden , Washington , and Franklin , and not those of Rousseau , that we have passed safe through every danger , and become the wonder and despair of despotism . Out of the wholesome fruits of the earth , and the staff of life itself , the perverse chemistry of man distills delirious vapors , which , being condensed and bottled , exalt his brain with glorious phantasies , and then leave him in the mud . So it is with the unhappy suffragists . From the sober words of our ancestors they extract the means of mental inebriety . Because the fathers of the republic gave certain reasons to emphasize their creed that America should not be taxed because America was not represented in the British Parliament , they cry out that we must fling open the floodgates to vaster tides of ignorance and folly , strengthen the evil of our system and weaken the good , feed old abuses , hatch new ones , and expose all our large cities-we speak with deliberate convictionto the risk of anarchy . We have replied to our critics , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be on terms of adverse discussion with women or with men who represent them , and we willingly leave them the last word if they want it . Whatever we may have to say on the subject in future will not be said in the way of controversy . FRANcIs PARKMAN.
