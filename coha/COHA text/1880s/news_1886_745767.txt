txt The world-wide discussion of the attitude of Russia toward England and her possessions in the East which preceded and followed the battle of Penjdeh convinced many keen observers that the extension of the Czar 's territory to the Arabian Sea was only a matter of time . Since the temporary settlement of the boundary quarrel Russia has materially strengthened her position in the region north of Afghanistan , while England appears to have gained no advantages which she did not enjoy a year ago . Our very interesting letter from Teheran , published yesterday , shows not only that the Czar has now a more satisfactory base of operations for any movement in the direction of Afghanistan which he may desire to make , but also that he has recently gained possession of a large slice of Persia and that the Shah 's entire country is at hid mercy . The strip of territory which has been transferred to the Czar adjoins the northeastern boundary of Persia , and is of great value to Russia because it includes a region lying south of the new Russian railway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a southeasterly direction to a point below the latitude of Herat . While the secret treaty , which was negotiated without the knowledge of Great Britain , does not openly cede the land , it transfers the civil and military administration of the district to Russia and provides that the Czar shall have the sole right of quartering troops there . The district really passes to Russia as completely as if it had been sold to her . Our correspondent shows that Russia has now opened three good roads into the Shah 's dominions , and that Persia itself is ready to fall into the Czar 's hands whenever he shall decide that the time has come for going down to the Persian Gulf . There are other important statements in the letter of Mr. VON SCHIERBRAND , and they deserve careful attention because his semi-official position at Teheran enables him to get trustworthy information . A few days ago the State Department at Washington received from Mr. WINSTON , our Minister at Teheran , a communication in which the Shah invited American capitalists to build railroads for him . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construct a road from Mohammerah , on the Euphrates , to his capital . Our correspondent writes about the grant made by the Shah to Baron REUTER , and shows how that contract was broken . Concerning the appeal to American capitalists he says : " As a last sheet anchor the Shah has been attempting of late to draw American capital into Persia for railroad building purposes , but without avail so far , I am happy to say . Two or three schemes of that kind have broken down when hardly beyond the budding stage , and the bursting of the last bubble happened but two months ago . The American sukveyors and engineers , who had gotten as far as London , went home again . The trouble is that no railroad would pay here . The Persians , too , have the same idea about America that the Europeans have , viz. , that there are too many nabobs in our country , and that it is a boon to humanity to relieve them of at least a portion of their Pactolian stream . That is why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ builders here . " The people are not travelers ; they prefer to transport goods by caravan , and the Government will not give proper guarantees . But these objections , grave as they are , will probably , have less weight with capitalists who read Mr. VON SCHIERBRAND 'S letter than his remarkable exposition of the rottenness of the Persian Government and the dishonesty of Persians in private as well as public life . " Prom top to bottom corruption reigns supreme . Everything goes by bribery , trickery , and crooked means . " If Americans want to build railroads in Persia they should wait until Russia takes the country , for even a Russian administration will be by far cleaner than the Government of the Shah . Our correspondent has opinions about the advisability of sending a diplomatic representative from the United States to Teheran , and he expresses them emphatically . He thinks the American mission should be abolished . There is nothing for an American Minister to do in Persia . He reports that Mr. WINSTON is disgusted . Perhaps there will by and by be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country at a foreign Court .
