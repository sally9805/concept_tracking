txt One of the most gratifying results of yesterday 's election is the defeat of the impudent demagogue who.has been flaunting his arrogant pretensions in the face of the people of Massachusetts for a year past . Last year BUTLER owed his triumph to the . dissatisfied state of mind in which-he found many Republicans and a spirit of recklessness which invited the experiment of a Butler administration . The use that he . has made of the opportunity given him has disgusted most decent people . While pretending to simplicity and appealing in words to the " plain people " he has made a most offensive display of the insolence of office . While professing purposes of reform in administrative methods he has acted unblushingly on the principle that the spoils were his for distribution among his friends . His crusade against the State Alms-house was inspired by malice against ' a Superintendent who had defied his dictation when he assumed to act as a Republican " boss " in Middlesex County , and his conduct of the investigation was characterized by duplicity , false pretense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the canvass just ended he resorted to every conceivable device of falsehood , demagogism , and arrogance . He has assumed that ignorance , and prejudice afford a sure reliance for the politician . The result of his administration and of his canvass for a re-election has been to arouse and unite the Republicans from Cape Cod to the Berkshire Hills and to disgust many of the respectable Democrats who had previously tolerated him for the sake Of a transient party success , which gave nothing to the party and everything to BUTLER . The returns from the cities and manufacturing towns show that many of the working men had ceased to put faith in his pretensions as a special champion of their interests . The only surprisi , thing about yesterday 's vote in Massacusetts is that ROBINsox 's majority is no greater . The State is normally Republican by 50,000 to 60,000 on a full vote , and yet with the help ' of disgusted Democrats the party majority this year is not far from 20,000 . This ' is doubtless due to the fact that many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ex-Collector SIMMONS , of Boston , adhered to the fortunes of the man for whom they were wont to work in former times . But though the wound which has ended BUTLER 'S political career is not as wide as a church door nor as deep as a well , it will serve . It will end his " boom " and teach the Democratic Party that there can be no permanent gain in throwing away principles and : seeking success by giving way to the lead of a vulgar demagogue . BUTLER 'S effort to secure a hold upon the national party by the same means that enabled him to capture a State organization has failed . By representing that his political career is ended we do not mean that he will himself give it up , but he has nothing to hope for from either of the regular parties . It would not be surprising if he were to attempt to lead a third party of some nondescript kind in the next national canvass . His vitality is not easily exhausted , and his impudence is incapable of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and can never repeat his brief period of triumph in a wider field .
