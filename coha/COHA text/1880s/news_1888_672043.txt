txt The great Fish Trust came ? to an abrupt end this evening . The " combine " was known as the Boston Fresh FisliDealers ' Association and was composed of wholesalers only . Trouble has been brewing in the trust for some time and it culminated in a heated meeting of the members at the T Wharf rooms late this afternoon . The meeting was . held with closed doors , the officers placing sentries at all approaches to prevent the details of the wrangle from getting abroad . The principal cause of trouble was the charge that several members of the trust were not keeping faith in selling under the trust prices under fictitious names . Detectives had been employed to hunt up the faithless members with very goon success , and the charges were proved against several dealers prominent in the trade . Then of course the tignt came over the attempt to prevent the double dealers from getting any share of the pool , which now amounts to several thousand dollars . This settled the existence of the trust very quickly , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the Finance Committee gives it up . The matter will probably come up in court tomorrow morning on the complaint of the dealers who are left out in the cold by the irate members who nave stuck squarely to card prices in selling their fish . Cutting in prices will also begin to-morrow morning and will continue until many of the smaller dealers who were protected by the trust , are forced , to the wall . The chief complaint among the fish dealers is that there are too many wholesalers , and now that all roctriottona are removed the prices will be out until bankruptoy thins the number . It will be a harvest for the retailers for a time , but prices to consumers will remain the same as now .
