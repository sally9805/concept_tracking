txt Doubtless all knowledge is good ; but if some knowledge is better than other , if studies are ranked according to practical worth , study of etymological derivations will fall low on the scale . For words are not , in point of fact , much introduced into language by any process of " derivation . " Men do not , as a general rule , " hark back " and form new terms by any set method of combining elements of old ones . No doubt such a process exists and contributes some few of the new words . But the general growth of language is by making new applications of familiar tennis without any systematic consideration of etymologies . Old words are perverted to new uses . Trustworthy historic knowledge of the social , commercial , artistic , or other changes which have caused these perversions of words is of genuine value . One may well wonder , for instance , how " a farm " should mean a tract of land , but " to farm " should mean , in one of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privilege ; how " farmer " should signify either an agriculturist or a tax-gatherer . Reading history one is told that the Saxon word reproduced in the letters f-a-r-m originally meant provisions ; that Saxon tenants seldom paid money for their lands , money being little used , but hired for and paid by a share of the provisions raised , whereby " farm " came to mean rent ? a share of produce paid for the privilege of gathering it ; that from this point usage di-vided , and persons who took lands upon condition of paying rent called their lands " farms " and themselves " farmers , " and came , after a time , so to speak even if they owned the laud and paid no rent ; while , on the other hand , persons who took charge of a privilege , such as collection of taxes on condition of paying a share of the produce , also called themselves " farmers , " and the franchise was said to be " farmed out . " This is in the nature of historic information , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable , it needs to bo true . Every step is matter of fact . There is no more opportunity , in such a line of explanation , for guessing , or inference , or a priori reasoning , than there is in the discussion of the graver problems of history . Is there proof that this account is true ? ought to be a challenge put to all etymologies . The celebrated " Temperance Tales " were commended to the public by the motto , " Founded on fact . " How fow of the etymologies so profusely proffered in the dictionaries are shown to be even " founded on fact . " Ono derivation sounds plausible till another is read ; but this second one contradicts the first , a third spurns the two , and a fourth throws the whole subject into confusion . To enjoy any comfortable reliance upon etymology , one must scrupulously confine himself to one lexicon . To contrive these derivations is fascinatingly easy if one will only release himself from allegiance to historic truth , as it seems the noted CALVINUS avowedly did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ framing derivations according to the supposed nature of things , without regard to the proprieties of language or to the niceties of grammar ! What a variety of surmises may be offered as to " newspaper , " for instance . One lexicographer may say that it means a paper containing news , which is plural of a supposed noun , new . Another may derive it from sorts , the Greek for mind , intelligence . Another will surmise that antique journals had the sign of the compass at their heading , and in time coined the initials N. E. W. S. into a word betokening that the sheet brought information from all four quarters . Another may imagine that because journals have so long been carried in a strap , cord , or noose , by lads delivering them from house to house , they came to be called noose-Pavers , and another . that the " new " in the term is k-new with the initial k worn off , and signifies that Ain the golden age ) correspondents furnished only what they knew . If same of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Broker. ? One dictionary derives it from the French broieur , ( lie that grinds or breaks a thing into small pieces . ) Another says it comes from the Saxon broc , ( misfortune , ) because none but traders broken by misfortune were admitted to the employment . A third attributes it to abroecan , ( a Saxon word which signified breaking up goods  --  selling at retail . ) Culprit. ? Five different accounts of the origin of this word can easily be gathered . No. 1 is that , in the days when mongrel Latin and French were used in English courts , the Clerk of court was accustomed to respond to a prisoner 's plea of not guilty , culpabilis , ( he is guilty , ) grit , ( the King is ready for trial , ) and these words , noted in abbreviations  --  cut , peril  --  on the journal of the day 's proceedings , became in time a word for a person ac cased . No. 2 says that the Clerk was wont to write posit on his record whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per patriots  --  ho puts himself upon the country  --  i. e. , demands a jury trial ; and that posit was , still later , abbreviated into put ; which , being unpronounceable , was wrested into prit , and , In connection with eel. , ( for culpabilis , ) as before , became a noun . No. 3 discards culpabilis and grit altogether , and narrates that the Clerk was accustomed to respond , in a cheery way , to the plea of not guilty , qu'il parole , ( may it appear : ) adding the question , how will you be tried ? and that these words , hurriedly pronounced , came to sound , to English ears , " Culprit ! how will you be tried ? " No. 4 pronounces all such derivations erroneous , and says that the word is a modification of culpit or culped , participle of a supposed verb , to culpe , to accuse . No. 5 is satisfied to make the modest suggestion of a derivation from the Latin cuipa . One Is at a loss whether most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Middle Ages , or the ingenuity which invents for the occasion a verb never before heard . Parliament. ? Serious books differ whether it comes from parlement , or parlemcnlum , ( speaking , ) or from parley le meld , ( to speak the mind , ) or from parium lamentum , ( the lament of the peers . ) Until they agree one may well accept the suggestion of the Comic Blaexstone that it is derived from varier and 711ftlar , ( to talk and to lie a Such contrasts show that many derivations proffered must be false . A more important question is : Are they " important if true " ? At the very best , the discussion only tends to show what the word was wont in times long gone by to signify , which is very different from knowing what it now means , how it is growing to be employed at the present day . A throng of questions may be proposed upon the present use of " news " and " newspaper . " A publisher is sued for libel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of news . " If this makes a difference must it not be because " news " means something other than novel to the public ? A New-York telegraph office agrees with a Chicago merchant to send , every night , all important news of the day affecting stocks ; the office hears that EDISON has invented electric light an.d telegraphs that , and the Chicago man loses mopes* by selling out gas stock . Has he any right to complain ? The office says the rumor was current in the City and was sent as news of the day ; the Chicago man says he did not want every rumor ; ho desired intelligence by which he could purchase or sell ; which is right ? Lately , au attorney sent his law- notices to be published on the covers of a monthly " Reporter , " and lost his case because the Judge said this was not publishing in " a newspaper . " Suppose postage on newspapers is fixed at one rate , and that upon circulars , magazines , and pamphlets at another , how decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Some one sells the good will of his news-stand in a depot , promising not to open a rival one near , and straightway begins to sell books and magazines within the very building . Is he keeping within his promise because he does not sell newspapers ? Is a " news-boy " always one who sells papers , and if so , is a " news-agent " or a " news-dealer " always a seller of journals , or sometimes a person employed to gather intelligence These are the questions which arise in affairs ; this is the kind of knowledge which will enable the business man to deal safely , the lawyer to earn fees , the writer to make himself understood . To the student who is preparing for active life etymologies are useful in proportion as they aid in answering such queries as these . But one can not help suspecting that , just as the botanist , if ho will divide and subdivide his blossom into petals , stamens , and pistils to learn how the structure grew , must forego the fragrance and beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ searching the non-ascertainable origin of words , is overlooking and losing the knowledge of their living power  --  their actual and growing use .
