ARTICLE IV. - TIIE REVOLUTION IN THE AMERICAN BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS FOR FOREIGN MISSIONS . AMONG the many Societies for public lSeneficence the organization of which marked the early years of this century , was one that was characterized above all the rest by the singular practical wisdom of its constitution . Concerning the constitutions of these societies generally , no one , in the light of later history , will venture to speak with much respect . They are nearly all after one pattern , and that a very bad one . It must have had , in the eyes of the projectors of these societies , a certain theoretic plausibility-an air of " popular sovereignty , " as if conferring on the contributors of the society 's funds the right of directing and controlling the use of their own gifts . il3ut it was an almost unaccountable lack of sagacity that failed , in the beginning of these societies , to foresee that in the event of their considerable success , this sort of constitution was , in the Carlylean phrase , a " constitution that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the society , charged with the government of its affairs and the election of its officers , should grow to large numbers widely dispersed , the control of the Society would practically come to be vested in a self-elected and irresponsible few . There are many persons who will be shocked at this way of putting it ; there are others who will deprecate all discussion of the su*bject ; but there is no man who can venture to deny that in the case ( for example ) of the American Tract Society and of the American Bible Society , practically the sole responsibility of the Managers and officers is to a small ring consisting of themselves and their personal friends . There are no real meetings of the Societies . The membership is defunct ; it exists in name only , for purposes of popular impression , as a pretended constituency and control . It would be interesting to know to which one of the five gentlemen who met at Farmington , Connecticut , on the 5th of // September , 1810 , and organized the " American Board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is indebted for such a masterpiece of wise forecast as is found in the constitution which was then agreed upon . It is marvelous that a period characterized by such childish unwisdom in organizing institutions for all time on a basis adapted only for the first few years of small things , should have given birth to so admirable an instrument ,  --  of an elasticity suiting it alike to the feeble beginnings of the Society , and to the days of its present or of any future magnitude ; combining the definite personal authority and reponsibility which belongs to a small number of corporators , with the wide popular interest which comes of a multitudinous membership styled honorary , but invested with immunities and duties that make it much more than honorary ; constituting a close corporation which can never , except by evasions of its organic law , become a secret corporation , but which is required to transact all its business , not only in the open daylight of public scrutiny , but under liability to interpellation and debate in the parliament of a great honorary membership having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The high qualities of this masterly constitution have been approved and illustrated throughout its history of now threefourths of a century . During that time , societies of a pre tended " open** or " popular " constitution have been carried helplessly in the pockets of the managing ring , all interference being defied . Some have depended , like the Bible Society , on silencing discussion by a rule of business . Others , like the Tract Society , have seen discussion overborne by a howling mob , under favor of which the administration has escaped formal responsibility . In others yet , as the American Home Missionary Society and the American Missionary Association , there have been attempts to remedy the incurable defects of their organic law . The smaller societies , from the Seamen 's Friend Society and the American and Foreign Christian Union down , find a safe refuge from public censure in their inertness and obscurity . But from before the birth of the oldest of these , the " American Board " has pursued its splendid career , through financial difficulties , through stormy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which such a Society is liable , except public suspicion of hidden abuse or of persistence in a condemned policy . In the nature of the case , this was precluded . Many a time the Administration has felt the irksomeness of the annual necessity of a public review of its doings . But unless it has been strangely blind to the source of the public confidence toward the institution which it represents , it must have felt that its exemption from the worst evils to which like societies have been exposed has been due to this inconvenient , recurrent , inevitable necessity . The only occasions when the American Board has been subjected to public suspicion and the necessity of Committees of Investigation , have been occasions when the constitutional provision for the annual unsparing public revision , control and direction of its affairs has been evaded or otherwise defeated . The history of the American Board includes the history of some of the most memorable debates in the annals of American eoquence . The ablest men in the service of the American Church have felt that here was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mass-meeting in which grave questions would be decided by the sudden clamor of a popular vote ; nor on the other hand , was it a quiet conclave for the deliberations of a few . But , with the vast public audience , the great numbers of eager disputants to whom the debate was freely open , the venerable senate of corporators sitting as a jury to hear and determine , and the grave questions that were wont to emerge-questions not only high and deep , but at the same time concrete and immediately practical-withal , with the vast spiritual interests involved ; there was in the meetings of the American Board , as intended by the constitution of the Society , and as actually conducted until a comparatively recent period , every condition favorable to invite and stimulate the best faculties of the best men in the thorough transaction of the important matters of business which it is the . distinct and explicit object of the meeting to attend to . Among the more memorable of the meetings of the American Board , in which great principles or great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Board , and de // cisions rendered for the guidance and government of the Executive , may be named the meeting in Brooklyn in 1845 , when the debate went to the roots of the Slavery question , and did much to enlighten and confirm the clergy and churches of the northern States in a temperate , discriminating , and therefore inexpugnable conviction on the subject of slavery ; * the meeting at New Haven in 1846 , when sharp and salutary discussion arose as to the limitations on the discretion of the Secretaries , and the right of the Board to control and direct its officers was asserted and maintained ; the meeting at Hartford in 1854 , when , through a conspicuously able , and animated debate , conclusions were reached which fixed the policy of the Board in the missions among the North American Indians , especially as affected by the continually disturbing presence of slavery . But no meeting in the history of the Board , perhaps , has been more illustrative of the proper function of the Board , than the meeting held at Utica ii* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Albany . At the Utica meeting it was brought to the knowledge of the Board , not by the facts in the annual report , but only by grievous complaints coming from various missions to members of the Board , that in the course of the year a gravely important change in the * " The late annual meeting of the Board at Brooklyn in 1845 , was signalized by a discussion of slavery and its relations to the missionary work . . . The debate occupied the greater part of the entire session . It was free ; there was no restraint put upon the utterance of any opinion , however extreme . On the one hand there were the strongest denunciations , not only of slavery , but of all who are masters of slaves -- on the other hand there was a speech from a South Carolina clergyman , suited exactly to the meridian , of Charleston  --  and both were heard with exemplary patience . The discussion was bold , partly in consequence of its being free ; every man who spoke seemed to express his opinion without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was characterized by decorum . Though the number of members present , corporate and honorary , was more than six hundred , all of whom had the same right to speak ; and though , in the absence or consultation as to who should lead in the argument , some fifty or more were ready and anxious to take part in the debate , there was no unseemly contending for the floor , and only once or twice was there any occasion for a call to order . And notwithstanding the necessarily desultory character of an unprepared debate , on such a subject , in such an assembly , all will agree that it was on the whole an uncommonly able discussion . " - LEONARD BACON in the New York Evangelist , January , 1846. // educational policy of the missions had been effected by the sole authority and initiative of the Board 's Executive . To some present , this act of the Executive seemed to be of the nature of a coup d ' *tat ; and it was a grave question in the debates at Utica whether the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restore the mission schools to the status quo . It was a question partly of the theory of missions , partly of the subordination of the Executive to the appointing and directing power , and partly of expediency . The debate was long and earnest , and was so far from arriving at a satisfactory conclusion that the meeting was adjourned , leaving the subject in the hands of a large and able committee , whose report , prepared after much direct correspondence with the missions , became the basis on which the Board , after renewed debate , was brought , at last , to a unanimons agreement , at the special meeting . Such meetings of the American Board are a thing of the past , and of a past which is already beginning to grow remote . But the days when these meetings were the great parliament of Christ 's Church in America for high debate and responsible action on " the things concerning the kingdom , " were the golden days of the American Board . Those great meetings , that were not meant for popular impression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were too gravely absorbed to be on the look-out for popular impression , were , for this very reason , the most popnlarly impressive and instructive meetings that have ever been held for the advancement of missions . Vast concourses of earnest men thronged to attend them ; and incidental to the central business of the meeting were opportunities that were never neglected , of earnest public appeal , of set instruction , and of the fervid worship of crowded assemblies of zealous believers . The incidental value of the meetings was found to be very great . And this was the beginning of the decline of them . The merely incidental results were so very important , even in a finaucial view , that those who were immediately responsible for the financial conduct of the Board began to exalt the mcidental above the essential . Everybody said that the meetings were solemnly impressive ; whereupon the persons on whom // the preparation of them seemed to devolve were tempted to say to one another , " Go to , now ; let us become impressive and solemn . " Eminent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on hand and make eloquent prayers ; and distinguished speakers must be " billed " for the successive meetings through the week , in order that the interest should be well sustained . Withal , the transaction of business must not be allowed to intrude upon this program of popular addresses and acts of worship , but such necessary formalities of business as absolutely can not be dispensed with must be dispatched without discussion in such remnants of time as are not wanted for something impressive . " And yet some of us who remember the old days are disposed to think that the meetings made far more of an impression for not throwing themselves into attitudes and trying to be impressive . Of course , the change tends to aggravate itself . The altered character of the meeting tends to change the character of the attendance ; and this in turn increases the demand for a spectacular and emotional meeting , and the popular impatience at the sober and serious business of the Board . It would be the idlest affectation in the world to try and make believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effecting the quiet but revolutionary change in this great institution . The effect of this change has been to invest a little knot of gentlemen in Boston with the practically irresponsible control of a magnificent system of spiritual influences reaching to the ends of the earth and affecting the courses of current and future history . To suppose that they do not enjoy this is to suppose them superior to one of the commonest infirmities of noble minds . To believe them honestly convinced that the administration of the missions will be more wisely and safely conducted by themselves without interference from the Annual Meeting , is to impute to them no larger a measure of self-respect than is common to human nature , even in Boston . To deny that the present condition of things exists by virtue of something more than connivance on their part is to contradict demonstrable facts . To expect them readily to surrender this unwarranted and unconstitutional power , after having held it for several years with little question , is-well , is to pay them the highest possible honor as men of fidelity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the annual meeting are Iixed in advance in such a way as to preclude all discussion of the policy and conduct of the Administration except in the order , on the topics , and by the speakers selected by the Administration itself , and in such a way as to exclude any other business which the Board or its members might wish to entertain , may be j uidged from the official program of the meeting held in Columbus in October last  --  a program not essentially differing from those annually prescribed by the officers at Boston . From 3 m M. of Tuesday till noon of Wednesday , is consnmed by an unbroken series of set speeches and papers , some of them necessary to the business of the meeting , some of them highly desirable , if there had been time for them without excluding business , and some of them of no obvious immediate value , then and there , unless for the purpose of excluding business . On Wednesday afternoon and evening are prescribed discussions of the topics presented in the Home Department Report and in two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with addresses . Thursday forenoon is occupied with Reports from Committees on the various Missions . At 2 P. M. the Lord 's Supper is observed ; after which , at 3.30 , is a " Business Meeting for the election of officers , reports on Missions , and other business . " All the remaining time , till Friday noon , is occupied by " addresses , " except a provision for " Business Concluded , " on Friday morning . What , now , is a member of the *B*'ard to do , who comes to the meeting with important business which he wishes to lay before his colleagues ? There is a " business meeting " to be held on Thursday afternoon , in which there seems to be a chance for him under the title of " other business ; " but his affair is one requiring deliberation , and reference , and report , and if he waits till Thursday afternoon it will be too late . He inquires of the Secretaries ( for by the absurdest anomaly in the world , this meeting of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found to be under the supreme control of the persons whose administration is to be examined into ) , and is told that the Rule is that that all business shall be presented through the Business Committee . ( It turns out , on subsequent inquiry , that there is no such rule , but there is not // copy of the rules accessible , and we must take the Secretary 's word for it . ) Where is the Business Committee to be found ? After no small searching , one member of it is discovered , and then another , but when they are got together they are not aware what is expected of them . The upshot of the matter is that at last , not too late for the necessary action , a matter of the gravest consequence is got before the house and referred to a committee . But it is evident that the fact that a member of the Board should have any business to present to the Board is looked upon as something irregular , not to say eccentric-one of those not-to-be-expected things which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to provide by the appointment of a Business Coiumittee . But there is a " business meeting " provided for in the program . Yes ; indeed there is-as if the whole " annual meeting of the Board " were not , by its constitution and purpose , a series of business meetings . But there is a business meeting left . And if it were the design of the Administration to evade and defeat that wise provision in the constitution of the Board by which its business is to be transacted in the light of publicity , in the presence of the great body of its honorary members , assisting in its deliberations , " and to substitute for the open meeting a secret conclave in which matters of great moment might be dispatched by a snap-vote without the public knowledge , they would find it difficult to devise any measure tending to that end , in addition to those which are annually used . The " business meeting " is announced for that hour of the whole week when the attendance of honorary members is most unlikely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice gives the impression that nothing but the most uninteresting routine business is to be transacted- " election of officers , reports on missions and other business . " And actually , the honorary members in attendance are given to understand by public announcement that this meeting is " a meeting of the eo*poi*ate members " - as if the corporate members had any right to hold a private meeting ! This was done at Portland , and again at Columbus . Probably it was an inadvertence ; but when such an inadvertence becomes habitual , it is a serious matter . // 59 Revolution in the A. B. C. J ? iVII . And if an honorary member , by way of asserting his constitutional rights , had gone into this merely " business meeting , " he would have seen how convenient it is . Both by the laws and by the charter of the Board , the not very grievous but gravely important safeguard is prescribed , that the election both of officers and of new members shall be by ballot ; and the first motion made in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the law of the State by the very common but not at all respectable trick of nominating some one to cast a single ballot for the crowd . Apparently the motion would have prevailed , but for the protest of one of that class of members who had been invited to absent themselves . Beside these elections there was " other business **-nothing that the public or the honorary members could be supposed to take any interest in-only a mere bagatelle of a quarter of a million of dollars in the treasury that the Prudential Committee wanted authority to make a certain disposition of- " it 's all right , you know , the Prudential Committee only want you to pass this niotion . " And so they passed it on the spot , without a question or a word , and smilingly adjourned to assemble again at one of the meetings that are not business meetings . There is no question at all of the great convenience of thus holding private corporation meetings , if only it were not unlawful . If this proposal to dispose of a legacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in presence of the full Board , some inopportune member , not sufficiently informed of the wishes of the Administration , might have blundered out a motion to refer the matter to a committee , and in that case the Board , for mere decency 's sake , wQnld have had to refer it . This would have taken time , and might have led to deliberation-possibly even to diversity of opinion . low wrong , to divert the minds of this great gathering of honorary members from the exercises of prayer , praise and pulpit eloquence , to the earthly and carnal question of what to do with $250,000 ! So much easier it is for all concerned , and especially for the Prudential Committee and the Secretaries , to have the whole matter dispatched in sixty seconds in a private meeting , and no questions asked . If only it were lawful ! It is necessary to add , in order that the completeness of this // strange revolution may be set forth , that the power which the Administration of the Board has usnrped over the conduct of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not confined to the exclusion of business , in a merely negative way . It extends to intermeddling with the proper business of the Board in every way that is most indelicate and unbecoming , and most calculated to defeat the proper business of the Board , and the proper accountability of its officers . It was known in advance of the meeting at Portland , in 1882 , that a member of the Board would try to introduce to the consideration of the Board a matter of grave concern , which involved questions of the wisdom of the Secretaries and the Prudential Committee in their management . On the way to the meeting , the Secretaries were openly , without the slightest disguise , engaged in " fixing up " the committee to which this matter should be referred . They meant to do it fairly , no doubt ; but what business had they , of all men , to be " fixing up " committees at all ? The member who wished to introduce the matter to his colleagues , had gone to the trouble and expense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fuller exposition of the case . The Secretaries assumed the responsibility of hunting through the hall of assembly and gathering up all the copies of this pamphlet and secreting them , lest a member of the Board should succeed in communicating to his fellow-members facts which he considered pertinent to their inquiry into the conduct of the Board 's business . When the Secretaries were taxed with this extraordinary procedure , they explained themselves by telling what they were willing to have come before the Board , and what they were not willing , and how under such and such circumstances they might have been willing . An astounding piece of effrontery , it would have seemed , for a Society 's employees to dictate to the Society what information it might or might not be permitted to have on matters relating to their official conduct ! But in fact it was not effrontery at all . It was sheer simplicity . It came of their habitual conscientious feeling that it is their duty to manage and govern the American Board of Commissioners , instead of allowing the American Board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , does not the present condition of things practically work well ? It is evident enough that the original constitution of the iBoard has been capsized , and that they are sailing the ship bottom-upwards ; but after all does n't she sail so well in this shape that it is hardly worth while to try and right her np again ? " In answering this question , there is no need to insist on the point , which some might dispute , that the conduct of the missions would be the wiser and better for that bon4 , ftde annual examination and control for which the constitution provides and which has until lately been exercised . The point might be proved out of the history of the Board itself. * But there is no need of proving it . There are points enough beside . 1 . The present r*/qime is injurious to the one cause which it is supposed to promote  --  the public interest in the Annual Meeting . This meeting will live long on the memories and traditions of the time when it was really a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never come when enterprising management on the part of the Secretaries , free accommodations , reduced railroad fares , and famous speakers shall fail to draw a great concourse to it . But already it is no longer 8uch a concourse , in point of character , as it used to be . The list of earnest , able , influential friends of missions , among the members of the Board , who habitually stay away from it , would be instructive on this point , if read in " the light of other days . " t 2 . The present methods convert one of the best imaginable constitutions into one of the worst possible . The best imaginable is the constitution of the American Board as it was meant to be and as it used to be . The next * One of the instances which would require to be studied , if this historical argument were to be pursued , is the coup d ' *tat of 1854 , by which the educational system of the missions was suddenly overthrown without authorization from the Board , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Administration has acknowledged its error , in some measure , by working back toward the old system again . But it was an error from which it would have been saved , if the Prudential Committee had been willing to add to its own wisdom the wisdom of the Board which it ought to have consulted . ? This point was impressed upon the mind of the writer by the remark of a man in very eminent position , who had lately been chosen a cor // best , perhaps , would be a small close committee at Boston or elsewhere , in full and unlimited control of the whole business , distinctly and explicitly exempt from interference and superporate member . He had given up attending the meetings , he said , because he found , by several experiments , that all that was wanted of him was to sit on the platform and look dignified . Another very distinguished and revered friend of the Board expresses his views on the subject in these words : " I used to attend the Annual Meetings , and enjoyed them , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business of such a Board . But I confess that they have not attracted me since they became meetings for conference and prayer ' only . The stimulus and uplifting of such assemblies one can get from any county conference , and more helpfully from any live church-meeting , in which no individual feels lost in a crowd . I am glad if others obtain from the meetings of the Board as now conducted an inspiration not found elsewhere , but for one , I do not . I feel a more profound interest in the cause , and a more manful devotion to it , when and where I can be sensible of doing something more than listening to prayer and praise and exhortation . " Generally speaking , people do not like to " rise to a point of order " against a hymn or a " season of prayer . " The only instance of it in parliamentary history , that we remember , was when Dr. Bushnell promptly said , " I object , " to a proposal to have prayer in the General Association of Connecticut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons have the courage of Dr. Bushnell that " Let us pray " is often the most effective of all methods of arresting discussion . Moving the Previous Question is not to be compared with it . But it ought to be used sparingly . There are not a few persons who remember with amusement , not unmixed with more serious feelings , how often , in the American Board , when discussion grew earnest , it used to be broken in upon by the thundering voice of Secretary Pomroy shouting " Brethren , let us sing a hymn , " and leading off accordingly . It was an expedient to which there could be no resistance . And it is not strange that many who had " tried the unequal strife " should become discouraged and refrain from " assisting in deliberations " in which they were placed at such disadvantage . The " General Remarks " appended to the official account of the Annual Meetings of the Board , in successive volumes of the Annual Report , clearly reflect the official mind on the subject . The several meetings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they answered more or less closely to the ideal of a methodist camp-meeting ; and the transaction of the Board 's business in overhauling the official conduct of its appointees is adverted to as an unfortunate interference necessary , perhaps , but still unfortunate , with the great object of the meeting . These " General Remarks " are rather an impertinence , in the nature of them ; and in the manner of them , they savor disagreeably of cant. // 1885 . Revolution in the A. B. C. F. if 63 vision , and therefore feeling , every man in his own conscience , . the full weight of responsibility . The worst possible and altogether intolerable organization is the Boston Committee , ostensibly subordinate but practically supreme , acconutable to an annual public meeting whose liberty it has captured and all whose proceedings it engineers according to its own program , and upon whose pretended oversight and direction it can shirk its responsibility to its own conscience and to public opinion . 3 . The existing methods are further censurable in that they can be maintained only by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporate members of the Board , and fraud against the honorary members . In 1863 , the Board , which had not then ceased from active functions , solemnly declared that " whereas membership in this corporation is not an honor merely , to be conferred on men distinguished by position , by learning and genius , or by civil and ecclesiastical influence , but is a trust which can not be discharged without labor and sacrifice ; therefore , every man elected to membership , if he accept and retain the trust , shall be considered as pledged to perform its duties . " Already the tendency to turn the serious business of the Board into a mere dress-parade was manifest , and the IResolntion of 1863 did not suffice to stop it . The value of praise and prayer as an instrnmentality for repressing discussion and staving off investigation had got to be too well understood . But the IResolution is still on record as a reminder and a reproach . The transactions of this great Christian corporation , which ought to be an example to the country of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather an example to be quoted in apology for every derelict board of bank-directors . " Fervent in spirit , slothful in business . " 4 . Further , the present methods are perilous . They secure , by illegitimate proceedings , to the administration , an immunity from annual anxiety , and to the Board , a release from annual duty ; but it is at a risk for the future which it is not right to take . The Prudential Committee and the Secretaries are men of very high , but not at all of superhuman excellence .. And even if they were secure from the possibility of grave . // error and wrong , they could not be secure from the suspicion of it . At any moment , the suspicion is liable to be spread about that some serious abuse has been hidden in the secrets of the conclave of administration-that some of the less gross forms of temptation have prevailed , the love of spiritual domination , the inclination to do evil that good may come , the wish to screen an associate from censure  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They will point to their eminent names , and the public will answer that those are the very names that are in question . They will refer to the annual inquiry and indorsement of the Board , and the public ( having seen something of the nature of this inquiry ) will laugh in their face ; and then they will wish that they had confined themselves to their proper official business , and had refrained from tampering with the liberty , independence , and impartiality of the Annual Meeting . 5 . But the practical mischiefs of the existing abuses are not in the possible future only . They are very real , actual and present . All over the country and in other countries , the Administration of the Board has been for these many years creating multitudinous centers of disaffection toward itself and toward the cause which it represents . It is one of the most trying and painful things in the duties of the administration of a system of missions , that the most cautious wisdom , the tenderest care , the truest affection towards missionaries and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold delicate and responsible relations , will not save it from being brought into relations of serious difference with some of them . It is the unhappy policy of the Administration of the American Board to shut in the face of all aggrieved persons the door of their proper Court of Appeal , and to insist on being itself the final judge in cases in which it is itself a party . One may freely admit the fair and even magnanimous intentions of the Administration in every such individual case , and yet condemn this policy as unjust and most fatuously unwise . What pastor is there , among the churches sustaining the Board , who does not know of sonic person now or formerly in its employ who is resting , perhaps without complaint , under a sense of grievance unredressed , on which he has never had a fair hearing , // and never can have , so long as the Annual Meeting is " run , " its program dictated , its Committees made up , its time from beginning to end preoccupied , by the other party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is a dissuasive from the cordial support of the Board in the neighborhood where he lives , which it takes a great deal of powerful preaching to countervail. * Such is the gradual but complete revolution which has been effected in the most ancient and illustrious of American Missionary Boards , such the history , the evils and the dangers of it . How is it to be remedied ? or is it irremediable ? 1 . The ready cure for it is for the officers and Prudential Committee of the Board simply to desist from a line of extraofficial action which they ought never to have entered upon a sort of work which is not only aside from their proper functions but incompatible with them . Whether they have undertaken this work of their own motion , or even if by some inconsiderate vote of the Board they may seem to have been invited to it , they would be fully justified in declining any longer to be charged with it , on account of the most obvious considerations of delicacy . The fact that " the general public " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point . After the meeting of the Board in Detroit in 1883 , which was criticised by some as deficient in " thrill , " a certain Western Ministers ' meeting voted to discuss the question , " How ought the Secretaries of our great Benevolent Societies to conduct the Societies ' Annual Meetings ? " They would have done well to follow it up with discussing : How the Cabinet Secretaries ought to conduct the Congressional debates on their Annual Reports ; and How the Cashier of a National Bank ought to conduct the Inquiry by the Government Examiners . The proper way for the Secretaries of the Board * It is needless to mention names , though they might be mentioned by scores . Neither is it necessary to suppose that the Administration have ever done injustice on the merits of any single case . Their method of procedure ,  --  to have manipulated , preoccnpied , and kept the door of , the Court of Appeal , so that one having a complaint against them can have no recourse to it with hope of a fair hearing-is itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love for fair play towards a weaker party is bound to have a moment 's patience . // to conduct its annual meeting is for them not to conduct it at all . 2 . Unhappily , it is little to be expected that the Administration will freely resign the irresponsible power which they have so long enjoyed . On the contrary , it would be in accordance with precedents even in sanctified human nature , if they were to cling to it with a struggle , thinking thereby to do God service . It is honestly difficult for able and energetic men , continually versed in the conduct of such affairs , not to feel themselves far more competent to decide questions of policy , than a Board of Commissioners who give to the subject only their occasional attention . And the more capable the administrator the more sure he is to feel his superiority to his superiors . That very able officer , Secretary Rufus Anderson , in an unlucky moment , protested that the work of Missions could not be carried on if the Board was going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we might as well hoist all sail and run the ship aground . " But that was in the days when the . Board understood its dignity and its authority and its duty ; and Secretary Anderson was very suddenly and sharply given to understand the proper relation between the Secretaries and Committee as subordinate and the Board as superior ; and that it was for him to sail the ship according to his sailing orders , or not to sail the ship at all . So hard it was , and is , for the Administration to trust the Board to do the Board 's own proper work ! In case the Administration shall gracefully lay down its assumed charge over the deliberations of its superior body ,  - -  and equally in case it shall decline so to do  --  the simple course for the Board to pursue is to resume into its own hands the conduct of its own proper business , by appointing at each annual meeting its own committee , from outside the circle of its administrative officers , to make arrangements for the transaction of its business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as this would suffice to turn back that inauspicious Revolution in the American Board , which is the subject of this Article , and restore the defeated constitution to its original force . As a result of it , there would begin to be once more , as of old , an American Board of Commissioners for // Foreign Missions , active and effective , and not merely a Boston Committee for Foreign Missions holding its annual public parade . Keither could any harm come of it . Why should it be feared that the Board 's Committee of Arrangements for Business would not c&amp;Sperate cordially with the Board 's Prudential Committee and the Board 's Secretaries ? Can the Board be imagined as appointing a Committee that would not eagerly promote every reasonable desire of the Executive ? Could it be reckoned an nnreasonable or harmful limitation of the Secretaries ' privilege of bringing in " Special Papers " to be made the subject of report and discussion , * if other people should be allowed a chance to bring in business too ?

Every member of the Board would rejoice to see its annual convocation for business made an occasion of the * This business of " Special Papers " read by the Secretaries , referred , reported on , and discussed , is not exempt from liability to abuse .
