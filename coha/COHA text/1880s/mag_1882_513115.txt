TORPEDOES AND TORPEDO BOATS . qwq upon an enemy in the shortest possible time , and hence the once despised torpedo now occupies a place in the front rank . In the short space of a magazine article it is impossible to take more than a mere cursory glance at our subject ; but so complete in its details was the first recorded torpedo boat that it merits more than passing notice . Mr. David Bushnell , of Connecticut , who well earned the title of the " father of torpedo warfare , " built in 1775 a boat intended for submarine attack upon an enemy 's vessel . This craft contained sufficient air to enable the operator to remain half an hour under water , and it was so arranged as to be sunk to any desired depth by the flow of water into the hold ; rising was effected by pumping this water out . BU5HNELL ' 5 TORPEDO BOAT . // The depth was indicated by a glass water gauge illuminated by a piece of phosphorus . A screw-propeller , worked by hand or foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while a similar screw assisted in the descent and ascent . There was carried upon the outside of the boat a tin case , containing one hundred and fifty pounds of powder , so constructed as to be lighter than the bulk of water it displaced . To this case was attached a rope , the other end of which was fast to a wood-screw ; this latter was turned by a rod which passed through a tube in the top of the boat . The operator was supposed to make his way under the bottom of the vessel selected . Here he was to turn this rod , causing the screw to enter the plankin* , . This being done , the rod was to be removed , and the magazine cast off , when it would float the length of the rope , and thus remain In contact with the bottom . The detaching of the magazine set in operation a train of clock-work , arranged to run any desired length of time , at the expiration of which a strong flint and steel gun - lock was sprung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat constructed after Bushnell 's plan was used in 1776 in an unsuccessful attempt upon the Eagle in New York Harbor . A year later , Bushnell made an attempt to destroy the Cerberus in New London by using two floating tor pedoes connected by a long B line . These were set adrift on the ebb-tide , his idea being that the line would foul the chain of the frigate , and G n upon being discovered would be hauled in . As this was done the torpedo would strike the side of the vessel , and explosion would ensue , the mechanism being not unlike that just described . Fortunately for the Cerberus 's people , a captured schooner was lying near . A The line fouled her chain , and an explosion destroyed her entirely . Bushnell also arranged the barrel torpedoes which FULTON ' 5 TORPEDO AND GUN . were floated down the Del- qwq earlier essay : this one , however , was of the familiar cigar shape . In it Fulton remained over four hours under water , he having arranged a tank with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He blew up a small vessel in the harbor of Brest with a twenty-pound torpedo which he had attached to her bottom . The French government gave him little encouragement ; consequently he transferred his stock in trade to England , where Pitt , then Premier , assisted him in various ways . His plans included not only his submarine vessel , but also torpedoes which , floating at or near the surface , should be brought by the tide in contact with a vessel ; with one of these last he blew up a brig in presence of Pitt and various naval officers . The Earl St. Vincent remarked that " Pitt was the greatest fool that ever existed , to encourage a mode of war which they who commanded the seas did not want , and which , if successful , would deprive them of it . " Herein the noble earl was unquestionably correct , for a weak nation can now defend itself more easily than ever before . His views prevailed , for Fulton was dismissed with a gratuity , and returned to this country to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have dropped the Nautilus altogether , as his proposals took the shape shown in the illustration , in which A is the torpedo ; B , a // be carried in a launch or other row-boat . The gun being fired at the bow of a vessel , the harpoon would stick in the plank , the torpedo would float against the side , and explosion would ensue . After a number of trials , he succeeded in destroying a vessel at New York , and finally Congress appropriated five thousand dollars to enable him to make experiments against a naval vessel . A commission was appointed by the Secretary of the Navy to witness them , of which Comniodore Rodgers was a member . The commodore so surrounded the Argus with nets and other obstructions that Fulton was foiled , and the attack was FRAME ARD FILE TORFEDOEs. unsuccessful . Although Chancellor Livingston thought it " one of the most unportant military discoveries , " and though Morgan Lewis deemed the torpedo " entitled to rank among the best and cheapest defenses of ports , " yet Commodore rodgers 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Fulton in disgust dropped the subject forever . In 1842 , Samuel Colt , best known to the world as the inventor of the revolver , brought to the notice of the government his scheme for torpedo warfare . He first employed electricity as an igniting agent , and by this means destroyed a schooner at anchor in the Potomac , while five miles distant from her : later he destroyed a vessel under way , a few minutes after her abandonment by the crew . Notwithstanding these successes , he received no encouragement , the general sentiment of both the military and naval authorities being averse to this mode of warfare . Colt 's methods were secret , but to him unquestionably belongs the honor of being the pioneer in the use of the electric current by means of an insulated cable . Torpedoes were employed to some extent by the Russians in the Crimean war , but without any great effect , save to give the enemy a wholesome horror of them . It remained for our own civil war to bring them into prominence , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first found by our forces in the Savannah River in February , 1862 . These were rather crude affairs , it being intended that passing vessels should entangle lines , which , on being pulled , should cause a friction primer to explode . These were not successful , being quite easily found and removed , so that there was but little delay caused in the movements of the besieging force . About this time , however , a regular Torpedo Corps was organized at Richmond , and much attention was paid by them to the perfection of this very important weapon . Naturally the first use was for defensive purposes , and frame or pile torpedoes were very suc cessfully used to close various water-courses . It was nearly impossible to remove them , and hence our vessels never attempted to penetrate channels where they were known to be planted . The shell was secured to the timber by heavy bolts , and explosion ensued whenever a passing vessel struck one of the fuses . These were so sensitive that a blow of ten pounds was quite sufficient to explode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very thin cap of soft copper , which yielded readily to a slight pressure . Another device for a fuse was a leaden tube containing a mixture of chlorate of potash and sugar , inclosing in turn a glass tube in which was sulphuric acid ; upon the lead being struck , the glass was broken , and the contact between the acid and the mixture resulted in a fierce flame , which was communicated to the powder . A most easily constructed and muchdreaded affair was the barrel torpedo , made of a lager-beer keg rendered watertight by being pitched , and given flotation by the addition of conical pieces of pine . They were provided with several of the sensitive primers already described . They were easily made and readily placed , but required to be most securely anchored , for if once adrift , they were as dangerous to friend as to foe . A more elaborate affair was the buoyant spar torpedo , with its accompanying " devil 's circumventor . " Owing to its // form and mode of anchoring , it was quite unlikely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a line attached to the primer of the circumventor would in all probability cause its explosion , to the great damage if not destruction of those engaged in the work . Various devices were used to " carry the war into Africa . " The most formidable were in the shape of a lump of coal . They were made of cast iron , and when covered with a mixture of tar and coal dust , would readily be taken as pieces of the indispensable fuel . They were intended to be placed in the coal piles whence our vessels were supplied . A number of explosions , otherwise en tirely unaccountable , are attributed to the use of this peculiarly wicked and treacherous device . A tremendous explosion was caused at City Point by the use of a plain case of wood , having clockwork and a percussion arrangement in one corner . This was placed near the powder which was being unloaded , by a man in the guise of a laborer , who belonged to the secret service corps upon the other side . All these and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances , and hence the chance of the explosion of any given torpedo was but very slight . The electric fuse , however , obviated this difficulty , and placed the control of the weapon in the hands of an operator on shore . These weapons were generally of boiler iron , the fuse being in the centre of the charge ; the fuse was simply a small section of goose-quill filled with fulminate of mercury , through which passed a small platinum wire connected to the copper wires leading from the battery ; upon the passage of the current this platinum became heated , exploding the fulminate , which , in turn , set fire to the powder . Briefly stated , this is the principle upon which electric fuses are still constructed , though other forms are in use . Possessing control of the torpedo , it became economically possible to construct them of huge dimensions , some holding nearly a ton of powder . They were generally placed in narrow channels , where a vessel passing would be obliged to go directly over them , or nearly so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper time to have arrived . A defect in the connections of course rendered the torpedo perfectly harmless  --  a circumstance which proved of infinite importance to the New Ironsides during the siege of Charleston . On one occasion this vessel was directly over one of these huge mines for more than an hour , but it could not be fired . It was afterward ascertained that the cable had been injured by a passing cart upon the beach . It was one of these large mines which was the means of destroying the gunboat Commodore Jones , in the James River , in May , 1864 . This vessel was in the van of the fleet engaged in searching for evidences of torpedoes , when suddenly , without any premonition whatever , her whole fabric was lifted bodily from the water , followed immediately by a column of water , which tore through her hull , carrying great pieces of her frame-work , mingled with a confused mass of guns , stores , and human beings , high into the air . When the water , with its unaccustomed freight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jones were found floating in the river , together with a few struggling wretches , who were quickly picked up by the boats of the fleet . BARREL TORPEDO . FLOATING SPAR TORPEDO AND DEVIL cIRCUMVENTOR. // A similar occurrence took place at Mobile , where the iron-clad Tecumseh was sunk almost instantaneously . No nober instance of heroisni adorns the page of history than that exhibited by the chivalrous Craven , her commander , who , having given orders for the abandonment of the ship , and finding himself and his pilot at the foot of the ladder leading to the top of the turret and to safety , gallantly stepped to one side , saying , with a polite wave of the hand , " After you , sir , " thus ( so short was the time ) going down with his ill-fated craft , while the pilot , the water following close upon his heels , reached the roof of the turret , and was saved - saved to tell the story how the gallant Craven gave to his subordinate the one chance for life which remained between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cause of the Tecumseh 's loss ; a similar one sunk the Patapsco at Charleston in less than a minute after the explosion . Many other successful cases of torpedo explosions induced the Torpedo Corps to make attempts at using the new weapon offensively , and torpedo boats were planned after many ingenious devices . The diminutive proportions of these little craft , as compared with the huge bulk of their antagonists , rendered the comparison of the shepherd boy of Israel and the giant of Gath not an inapt one , and they were known to our forces by the generic The first attack ever made by a steam torpedo - boat upon an enemy 's vessel would seem to merit some attention . The vessel whose destruction was attempted was the frigate New Ironsides , whose appearance in action was always viewed . with dismay by the enemy , so extremely rapid and accurate was her fire , driving the gunners to their bomb-proofs , and permitting the work of the army to go on unmolested . Naturally her continued presence was a source of pride to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine o'clock one evening in October , 1863 , the lookouts of the Ironsides discovered something which looked like a boat approaching ; the only answer to the hail , " Boat , ahoy ! " was a musket-shot , followed instantly by an explosion close alongside , which shook the vessel to her centre , *thro*vin g a great quantity of water into the air . A perfect hail-storm of bullets was sent after the adventurous little craft as she drifted into the darkness , and a boat was sent in search of her . Two of her crew were found floating by the aid of life-preservers , but no vestige of the David . After the war had closed , it was ascertained that two of the crew , finding their vessel not sunk , swam to her , and once more kindling her fires , steamed back to Charleston . Not long after this the Housatonic , a wooden sloop of war , was destroyed by a David . The little H CONFEDERATE DAVID . term of Davids . The illustration shows very clearly the salient points of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the protruding spar , and was exploded on contact , being provided with the sensitive primer . A number were built , and had the war lasted longer , much damage would doubtless have been inflicted upon our fleet . They were propelled by steam , having a speed of seven or eight miles an hour . A vessel at anchor on the blockade , seeing one of the Davids , found her only safety in instant flight ; but they were so low in the water that they could readily approach very close before being detected . craft which accomplished this feat had quite a tragic history , having during her experimental trials been thrice sunk , each time with the loss of her crew , and finally going down , for the last time , with all on board , when she had finished her mission . While the Southern naval men were thus active , they were building in nearly every blockaded port one or more irondads as well . One of these , the Albemarie , had been successful in a battle with our vessels in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatly endangered our naval supremacy in these waters . About this time Messrs . Wood and Lay , of the Engineer Corps of the // navy , had invented a torpedo to be used in steam-launches , the method of operating which will readily be understood from the illustration . It was constructed so as to be lighter than its bulk of water . The air-chamber at the top was supposed to give direction to the effect of the charge . Through the centre of the torpedo was a tube , at the bottom of which , communicating with the powder , was an ordinary percussion-cap . A small grape-shot was held by a pin at the upper end of this tube , and to the pin was attached a lanyard , which was controlled by the operator in the boat . The whole affair rested in a scoop at the end of the spar which projected from the boat , and was kept in its position by a second pin , the lanyard of which was also worked by the operator . A third rope , fastened on one side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torpedo , and when hauled upon in the boat , after the pin had been drawn out , threw it clear of the scoop , when it immediately assumed an upright position , and rose until it touched the bottom of the vessel attacked . Whenever in the judgment of the operator this contact had taken place , he pulled the remaining lanyard and drew out the pin , allowing the grape-shot to fall upon the cap , when explosion ensued . This weapon , of so complicated a character that it would seem almost impracticable to have everything work successfully , has been so fully described be of lieutenant-commander when but twenty-one years of age . In such enterprises as this Cushing was in his element . He had secured to his person the three ropes . necessary to be pulled in order to successfully attack his foe ; and in addition he held cords leading to the engineer and helmsman , by which he could transmit his orders without speaking . With all this complicated system of cords to manage , he never for an instant became confused but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Albernarle lie was hailed by her lookouts ; then , as he dashed at SECTION OF her with the full speed of TORPEDO USEL* which his little craft was BY CUSHING. capable , the light of a fire on shore permitted him to observe that she was surrounded by a cordon of logs , some thirty feet from her side ; at the same time a hail - storm of bullets was poured around the devoted little band , so that , to use Cushing 's own words , " the air seemed full of them . " Several were wounded ; but " Cushing 's luck " stood him in good stead , and he remained unhurt , though three bullets pierced his clothing . A less cool head than his would havc rigged out the spar at first sight of the BOAT USED BY LIEUTENANT GUSHING. cause with one like it was the launch armed with which the dauntless Cushing suiik the vessel which threatened to change the existing state of affairs in a manner not pleasant for us to contemplate . Of this feat a high English authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of Nelson , " and for it the youthful hero received the thanks of Congress , and was promoted to the grade enemy ; but Cushing took in the situation quickly , and knew that he must put the spar over the boom , if he would be successful . He therefore waited until his . boat struck it and pushed it in some distance toward the enemy ; then , with the bow half out of the water , still in the face of the musketry fire , and in momentary expectation of being opened upon with the great guns which lie could hear being // worked , he coolly launched his spar , and pulled his three lanyards in succession . This was accomplished just as the Albemarie 's first gun was fired , simultaneously with which the torpedo exploded , tearing a great bole in the ship 's side , and causing her to sink quickly . The column of water thrown up , in its descent filled the launch , and as she sunk beneath his feet , he told his comrades to save themselves as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fleet rcad like a fairy tale ; but the charmed existence which he ever seemed to bear took him through this , as through all other of his perils , in safety . Only a very small number of the many different sorts of torpedoes invented during the continuance of the war have been noticed , but enough has been detailed to show how much damage the comparatively inferior weapons of that day could accomplish . Since the close of that struggle , which established the torpedo as an authorized weapon , much time and talent have been devoted to its improvement . Still the main reliance of a torpedo attack is upon " a bag of powder on the end of a pole , " as it has been called ; it is chiefly in the speed of the launches and in the method of firing the torpedo that the greatest gain has been made . Much has been done in the way of increased speed . In this country we build launches of the Herreschoff type . The Lightning , one of this kind , has made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these boats is their boiler , in which steam can be raised to working pressure in five minutes or less , and can be kept there without difficulty . The illustration shows the salient features of the boilers , the water being contained in the coil of iron pipe , and passing to the separator in the form of steam . The propeller and rudder are also peculiarly arranged , and the whole boat ( which is built of wood ) is so light that she can be stopped in her own length when going at full speed , and she steers just as well when going astern as when going ahead . Unfortunately she is not well adapted for war purposes , save in an emergency ; still , in smooth water and under favorable circumstances , she might make a successful attack , provided she escaped in safety from the shower of balls and bullets which machine guns and revolving cannon would be casting at her . In England , Farrow and Thornycroft have built boats of great speed ; these are constructed of steel , and hence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and afford a protection for the crew from musketry fire , as they are covered over with a whale's-back , through which man-holes are cut to the different compartments ; they are also nearly noiseless , and some of them are smoke-consuming . Some of them are quite capable of service in a seaway , having proved this by steaming across the Bay of Biscay , one even venturing to cross the Atlantic to the South American coast , where she was wrecked . These boats are of course intended for torpedo service alone , and pre THE HERRESOHOFF BOILER . THE LIGHTNING. ** // sent great contrasts to the dull craft used in Cushing 's exploit . Their torpedo gear , however , does not differ in principle from that used by him ; strong , light , hollow steel spars carry the torpedo , which is fitted generally to explode either on contact or by electricity , and is not dependent upon the clumsy , complicated method upon which he was obliged to rely . Smaller boats are also built , which , like the Lightning , can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessels of any size are unprovided with these additions to their armament . A very peculiar form of torpedo is the invention of Commander Harvey , R.N. This is towed from a ship , or from a large tug specially constructed for the purpose , and being hung similarly to a boy 's kite , it diverges from the vessel 's wake at quite a large angle . It is somewhat heavier than water , and is supported by a buoy of cork , which prevents it from sinking when placed in the water . So soon as a strain is brought upon the tow - rope it darts quickly to its place , remaining at the surface until the line is slacked , which is done as it approaches an enemy . The torpedo then dives , and upon contact with the bottom of the vessel is exploded . This was thought to be so excellent a weapon that it was adopted in the English navy , and largely in other services . Later developments have caused it to be dropped as a practical weapon . A boat large enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effectively employed , and as an addition to the outfit of an ordinary cruiser , Harvey 's invention is , to say the least , of but doubtful utility . The cruising vessels of our own and of several other navies are provided with spars which project some forty feet from the side , and carry torpedoes containing about a hundred pounds of explosive . It remains to be shown in practice whether this plan will prove of utility in action . England has built one or two quite large vessels solely for torpedo purposes , and her example has been followed by other nations . In our navy we have the Alarm and Intrepid , the former designed by Admiral Porter . She is of iron , with double bottom and water - tight compartments . She carries one heavy gun in the bow , and is provided also with a ram and torpedo spars , the latter projecting through the side some feet under water . She has also an additional spar extending , directly in line with the keel , some thirty feet beyond the point of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of the Mallory steering propeller , which may be briefly defined as rudder and propeller in one . The four inches of armor at the bow is intended to deflect any shot that might strike her . Unquestionably , if the great desideratum , speed , can be obtained , she will prove a most formidable vessel ; and she seems to combine in an advantageous manner the elements of the coming gunboat fleet . The Intrepid can not be said to be a success ; almost any large tug will be as serviceable as she , for she has at present no special torpedo appliances thal* can not be used by other vessels . The latest vessel designed solely for torpedo warfare is the production of the genius of John Ericsson . If the accounts which have reached the public are trustworthy , the Destroyer is not excelled by any torpedo vessel now afloat . She is reported to have great speed , and to be so constructed as to be practically invulnerable to ordinary shot . Her chief point of merit lies , however , in the armament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water-line , which discharges through the bows a shell or torpedo containing two hundred and fifty pounds of explosive material to be fired upon contact . This new weapon is forced from the gun by a comparatively small charge of gunpowder , its extreme range being about two hundred and fifty yards . Contrary to the ordinarily received ideas , Mr. Ericsson has succeeded in demonstrating that this shell can be so fired , and we may look for great efficiency from this new triumph of his genius . All these craft which we have been consideriiig require the presence of human agency on board in order that they may l ) erform their work . We come now to the more ingenious and more formidable type , which is propelled by machinery contained within itself , and which is only large enough to carry the explosive in addition to the engines . This type is divided into two classes : those which , once launched and their machinery set in motion , act automatically , and those of which the control is retained by an operator on shore . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact the only one ever practically perfected , is the celebrated Whitehead . This is built of thin , iron or steel , being in its general form not unlike the Lay , though not quite so // qwq by means of compressed air , or it may be started by hand ; tubes for firing it ( quite similar to those of the Destroyer ) have been fitted to many foreign vessels , and the inventor has reaped a great harvest , nearly every European government having purchased the secret at a heavy price . Our own government , however , has not yet deemed it advisable to make any purchase , though it has been pressed upon the naval authorities at various times . The explosive is carried in the bow compartment , being fired on contact ; its speed for a short distance is at the rate of more than twenty miles per hour . It is believed to be , on the whole , too complicated and costly , and has not yet met with any great success in the trials it has had in actual warfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ericsson ; its motive power was compressed air , furnished to the engines from a pump on shore , through a tubular cable paid out as it progressed . An increase or diminution of the normal pressure caused a movement of the helm ; it was also provided with an ingenious diving apparatus . Its great and apparently insurmountable defect was want of speed . The most successful type of the movable torpedo is found in the invention of Mr. John L. Lay , of Buffalo , New York , who has heretofore been mentioned as asalways under the control of the operator , who can stop or start it , steer to either one side or the other , or fire the charge whenever he pleases . All these things are of course extremely advantageous , and greatly enhance the value of the weapon . The motive power is carbonic acid gas . This gas ( as is well known ) becomes liquefied under a pressure of forty atmospheres , . and in this state it is stored in a flask in the boat . When the valve closing this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is taken to the engine , first passing an automatically acting reducing valve , s&amp; that the pressure will not be too great . As the liquid expands , great cold is produced , and trouble is experienced from its use as a motor ; this , however , is not a serious difficulty , and some remedy will doubtless be found . The explosive chaniher , containing five hundred pounds of material , is at the bow , and is so constructed that on contact with a vessel it is disengaged from its resting-place , and drops several feet , the idea being that an explosion in that position will do more damage than at the water-line . In one compartment of the boat is a drum , from which is paid out the cable through which the electric current passes . A suitable arrangement of magnets opens a valve which allows gas to enter a cylinder , the piston in which causes the helm to be put in the LAY TORPEDO BOAT . // desired direction ; and a similar arrangement causes the throttle of the engine to open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is desired , or it may always be kept under the operator 's control . Some of these boats have but one wire in the cable , over which the various functions are caused to operate ; others have a multiple cable , with a wire for each thing required to be done . Over a mile and a half of wire is carried , so that the effective range becomes very much greater that that of any of its rivals . Mr. Lay is constantly at work introducing improvements , all of which are protected by numerous patents . His system has been definitely adopted by Russia after a satisfactory trial of ten of the boats built for her . A factory has been established , and it is proposed to use them very extensively in any future war . The sensation is by no means a pleasant one that this fish-like monster causes when seen pursuing its way through the water as if endowed with life , obedient to the will of the operator , who controls its motions by the simple pressure of a key . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are two guide-rods elevated some five or six feet above its top , which is just awash . These rods bear different-colored flags by day and lanterns by night ; these are screened from view except from aft , so that the approach of the boat is entirely hidden . So noiseless is the advance , and so little opportunity is there for discovery , that at an experimental trial before the Belgian authorities one was sent , upon a dark night , between two boats anchored about twenty feet apart , without the slightest intimation of the fact to the officers who were on the lookout for it ; it was not until after the torpedo had passed them that they saw the lights . This feat was accomplished by an operator more than half a mile distant . So far as the question of controllability is concerned , the Lay is far in advance of any other ; it now remains only to devise some means by which the speed can be raised to sixteen miles an hour to render it the most formidable of all torpedoes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Simms , which promises very well , having attained a very reasonable degree of speed . With the recent advances in electrical practice , there is not much doubt that in the near future an efficient craft of this kind will be built , the aid of steam being called in to turn a dynamo-electric machine on shore , from which the current will be transmitted over a cable , paid out like that of the Lay , to the electro - motor which will drive the boat . Both the Lay and the electric torpedoes , however , have some disadvantages : the former requires to be used near some place at which the gas may be liquefied ; the latter necessitates the use of a steamengine . The Whitehead has the advantage over these that it can be carried in sea-going vessels , as suitable machinery for compressing the air necessary to drive it can readily be accommodated . In this respect the electric boat is superior to the Lay , for it also can be carried to sea , space for its dynamo machine being readily attainable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of twenty miles an hour ( and it can be built ) , we shall possess a weapon which will be able to sink the stoutest iron-clad that floats . The latest wars have shown a few examples of the use of the torpedo . The very latest device used by the Peruvians was the setting adrift of a launch loaded with vegetables , fruits , etc. ; underneath them was stowed a large amount of explosive . This boat was picked up by a Chilian vessel , and hauled alongside to be discharged . As the articles were removed , the weight upon a spring was lessened , and finally the mine was fired , causing the destruction of the vessel and the loss of many lives . In the Franco-Prussian war the fear of the torpedoes with which the Prussians were reported to have stocked their waters was quite sufficient to deter the French from making any serious attempts to annoy their enemy : this is a good example of their moral effect . An eminent officer of our own navy once very truly said that " it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to expose one of the costly iron-clads of the present day to the chance of destruction by torpedoes : the amount at stake was too great to enable one to use his ship as of old , when she was exposed only to the fire of artillery . * In the Russo-Turkish war a number of attacks were made by the Russians . With launches armed with the spar torpedo , of five attacks but one was successful , a donble-turreted Monitor being destroyed . At another time the Russian boat got alongside a Turkish iron-clad without being discovered , but the torpedo did not explode , // owing to defects in the connecting wires from the battery , caused by the cable haying been chafed by the screw . On another occasion the torpedo was exploded just an instant too soon , before contact was fully made , the only result being to deluge both the assailant and the assailed with the column of water . With the Whitehead but one vessel ( a revenue-cutter ) was destroyed , though several attempts were made . In the case of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more in company . A device likely to be employed in future wars was the use of a large merchant steamer to carry a number of small boats fitted with spar torpedoes , thus enabling a descent to be made upon a blockading fleet from seaward . The moral effect of these weapons was again shown , and the truth of the remark referred to above proven , in the fact that the Turkish fleet kept at a safe distance from the iRussian ports during the entire war . No allusion has been made either to the explosives used or to the various ways from time to time brought forward for their ignition , as these matters alone would fill quite as much space as is allotted to the whole of this article . Suffice it to say , however , that in lieu of gunpowder there have been employed the higher explosives , gun-cotton and nitro-glycerine in its various forms . Doubtless these will in the future entirely replace the more bulky and weaker powder . Torpedoes for offensive purposes are generally provided with both automatic and controllable electric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small dynamo machine . The subject of the defense of harbors by torpedoes or mines is one that can not fully be entered into here . For our own coast , the accomplished head of the engineering school at Willet 's Point , General Abbott , has devised plans which are of the most comprehensive character . Generally speaking , mines of this description are provided with outlying buoys , in which is some sort of an arrangement by which on being struck by a vessel the circuit of the battery is closed , and the mine fired . This is in addition to the control which is possessed on shore , whence explosion can be caused whenever it is desired . Should a friendly vessel wish to pass , the battery can be switched off , and the passage made with safety . Methods are devised by which , with a chart of the harbor , upon which is indicated the location of each mine , the course of an entering vessel can be followed , and when she is in the correct H EFFECT OF six HUNDRED AND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OF AN iRON-CLAD ) AT A DiSTANCE OF TWENTY-THREE AND A HALF FEET .
