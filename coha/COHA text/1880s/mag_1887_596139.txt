IS the date of inauguration approached , formal invitations , without party distinction , came from the legislatures of Indiana , Ohio , Pennsylvania , New York , New Jersey , and Massachusetts , tendering Mr. Lincoln the hospitalities of those States and their people , and inviting him to visit their capitals on his journey to Washing . ton . Similar invitations also came to him from the municipal authorities of many cities and towns on the route , and railroads tendered him special trains for the use of himself and family . Mr. Lincoln had no fondness for public display , but in his long political career he had learned the importance of personal confidence and live sympathy between representatives and constituents , leaders and people . About to assume unusual duties in extraordinary times , he doubtless felt that it would not only be a gracious act to accept , so far as he could , these invitations , in which all parties had freely joined , but that both people and executive would be strengthened in their faith and patriotism by a closer acquaintance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Accordingly he answered the governors and committees that he would visit the cities of Indianapolis , Columbus , Cincinnati , Cleveland , Pittsburg , Buffalo , Albany , New York , Trenton , Philadelphia , and Harrisburg , while to the governor of Massachusetts he replied that the want of time alone constrained him to omit that State from his route of travel . Monday , the 11th day of February , was fixed as the time of departure , and a programme and schedule of special trains from point to point were arranged , extending to Saturday , the 23d , the time of arrival in Washington . Early Monday morning ( the i ith ) found Mr. The presidential party which made the whole journey consisted of the following persons : Mr. Lincoln , Mrs. Lincoln , their three sons , Robert T. , William , and Thomas , Lockwood Todd , Doctor W. S. Wallace , John G. Nicolay , John Hay , Hon. N. B. Judd , Hon. David Davis , Colonel E. V. Sumner , Major David Hunter , Captain George W. Hazard , Captain John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ellsworth , J. M. Burgess , George C. Latham , W. S. Wood , and B. Forbes . Lincoln , his family , and suite at the rather dingy little railroad station in Springfield , with a throng of at least a thousand of his Spnngfield neighbors who had come to bid him goodbye . It was a cloudy , stormy morning , which served to add gloom and depression to the spirits . The leave-taking became a scene of subdued anxiety , almost of solemnity . Mr. Lincoln took a position in the waiting-room , where his friends filed past him , often merely pressing his hand in silent emotlon . The half-finished ceremony was broken in upon by the ringing bells and the rushing train . The crowd closed about the railroad car into which the President-elect and his party * made their way . Then came the central incident of the morning . Once more the bell gave notice of starting ; but as the conductor paused with his hand lifted to the bell-rope , Mr. Lincoln appeared on the platform of the car , and raised his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the falling snow-flakes , and standing thus , his neighbors heard his voice for the last time , in the city of his home , in a farewell address t so chaste and pathetic , that it reads as if he already felt the tragic shadow of forecasting fate : " My friends : no one , not in my situation , can appreciate my feeling of sadness at this parting . To this place , and the kindness of these people , I owe everything . Here I have lived a quarter of a century , and have passed from a young to an old man . Here my children have been born , and one is buried . I now leave , not knowing when or whether ever I may return , with a task before me greater than that which rested upon Washington . Without the assistance of that Divine Being who ever attended him , I can not succeed . XVith that assistance , I can not fail . Trusting in Him , who can go with me , and remain with you , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will yet be well . To His care commending you , as I hope in your prayers you will commend me , I bid you an affectionate farewell . " Besides these a considerable number of other personal friends and dignitaries accompanied the President from Springfield to Indianapolis , and some of them to places farther on the route . t This address is here correctly printed for the first time , from the original manuscript , having been written down immediately after the train started , partly by Mr. Lincoln 's own hand and partly by that of his private secretary from his dictation . * Copyright by J. G. Nicolay and John Hay , 1886-7 . All rights reserved . VOL . XXXV. - 38. // A proper description of the presidential tour which followed would fill a volume . It embraced two weeks of official receptions by committees , mayors , governors , and legislatures ; of crowded evening receptions and interminable hand-shakings ; of impromptu or formal addresses at every ceremony ; of cheers , salutes , bonfires , military parades , and imposing processions , amid miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the general curiosity to see and hear the man who by the free and lawful choice of the nation had been called to exercise the duties of the presidential office . The universal eagerness was perhaps heightened by the fact that during the same two weeks the delegates from the States in insurrection were in session at Montgomery , Alabama , occupied with the temporary organization ofa government openly pledged to rebellion , and whose doings were daily reported by the telegraph and printed in every newspaper . Personal curiosity was thus supplemented by growing political anxiety , and every word of the President-elect was scanned for some lightby which to read the troubled and uncertain future . Mr. Lincoln was therefore obliged to measure his public utterances with unusual caution ; and while he managed to avoid any announcement of policy , the country was nevertheless able to read between the lines that it had made no mistake in the man to whom it had confided the preservation of the Government . It would , of course , be impossible in a single chapter to cite his many speeches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessity , a great deal of repetition . It will , perhaps , give a better idea of their general tenor to reproduce passages from a few of the most noteworthy . In reading these the critic must constantly bear in mind that they were reported and printed under such circumstances of haste and confusion that verbal accuracy could not be expected , and that they are but abstracts , in which the full structure of his sentences is often abridged or transposed to permit the whole to be brought within the limits of an ordinary press dispatch . The train which left Springfield in the morning arrived in Indianapolis before nightfall , where , in response to an address from Governor Morton , Mr. Lincoln said : " Most heartily do I thank you for this magnificent reception , and while I can not take to myself any share of the compliment thus paid , more than that which pertains to a mere instrument , an accidental instrument , perhaps , I should say , of a great cause , I yet must look upon it as a most magnificent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you for it . You have been pleased to address yourself to me chiefly in behalf of this glorious Union in which we live , in all of which you have my hearty sympathy , and , as far as may be within my power , will have , one and inseparably , my hearty coLiperation . While I do not expect , upon this occasion , or until . I get to Washington , to attempt any lengthy speech , I will only say that to the salvation of the Union , there needs but one single thing , the hearts of a people like yours . The people , when they rise in mass in behalf of the Union and the liberties of this country , truly may it be said , The gates of hell can not prevail against them . ' In all trying positions in which I shall be placed , and doubtless I shall be placed in many such , my reliance will be upon you and the people of the United States ; and I wish you to remember , now and forever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if the union of these States and the liberties of this people shall be lost , it is but little to any one man of fifty-two years of age , but a great deal to the thirty millions of people who inhabit these United States , and to their posterity in all coming time . It is your business to rise up and preserve the Union and liberty for yourselves , and not for me . . . . I appeal to you again to constantly bear in mind that not with politicians , not with Presidents , not with office-seekers , but with you , is the question , Shall the Union and shall the liberties of this country be preserved to the latest generations ? * ' The ceremonies during his stay here called out another address from him in which he asked the following pertinent questions : " I am here to thank you much for this magnificent welcome , and still more for the generous support given by your State to that political cause which I think is the true and just cause of the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time to keep silence , ' and when men wrangle by the month with no certainty that they mean the same thin c* , while using the same word , it perhaps were as well if they would keep silence . The words coercion ' and invasion ' are much used in these days , and often with some temper and hot blood . Let us make sure , if we can , that we do not misunderstand the meaning of those who use them . Let us get exact definitions of these words , not from dictionaries , but from the men themselves , who certainly appreciate the things they would represent by the use of words . What , then , is Coercion ' ? What is Invasion ' ? Would the marching of an army into South Carolina , without the consent of her people , and with hostile intent towards them , be invasion ' ? I certainly think it would ; and it would be coercion ' also if the South Carolinians were forced to submit . But if the United States should merely hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collect the duties on foreign importations , or even withhold the mails from places where they were habitually violated , would any or all of these things be invasion ' or coercion ' ? Do our professed lovers of the Union , but who spitefully resolve that they will resist coercion and invasion , understand that such things as these on the part of the United States would be coercion or invasion of a State ? If so , their idea of means to preserve the object of their affection would seem exceedingly thin and airy . If sick , the little pills of the homeopathist would be much too large for them to swallow . In their view , the Union , as a family relation , would seem to be no regular marriage , but a sort of free-love ' arrangement , to be maintained only on passional attraction . ' By the way , in what consists the special sacredness of a State ? I speak not of the position assigned to a State in the Union , by the Constitution ; for that , by the bond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a State can not carry out of the Union with it . I speak of that assumed primary right of a State to rule all which is less than itself , and ruin all which is larger than itself . If a State and a county , in a given case , should be equal in extent of territory , and equal in number of inhabitants , in what , as a matter of principle , is the State better than the // county ? Would an exchange of names be an exchange of rights upon principle ? On what rightful principle may a State , being not more than one-fiftieth part of the nation , in soil and population , break up the nation and then coerce a proportionally larger subdivision of itself , in the most arbitrary way ? What mysterious right to play tyrant is conferred on a district of country , with its people , by merely calling it a State ? Fellow-citizens , I am not asserting anything ; I am merely asking questions for you to consider . " At Columbus , Ohio , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joint session in the hall of the Assembly : " It is true , as has been said by the President of the Senate , that very great responsibility rests upon me in the position to which the votes of the American people have called me . I am deeply sensible of that weighty responsibility . I can not but know what you all know , that without a name , perhaps without a reason why I should have a name , there has fallen upon me a task such as did not rest even upon the Father of his Country ; and so feeling , I can not but turn and look for that support without which it will be impossible for me to perform that great task . I turn , then , and look to the American people , and to that God who has never forsaken them . Allusion has been made to the interest felt in relation to the policy of the new Administration . In this I have received from some a degree of credit for having kept silence , and from others some deprecation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . I have not maintained silence from any want of real anxiety . It is a good thing that there is no more than anxiety , for there is nothing going wrong . It is a consoling circumstance that when we look out , there is nothing that really hurts anybody . We entertain different views upon political questions , but nobody is suffering anything . This is a most consoling circumstance , and from it we may conclude that all we want is time , patience , and a reliance on that God who has never forsaken this people . " During a brief halt of the train at Steubenville , where a large crowd was assembled , he made the following short statement of the fundamental question at issue : " I fear that the great confidence placed in my ability is unfounded . Indeed , I am sure it is . Encompassed by vast difficulties as I am , nothing shall be wanting on my part , if sustained by the American people and God . I believe the devotion to the Constitution is equally great on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different understanding of that instrument that causes difficulty . The only dispute on both sides is , What are their rights ? ' If the majority should not rule , who would be the judge ? Where is such a judge to be found ? We should all be bound by the majority of the American people - if not , then the minority must control . Would that be right ? Would it be just or generous ? Assuredly not . I reiterate , that the majority should rule . If I adopt a wrong policy , the opportunity for condemnation will occur in four years ' time . Then I can be turned out , and a better man with better views put in my place . " N ecessarily omitting any description of the magnificent demonstrations , and the multiplied speeches in the great State and city of New York , his addresses in the capital of New Jersey must be quoted , because they show a culminating earnestness of thought and purpose . To the Senate he said : " I am very grateful to you for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I can not but remember the place that New Jersey holds in our early history . In the revolutionary struggle few of the States among the Old Thirteen had more of the battlefields of the country within their limits than New Jersey . May I be pardoned if , upon this occasion , I mention that away back in my childhood , the earliest days of my being able to read , I got hold of a small book , such a one as few of the younger members have ever seen , Weems ' Life of Washington . ' I remember all the accounts there given of the battle-fields and struggles for the liberties of the country , and none fixed themselves upon my imagination so deeply as the struggle here at Trenton , New Jersey . The crossing of the river ; the contest with the Hessians ; the great hardships endured at that time , all fixed themselves on my memory more than any single revolutionary event ; and you all know , for you have all been boys , how these early impressions last longer than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though I was , that there must have been something more than common that these men struggled for . I am exceedingly anxious that that thing - that something even more than National Independence ; that something that held out a great promise to all the people of the world to all time to come - I am exceedingly anxious that this Union , the Constitution , and the liberties of the people shall be perpetuated in accordance with the original idea for which that struggle was made , and I shall be most happy indeed if I shall be an humble instrument in the hands of the Almighty , and of this , his almost chosen people for perpetuating the object of that great struggle . You give me this reception , as I understand , without distinction of party . I learn that this body is composed of a majority of gentlemen who , in the exercise of their best judgment in the choice of a chief magistrate , did not think I was the man . I understand , nevertheless , that they came forward here to greet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - as citizeis of the United States - to meet the man who , for the time being , is the representative of the majesty of the nation - united by the single purpose to perpetuate the Constitution , the Union , and the liberties of the people . As such , I accept this reception more gratefully than I could do did I believe it were tendered to me as an individual . " Passing then to the Assembly Chamber , he addressed the members of the lower house in conclusion : " You , Mr. Speaker , have well said that this is a time when the bravest and wisest look back with doubt and awe upon the aspect presented by our national affairs . Under these circumstances , you will readily see why I should not speak in detail of the course I shall deem it best to pursue . It is proper that I should avail myself of all the information and all the time at my command , in order that when the time arrives in which I must speak officially , I shall be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safest , and from which I may have no occasion to swerve . I shall endeavor to take the ground I deem most just to the North , the East , the West , the South , and the whole country . I take it , I hope , in good temper , certainly with no malice toward any section . I shall do all that maybe in my power to promote a peaceful settlement of all our difficulties . The man does not live who is more devoted to peace than I am , none who would do more to preserve it , but it may be necessary to put the foot down firmly . Here the audience broke out into cheers so loud and long , that for some moments it was impossible to hear Mr. Lincoln 's voice . And if I do my duty and do right , you will sustain me , will you not ? Loud cheers , and cries of ' Yes , yes , we will . ' Received as I am by the // members of a legislature , the majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I trust that I may have their assistance in piloting the ship of State through this voyage , surrounded by perils as it is ; for if it should suffer wreck now , there will be no pilot ever needed for another voyage . " Perhaps in no one of the many addresses delivered during his tour was he so visibly moved and affected by his surroundings as when he spoke in Independence Hall in Philadelphia , which he visited on the 2 2d of February , the anniversary of Washington 's birthday . He said : " I am filled with deep emotion at finding myself standing in this place , where were collected together the wisdom , the patriotism , the devotion to principle from which sprang the institutions under which we live . You have kindly suggested to me that in my hands is the task of restoring peace to our distracted country . I can say in return , sirs , that all the political sentiments I entertain have been drawn , so far as I have been able to draw them , from the sentiments which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall . I have never had a feeling , politically , that did not spring from the sentiments embodied in the Declaration of Independence . I have often pondered over the dangers which were incurred by the men who assembled here and framed and adopted that Declaration . I have pondered over the toils that were endured by the officers and soldiers of the army who achieved that independence . I have often inquired of myself what great principle or idea it was that kept this Confederacy so long together . It was not the mere matter of separation of the colonies from the motherland , but that sentiment in the Declaration of Independence which gave liberty , not alone to the people of this country , but hope to all the world , for all future time . It was that which gave promise that in due time the weight would be lifted fiom the shoulders of all men and that all should have an equal chance . This is the sentiment embodied in the Declaration of Independence . Now , my friends , can this country be saved on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself one of the happiest men in the world if I can help to save it . If it can not be saved upon that principle , it will be truly awful . But if this country can not be saved without giving up that principle , I was about to say I would rather be assassinated on this spot than surrender it . Now , in my view of the present aspect of affairs , there is no need of bloodshed and war . There is no necessity for it . I am not in favor of such a course ; and I may say in advance that there will be no bloodshed unless it be forced upon the Government . The Government will not use force , unless force is used against it . " My friends , this is wholly an unprepared speech . I did not expect to be called on to say a word when I came here . I supposed it was merely to do something towards raising a flag - I may , therefore , have said something indiscreet . Cries of No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am willing to live by , and , if it be the pleasure of Almighty God , die by . " In his last speech of the series , delivered in Harrisburg , before the assembled legislature of Pennsylvania , he happily described another interesting ceremony which had taken place that same morning before leaving Philadelphia : " I appear before you only for a very few , brief remarks , in response  --  to what has been said to me . I thank you most sincerely for this reception , and the generous words in which support has been promised me upon this occasion . I thank your great commonwealth for the overwhelming support it recently gave , not me personally , but the cause which I think a just one , in the late election . Allusion has been made to the fact  --  the interestingfact , perhaps , we should saythat I for the first time appear at the capital of the great commonwealth of Pennsylvania upon the birthday of the Father of his Country . In connection with that beloved anniversary connected with the history of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene this morning in the ceremonies at Philadelphia . Under the conduct of gentlemen there , I was for the first time allowed the privilege of standing in the old Independence Hall , to have a few words addressed to me there , and opening up to me an opportunity of expressing , with much regret that I had not more time to express something of my own feelings , excited by the occasion , somewhat to harmonize and give shape to the feelings that had really been the feelings of my whole life . Besides this , our friends there had provided a magnificent flag of the country . They had arranged it so that I was given the honor of raising it . And when it went up , I was pleased that it went to its place by the strength of my own feeble arm . When , according to the arrangement , the cord was pulled , and it floated gloriously to the wind , without an accident , in the bright , glowing sunshine of the morning , I could not help hoping that there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least something of an omen of what is to come . Nor could I help feeling then , as I often have felt , in the whole of that proceeding I was a very humble instrument . I had not provided the flag ; I had not made the arrangements for elevating it to its place ; I had applied but a very small portion of my feeble strength in raising it . In the whole transaction I was in the hands of the people who had arranged it , and if I can have the same generous cooperation of the people of the nation , I think the flag of our country may yet be kept flaunting gloriously . I recur for a moment but to repeat some words uttered at the hotel , in regard to what has been said about the military support which the general government may expectfrom the commonwealth of Pennsylvania in a proper emergency . To guard against any possible mistake do I recur to this . It is not with any pleasure that I contemplate the possibility that a necessity may arise in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While I am exceedingly gratified to see the manifestation upon your streets of your military force here , and exceedingly gratified at your promise to use that force upon a proper emergency - while I make these acknowledgments I desire to repeat , in order to preclude any possible misconstruction , that I do most sincerely hope that we shall have no use for them ; thatit will neverbecome their duty to shed blood , and most especially never to shed fraternal blood . I promise that so far as I may have wisdom to direct , if so painful a result shall in anywise he brought about , it shall be through no fault of mine . " LINCOLN 'S SECRET NIGHT JOURNEY . ON the morning of February 23d the whole country was surprised at the telegraphic announcement , coupled with diverse and generally very foggy explanations , that the Presidentelect , after his long and almost triumphal journey in the utmost publicity and with well-nigh universal greetings of good-will , had suddenly abandoned his announced programme and made a quick and secret night journey through Baltimore to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for years afterward , was puzzled by the event , and the utmost contrariety // of comment , ranging from the highest praise to the severest detraction which caricature , ridicule , and denunciation could express , was long current . In the course of time , the narratives of the principal actors in the affair have been written down and published , * and a sufficient statement of the facts and motives involved may at length be made . The newspapers stated ( without any prompting or suggestion from Mr. Lincoln ) that an extensive plot to assassinate him on his expected trip through Baltimore about midday of Saturday had been discovered , which plot the earlier and unknown passage on Friday night disconcerted and prevented . This theory has neither been proved nor disproved by the lapse of time ; Mr. Lincoln did not entertain it in this formt nor base his course upon it . But subsequent events did clearly demonstrate the possibility and probability of attempted personal violence from the fanatical impulse of individuals , or the sudden anger of a mob , and justified the propriety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , plots to seize Washington , to burn the public buildings , to prevent the count of electoral votes and the inauguration of the new President , which had for six weeks filled the newspapers of the country , caused much uneasiness about the personal safety of Mr. Lincoln , particularly among the railroad officials over whose lines he was making his journey ; and to no one of them so much as to Mr. S. M. Felton , the President of the Philadelphia , Wilmington , and Baltimore Railway , whose line formed the connecting link from the North to the South , from a free to a slave State , from the region of absolute loyalty to the territory of quasirebellion . Independently of politics , the city of Baltimore at that time bore a somewhat unenviable reputation as containing a dangerous and disorderly element ; her " roughs " had a degree of newspaper notoriety by no means agreeable to quiet and non-combative strangers . But Baltimore and Maryland were also profoundly moved by the incipient rebellion . Governor Hicks had been plied with persuasion , protest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to convene the Maryland legislature , so that secession might begin under a legal pretext . The investigation of the Howard Congressional Committee , though it found no organized plot to seize the capital , gave * See narrative of S. M. Felton , in Schouler , " Massachusetts in the Civil War , " Vol . I. , pp. 59-65 ; Judd to Pinkerton , Nov. 3d , 1867 , Edwards , " Life of N. B. Judd , " pamphlet , pp. i-i7 ; Pinkerton , " The Spy of the Rebellion , " pp. 45-103 ; Kennedy to Lossing , embracing narrative of Colonel Stone , Lossing , " Civil War , " Vol . II. , pp. 147-149 ; Lincoln 's statement to Lossing , lb. , Vol . I. , pp. 279,280 ; Lincoln 's statement to Arnold , Arnold , " Lincoln and Slavery , " p. 171 ; and abundant traces of secession conspiracy of various degrees- especiallyof half-formed military companies , organizing to prevent Northern troops from passing through Baltimore to Washington or the South . As part and parcel of this scheme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burned . The events of April , as they actually occurred , had already been planned , informally at least , in January . Aside from patriotism , the duty of protecting the tracks and bridges of the railroad of which he was president induced Mr. Felton to call to his aid Mr. Allan Pinkerton , chief of a Chicago detective agency , whom he had before employed on an important matter . " He was a man of great skill and resources , " writes Mr. Felton . " I furnished him with a few hints and at once set him on the track with eight assistants . There were then drilling upon the line of the railroad some three military organizations , professedly for home defense , pretending tobe Union men , and in one or two instances tendering their services to the railroad in case of trouble . Their propositions were duly considered ; but the defense of the road was never intrusted to their tender mercies . The first thing done was to enlist a volunteer in each of these military companies . They pretended to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be wanting in sympathy for the South . They were furnished with uniforms at the expense of the road , and drilled as often as their associates in arms ; became initiated into all the secrets of the organizations , and reported every day or two to their chief , who immediately reported to me the designs and plans of these military companies . One of these organizations was loyal ; but the other two were disloyal , and fully in the plot to destroy the bridges , and march to Washington , to wrest it from the hands of the legally constituted authorities . Every nook and corner of the road and its vicinity was explored by the chief and his detectives , and the secret working of secession and treason laid bare and brought to light . Societies were joined in Baltimore , and various modes known to and practiced only by detectives were resorted to , to win the confidence of the conspirators and get into their secrets . The plan worked well ; and the midnight plottings and daily consultations of the conspirators were treasured up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . It was made as certain as strong circumstantial and positive evidence could make it , that there was a plot to burn the bridges and destroy the road , and murder Mr. Lincoln on his way to Washington , if it turned out that he went there before troops were called . If troops were first called , then the%ridges were to be destroyed , and Washington cut off and taken possession of by the South . I at once organized and armed a force of about two hundred men , whom I distributed along the line between the Susquehanna and Baltimore , principally at the bridges . These men were drilled secretly and regularly by drill-masters , and were apparently employed in whitewashing the bridges , putting on some six or seven coats of whitewash , saturated with salt and alum , MS. letters printed in this chapter . Also Lamon , " Life of Lincoln , " pp. 511-526. t Mr. Lincoln , long afterward , declared : " I did not then , nor do I now , believe I should have been assassinated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I thought it wise to run no risk , where no risk was necessary . " Hon. I. N. Arnold , inhis work , " Lincoln and Slavery , " adds in a note , p. 171 , that the above was " stated to the author by Mr. Lincoln . " // to make the outside of the bridges as nearly fire-proof as possible . This whitewashing , so extensive in its application , became the nine-days ' wonder of the neighborhood . Thus the bridges were strongly guarded , and a train was arranged so as to concentrate all the forces at one point in case of trouble . The programme of Mr. Lincoln was changed ; and it was decided by him that he would go to Harrisburg from Philadelphia , and thence over the Northern Central road by day to Baltimore , and thence to Washington . We were then informed by our detective that the attention of the conspirators was turned from our road to the Northern Central , and that they would there await the coming of Mr. Lincoln . " It appeared from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspicious indications were the very free and threatening expressions of a man named Ferrandini , an Italian , sometime a barber at Barnum 's Hotel in Baltimore , but who had become captain of one of the military companies organized in that city to promote secession . Ferrandini 's talk may not have been conclusive proof of a conspiracy , but it showed his own intent to commit assassination , and conveyed the inference of a plot.t Coupled with the fact that the Baltimore air was full of similar threats , it established the probability of a mob and a riot . Add to this Ferrandini 's testimony before the Howard Committee ( February 5th , i86x ) , that he was then drilling a company ( fifteen members ) of " Constitutional Guards " in Baltimore , formed for the express purpose " to prevent Northern volunteer companies from passing through the State of Maryland to come here Washington* to help the United States troops , or anybody else , to invade the South in any shape whatever " ; also that another corps , called the National Volunteers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and began drilling the previous Saturday ; also that he had " heard that the Minute Men have fifteen companies in Baltimore and we have the direct evidence of extensive organization , and strong presumption of the uses to which it could be turned4 Then , if we remember that riot , murder , and bridge-burning actually took place in Baltimore two months later , in exact accordance with the plans and ideas formulated , both in the loose talk and the solemn testimony by Ferrandini and others , we are unavoidably driven to the conclusion that Mr. Felton , General Scott , Governor I-licks , and others had abundant cause for the very serious apprehensions under which they acted . Hon. N. B. Judd , a resident of Chicago , of peculiar prominence in Illinois politics and the intimate personal friend of Lincoln , was perhaps the most active and influential member of the suite of the President-elect . Pinkerton * Schouler , " Massachusetts in the Civil War , " Vol . I. , pp. 6i , 62. t Lamon , " Life of Abraham Lincoln , " p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the presidential party approached , notified him by letter at Buffalo , and by special messenger at New York , of the investigations he was making in Baltimore . Judd as yet said nothing of the matter to any one . When the party arrived in Philadelphia , however , he was instantly called to a conference with Mr. Felton and the detective . Pinkerton laid his reports before the two , and , after an hour 's examination , both were convinced that the allegation of a plot to assassinate the President-elect was as serious and important as in the nature of things such evidence can ever be found . He immediately took Pinkerton with him to Mr. Lincoln 's room at the Continental Hotel , to whom the whole story was repeated , and where Judd advised that , in the opinion both of Mr. Felton and himself , Mr. Lincoln 's safety required him to proceed that same evening on the i i o'clock train . " If you follow the course suggested , " continued Judd , " you will necessarily be subjected to the scoffs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your friends , who can not be made to believe in the existence of so desperate a plot . " Mr. Lincoln replied that he appreciated these suggestions , but that he could stand anything that was necessary . Then rising from his seat he said : " 1 can not go to-night ; I have promised to raise the flag over Independence Hall to-morrow morning , and to visit the legislature at Harrisburg . Beyond that I have no engagements . " Hitherto , all Lincoln 's movements had been made under the invitation , arrangements , direction , and responsibility of committees of legislatures , governors of States , and municipal authorities of towns and cities . No such call or greeting , however , had come from Maryland ; no resolutions of welcome from her legislature , no invitation from her governor , no municipal committee from Baltimore . The sole proffers of friendship and hospitality out of the commonwealth came from two citizens in their private capacity - Mr. Gittings , President of the Northern Central Railroad , who tendered a dinner to Mr. Lincoln and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who extended a similar invitation to the Presidentelect and his suite .

During their ten-days ' experience on the journey thus * Report Select Committee of Five ( Howard Committee ) pp. 133-137. *Judd to Pinkerton , November 3d , 1867. // far , both he and his suite had had abundant evidence as to how completely exposed and perfectly helpless every individual of the party , and especially Mr. Lincoln , was at times , even amid the friendliest feeling and the kindest attention .

Yet with all these considerations Mr. Lincoln could not entirely convince himself that a deliberate plot to murder him was in existence . " I made arrangements , however , with Mr. Judd for my return to Philadelphia the next night , if I should be convinced that there was danger in going through Baltimore . I told him that if I should meet at Harrisburg , as I had at other places , a delegation to go with me to Baltimore , I should feel safe , and go on . " Mr. Judd devoted the remainder of the afternoon and nearly the whole of the night of February 21st to the discussion and perfection of arrangements for a night journey through Baltimore , as suggested by himself and Mr. Felton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons joined in this discussion , - Mr. Judd , Mr. Pinkerton , Mr. Franciscus , General Manager of the Pennsylvania Railroad , and Mr. Henry Sanford , representing Colonel E.

At 6 o'clock on the morning of February 22d , the appointed flag-raising by the President-elect , over Independence Hall in Philadelphia , was duly celebrated , and on the trip to Harrisburg , which followed as soon as possible , Mr. Judd communicated the details of his plan to Mr. Lincoln . Before this , however , Lincoln had received at the Continental Hotel the visit of Mr. Frederick W. Seward , who came as a special messenger from his father , in Washington , to place the following correspondence in his hands : Seward to Lincoln . " WASHINGTON , February 21st , iS6i .

He states that there are banded rowdies holding secret meetings , and that he has heard threats of mobbing and violence , and has himself heard men declare that if Mr. Lincoln was to be assassinated they would like to be the men . He states further that it is only within the past few days that he has considered there was any danger , but now he deems it imminent . He deems the danger one which the authorities and people in Baltimore can not guard against . All risk might be easily avoided by a change in the traveling arrangements which would bring Mr. Lincoln and a portion of his party through Baltimore by a night train without previous notice . " t t Judd to Pinkerton , November 3d , 1867. * Unpublished MS. // Here was a new and most serious additional warning . The investigation on which it was based was altogether independent of that made by Pinkerton , and entirely unknown to him . Colonel Stone , it will be remembered , was the officer to whom General Scott intrusted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Washington and the general supervision and control of the city . The detectives , three in number , were from New York , and at the request of Colonel Stone had been selected and placed on duty by Mr. Kennedy , superintendent of police of New York city. * In both cases similar observations had been made , and similar conclusions arrived at . Warned thus of danger by concurrent evidence too grave to be disregarded , and advised to avoid it , not only by Judd and Felton in Philadelphia , but now also by Mr. Seward , the chief of his new Cabinet , and by General Scott , the chief of the army , Mr. Lincoln could no longer hesitate to adopt their suggestion . Whether the evidence would prove ultimately true , or whether violence upon him would be attempted , was not the question . The existence of the danger was pointed out and certified by an authority he had no right to disregard ; the trust he bore was not merely the personal safety of an individual , but the fortune and perhaps the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his imperative duty to shun all possible and unnecessary peril . A man of less courage would have shrunk from what must inevitably appear to the public like a sign of timidity ; but Lincoln on this and other occasions concerned himself only with the larger issues at stake , leaving minor and especially personal consequences to take care of themselves . Mr. Frederick W. Seward was therefore informed by Judd " that he could say to his father that all had been arranged , and that , so far as human foresight could predict , Mr. Lincoln would be in Washington at 6 o'clock the next morning . " t With this message Mr. Seward returned to Washington , while Mr. Lincoln and his suite proceeded to Harrisburg , where on that same Friday , the 2 2d of February , he was officially received by the governor and the legislature of Pennsylvania . No other member of Mr. Lincoln 's suite had as yet been notified of anything connected with the matter ; but Mr. Judd had suggested to him that he felt exceedingly the responsibility of the advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Civil War , " Vol .

" To the above suggestions , " writes Judd , " Mr. Lincoln assented , adding : I reckon they will laugh at us , Judd , but you had better get them together . ' It was arranged that after tJTle reception at the State-house , and before dinner , the matter should be fully laid before the following gentlemen of the party : Judge David Davis , Colonel E. V.

The facts were laid before them by me , together with the details of the proposed plan of action . There was a diversity of opinion , and some warm discussion , and I was subjected to a very rigid cross-examination . Judge Davis , who had expressed no opinion , but contented himself with asking rather pointed questions , turned to Mr. Lincoln , who had been listening to the whole discussion , and said : Well , Mr. Lincoln , what is your own judgment upon this matter ? ' Mr. Lincoln replied : I have thought over this matter considerably , since I went over the ground with Pinkerton last night . The appearance of Mr. Frederick Seward , with warning from another source , confirms Mr. Pinkerton 's belief . Unless there are some other reasons besides fear of ridicule , I am disposed to carry out Judd 's plan . ' Judge Davis then said : That settles the matter , gentlemen .

M. , the others to go to the dinner table , and myself to go to the railroad station and the telegraph office . At a quarter to 6 I was back at the hotel , and Mr. Lincoln was still at the table . In a few moments the carriage drove up to the side door of the hotel . Either Mr. Nicolay or Mr. Lamon called Mr. Lincoln from the table . He went to his room , changed his dinner dress for a traveling suit , and came down with a soft hat sticking in his pocket , and his shawl on his arm . * As the party passed through the hall I said , in a low tone , Lamon , go ahead .

Here they were met by Mr. Seward and Mr. Washburne , member of Congress from Illinois , and conducted to Willard 's Hotel . The family and the suite made the journey direct from Harrisburg to Baltimore , according to the previously published programme , arriving in Washington late that evening . They encountered in Baltimore no incivility , nor any unusual disorder , though , as elsewhere , dense crowds , very inadequately controlled by the police , surrounded the railroad depots and filled the streets through which their carriages passed . All temptation , however , to commit an assault was now past , since it was everywhere known that Mr. Lincoln was not with the party , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ARRIVED in Washington , and installed in the spacious parlors on the second floor of VOL . XXXV. - 39 . Willard 's Hotel , fronting on Pennsylvania Avenue , Mr. Lincoln had a little more than a week to prepare for the inauguration . Of this a part was taken up with the customary introductory visits ,  --  to the outgoing President and Cabinet , where Mr. Buchanan and bis counselors received him with cordial politeness ; to the two houses of Congress , where he was enthusiastically welcomed by friends and somewhat sullenly greeted by foes ; and to the Supreme Court of the United States , whose venerable chief and associate justices extended to him an affable recognition as the lawful successor in constitutional rulership . In his own parlors , also , the President-elect received numerous demonstrations of respect . President Buchanan and his Cabinet officially returned his visit . The Peace Conference , embracing distinguished delegates from all the free States and the border slave-States , and headed by their chairman , ex-President Tyler , waited upon him in a body , in pursuance of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Breckinridge , each made him a call of courtesy . The mayor and the municipal council came in an official visit of welcome . Several delegations and many high functionaries repeated these ceremonial calls , which again were supplemented by numerous cordial invitations to private hospitality . While all these tokens of respect were sincere and loyal , there was no concealment of a deep anxiety in public feeling , and a curiosity to learn how the new President would deal with an organized rebellion , which had been allowed by his predecessor to establish itself without the least hindrance , and which , while committing repeated acts of war , had as yet perpetrated no violence or bloodshed ,  --  only , however . because it had met neither official nor military resistance . Mr. Lincoln 's chief labor during this interim was his consultation with the more influential leaders of the Republican party , who , either as members of Congress , delegates in the Peace Conference , or as casual or special visitors to the capital at this moment , had a final word to say to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his Administration . Thus from the 23d of February to the 4th of March , every moment of the day and many hours of the night were occupied . As his doors were at all times freely opened , Proceedings of Peace Conference , " Pp. 336-33 7 . WARD H. LAMON . ( FROM A PHOTOGRAPH BY BRADY. ) // and as his life-long habit was to listen patiently to counsel from all quarters , it is safe to say that no President ever approached his task better informed of the temper of his followers , and none decided more deliberately upon his general course of conduct . Yet , here as afterwards , he followed the practice of holding his convictions open to the latest moment , and of not irrevocably committing himself to specific acts till the instant of their execution . Neither in the formation of his Cabinet nor in his proposed administrative policy , however , did this final consultation with his party friends work any essential alteration of his own wellformed opinions . His executive counselors were chosen upon plans long since matured in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and privately printed at Springfield , received on the last days several slight changes in the text , and a number of verbal changes , mainly suggested by the very few individuals to whom he submitted it . Judge David Davis read it while in Springfield . Hon. 0 . H. Browning read it in Indianapolis after the presidential journey was begun , and suggested perhaps the most important modification which he made . Hon. Francis P. Blair , Sr. , read it in Washington , and highly commended it , suggesting no changes . As would be natural in any great political leader scanning his successful rival 's first act of practical statesmanship , the most careful scrutiny of the document was made by Mr. Seward . The President-elect handed him a copy some time during the day of his arrival ; and the next day being Sunday , Mr. Seward seems to have spent the greater part of it in examining the inaugural and in writing out the list of alterations and amendments which he thought advisable . On Sunday evening he wrote the following letter , which with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " SUNDAY EVENING , February 24th , i86i .

It has not been their duty to study it , as it has been mine . Only the soothing words which I have spoken have saved us and carried us along thus far .

The other modifications in his list were simple changes of phraseology - affecting only the style , but changing no argument or proposition of policy . Whether these were on the whole an improvement depends perbaps upon the taste of the reader and critic , whether he prefers a full and formal or a direct and sen tentious diction . The literary styles of Mr. Seward and Mr. Lincoln differed essentially . Mr. Seward was strongly addicted to and unusually felicitous in long , sonorous sentences , amplifying his thought to general application and to philosophic breadth .

" * Mr. Lincoln 's policy was , without prejudice or passion to state frankly and maintain firmly the position and doctrines assumed by the American people in the late presidential election . Mr. Seward believed himself to be the past and the coming peacemaker ; and thus his whole effort was to soften , to postpone , to use diplomacy . His corrections of the inaugural were in this view : a more careseized by the rebels , but for important change Mr. Lincoln himself made . In the original draft any idea of an amendment of the Constitution was rather repelled than invited . In the revision Mr. Lincoln said he should " favor rather than oppose a fair opportunity being afforded the people to act upon it , " and further expressed his willingness to accept the amendment recently proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopted , are added as notes to the text of the inaugural in this chapter , where the critical student will compare them with special interest . It was in the closing paragraph of the inaugural that Mr. Lincoln 's mastery in literary art clearly revealed itself . Mr. Seward , as we have seen in the postscript of his letter , thought that some words of affection - some of calm and cheerful confidence , " " to meet and remove prejudice and passion in the South , and despondency and fear in the East , " ought to be added . In the original draft the concluding sentence , addressing itself to " my dissatisfied fellow-countrymen , " was : " With you and ful qualification of statement , a greater ambiguity of phrase , a gain in smoothness , but a loss in brevity and force .

One of them was long and commonplace ; under the other lurked a fine poetic thought awkwardly expressed . This Mr. Lincoln took , but his more artistic sense transformed it into an illustration of perfect and tender beauty .

General Stone , who had charge of the military arrangements , has related them with some minuteness . " On the afternoon of the 3d of March , General Scott held a conference at his headquarters , there being present his staff , General Sumner , and myself ; and then was arranged the programme of the procession . President Buchanan was to drive to Willard 's Hotel and call upon the President-elect .

A battalion of District of Columbia troops were to he placed near the steps of the Capitol , and riflemen in the windows of the wings of the Capitol . On the arrival of the presidential party at the Capitol the troops were to be stationed so as to return in the same order after the ceremony .

When they reached the Senate Chamber , already densely packed with officials and civilians , the ceremony of swearing-in the Vice-President was soon performed . * General C. P.

Around this central group other judges in their robes , senators , representatives , officials , and prominent guests crowded to their seats . To the imaginative spectator there might have been something emblematic in the architectural concomitants of the scene . The construction of the great dome of the Capitol was in mid-progress , and huge derricks held by a network of steel ropes towered over the incomplete structure .

" 1 I do not consider it necessary at present for me to discuss those matters of administration about which there is no special anxiety or excitement . Apprehension seems to exist among the people of the Southern States that by the accession of a Republican Administration their property and their peace and personal security are to be endangered . There has never been any reasonable cause for such apprehension . Indeed , the most ample evidence to the contrary has all the while existed and been open to their inspection . It is found in nearly all the published speeches of him who now addresses you . I do but quote from one of those speeches when I declare that " I have no purpose , directly or indirectly , to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists . I believe I have no lawful right to do so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Those who nominated and elected me did so with full knowledge that I had made this and many similar declarations , and had never recanted them . And , more than this , they placed in the platform for my acceptance , and as a law to themselves and to me , the clear and emphatic resolution which I now read : " Resolved , that the maintenance inviolate of the rights of the States , and especially the right of each State to order and control its own domestic institutions according to its own judgment exclusively , is essential to that balance of power on which the perfection and endurance of our political fabric depend , and we denounce the lawless invasion by armed force of the soil of any State or Territory , no matter under what pretext , as among the gravest of crimes . " I now reiterate these sentiments ; and , in doing so , I only press upon the public attention the most conclusive evidence of which the case is susceptible , that the property , peace , and security of no section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Administration . I add , too , that all the protection which , consistently with the Constitution and the laws , can be given , will be cheerfully given ' to all the States when lawfully demanded , for whatever cause - as cheerfully to one section , as to another . There is much controversy about the delivering up of fugitives from service or labor . The clause I now read is as plainly written in the Constitution as any other of its provisions " No person held to service or labor in one State , under the laws thereof , escaping into another , shall in consequence of any law or regulation therein , be discharged from such service or labor , but shall be delivered up on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due . " It is scarcely questioned that this provision was intended by those who made it for the reclaiming of what we call fugitive slaves ; and the intention of the lawgiver is the law . All members of Congress swear their support to the whole Constitution - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To the proposition then , that slaves , whose cases come within the terms of this clause , " shall be delivered up " their oaths are unanimous . Now , if they would make the effort in good temper , could they not , with nearly equal unanimity , frame and pass a law by means of which to keep good that unanimous oath ? There is some difference of opinion whether this clause should be enforced by national or by State authority ; but surely that difference is not a very material one . If the slave is to be surrendered , it can be of but little consequence to him , or to others , by which authority it is done . And should any one , in any case , be content that his oath shall go unkept , on a merely unsubstantial controversy as to how it shall be kept ? Again , in any law upon this subject , ought not all the safeguards of liberty known in civilized and humane jurisprudence to be introduced so that a free man 1Mr . Lincoln 's original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The more modern custom of electing a Chief Magistrate upon a previously declared platform of principles supersedes in a great measure the necessity of re-stating those principles in an address of this sort . Upon the plainest grounds of good faith , one so elected is not at liberty to shift his position .

" Having been so elected upon the Chicago platform , and while I would repeat nothing in it , of aspersion or epithet , or question of motive , against any man or party , I hold myself bound by duty , as well as impelled by inclination , to follow , within the Executive sphere , the principles therein declared . By no other course could I meet the reasonable expectations of the country .

In the original draft this sentence stood : " The protection which , consistently with the Constitution and the laws , can be given will be cheerfully given to all the States , " etc . Mr. Seward proposed to amend it thus : " will be cheerfully given in every case and under all circumstances to all the States , " etc . Mr. Lincoln did not adopt the suggestion , but himself modified it so as to read : " will be cheerfully given to all the States when lawfully demanded , for whatever cause - // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slave ? And might it not be well at the same time to provide by law for the enforcement of that clause in the Constitution which guarantees that " the citizen of each State shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States ? " I take the official oath to-day with no mental reservations and with no purpose to construe the Constitution or laws by any hypercritical rules . And while I do not choose now to specify particular acts of Congress as proper to be enforced , I do suggest that it will be much safer for all , both in official and private stations , to conform to and abide by all those acts which stand unrepealed , than to violate any of them trusting to find impunity in having them held to be unconstitutional . It is seventy-two years since the first inauguration of a President under our National Constitution . During that period fifteen different and greatly distinguished citizens have , in succession , administered the Executive branch of the Government . They have conducted it through many perils , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of precedent , I now enter upon the same task for the brief constitutional term of four years , under great and peculiar difficulty . A disruption of the Federal Union , heretofore only menaced , is now formidably attempted.5 I hold that , in contemplation of universal law , and of the Constitution , the union of these States is perpetual . Perpetuity is implied , if not expressed , in the fundamental law of all National Governments . It is safe to assert that no Government proper ever had a provision in its organic law for its own termination . Continue to execute all the express provisions of our National Constitution , and the Union will endure forever - it being impossible to destroy it except by some action not provided for in the instrument itself . Again , if the United States be not a Government proper , but an association of States in the nature of contract merely , can it , as a contract , be peaceably un made by less than all the parties who made it ? One party to a contract may violate it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not require all to lawfully rescind it ? Descending from these general principles , we find the proposition that , in legal contemplation , the Union is perpetual , confirmed by the history of the Union itself . The Union is much older than the Constitution . It was formed , in fact , by the Articles of Association in 1774 . It was matured and continued by the Declaration of Independence in I 776 . It was further matured , 6 and the faith of all the then thirteen States expressly plighted and engaged that it should be perpetual , by the Articles of Confederation in 1778 . And , finally , in 1787 , one of the declared objects for ordaining and establishing the Constitution was , " toform a more perfect Union ' But if destruction of the Union by one , or by a part only , of the States be lawfully possible , the Union is less perfect than before the Constitution , having lost the vital element of perpetuity . It follows from these views , that no State , upon its own mere motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolves andordittancesto that effect are legally void ; and that acts of violence , within any State or States , against the authority of the United States , are insurrectionary or revolutionary , according to circumstances.8 I therefore consider that , in view of the Constitution and the laws , the Union is unbroken ; and to the extent of my ability , I shall take care , as the Constitution itself expressly enjoins upon me , that the laws of the Union be faithfully executed in all the States.9 Doing this I deem to be only a simple duty on my part ; and I shall perform it , so far as practicable , unless my rightful masters , the American people , shall withhold the requisite means , or in some authoritative manner direct the contrary.10 I trust this will not be regarded as a menace , hut only as the declared purpose of the Union that it will constitutionally defend and maintain itself . ' 1 In doing this there needs to be no bloodshed or violence ; and there shall be none , unless it be forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draft . Mr. Lincoln added it of his own accord . This sentence stood in the original : " They have conducted it through many perils ; and on the whole , with great success . " Mr. Lincoln adopted Mr. Seward 's suggestion to make it read : " and generally with great success . " tmIn the original this sentence read : " A disruption of the Federal Union is menaced , and , so far as can be on paper , is already effected . The particulars of what has been done are so familiar and so fresh , that I need not waste any time in recounting them . " Mr. Seward proposed to change it as follows : " A disruption of the Federal Union , heretofore only menaced , is now formidably attempted .

" 8 The first half of this sentence originally closed : " ordinances to that effect are legally nothing , " and the second half , " are insurrectionary or treasonable , according to circumstances . " Mr. Seward 's suggestions to strike out the word " nothing " and substitute the word void , " and to strike out the word " treasonable and substitute the word " revolutionary , " were adopted . * the original this sentence stood : " I therefore consider that the Union is unbroken ; and , to the extent of my ability , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be faithfully executed in all the States .

Before entering upon so grave a matter as the destruction of our national fabric , with all its benefits , its memories , and its hopes , would it not be wise to ascertain precisely why we do it ? 16 Will you hazard so desperate a step while there is any possibility that any portion of the ills you fly from have no real existence ? Will you , while the certain ills you fly to are greater than all the real ones you fly from - will you risk the commission of so fearful a mistake ? All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitutional rights can be maintained . Is it true , then , that any right , plainly written in the Constitution , has been denied ? 17 J think not . Happily the human mind is so constituted , 18 that no party can reach to the audacity of doing this . Think , if you can , of a single instance in which a plainly written provision of the Constitution 12 In the original draft this paragraph , after the first sentence , stood as follows : " All the power at my disposal will be used to reclaim the public property and places which have fallen : to hold , occupy , and possess these , and all other property and places belonging to the Government and to collect the duties and imposts ; but beyond what may be necessary for these objects , there will be no invasion of any State .

While the strict legal right may exist in the Government to enforce the exercise of these offices , the attempt to do so would be so irritating , and so nearly impracticable withal , that I deem it better to forego for the time the uses of such offices .

There are in this government as in every other , emergencies when the exercise of power lawful in itself is less certain to secure the just ends of administration , than a temporary forbearance from it , with reliance on the voluntary though delayed acquiescence of the people in the laws which have been made by themselves and for their own benefit .

At Indianapolis he gave a copy of his original draft to Hon. 0 . H.

On principle the passage is right as it now stands . The fallen places ought to be reclaimed . But can not that be accomplished as well or even better without announcing the purpose in your inaugural ? ' * Mr. Lincoln adopted Mr. Browning 's advice , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this paragraph another slight change of phraseology . For , " there will be no invasion of any State , " he substituted , " there will be no invasion , no using of force against or among the people anywhere .

" * paragraph originally closed with the following sentence : " This course will be pursued until current experience shall show a modification or change to be proper . " Mr. Lincoln himselfchangedthis soas to read : " The course here indicated will be followed , unless current events and experience shall show a modification or change to be proper . " He also added a part of the language proposed by Mr. Seward for the previous paragraph , as will be seen by comparison . a This sentence originally stood : " That there are persons who seek to destroy the Union , " etc . Mr. Seward proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That there are persons in one section as well as in the other , who seek to destroy the Union , " etc . Mr. Lincoln changed the amendment to , " That there are persons in one section or another who seek , " etc . Mr. Seward also proposed to add to the last clause of the sentence , after the word " them , " the following : " because I am sure they must be few in number and of little influence when their pernicious principles are fully understood . " Mr. Lincoln did not adopt the suggestion . 16Mr Lincoln himself struck out the word " Union " as it originally appeared in this sentence , and inserted in lieu the words " fabric , with all its benefits , its memories , and its hopes . " 17Mr . Seward proposed to insert the word " distinct " after the words " Is it true , then , that any , " in the second sentence of this paragraph . Mr. Lincoln did not adopt the suggestion . is In this sentence Mr. Lincoln himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // has ever been denied . If , by the mere force of numbers , a majority should deprive a minority of any clearly written constitutional right , it might , in a moral point of view , justify revolution - certainly would , if such right were a vital one . But such is not our case . All the vital rights of minorities and of individuals are so plainly assured to them by affirmations and negations , guarantees and prohibitions , 19 in the Constitution , that controversies never arise concerning them . But no organic law can ever be framed with a provision specifically applicable to every question which may occur in practical administration. * No foresight can anticipate , nor any document of reasonable length contain , express provisions for all possible questions . Shall fugitives from labor be surrendered by national or by State authority ? The Constitution does not expressly say . May Congress prohibit slavery in the Territories ? The Constitution does not expressly say . Must Congress protect slavery in the Territories ? The Constitution does not expressly say . From questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we divide upon them into majorities and minorities . If the minority will not acquiesce , the majority must , or the Government must cease . There is no other alternative ; for continuing the Government is acquiescence on one side or the other.21 If a minority in such case will secede rather than acquiesce , they make a precedent which in turn will divide and ruin them ; for a minority of their own will secede from them whenever a majority refuses to be controlled by such minority. * For instance , why may not any portion of a new confederacy , a year or two hence , arbitrarily secede again , precisely as portions of the present Union now claim to secede from it ? * All who cherish disunion sentiments are now being educated to the exact temper of doing this . Is there such perfect identity of interests among the States to compose a new Union as to produce harmony only , and prevent renewed secession ? Plainly , the central idea of secession is the essence of anarchy . A majority held in restraint by constitutional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes of popular opinions and sentiments , is the only true sovereign of a free people. * ' Whoever rejects it does , of necessity , fly to anarchy or to despotism . Unanimity is impossible ; the rule of a minority , as a permanent arrangement , is wholly inadmissible ; so that , rejecting the majority principle , anarchy or despotism in some form is all that is left . I do not forget the position , assumed by some , that constitutional questions are to be decided by the Supreme Court ; nor do I deny that such decisions must be binding , in any case , upon the parties to a suit , as to the object of that suit , while they are also entitled to very high respect and consideration in all parallel cases by all other departments of the Government2* And while it is obviously possible that such decision may be erroneous in any given case , still the evil effect following it , being limited to that particular case , with the chance that it may be overruled , and never become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could the evils of a different practice.n At the same time , the candid citizen must confess that if the policy of the Government , upon vital questions , affecting the whole people , is to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court , the instant they are made in ordinary litigation between parties in personal actions , the people will have ceased to be their own rulers , having to that extent practically resigned their government into the hands of that eminent tribunal. * Nor is there in this view any assault upon the phrase , " by affirmations and negations , " Mr. Seward proposed to make , " by affirmations and negations , guarantees and prohibitions . " Mr. Lincoln adopted the suggestion . * The phrase , " applicable to every question , " Mr. Seward proposed to change to , " applicable to every possible question .

" Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minority of their own number will secede from them , " Mr. Lincoln himself changed to , " a minority of their own will secede from them .

Her people , and , indeed , all secession people , are now being educated to the precise temper of doing this . " Mr. Seward proposed to substitute the names " Alabama or Florida ' * for " South Carolina " ; and the word " communities " for " people . " Instead of adopting this , Mr. Lincoln re-wrote the whole , as follows : " For instance , why may not any portion of a new confederacy , a year or two hence , arbitrarily secede again , precisely as portions of the present Union now claim to secede from it ?

It is a duty from which they may not shrink to decide cases properly brought before them , and it is no fault of theirs if others seek to turn their decisions to political purposes.a One section of our country believes slavery is right , and ought to be extended , while the other believes it is wrong , and ought not to be extendedA ' This is the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the law for the suppression of the foreign slave-trade , are each as well enforced , 31 perhaps , as any law can ever be in a community where the moral sense of the people imperfectly supports the law itself. * The great body of the people abide by the dry legal obligation in both cases , and a few break over in each . This , I think , can not be perfectly cured ; and it would be worse in both cases after the separation of the sections , than before . The foreign slave-trade , now imperfectly suppressed , would be ultimately revived without restriction in one section ; * while fugitive slaves , now only partially surrendered , would not be surrendered at all by the other . Physically speaking , we can not separate . We can not remove our respective sections from each other , nor build an impassable wall between them . A husband and wife may be divorced , and go out of the presence and beyond the reach of each other ; but the different parts of our country can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , and intercourse , either amicable or hostile , must continue between them . Is it possible , then , to make that intercourse more advantageous or more satisfactory after separation than before ? Can aliens make treaties easier than friends can make laws ? Can treaties be more faithfully enforced between aliens , than laws can among friends ? Suppose you go to war , you can not fight always ; and when , after much loss on both sides , and no gain on either , you cease fighting , the identical old questions as to terms of intercourse are again upon you . This country , with its institutions , belongs to the people who inhabit it . Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing Government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it , or their revolutionary right to dismember or overthrow it . " I can not be ignorant of the fact that many worthy and patriotic citizens are desirous of having the National Constitution amended . While I make no recommendation of amendments , I fully recognize the rightful authority of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either of the modes prescribed in the instrument itself ; and I should , under existing circumstances , favor rather than oppose a fair opportunity being afforded the people to act upon it . I will venture to add that , to me the convention mode seems preferable , in that it allows amendments to originate with the people themselves , instead of only permitting them to take or reject propositions originated by others , not especially chosen for the purpose , and which might not be precisely such as they would wish to either accept or refuse . I understand a proposed amendment to the Constitution - which amendment , however , I have not seen - has passed Congress , to the effect that the Federal Government shall never interfere with the domestic institutions of the States , including that of persons held to service .

Why should there not be a patient confidence in the ultimate justice of the people ? Is there any better or equal hope in the world ? In our present differences the people will have ceased to be their own rulers , having practically resigned their government into the hands of that eminent tribunal .
