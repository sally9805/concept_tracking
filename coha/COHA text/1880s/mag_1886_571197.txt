ARTICLE 11. - GOVERNMENT BY PARTY . II . THE PARTY AND THE ADMINISTRATION . Continued from the January Number , 1886 . THE re-apportionment of a revenue progressively diminishing with the liabilities of the state , affords the government all the larger opportunities for profitable discriminations in the creation of public power . It can confirm the allegiance , or avert the hostility of whole classes by taking off taxes , or by leaving them on , according to the urgency of the interests involved . Intimate alliances are formed , with ramifications far beyond the precincts of the supporting party , and for purposes alien to or not included in the party programme . The discouragement of bank circulation , the suppression of intemperance , the exclusion of foreign wares at real values from the American market , all these are interests unrepresented in the authentic doctrine of the Republican party , which was formed to suppress slavery , restore the Union , and complete the constituency . Yet the complete control which the government has of fiscal legislation , its almost undefined right of drawing revenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the party vote , which is the normal basis of its power , the support of those who , for any reason , are bent on having the obnoxious articles 7heavily taxed . Nevertheless , although the natural tendency of these extrapartizan measures is to release the Administration from the control of the Party , to set it free for purposes of its own by bringing in auxiliaries of another kind from abroad , they have always been the habitual practice of party government everywhere . There are , perhaps , not a dozen men in the United States-I am not sure there are two-who regard the disproportionate taxation of tobacco and alcoholic fluids as an illegitimate device of party warfare . At this moment the great Conservative party in England , or a section of it , is attempting to recover something of its wasting power , to tempt to it new adherents , by reviving , in the home of free-trade , the exploded // heresy of a protective tariff . It is to be added , further , that transactions of this sort need not involve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publicity of all law , and they take effect indiscriminately upon great masses of men . They are the abuse of a power whose methods of creation have not been perfectly defined , but abuses for partizan rather than personal ends ; and they serve the special interests of the Administration only indirectly , in a certain large and generous way , by prolonging artificially beyond its time , a majority whose distinctive doctrine has been fully vindicated and whose avowed ends have been fully accomplished . It is to the employment of power and not to its first creation , the expenditure and not the raising of revenue , that the scandals of the last twenty years belong . Here , in the dark background and purliens of government , under cover of the law , are gathered the unrecorded intrigues , the lawless bargains and briberies , the sale of privileges and the purchase of support , the distributions of spoil , whereby individuals have grown rich , coalitions have formed , and in the midst of which there has arisen an interest of the governing body at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By an apparent paradox , the material for these combinations-the funds of the conspiracy-has been abundantly provided in the overflow of a constantly diminishing revenue . In ordinary circumstances rising taxation , with its consequent increase of revenue , means that the state is in a strait between urgent liabilities and insufficient means . There is nothing available for unlawful use , or for special purposes of the governing body , because there is not enough for the exigencies of the State . This is the explanation of the superior purity of administration in old and heavily burdened societies like Great Britain and Germany . In these countries perversions of public power have nearly all taken on the more inveterate form of ancient laws and established institutions , and belong more to the creation of power , or to the ends for which it is employed , than to the manner of its employment . The wealth of the community is already taxed nearly to the limit of what it will bear , while inflowing revenue is drafted off by imperious necessities that can not be postponed // or trifled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion intolerant of needless taxes and of expenditures unaccounted for . Mr. Gladstone , who might have fallen on any one of a dozen questions , actually went out , with a parliamentary majority at his command , on the proposal to raise the duty on beer . Who supposes that he could have made any clandestine or corrupt use of the duty if he had got it ? In circumstances like these there can be little malversation , because there are no available funds left over in the jealously guarded equilibrium between revenue and expenditure . To the contrary of all this , and in a community situated as ours was at the close of the rebellion , the remission of taxes means always that there is already on hand more than enough for the wants of the State ; something , therefore , available for the use of the governing body ; that is , it has at its disposition a certain amount of treasure which is not taken promptly out of its hands by some imperious public necessity , and which it has a hundred ways of employing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this tempting balance in the hands of the government which gives the signal , and is the justification for every successive remission of taxes , exactly as the lack of funds is the signal for fresh taxation . There is thus always a superabundance in store until the final level of exact adjustment between revenue and liability has been reached ; and during the entire process the government avails of means denied to it when new taxes are.going on and the revenue is rising . To appreciate the situation perfectly we must recall the fact that during the four years of the war the people had habituated itself to lavish creations and to wasteful employment of public power . Whatever was needed in the dire peril of the State , or was said by any seeming authority to be needed , was promptly furnished wherever it came from and whatever it cost . There was no stint and no restraint anywhere on the part of the contributors ; from first to last the hand of the gov. eminent was forced by the patriotic emotion which staked the wealth and credit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural corrective to prodigality of this sort is in the reaction that follows prolonged effort , the economics forced upon the State when immense destructions of capital and maturing // obligations make themselves felt in the midst of exhausted energies and prostrate industries . As it turned out in this case , the reaction came in another way ; instead of taking to retrenchment , the people took boldly to production , to filling its emptied reservoirs , not by stopping wastes , but by creating new wealth . It followed that what had been the uncalculating generosity of the war went right along as the easy extravagance of prosperous peace . We became spendthrift in our abundance from the very fact that we had been self-sacrificing in a strait . But what gave an absolute originality to the situation was the fact that this persistent lavishness had acquired a new purpose which complicated matters all round . Revenue kept pouring into the treasury in redundant volume without effort , because the people was making or losing money in vast amounts and was indifferent to its taxes , as to any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a motive . The motive was the extinction of the public debt , the heroic resolve to wind up the war by settling the bill when it came due or before . The proposal was to merge the debt , principal and interest , in the account for current expenses ; that is , to save enough out of current revenue to meet , or anticipate , maturing credits . Unluckily , the people called for the extinction of the debt much as it had called for the suppression of the rebellion which had caused it . As it had given carte blanche for whatever was wanted to make war , so it did for whatever was wanted to pay the bill ; all it askud in one case was a decisive victory , in the other a brilliant surplus . Take all you need , it cried , only show us punctually a reduction of the debt capital and a rise in the market quotations . A wiser thing was never done in more unbusiness-like fashion . If you pile up deposits at your bankers against all contingencies , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get your paper out of the market at any cost , he will do it no doubt ; but the chances are that he will have an iron or two of his own in the fire and make money in the operation . So the people got what it asked for , certainly ; rapid reductions of the national debt with prompt restoration of the national credit the world over . But in its satisfaction with the net result it quite forgot to look into the really signi // ficant items of the account , and waived aside the annual budgets with the grand air of a millionaire who tells the hotel-waiter to keep the change for the bill . Nobody observed that in accumulating a surplus for the payment of the public debt , the government was disposing of another , undefined and unaccounted for , from the same sources . It is now to be added that this residuary surplus had no apparent , tangible existence anywhere , like the other openly accumulated and applied to the payment of the debt , but eluded observation by the roundabout and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ De non apparentibue et de non eceistentibu8 eadem est ratio . It was no specific sum of money saved out of current receipts of the treasury and ntilized openly and directly for a specific purpose . Savings of that sort are all covered by the constitutional necessity the administration is under of making an appropriation before it makes a disbursement . It must say distinctly , in the form of a law addressed to the whole constituency , what it is going to do with the money . To use it for any purpose not clearly specified in an act of appropriation , would be simply embezzlement of public funds ; a thing which happens in all governments as in any business to which rogues get admitted along with honest men , but which can never become a practice or policy of the governing body itself , as such , in a society like ours . Accordingly the surplus in question was not acquired by putting aside something from current receipts , but by the manner of meeting current liabilitieS* Congress , for example , having appropriated $1,000,000 for a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any part of the appropriation for any other purpose ; but , as the result showed , somebody could both draw and deliver the whole sum for a nine hundred thousand dollar ship . This left $100,000 , over and above the costs and rightful profits of the builder , given away-not for nothing , but for nothing of value to the people ; for something , but for something profitable to the disbursing officers and their accomplices , or to the Administration , or to the party . All the real abuses under our system , peculiar to the expenditure as distinguished from the collection of revenue , are reducible to this one type , the paying out of money for something other than // the ostensible equivalent ; the receipt along with what was openly purchased for the exclusive use of the State , of certain other things secretly purchased for the benefit of somebody else . Except in the matter of the public debt , where the equivalent could not be tampered with because already delivered and mised , the process was applicable to all the disbursements of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the revenue into the material and labor required for the public service . And the result was the accumulation of a real surplus , whether in money or in the things money will buy , of the most inscrutable and effective kind , because under cover of the law , absent from the accounts , and distributed in endless detail among the beneficiaries of the government all over the land . What a latitude this leaves to the government , what a means for rewarding its friends and punishing its foes , appears from the fact that the mere awarding of a perfectly equitable contract , or of employment at perfectly reasonable rates , to one man rather than another , is a favor which multitudes are glad to get and willing to pay for . The government may really obtain a full equivalent for what it spends , money 's worth for the money , yet put a heavy premium upon party loyalty and recruit a whole army of active retainers by skillful selection of its creditors andemployees . Its disbursements as the most considerable employer of the realm are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diversified in amounts , that there is no individual , no class , no section of the country beyond its re*ach , inaccessible to its vengeance or its rewards . By simply directing the rivers and rivulets of outflowing treasure where they will have the most effect , it can create a class of dependents who are kept faithful by the good things they get , and another continually tempted by the good things they are kept out of . It is to be supposed that any government would be contented with partizanship of this description if it continued sufficient for the purpose . The misfortune is that a class of mercenaries , held to the party by no strength of political convictions , but purchased , very likely in spite of their convictions , by premaims upon fidelity , develops the insatiable cupidities of the class . The appetite grows by what it feeds on . A man who has sold his faith for a consideration of any kind , is sure to find // the consideration inadequate and the basis for a larger one The legitimate profits of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to satisfy him , he offers perhaps a heartier loyalty to his party , increased activity in election time , larger contributions to the campaign funds , some kind of support more valuable to the Administration than he offered before , on the condition of delivering something less than fhe equivalent in public property or public service of what he is paid in public funds . If a humble laborer with only a vote to give or an influence upon other votes , he is taken on at some navy yard or custom-house or public works , where his labor is not needed , at rates paid no other laborers . If a great contractor , ready tG divide his spoils with friends at court or to set them flowing through the channels of campaign expenses , he is set , with a throng of laborers as aforesaid , to repairing some old hulk that will never float outside the navy register , or to dredging some rivulet into an impossible harbor , or to " expediting " some postal route over which no mails are carried . It goes without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however the methods of it may be . The fame of his doings , and of a thousand like him , goes abroad in the land . A vast population which has suspended its political activities and abandoned to the government the care of public affairs that it may plunge , unhampered , into business enterprise , discovers that the straightest and surest road to wealth is through the munificence of the government . A crowd of hungry applicants throng around every great department and every bureau in it , to dispute the treasure flowing out of them . The exploitation of the State becomes an accredited industry like any other , and the government , which stood solid before as the representative of a great party and the organ of certain principles , finds its centre of gravity shifted , ita whole fabric held together and held up , more and more , by alien alliances that have no political significance or durability in them . From the moment the party majority , which I repeat is the only normal basis of its power , begins to undermine and waste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its choice , namely , to bid higher and higher for the support of its new allies , to distribute its prizes with greater and greater prodigality . There is not only the necessity of doing this , but as if to // cut off all possibility of return to safer tactics and a nobler doctrine , there has been , in the recent situation of the two great parties , an irresistible opportunity of doing it with effect . It has so happened for years that in the slow waste of the Republican and the reviving strength of the Democratic party , the issue of decisive elections in which the fate of the government was staked , has turned upon one or two " doubtful " states , Indiana or Louisiana , or New York , and all the energies of the government have been spent in carrying these States . No dilatory or diffusive measures , like a re-adjustment of the fiscal system , could avail in emergencies such as these . A law imposing or remitting a tax is a wide generalization like any other , taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could be made to tell anywhere the battle would have been lost or won . What is needed is direct and prompt intervention at the critical time and place , and that is possible in one way only , namely , by bringing to bear the purchasing power of the government , by lavish distribution of public patronage and treasure to win the uncertain votes that decide the whole campaign by carrying a single constituency . As I have said , the feature common to all the vast variety of these dealings of the government , is the paying out of public funds for something other than the ostensible equivalent . The equivalent as it figures in all the records , is property purchased or work done for the benefit of the whole people ; the something additional to this , and the real determining consideration , is service of some kind rendered , not to the people , but to the party on which the administration depends , or directly to the Administration itself . Now it has long ceased to be anybody 's secret , that the safest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to purchase it by money paid out as the stipulated salary of a public office . Notwithstanding the industrial character of the population , the intensity of the passion and the manifold aptitudes it takes into commercial enterprise , there is nothing in the gift of the government more coveted , or by greater numbers , than its offices . In the lowest grades they carry some scrap of a dignity dear to the heart of every American , appeal to the idealism that is under his most sordid instincts by bringing along with the money , one of the highest // prizes money can buy for him . He imagines , too , that they offer him congenial employment , with abundant leisure , and are well suited to his capacities and training , no matter what these are . He may have broken down at everything else , but he is sure that somewhere in the public service there is a place he is fitted to fill and which will become him well . It follows that the throng of applicants who beset the government for favors of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importunity for office which keeps on thundering at its gates , and which , upon every change of Administration , simply beats down the transaction of public business . It is the most glaring , and , as it would seem , the most humiliating and intolerable part of the bondage into which the government has been brought by the artifices of its later policy . There has been no high-minded man in any recent administration who has not grown disgusted and indignant under it , but all administrations have put up with it as an incident of a tremendous power , the power to command the personal or partizan services of the whole body of men in subordinate office , the vaster one of men who hope to get there , and of the friends and dependents of both . They furnish an army of mercenaries , who satisfy all the requirements of law by the discharge of the prescribed functions , who take no money out of the treasury they have not rendered an apparent equivalent for ; yet who may be drilled into a compact and flexible organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows the strongest front . All the most sfibtle and taking sophistries of our political conflicts have been spun about this preposterous abuse , until it has wrought itself into the very fabric and functions of our political institutions . They are not worth recapitulation . An appointment to office , like the hiring of a laborer or the awarding of a contract , for any other consideration than an equivalent in service rendered to the people , is the perversion of the power of the people to the benefit of the men who appoint and are appointed  --  the confiscation by a part of what belongs to the whole . We need not trouble ourselves with the ethics of the thing . They are settled beforehand in the absolute and everlasting certainties of right and wrong in human conduct . The important question here is the effect of the entire system // 217 of such abuses upon the character and fortunes of the governing body . IDoes it gather intelligence , solidity and strength in the practice of them , or not ? It exists as the consecrated organ of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the subjects alike . The only legitimate foundation of its continuing existence is the suifrages of the men by whom these doctrines are held , and the only legitimate use of the power put in its hands , is to give them expression in the law and effect through the executive . When this has been done , or has hopelessly failed in the doing , when the doctrines have been vindicated , or cast away , for all time , then it is time for the men , who are but the representatives of the doctrines , to go . But what if they will not , or can not go ? Xo administration or ministry was ever yet known to depart opportunely in any age or land . Nothing in its life becomes it so little as the leaving of it ; the supreme triumph of dignified death is always denied to it . As the sources of its legitimate strength are dried up , and the majority which gave it birth and kept it alive wastes it away , it strikes its suckers and roots into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The question is , does it thrive on its new alliances ? Does it build up an enduring and more formidable power by submitting to the bondage and doing the work of importunate interests within or beyond the party it represents ? All the issues of Reform are involved in the answer to this question . For if the new departure is a victorious achievement , if the subsidized classes that have grown up around the perverted of the State have availed to save the government that subsidized them , then we may put the possibility of Reform into the indefinite future . If , on the other hand , the experiment has been a failure , then all the essential conditions of Reform are alive and at work in the working of our institutions . The coherent , continuous evolution of a community which has sloughed off the abuses of political society in the old world , which has absorbed into the constituency a race of enfranchised slaves , may be trusted to dispose of the obnoxious and artificial combinations which have blocked its way for the last twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly fill , that twenty years are but moments in the life of the nation , and that the evil of them , // however it may laugh at the first faltering tentatives of reform , can not last if it contradicts the fundamental principles and thwarts the ruling tendencies of our civilization . All they , therefore , who are cast down with the sorry spectacle they see around them , and all they who are watching with doubtful faith the progress of partial and incoherent reforms , may profitably turn their attention to that most curious counterevolution which has been going on in the midst of the larger one , the rise , the flourishing , and the fall , of the great Republican Machine .
