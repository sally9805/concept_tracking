Red earth , pebbles and black sand but never a show of the yellow gold . I 'm sick of breaking a half acre of stone to get half a loaf of bread out of it ; and , like as not , I 've prospected the whole hillside just to make way for some fool to strike his pick into the one lucky spot . FERGUSON . That 's so ! Blessed if I point another pick throws down his tool ;  --  some of the others stop work BRODERICK . But I say , lads  --  if there 's a scarcity of gold , there are fools enough in camp , and here comes one  --  York ! the gentleman capitalist , the dandy scientist !

YORK . indolently Oh no ! Why should I be ? It 's vigorous and  --  chaste  --  BRODERICK. impatiently  --  aside Hang his airs ! aloud You 're looking for game  --  So am I ! Good ! We 'll swop information ; now if I should tell you where you could flush a flock of quails in the chaparral yonder , perhaps you 'd show me how to bag something out of this claim ? YORK . It is a fair offer , but you will excuse me if I plead press of time and decline it . Good morning . exits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this gilt-edged prig , one of these days . takes up a handful of dirt Confound it , this thing that 's called a pocket claim is nothing but just a lottery with a thousand blanks in it and one big prize . I might as well give up the game . I wonder if Plunkett 's got anything to drink ? knocks on PLUNKETT 'S door L.2.E . Plunkett ! Nobody at home , I guess . pushes open door and looks in Hello , what 's this ? reaches in and takes out photograph York 's picture , flattering likeness of the puppy too . What a mug it is . Great friends Plunkett and York ! A liar and a snob. throws picture on stump It 's a well matched team . locking into cabin again Next thing I oughter run across is a picture of old Plunkett 's daughter that he brags so much about  --  No , but I reckon here 's the original takes out bottle and drinks  --  smacks his chops Fine girl !

I wonder who she is ? One of his family come from the states may be . I do n't want to meet any more of the Plunkett tribe . I 'll step aside ! goes R.2.E . PLUNKETT. outside This way , miss , look out for the mud there , that 's it  --  ah , here we are !

Oh , I am so much obliged to you for your kindness ; so this is the gold region , eh ? rather a desolate place to pass one 's time , I should imagine . PLUNKETT . Oh , it 's pleasant enough here , miss ; we have any quantity of amusement . Hardly a night passes but we have a ball , oysters and champagne suppers and all that  --  BRODERICK . Lie number one for the old fool ! Oh  --  he 'll sling his yarns now  --  as many as she wants . exits MISS TEMPEST . Indeed ? But let me ask the name of him who has so befriended me . PLUNKETT . Certainly , miss , with pleasure ; indeed you honor me by asking the question  --  I am Abner Plunkett , pretty well known in this region , proprietor of the Goddess of Liberty Mine  --  yonder . MISS TEMPEST . Ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've hit it the first time , miss  --  it 's awful rich , miss  --  ah , miss , I am afraid I have forgotten the name . MISS TEMPEST . laughing It is so easy to forget what one does not know . I am Miss Tempest of San Francisco ! removing veil PLUNKETT. amazedly What ! the rich Miss Tempest ? The heiress of Judge Tempest ; the famous belle ? MISS TEMPEST . sighing I am afraid you 're right . I 'm all that sort of thing . PLUNKETT . But my dear young lady , this is no place for you  --  Not , you understand , that anybody in Deadwood would dare to  --  to  --  to  --  MISS TEMPEST . Pardon me , my good friend , if I continue my explanation . You see , when the stage coach broke down on the hill beside your camp , my maid was with me and we were both on our way to the next settlement . I think they call it  --   --  X.L. PLUNKETT . Columbia ? MISS TEMPEST . Exactly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you offered your help . I was glad of the opportunity of learning for myself something of the ways and manners of the miners and also glad considering my unprotected state  --  to find in the first one I met  --  a gentleman .

A moment , Mr. Plunkett ; I think I can therefore trust to you keeping this episode a secret . PLUNKETT. with effusion You do me honor , miss ; you do me great honor , and yet you only do me justice too . In the matter of keeping a secret , you can rely on Abner Plunkett as you 'd rely upon a corpse  --  an old corpse , miss  --  a mummy ! MISS TEMPEST . I believe you . aside I wonder if I could trust the good natured extravagance of this man ? PLUNKETT . You have never been in this locality before ? MISS TEMPEST . glances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and after a moment 's hesitation  --  aside I will trust him ! aloud Two years ago a brave man seized my runaway horses and saved my life , a crowd surrounded the carriage , and in the confusion the stranger spirited himself away without waiting to receive our thanks or even disclosing himself . PLUNKETT . You saw him ? MISS TEMPEST . languidly Only for a moment ,  --  aside sighing I wish I had n't ! PLUNKETT . And he saw you ? MISS TEMPEST . No ! That 's the worst of it ! It was dark in the carriage . He might at least have waited to know whether it was an old or a young woman he had saved . We advertised for the wretch but to no purpose . PLUNKETT . A singular case , miss , but not without a parallel . Why I remember once on the plains I stopped a vast herd of buffalo ; 2,000 I should judge . They were dashing down on a carriage full of women and children  --  I up with a big buck  --  MISS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all about it  --  But  --  picking up YORK 'S picture from log Who is this ?

He was here a year ago , but he 's gone , and confidentially , miss , he is engaged to one of the finest and richest heiresses in New York . MISS TEMPEST . aside This man 's son ! In New York and X.R. engaged . Can it be the same ? Yet looking at photo. this is the face . aloud Mr. Plunkett , I 've taken a great fancy to your son 's picture . Let me tax your generosity as I have taxed upon your kindness further  --  give it to me  --  you have the substance , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it a fair exchange . Here is my photograph . It flatters me no doubt . PLUNKETT. inspecting it Jingo ! The living image ! I will wear it next my  --  MISS TEMPEST .

Miss Grace Astor Livingstone of Madison Square , New York . MISS TEMPEST . Miss Grace Astor Livingstone . It may not be able to recall to him the face of one to whom he once did a service , but you will assure him that gratitude for that heroic service and appreciation of his rare modesty have prompted me to send it .

BRODERICK . L. Why , it 's common talk in the camp , some of your other exploits , too , like that one where you surrounded a battalion of the enemy all by yourself and took every man prisoner ! PLUNKETT. still more pleased By George , I did n't think a little circumstance like that would be remembered . But I did it ! By the great hocus-pocus I did that very thing . Lots of people that are dead now were there and saw me do it . aside Hang it , I begin to like Broderick . BRODERICK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp knows it . It is notorious that when you shouldered your gun in the War of 1812 , England give in and hung out a white flag . PLUNKETT .

If you had stayed with us , instead of leaving us unprotected to be picked up by any passing stranger , this would n't have happened .

Well , the lover of Miss Plunkett alias Miss Tempest , I grieve to say is in a dangerous strait . The evidence that might be frivolous and insufficient before a competent court will be convincing to the rude law of this locality . MISS TEMPEST . But , father , you can  --  you will save him ! JUDGE . gravely My child , your vigilance committee knows that it must justify its irregularities by its final verdict . It has to hang a man to show that it had the right to simply arrest him . MISS TEMPEST . You terrify me , father . JUDGE TEMPEST . Be assured , my poor child , I will do all I can . I will go to the poor fellow now . They will admit me  --  though they deny all others .

JUDGE TEMPEST . aside Confound it , I 'm getting the worst of it . aloud They will not allow women there . They will not admit you . MISS TEMPEST . They shall admit me . JUDGE . Oh , folly , folly ! But , my child , these are wild , rough miners  --  MISS TEMPEST . They are men . And all men have hearts . X.L. JUDGE . perplexed for a moment  --  then kindly Shirley , I do sincerely feel for you ; and if you could do the least good , I would yield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a young girl . My arguments have all failed  --  now I must use compulsion . You can not go . MISS TEMPEST . with gentleness but firmly Father , try to forgive me , but I will go . JUDGE . surprised Shirley , it is the first time you ever refused me obedience  --  It does not become a girl to  --  MISS TEMPEST . All my life , till this day , I was a girl , and a subject . To-day , I am a woman ! X.R. JUDGE . Then nothing can change your mind ? MISS TEMPEST . calmly Nothing , Father . JUDGE . It will grieve me  --  but you compel me to do it . I will oppose your entrance myself and I will take you home . You know me , my child . MISS TEMPEST . appealingly Oh , father , father ! JUDGE . embracing her I must be cruel to be kind .

But I must n't seem to have heard it . aloud Keep up your heart my child  --  wait at home ' till I bring you news . exits MISS TEMPEST . Oh , there 'll be no turning my father from his purpose ; and that murderous pack will sacrifice the man , whose life is dearer to me now than my own , and I shall not be near to  --  But I will be there !

There 's a little dispute here . I went 10 cents blind , and Jake Miller saw it with a 20 , and then I straddled his blind , and it took him 40 cents to make it good ; and , by George , now he says it takes me 80 to come in. 1st MINER . L. Oh , that be hanged ! Where 'd you get your education , Jake Miller ? The idea of its costing him 80 to come in on his own straddle . MASTERS . C. gravely Mr. Miller , I am surprised that any man in a land where education is as free as the air we breathe should be so sunk in ignorance . A man straddles your blind and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proclaim that it costs him 4 times to come in on his own straddle ! It is a spectacle to make one blush for his species . Such a man is not fit to sit upon a Jury and deal with the mighty matters of life and death . It is persons like you that have brought the Jury system into disrepute , and made the American Jury a synonym for ignorance and savage stupidity . You may retire from the box . Hank Williamson , take his place . the change is made 1st MINER . That 's it !  --  Now there 's sense in that . MASTERS . A man that ca n't play poker is not fit to sit on a Jury . 1st MINER . Of course not . MASTERS . Gentlemen of the Jury , the evidence is all in . BRODERICK hands MASTERS a flask  --  He drinks and BRODERICK sends it to Jury Thanks . JUDGE TEMPEST . rising Your honor , I must protest , once more , against these irregularities . To pass a flask of liquor around  --  MASTERS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Second the motion .

Stand off the Pagan 's tail ! Now you be quiet , or I 'll pull your tail out and flog you to death with it . FERGUSON . Gentlemen of the Jury . You 've seen yourselves that there is evidence enough to hang 40 men . There had been a fight  --  the ground torn up and the blood spots showed that ; who fought that fight ? York 's pistol was found there with two charges shot off . Who generally carries Mr. York 's pistol for him ? 1st MINER . Good ! FERGUSON . A handkerchief was found there , too . A clean one !  --  Who does that suggest ? 1st MINER . Good again ! FERGUSON . I ask you to examine it . it is passed to Jury , who examine it with disgust  --  BRODERICK whispers to FERGUSON and pushes the dilapidated gloves before him And a pair of unknown gloves found not 50 yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Jury Kid gloves ; you know this swell was always insulting the camp in every way he could think of , particularly by wearing kid gloves . BOSTON . That 's so every time . FERGUSON . There 's another thing that looks mighty black  --  he jumps Plunkett 's claim , says he bought it . If he did , where 's the papers for it  --  He says he lost ' em . Too thin ! sits BOSTON . You bet  --  It 's a blame sight too thin . JUDGE TEMPEST . Your Honor , I must protest against these extraordinary expressions of opinion by Jurymen . MASTERS . a trifle severely Look here , my friend , who 's trying this case if it ai n't the Jury ? JUDGE TEMPEST . But these premature expressions of opinion are totally at variance with all custom and precedent . MASTERS . Never mind  --  you sit down . I reckon we 've tried this sort of cases before often enough to know how to do it . If this man ai n't guilty I never saw a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak his mind , where 's your boasted freedom of speech your Declaration of Independence brags about ? 1st MINER . Good ! Had him there ! BRODERICK sends box of cigars to MASTERS and Jury MASTERS . Go on , Mr. Ferguson . FERGUSON . 5 or 10 words more is all I want to say . Gentlemen of the Jury look at the bare facts a moment . York was rich ; all of a sudden he loses every dollar he 's got and do n't know where to turn to make a raise . He is frantic , crazy , perfectly desperate . That very day he stumbles on poor old Plunkett at the very moment that Plunkett has struck it rich . It was a lonesome place , nobody by to see the act  --  he outs with his revolver , shoots the old man dead . JUDGE TEMPEST . rising impetuously Come , come , this is not in evidence ! Why the very fact that nobody saw the act done is proof that nobody knows who did it . FERGUSON . very calm , sarcastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would like to know ? to Jury As I was saying , when interrupted by this old Blackleg , he shoots the old man dead  --  jumps the claim and has the effrontery to come calmly before this camp and say he bought the mine ; and the heartlessness to come with new kid gloves and a new stove pipe hat on too  --  mark that  --  purchased with the proceeds of his crime . audience show rising excitement There was a time when the man that dared to flaunt the contemptuous effronteries of kid gloves and a stove pipe hat in the face of this camp , did it at the peril of Tar and Feathers , a ride upon a rail , and Banishment ! the spectators surge forward , the Jury stand up  --  Chorus of shouts OMNES .

I 'll kill the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back muttering and shaking their heads  --  MASTERS stands glaring on the crowd a while , then says with strong and pathetic indignation Confound it , have I got to kill a man every time I sit on a case of this kind ? sits gravely down Let the defense begin . AH SIN , in his fright , has climbed to the top of a conspicuous pile of boxes , starts to come carefully down and tumbles with a crash  --  startled What the nation did you get up there for ! AH SIN . Me wantee see better . MASTERS . Well , what did you come clattering down like that for ? AH SIN . Me no got time be all day comin ' down . BRODERICK whispers to FERGUSON who springs up FERGUSON . Hold on ! Just a single word more ! This prisoner has had a couple of women masquerading at his house for a day or two , passing themselves off for Plunkett 's widow and daughter . It has been found out that they are nothing of the kind . It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little game ? Did he want that bogus widow to make him a deed to Plunkett 's mine , hey ? sensation And who are these impostors ?  --  the wife and daughter of no less a personage than  --  that gentleman there ! pointing to TEMPEST Sensation JUDGE TEMPEST . to some friend near Oh , what a fatal fool I have been ! Now I would give the world if my daughter were here to throttle this calumny . MISS TEMPEST enters through door in R. flat impetuously through the crowd  --  hat in hand , shawl half off  --  very pale Shirley , my child ! she runs to him MASTERS . What means this ? What is your name ? MISS TEMPEST . Shirley Tempest . AH SIN . Mellican lady goin ' to heap lie some more ! No can keep same name two day . MASTERS . Were you known by that name in the household of Mr. York ? MISS TEMPEST . No . MASTERS . By what name then ? MISS TEMPEST . Miss Plunkett . MASTERS . What object had you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a  --  foolish girl 's fancy . My father had brought us to meet Mr. York  --  his old friend . The letter informing him of our arrival did not reach him . But Mr. York , seeking Miss Plunkett , who was due the same day , mistook me for that lady  --  I  --  I  --  did not undeceive him . YORK . rising May it please this Court . MASTERS . Sit down , sir . YORK sits down protesting  --  to MISS TEMPEST But what was your object , if you were the legitimate guest of Mr. York , in deceiving him in this way ? MISS TEMPEST . greatly agitated Oh , sir , I assure you it was only a mere fancy  --  a foolish , girlish freak . sobbing He thought my photograph was Miss Plunkett 's . BOSTON . Oh , let up ! Oh , give her a show ! AH SIN . Givee her showee ! MASTERS . gravely Miss Tempest , consider one moment ; upon your next utterance may hang the life of the prisoner . If you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have come here , honestly , to clear his character , and your own , you will answer as honestly and frankly one question . What other motive had you in personating the woman in whom you knew he was interested ? MISS TEMPEST . looking wildly round the Court Because , because  --  because  --  I was  --  meeting YORK 's eye Oh , spare me , sir ; spare him . I implore you . MASTERS . gravely Answer . Remember , his life may hang upon your next sentence . MISS TEMPEST . Because  --  I  --  loved  --  him ! drops her head in her , hands . Sensation . Applause from Jury and spectators  --  BRODERICK turns away in anger BOSTON . Say that again , Miss , to me , and say it as you said it then , and I 'll take his place under the gallows . JUDGE TEMPEST . rising Again , I must protest against these constant intermeddlings of the Jury in  --  BOSTON . Sit down , you old ass  --  that girl of yours has said more in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is standing with back against wall , slaps thigh and is in the midst of a prodigious laugh when he observes that there is a stillness and all eyes are on him  --  slowly closes his wide mouth in shame MASTERS . Silence in Court ! silence , in which JUDGE TEMPEST embraces MISS TEMPEST and she whispers to him JUDGE TEMPEST . rising May it please the Court , may I have the privilege of examining this witness ? OMNES . Go on . Heave ahead , old man ! MASTERS . Go on . JUDGE TEMPEST . Swear the witness ! BOSTON . Swear a lady ! Doubt a lady 's word  --  Nonsense , go on ! go on ! OMNES . Yes , go on  --  go on . JUDGE TEMPEST . stupefied and shrugging his shoulders Well , I protest  --  but  --  BRODERICK . This is all very fine  --  very pretty  --  a put-up job between the father and daughter to humbug the Jury ! BOSTON . Oh , take a walk . BRODERICK sits down AH SIN .

Kick him out ! Lynch him ! JUDGE TEMPEST . Mr. Broderick must answer to me for his officiousness . To MISS TEMPEST How did you come to hold converse with Mr. Broderick ? MISS TEMPEST . I met him on the road , and in my distress I implored him to use his influence to save Mr. York . And he  --  he  --  BOSTON . Speak out , Miss  --  do n't you be afraid . What did he do ? MISS TEMPEST . He  --  he  --  insulted me with protestations of love ! Said if I would discard Mr. York for him , he would see that York was set free . breaks down and cries a little JUDGE TEMPEST . You scorned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said he would make my assumed name tell against the prisoner . JUDGE TEMPEST . The whole conduct of the prosecution is of a piece with this . I will not shame your intelligence , your manhood , your magnanimity by defending a man who is so manifestly guiltless , or by attacking a prosecution which has so ignominiously failed . 1st JURYMAN . That 's me  --  shake ! 2d JURYMAN . And me too . She has n't been treated right . 3rd JURYMAN . Count me in . AH SIN . Alle same me ! they all get to shaking hands . AH SIN offers to shake with somebody  --  is spurned contemptuously . BRODERICK whispers to FERGUSON who springs up FERGUSON . One word , Gentlemen of the Jury . Let us acquit him . OMNES . Agreed !
