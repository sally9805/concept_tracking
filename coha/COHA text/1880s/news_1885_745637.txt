Well , that remained in the car on the seat , and if the steam was hot enough to crisp that leather as you see , what chance was there for human flesh ? After recovering somewhat from the shock sustained in my headlong jump and tumble heels over head down the steep embankment on the frozen ground , I got up and got out of the way of those people who had rallied and were making desperate and heroic efforts to rescue those who were less fortunate than myself . The doctors , G. G. Roy , J. . Gaston , and J. F. Powell , of Atlanta , I think , and Drs .
