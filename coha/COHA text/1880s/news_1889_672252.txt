txt Anglican communion the results of a large experiment in the use of hymns , and the Committee on Hymnology will . report a new hymnal , which will doubtless be an improvement on the old one , but at present appearances it is not likely that the Church will consent to be tied up very closely in its choice of hymns to be sung in worship . The feeling is that the day of growth and experiment is not yet over . Neither does the feeling within the fold seem to be that it is wise or best to decide to-daywhat the ritual of the Episcopal Church shall be for the next fifty years . It is too early to say " Thus far and no further . " The Church of England is restricted by Parliament from making changes in the Prayer Book which are urgently demanded , and the opinion seems to be that in the United States the time is not ripe to attempt to pass an act of uniformity . It seems to be the peculiar fortune of this communion to anticipate many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church to modern life , and it is the anticipation of what this Synod may do which concentrates public interest upon it . It differs from the annual congress in the fact that its discussions lead to legislation which is authoritative , while the congress is intended simply and entirely for discussion . The pith and point of these trien nial sessions is to bring the Episcopal Church into more vital and helpful contact with American society , and this is accomplished chiefly by the passing of permissive or enabling acts by which the Church is better adjusted to the needs of the times . All American Churches are going through this process of adjustment , and many of them are taking on something of a national character . The Episcopal Church has a more difficult problem to deal with than the others , because it represents in its government the conservative and in its practical action the democratic elements in life . It has to reconcile the power to organize society with practical success in dealing with the individual . This twofold issue sums up what is most important in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aggressive forces , and it is in the harmonizing of these two and in the illustration of their working qualities that the Episcopal Church is giving an object lesson to the American people . It is evident from recent suggestive articles in the Churchman and from the drift of ? private comment . among churchmen that there is a great deal of dead wood . in this Noah 's ark that needs removal , and there is likely to be an earnest effort during the present session to change the basis of representation , or to introduce the provincial system , by which the organization may conform properly to the ancient system of provinces , with their Archbishops and . Synods , while the great Synod , which is the General Convention , would be reduced in size , but not in importance , and enabled to delegate the authority to the provinces by which its canons could be enforced . Bishop POTTER , in his recent address before the New-York Convention , went as far as any one has gone in the revival of the effort to introduce the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and declares himself ready to abide the time when the initial effort toward it in this State , which is called the Federate Council , shall be recognized for what it is worth . Whether the Episcopal Church is ripe for so radical a change remains to be seen , but in one form or another it is likely that this issue will be thoroughly discussed among the Bishops and , also in the House of Deputies . The present method of representation is unjust . to the communicants of the Church because a small diocese has the same voice in the contention which a large one has . The Synod itself is so large , and so many deputies wish to hear their own voices , that it is almost as difficult to secure action on important matters as it is in the National Congress , and even when sectional questions do come before it , like the colored question which has been raised in South Carolina , the parties are not in the Synod to any extent who are most competent to deal with it because they are thoroughly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be brought before a province that includes the dioceses which are vitally interested in them they could be wisely settled , or referred . to the triennial Synod for final settlement ; but in the past , they have been discussed rather than wisely settled in this body . What the Episcopal Church requires is increased mobility in the direction of its strength , increased flexibility in its worship , larger toleration , if this is possible , not only of schools of thought , but of different methods of doing Christian work . There is too much stiffness in movement , too much , slowness in reaching what is vital in work both at home and abroad ; and what the General Convention is expected to do is to ' oil the machinery and to introduce simpler and straighter methods in carrying on the Lord 's ' business . It is not possible to anticipate all that the convention may take . up . It is often the case that a , resolution is offered early in the session which gives color to the entire proceedings . But there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and . in which the interest is wider than the Episcopal communion . One of these is the adoption of the new hymnal and the other is the question of liturgical revision .
