txt The select Committee of the House on Civil Service Reform has taken up the subject committed to its charge with commendable promptness . This committee consists of Messrs . ORTa , Indiana , Chairman ; KASSON , Iowa ; HOER and HUBBELL , Michigan ; BRIGGS , New-Hampshire ; NEAL and BUTTERWORTH , Ohio , all Republicans , and the following Democrats : Messrs . HOUSE , Tennessee ; CURTIti , Pennsylvania ; TUCKER , Virginia , and PHELPS , Connecticut . Of these , five members only were present yesterday , viz. : Messrs . KASSON , HORR , BRIGGS , and NEAL , Republicans , and TUCKER , Democrat , but , after discussion , it was resolved to frame a separate bill , which it is hoped to present next Tuesday . It is reported that this bill will include provisions for probationary appointments and a fixed term of office of four or six years , with a prohibition of removals except for cause , and after allowing the official whom it is proposed to remove an opportunity to be heard before a special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objections to the legislation proposed , and it is hoped that a fuller consideration by a larger proportion of the committee will lead to its radical amendment . If that should not be the case , the passage of such a bill should be opposed by the friends of civil service reform , because its effect could only be to increase the evils under which the country now suffers , to add others to these , and to prevent real reform by a pretended but ineffective attempt at reform . The bill as outlined in the Washington dispatches contains no regulation of the appointing power except the purely illusory requirement that the appointments shall be made on probation . Unquestionably , probation is an essential element in any scheme of re ? form , because it supplies the deficiency that exists in any known preliminary tests of fitness , Competitive examinations can be so devised and administered as to provide excellent printh , facie evidence of general fitness , and particularly of relative general intelligence , accuracy , and facility among the competitors , and it has been found in experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rarely fails to confirm the choice made through the examinations . Probation is , nevertheless , important and necessary , because the examinations can not with certainty determine the qualities which actual service does determine completely . But appointment on probation , without competition , by the same methods now employed , which is what the committee seem to propose , would only strengthen the spoils system , because , during the period of probation at least , it would place the appointee absolutely in the hands of his superiors , and it would be just as easy to confirm a probationary appointment or to make one , for personal or partisan service as it now is to make an indefinite appointment , or one for four years . In the method of appointment said to be proposed by the committee there is , therefore , nothing to protect the service or weaken the tyranny of patronage . Nor is there any obvious improvement in giving the appointee a term of four or six years , with the right of a hearing before a special tribunal before he or she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left with the appointing power . The President could still decide what was " cause , " and if the Administration were distinctly wedded to the patronage system it would be very difficult to get a tribunal which would not be complacent in its judgments . However that might be , the judgments would have no actual effect , and a tribunal whose decisions can not be enforced would be an idle and useless body . But this is not the most serious objection to the system . That lies in the fact that it is a thoroughly mischievous system ; that it would make an energetic , disciplined , and responsible administration of affairs very difficult , if not practically impossible . Every superior officer should have the right to discharge subordinates who in his judgment are unfit for their duties . That is a principle universally acknowledged and followed in private business , and is necessary to anything like efficiency . There can be no proper subordination among employes of the lower grades , and no proper responsibility among those of the upper grades , without this right .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get . They have aright to have the public service regulated on the principles found necessary in private business , and no security against political favoritism would compensate for a sacrifice of the essential conditions of efficiency and economy . The notion of making subordinates removable for cause only , with the opportunity to be heard in their own behalf , arises from a misconception of the real evil in the actual service , which is not the arbitrary power of removal , but the abuse of that power and the arbitrary power of appointment for political motives . If the latter were rendered impossible , the former would be abolished . The President or the heads of departments would never abuse the power of removal if they were compelled to fill the vacancy by such competition and probation as would secure the place for the fittest applicant . The plan of limiting the power of removal , while leaving that of appointment unchecked , has been aptly described as putting up the bars at the wrong end of the road . It is permitting an abuse and then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remedy is obviously in requiring appointments to be made for proved fitness . This would not only destroy the associated evil of arbitrary removals by withdrawing all inducement for them , but it would leave the wholesome and necessary subordination and discipline of the public service unimpaired . Another objection to the reported proposed action of the committee is that it is inopportune . The Senate has under consideration a bill which has been favorably reported by one of its committees , and which has received the indorsement of the civil service reform associations throughout the country , and the approval in advance of the President . Considering the shortness of the session , the difficulty which there must be in passing any measure whatever , it would be far better to take up this bill , or one essentially the same , than to propose a separate plan . It would be infinitely better to do so than to bring forward a new bill which apparently is very much inferior to the Senate measure .                @ @ @ @ @
