IlIoTs generally originate in crowded cities or in districts where the population is principally composed of operatives . They are due to two causes . First : the restlessness or peevish discontent of the working-classes , who imagine that others are reaping large gains from their labor . Second : the plotting of demagogues and designing men , too indolent to earn their bread by their own exertions , who hope to receive power and profit , or perhaps notoriety . A third cause may be mentioned : the desire of honest but misguided men to obtain a better position for themselves and their families , who , brooding over real or fancied wrongs , finally resort to unlawful measures for redress . The actors in the first movements which finally lead to a riot rarely , if ever , imagine that they are inaugurating one of these ebullitions of popular fury . A combination of workmen , who have banded together presumably for proper purposes , believing themselves to be imposed upon by their employers , take measures to secure what they consider their rights .. Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which finally leads to a breach between employers and employed . Then comes a strike . Perhaps the strikers are in the employ of a railroad company , which , with its connections , reaches across the continent : all operations are suspended upon the railroad ; passenger and freight cars are stopped upon the tracks ; each individual striker has a little circle which he influences ; the circumferences of these circles touch each other , and thus commotion is spread through the land . Human sympathy always goes out to the oppressed ; the strikers represent themselves as oppressed by the monopolizing corporations , and the sympathy of the community for the weaker unites with its natural prejudice against the stronger in the contest ; disorder begins ; confusion // becomes worse confounded . Now appear the baser elements of society-the tramp , the thief , the rogue , the burglar  --  and these elements , which before were the outcasts of society , now become the rulers of the hour . The quarrel , before confined to the railroad and its employ*s , now enlarges its field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pillagers at first despoil the railroad company , and then seek the property of others , no matter whom , to satisfy their greed . The community awakes to the danger of the situation , but it is too late ; anarchy has the upper hand , and vice and lawlessness reign supreme . Or perhaps the general government , in a time of exigency , using an undisputed right , enacts an obnoxious law : mutterings of discontent are heard ; the demagogue or the ambitious man , seizing the opportunity , foments the public agitation . From a simple disturber , he becomes a leader of the mob and attempts to rule the storm , always having in view , however , his own personal ends . But , to rule , he must unite the masses in a grand struggle for relief from a grievance , real or imaginary . Again the passions of the mob are excited , and there peep from out their hiding-places scoundrels who never before dared face the light of day . These wretches , by their presence and active efforts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own wrongs or the wrongs of others , but in the hope of plunder and for the gratification of their baser passions  --  and scenes of anarchy , ravage , arid arson , like whirlwinds , sweep over the country . Or , looking in the faces of their wives and children , and upon their abodes , and finding a lack of the ordinary comforts of civilized life , a number band together , hoping by the strength of union to secure those comforts for themselves and their families . They use no improper means at first ; they intend to use none . The mere desire to better their condition develops in time into a disregard for law , a contempt for order , and a trampling upon the rights of others ; they are carried away in their excitement by aspirations which they would not have entertained in their cooler moments ; the circle of discontent increases ; others seeking redress for imaginary wrongs join in the contest . Numbers add to the turbulence , and again scoundrels and rascals appear , until at last the same scenes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land . These are no imaginary scenes . They have been enacted again // and again in this country , and under similar circumstances will be repeated . Public and private property to the value of millions of dollars has been destroyed , and precious lives have been sacrificed in only one such turbulent uprising . " How shall the future riot be suppressed ? Upon whom lies the duty of suppression-upon the general government , the State , or the municipality ? " These are the practical questions to be discussed . The general government has no power , except such as is derived by cession from the States . It is the creature of the State governments , and in its relations with the States is governed by organic law , beyond which it can not step . Like all general rules , there is an exception to this rule ; for there is a law , not to be found in any written constitution , which must from necessity control the general government , and that is the law of self-preservation . While it can not interfere in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there may be an exigency when it is not only its right , but its duty to interfere . Whenever the property of the government is endangered by an unlawful assemblage of persons , the government should protect its property , even with the sacrifice of life . It can make no difference where that property is situated . It is not subject to the laws of the States ; no taxes are paid to the State for its protection . To illustrate During the late Rebellion , a draft became necessary to fill up the army of the Union . The President , in pursuance of an act of Congress , had ordered it , but the draft could not be made under the immediate direction of the general government ; it must be made under the supervision of the State authorities . The draft , like all general laws , imposed hardships , and in some localities was resisted-especially in the city of New Yorkand from one step to another the resistance culminated in a riot , one of the most disgraceful ever known in this country . Houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were hung to lamp-posts , and for days , in this great city , scenes of anarchy and bloodshed were enacted , at the mention of which to-day every citizen of this great metropolis should shudder with horror . But the United States Government had no right to interfere , although the draft was for its benefit  --  to replenish its armies , fighting for the restoration of the Union . The draft was made under the immediate direction of the State . No officer of the government , // from the President down , could act , except when called upon by the State authorities . But the call of the President must be obeyed , and the duty of suppressing the riot rested upon the State and municipal authorities . If the rioters had attacked any property of the government , however , then it would clearly have been the duty of the general government to protect that property . Indubitably , the State officials could have called upon the general government for aid in an emergency , as in some cases they did ; but until such call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The rights of the States , so sharply defined , precluded the idea of any interference from the general government ; but those very rights threw on the State and the municipality the responsibility of suppressing the riot  --  the rights claimed and the responsibilities were proportionate and inseparable . It might become the duty of the government to suppress a riot in order to enforce an act of Congress with a penalty attached , where the duty of enforcing that act rested with the United States or its officers . True , it is the duty of the State to protect its citizens ; but in this case the cause of the riot is resistance to an attempt on the part of the general government to enforce its lawsits officers are defied , its laws set at naught , and its dignity compromised . It would be of little use for Congress to make laws , if those laws could be abrogated by the turbulence of lawless men . If the government could not enforce its enactments , then its laws would be mere nullities . With these two exceptions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the State and municipality . The highest duty devolving upon a government is the protection of the lives and property of its citizens . Taxes are levied by the State and paid by the citizen for this protection , and neither State nor municipality can escape the responsibility . The duty of suppression rests , first , with the municipality . The municipality failing , then the State is bound to render assistance . The legislatures of the different States have enacted laws for the punishment of rioters ; but these laws only apply to the punishment of rioters as such , and do not reach the real trouble in the case . It is true that laws may be passed making it a penal offense for persons to meet together for the purpose of beginning a riot , for inciting a riot , for conspiring to bring about a riot ; but no law can be passed preventing citizens from demanding in a // peaceable manner the enforcement of rights , or what they believe to be their rights . No law can operate against the formation of societies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the condition of its members . What is necessary is the adoption of measures creating such a condition of things that a riot will be impossible . An ounce of prevention , in this case , is worth many pounds of cure . It is very difficult to draw the line where forbearance shall cease to be a virtue , and where stern duty compels the authorities to use coercion . All this must be left to their good sense , alert judgment , and proper appreciation of each individual case . There should be no dallying with a mob . It is hydra-headed , manysided , and , at the outset , undecided as to its future movements ; but if , without the use of decided measures for prevention , it be suffered to take its own way , a leader will soon be found of sufficient capacity to direct and control these movements . Let this period once be passed , and let a master-mind be placed in command , with subservience on the part of hi* followers , and the control of the mob in the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment at which the blow must be struck ? The solution of this problem depends not upon any argument , but upon an instantaneous grasping of the facts and necessities of the case and of the steps necessary to be taken , and prompt action upon the decision of the moment . A howling , surging mob may be scattered in an instant by the use of discreet measures ; but a mob actuated by one ruling motive , organized and directed by one master mind , can no more be controlled by human influence , outside of itself , than can the Falls of Niagara be dammed with straw . The qualities most needed , in those who are charged with the duty of preventing riots , are coolness , decision , alertness , and courage . Let the mob once ascertain that any of these qualities are wanting in those who seek to suppress , and the opportunity for suppression is lost . It would have been more merciful in the end to those composing many mobs , certainly to those who suffered from their excesses , if instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way into the muskets . One determined man , with fearless front and undaunted courage , has been of more service in preventing a riot than scores of dilly-dallying mayors and governors who read the riot act and begged and // besought the rioters to disperse , and called them by endearing names . In 1877 riots broke out all over the land . The history of these riots reveals strange inconsistencies and many shameful derelictions of duty . In the city of Pittsburg , with the police of the city at his back , and a large number of State troops at his command , the mayor of that great town , with an indecision which was indefensible and unaccountable ( except upon the supposition that by so doing he hoped to preserve his popularity ) , suffered anarchy and pillage and murder to rule for days . He strove to stem a torrent of turbulence and violence with soft speeches , by reading the riot act , by kind words . But it was too late . The time for such formalities had passed . The sacrifice of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salvos of musketry charged with bullets , would have scattered the howling , demoniac mob back to the holes and dreary retreats from which so many of them had come . At Harrisburg , the same policy at first placed the troops of the great State of Pennsylvania , sent to relieve its capital from the depredations of the mob , prisoners in the hands of that very mob that they were sent to suppress . The militiamen were marched up and down the streets amid the jeers and howls of the rioters . But a different state of affairs was soon inaugurated , through the exertions of one determined man , the mayor of the city . He selected some of the best citizens , and with the sheriff of the county marched at their head , and almost in an instant dispelled the mob while in the very act of pillaging . All along the line of the railroads extending west from Buf* falo the employ*s were in commotion . Mobs of several thousand people had gathered at different points , but only at one place was the mob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city of Buffalo . At East Buffalo , where a mob which was estimated at more than three thousand persons was hooting , howling , and threatening vengeance , a captain of police , with the aid of the baton forcibly brought in contact with the heads of the rioters , in a very few moments dispelled the mob , so that , in the words of the historian who records this incident , " the East Buffalo grounds were as clear and quiet as a country field on a Sunday afternoon . " No other town in the great State of New York , except Buffalo , was seriously incommoded at this eventful period in the history of the riots of this country ; and this was due to the determined action // taken by the authorities , and to the splendid organization of the State militia , aided by a well-conducted police force . Other States were at the mercy of mobs , but New York was free . In New Jersey , when the late Theodore F. Randolph was governor , a remarkable instance was exhibited of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the executive of a State could accomplish . A riot was threatened , arising from the old grudge , long existing , between the different Irish factions  --  the Orangemen and the Catholics . Citizens went to bed at night quaking and quivering with fear . A few quick military preparations to quell the expected turbulence , a determined proclamation , with stern warning of punishment if the law were broken , and quiet was restored as if by magic . If the same policy of prevention had been pursued all over the country during the riots of 1877 , an effectual stop would have been put to violence , property of incalculable value would have been saved , and lives valuable to the community would have been preserved . Mobs are cowards at first . Crime always enervates . They only gain courage as they find that those whose duty it is to suppress them are themselves cowards . A mob is not to be feared when it is first aroused . It is only as its passion for carnage is whetted by the taste of blood , or its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Upon whomsoever devolves the duly of suppression , let this be his first effort : check at the very beginning ; allow no tumultuous gatherings ; permit no delay ; a few stern , resolute words ; if these be not heeded , then strike resolutely , boldly ; let there be no hesitation ; if necessary , take life at the outset . It will be more merciful to take one life then than to suffer the mob to take the lives of many , or to be compelled to sacrifice the innocent with the guilty at the point of the bayonet , or in the discharge of musketry or cannon . But the necessity to take life will not arise unless there be inactivity and indecision at the outset on the part of the authorities . Before the time shall come when it will be necessary to use musket-ball or bayonet , the opportunity will be afforded to suppress the riot ; perhaps at the sacrifice of a few broken heads , or by the imprisonment of some of its leaders . In every large city , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a perfect drill should prepare policemen to meet the // exigencies arising from any tumultuous assemblage of the people ; so that , at a moment 's warning , these conservators of the peace will be ready to act , and to act understandingly and promptly . It will be found that a few determined policemen , placed in the field at a moment 's notice , will prove one of the best and most direct methods of quelling a mob . These , by skillful maneuvers , can take a mob in flank , or in rear , or in front , if necessary , and so employ themselves and their clubs that almost before the mob would know what was impelling them they would be driven from the field of action . This drilling , advised to be used with policemen , can also be used to excellent advantage with the militia of every State , so that in case of emergency they can be used with as good effect as policemen . It has often been found , in the history of the riots of this country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face of a mob , even the officers were so unacquainted with their duties as to evince the most ridiculous ignorance of what was required of them and of their men in the exigency ; and they and their troops have been driven ignominiously from the field . They would have known what to do , without hesitation , had they been in the face of an enemy ; but , surrounded as they were by a frantic mob , they failed  --  and for lack of the necessary drilling . In the draft riot of 1863 , after the mob had had full possession of the city of New York for several days , and the United States troops had been called in with little or no effect , and the State militia had failed , the police of the city , by their bold , brave , and indefatigable action , quelled the riot and prevented any further disorder . It was a remarkable instance of what can be done by a drilled organization . Since that time no riot could by any possibility have occurred in that great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to act in any emergency ; and it is very doubtful whether it would be necessary to call in the aid of the State troops , or of the United States forces , in case a riot were threatened . Governor Seymour , in a proclamation made just after this riot , gave due credit to the police force , fully appreciating their magnificent services . Let it be known , in every large town and city throughout the land , that the police force is constantly under control and discipline , ready promptly to perform its whole duty in case of any riotous action , and there will be an end of these turbulent assemblages . The most fertile cause of all riots is the peevish discontent of // wage-workers-too often ignorant of the true relations between themselves and their employers . This peevish discontent may perhaps be confined to a few , but those few will be able to avail themselves of the restlessness which may pervade the whole body of operatives . This discontent arises not so much from any real oppression , or from any wrong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more or less , when he sees others living more luxuriously than himself , and especially when that luxury appears to be the result of his labor . Now this discontent may be dispelled , perhaps not in the present generation , though it may be greatly moderated ; but , certainly , means can be taken to prevent it in the future . The employer and employe may surely be brought together in more intimate relations than those they at present sustain . Where lies the fault in the present system ? Who is justly chargeable with the origin of this discontent ? That question can not be settled in this discussion . But so much may be said : the working-classes can be educated up to a higher tone of feeling , a better appreciation of their duty to their employers , a higher standard of morals , and a nobler level of thought and action . May not the employers find something in the present condition of things for which they are responsible ; and which they , in the exercise of the duty they owe to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a factory , in one of the large manufacturing towns of the country , where one of the employers , imbued with true Christian philanthropy , brings himself , in a measure , down to a level with his hundreds of employees . He mingles with their families ; finds out the social status and wants of all ; gives a word of advice to one ; imparts counsel to another ; sympathizes with the mourner ; puts his strong arm round the weak ; and employs all of his ability to raise his workingmen in the scale of human existence . He provides a reading-room for them , furnishes them with reading matter , and gives them lectures . Let this example be emulated by every employer in the land , and riots would be impossible . The legislators of the country , with a " penny wise and pound foolish " spirit , have neglected this their highest duty  --  the enactment of wise and judicious laws to provide for the many-sided interests of the employers and the employed . Demagogues invade legislative halls , and , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cater to the worst passions of their constituents . Many , imagining that the source of popularity lies with one class or with another , forget everything but their own selfish , groveling aims , and cater to the passions of that class . The history of the legislation of the country , unfortunately , is full of the evidences of this ignoble spirit . The true legislator , rising equal to his position , surveys the whole field and legislates for all-not for a class . In the near future it is quite evident that there is a contest imminent between labor and capital . The true law-maker may avert that contest  --  the false may hasten it .
