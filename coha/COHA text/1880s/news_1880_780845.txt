txt In the Senate to-day , at the conclusion of the debate upon the report of the Committee on Treasury Accounts , Mr. Cameron , of Wisconsin , moved to take up the bill for the relief of Ben . Holladay . Mr. Holladay carried the mails for the Government on the overland route before the Pacific railroads were built , and this bill awards to him about $500,000 for losses caused by the depredations of hostile Indians . It had been discussed in the Senate four times this session on as many days , and now Mr. Cameron hoped to secure a vote . For some unknown reason there were signs of opposition in some parts of the Democratic side of the chamber , although the bill had been reported favorably by the unanimous vote of the committee . Mr. Eaton moved to go into executive session , and when it was apparent that a majority were against him , David Davis called for the yeas and nays , The motion was lost-24 to 31 . Mr. Harris . of Tennessee , declared that it was improper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ session , and urged its postponement until December . Mr. Conkling made a vigorous defense of the bill , and showed that thorough discussion had prepared the Senate for a vote upon it . For 14 years Holladay has been asking for a settlement , and the Senate should admit or reject his claim . He closed with the assertion that the passage of the bfil , if only by the Senate , - would save Holladay and those who depended upon him from impending rain . During his remarks he somewhat sharply resented an unwai i anted interruption from David Davis , and thereupon the corpulent Senator sulked in his seat like a big boy who had been deprived of his playthings . When he had finished , Mr. Conkling endeavored to conciliate him , but Mr. Davis refused to be comforted , and amused the galleries by his manifestations of childish petulance . The Senator from New-York was supported in his plea by Mr. Garland , of Arkansas . Mr. Cockrell then decided to become , the spokesman of the opposition , and declared that the sum of money to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what had taken place in the committee , but was sharply called to order by the Chair . He then tried to show that the committee had this morning discussed the expediency of postponing action on the bill until December . The absurdity of this was shown by the fact that the bill had long ago passed out of the hands of the committee . At last he appealed to Senator Williams , and begged him to insist upon resuming the debate upon the bill to pension Confederate soldiers who had fought in the Mexican war . This Senator Williams refused to do , and declared that be would vote for Holladay . He also aqqPrted that the passage of the Holladay bill would save Holladay from ruin . Thereupon Mr. Cockrell spoke against time until another motion for an executive session was made by Mr. Butler , of South Carolina . Upon this the yeas and nays were demanded , but the motion was lost-21 to 28 . After a short debate upon the Mexican Pension bill , awakened by what had been said in regard to it , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had become apparent that the opposition minority of Democrats intended to continue to filibuster , and for this reason the motion was passed by a vote of 27 to 26.
