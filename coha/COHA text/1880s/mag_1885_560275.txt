Tiu* proposal recently urged by President Eliot that " in a university the student should choose his studies and govern himself , " coupled with recent legislation at Harvard founded upon this principle , forces upon our American colleges a crisis greater than any they have hitherto been called upon to meet ; greater not only for the reason that it affects the arrangement of their courses of study and their methods of government , but also because , if the real intention of the movement for which this skillfully worded proposal serves as a watchword and catchword is to prevail generally , our colleges must be reconstructed , their attitude as to conduct and studies radically changed , the objects for which they were founded set aside , the course of preparation for entrance greatly modified , and a system of training hitherto prevalent in education abandoned . The roots of this question extend to the very theory of education , to our fundamental beliefs both as to knowledge and morals , to the questions of intelligence and enlightenment in society . The proposal itself consists of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education when the student should be free to choose his studies and govern himself , the other that the university is the place where this freedom should be granted . These two statements no educated man will be apt to deny . The proposal ( if this be all there is in it ) is a harmless truism , a matter of general admission . But it has a purpose . It is no mere reassertion of a sound educational maxim ; for the movement it represents expressly proposes to apply this to the American college , which is not in any sense a university , and has no early - prospect of becoming one . Believing the proposal , thougli plausible in words , to be in the first place thoroughly unsound in theory , in the second place contrary to the best educational experience , and in the third place practically inapplicable to all 432 // or any of our existing colleges , I desire to examine it briefly by these three tests : I. The proposal is unsound in theory . This takes us back , step by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others spriug-Why do men need to be educated at all * The answer to this is very simple , almost too simple to repeat . It is part of the accepted alphabet of civilization . Men need to be educated because they are born into this world ignorant - ignorant of themselves and ignorant of the world in which they are to live . To live rationally and order their conduct wisely , they need to know ; and being ignorant , they have to learn ; and being ignorant and having to learn , they must be educated . But what do they need to know * Just that of which they are born ignorant , namely , themselves and their surroundings . If either of these two is left unexplored , the man is so far uninformed , ignorant , uneducated . A true education will therefore acquaint us with ourselves and with our surroundings . How is this to be done ? In two ways . First , by training the mind to its highest efficiency , making it able both to know and to use all its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should therefore be exercised regularly , continuously , symmetrically . Thus , by frequent practice , the observing faculties are made acute and memory retentive , imagination is chastened , reason expanded , the will invigorated , the moral sense made clear , and the emotional nature kept unperverted and wholesome . In this way , and by the play of one power on the other , are built up such qualities as the logically clear judgment , the habit of industry , general command of our abilities , delicate taste , genuine tact , and , in short , all those ripened results in character which prove our capacity to act as free , well-balanced , rational men , able to decide for ourselves the thousand important questions of knowledge and conduct . Second , by communication of the most valuable knowledge . The training of the mind is not the sole object and process in education . The acquisition of useful , usable knowledge is also an end ; for we have to live and make our way in the world . Hence this second part ; it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the training should come first , for it gives us the power to acquire . The supposed acquisitions , the observations and reasonings and the actions too , of a man of untrained mind are ignorant , crude , and intellectually worthless . When once the pupil has received this training , and // thereby has attained sufficient maturity to know his powers accurately and use them wisely , lie is ready for freedom , and not sooner . With this stage in his educational development properly comes the place where his freedom should be exercised , and that , by common consent , is the university . Is it for an instant to be supposed that our American boys , even from the best preparatory schools , are thus intellectually and morally mature when they enter college ? Is it not a fact perfectly obvious to every one that knows anything about our colleges , that the reverse is true ? Inexperience , immaturity , incomplete preparation , want of acquaintance with his own powers , halfshaped desires and purposes , with a conscious willingness on the part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the very marks by which the entering freshman is regularly detected . Anything opposite to this is exceptional . Ask the alumni of any college what they were when they left school to become freshmen ; ask preparatory instructors , college professors , who are concerned with teaching ; parents , who know with what solicitude they trusted their sons to the college ; in fact , all who are in any way experts , and they give but one answer : The American college-student at entrance is decidedly immature . It will be urged against this view that the way to mature him is to expect manly actions and intelligence , and thus elevate him by what we distinctly assume that he will do . Give the immature young student freedom at the very start , and this will bring out his sense of responsibility , and in this way will compel him to rise to self-possession , discriminating judgment , and intellectual ripeness . It is hard to say whether the chief characteristic of this view is its plausibility or its absurdity . Absurd it certainly is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a training process but by a forcing process . It overlooks the prime law of mental development , which is that of continuous gradual growth , and not strained and sudden change . Shall we then seek to have students do what they have as yet no mature deliberative capacity for doing , by simply expecting it , or by further training 6 ? Clearly the latter . Can we omit or force any stages of mental growth , and leap from one plane to the other ? Is not the mind to follow its own gradual and steady processes of development ? The further objection , that in making a university we are entitled to count not only on what already exists , but on what may reasonably be expected of preparatory schools // in response to the greater stimulus offered by increased requirements and expectations , has the same radical defect . In fact , the new departure at Harvard offers no such stimulus . The news that a boy may soon be able to enter there , and at graduation receive the degree of Bachelor of Arts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened a Greek book , or , if he prefer , a Latin book , will not stimulate schools to require higher training . The additional fact that , save in freshman year , he may now go through and receive his degree without being required to take a single course in Latin , Greek , mathematics , physics , chemistry , geology , astronomy , psychology , logic , ethics , political science , German , or even English , is still less encouraging. * But suppose the movement to be a real attempt to secure higher preparation by having the university require this of the schools . Few if any of them are able to respond to severer requirements , such as the German , or even the French and English , schools consider necessary . Our best schools rarely furnish more than four years of Latin and three of Greek , taught at most five times a week . Compare with this the English six years ' Latin and five Greek , or the French seven years ' Latin and five years Greek , both French and English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . Are we ready to do this ? Shall we ask it , and then simply expect it ? For ten years Harvard has asked better English from our schools , and , as President Eliot confesses , with but indifferent success ; and this is the verdict of colleges generally . But let us go a step higher in our comparison . Take the German gymnasia , with their nine years ' Latin averaging nine exercises a week , and six years ' Greek at the rate of six exercises a week . Besides this , there are eight years of French and nine years of training in the mother-tongue . Is it not folly to talk of obtaining anything comparable to this by merely requiring and expecting it of our existing schools ? Schools do not stand on colleges , but colleges on schools . The higher limit of preparatory teaching will fix the lower limit for colleges or universities . As this moves up or down , they move with it . To use the words of Prof. llofmann , of Berlin : " The form and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of preparation that the student brings with him to * See President MeCosh 's address on " The New Departure , " p. 13 . ( New York , 1885. ) // the university. *** Education grows from below upward , from the elementary to the advanced , and each lower stage needs substantial completion before the next higher can be essayed with reasonable hope of success . What the student " brings with him " from the lower , gives him confidence in attempting the higher . II . The proposal is opposed to the best educated experience of the world . Systems of education have been built . Generations of well-tested experience are at hand for our inspection . This is no new question . The universities of the Old World have had to meet it . Three great systems have been constructed ,  - -  the English , the French , and the German ,  --  and each of them on a well-defined basis . The English universities stand on the endowed public schools with their six years ' course , whose central core is classical and mathematical preparation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and obedience to law . The French university plan is a system of special faculties , and the University of Paris a commission of expert educators , who prescribe the preparatory course for the lyce*s . These have a seven year5* course , classical and mathematical at heart , and upon this stands the higher education of France . The German , or , more correctly , the Prussian university system is confessedly the best of all that have hitherto appeared . It stands on the gymnasium . President Eliot wishes us to take humble lessons from Germany as to what universities ought to be ; and to that court the case may well be submitted as to that of the best qualified judges in the world . What is the Prussian system ? What are its guarantees of university stability and efficiency ? They are three . First . At the base of the whole fabric lies compulsory education , given in the Volkschule. &amp;cond . Next above this stands the gymnasium . This has a nine years ' continuous course of study . Its instruction centers in the classical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average of nine weekly exercises , and Greek six years , with six lessons a week . These two form nearly half of all the school work . To this we must add nine years of the mother-tongue , taught fully three times a week , and eight of French twice a week . This completes the language - instruction , which in all amounts to about eighteen lessons a week . Twenty lessons is Inaugural address as Rector of the University , Oct. 15 , 1880. // the approximate weekly work of our American schools . But this is oniy two-thirds of the German schedule . Add two exercises more for religious instruction , five for mathematics and elementary science , three for history and geography , two for writing and drawing , and we have the gymnasial schedule of thirty lessons a week , * an amount not paralleled elsewhere . Besides this , there are gymnastics and music . At the end of the course , if the pupil desires to enter the university regularly and seek a degree at graduation , he must first pass the severe Abiturienten-examen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this is distinctly prescribed , namely , " to ascertain whether the student has attained to that degree of scholarly culture which is the goal of the gymnasium. " t To this end all cramming is severely discouraged , all roundabout ways , short cuts , or extraordinary efforts before examination , are excluded so far as possible , and reliance is placed on the quietly sustained work of the long school course . The examination is conducted by a carefully organized commission , and has two parts , the written and the oral , of which the written lasts a week . At the end of the examination the successful student 's reward is the Zeugniss der Reife , the " certificate of ripeness " or maturity , which alone can insure him a place in the university as a regularly matriculated student , a candidate for the degree at the end of his university career . This certificate is most carefully drawn . It always contains three things - a statement as to the student 's moral behavior , attentiveness , and diligence , a statement as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard of the school , and a declaration that he has sustained the final examination . Armed with this proof of " ripeness , " he is ready , in the judgment of the Prussian university , for university freedom , but not sooner . The gymnasium does even more than this . Not content with training and testing its pupils , it also proves its teachers . Ordinarily the Prussian gymnasial teacher must first have passed through the gymnasium as a pupil , and after that the university , where , if he wishes to stand well , he attends the Seminar or regular meeting for training and investigation in his department , and takes a degree at the end of his course upon a stringent * Centralblatt fur die gesammte Unterrichts Verwaltung in Breussen , April , 1882. t Id. , May , 1882 , p. 377. // examination , and at all events passes the terrible Staats-examen , on which depends his right to be employed as a teacher . If he runs all these gauntlets , he passes a trial-year or Probe-jahr at teaching . Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher . These are the men that make the gymnasium what it is , " the corner-stone of German culture . " * Third . As the gymnasium rests upon the Yolkschule , so the university in turn rests upon the gymnasium and crowns the whole system . Here the student is free . As Helmholtz , in his address t as Rector at Berlin , explains it , the students are " young men responsible to themselves , striving after science of their own free will , to whom it is left to arrange their own plan of studies as they think best . " Here is freedom in studies and conduct , and at the university . But this freedom does not mean that any student , even if he be a gymnasial graduate , will obtain his degree at the end of his course , no matter what subjects he studies . If he desires a degree , he must first obtain permission to be examined , and then present himself thoroughly prepared in some one chief subject , called his Ilauptfach , in which he must show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original investigation . Besides this , he must offer one or two kindred subsidiary subjects , called Nebenfdcher . Should he venture to present absurdly unrelated subjects , such as chemistry and Sanskrit , the university would refuse to examine him . Should he seek for such subjects as French plays and novels , courses giving facility in Spanish or Italian , or the beginnings of fine art , he would search in vain to find them in a Prussian university4 And whether he seeks a degree or not , if he wishes to fill any of the offices of church or state , he must still pass the &amp;aats-examen , whose power is well-nigh absolute , and whose rigor is unrelenting . This upholds the whole level of university work , in addition to the guarantees furnished from below by the gymnasium . Such is the Prussian university , and such its pledges of stability . First the Volkschule , then the gymnasium , after that the university . Need we wonder that the Germans are profoundly attached to it and regard it as the very crown of their civilization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston , 1883. ) t " On Academic Freedom in German Universities , " delivered October 15 , 1877 . For complete lists of all the courses offered in the German universities , consult the Deutscher Universitdts-Kalender , published in Berlin . // It is almost superfluous to say that President Eliot 's proposed university has not one of these three great safeguards . All the features considered essential by the Germans are lacking . Still more , the practical interpretation of the proposal-seen in the intention to make Greek or Latin optional for entrance , whereas the Germans consider these two the essentials , or rather the one indivisible essential , of preparatory training - is calculated to lower our already insufficient standards . Of the same character is the attempt first to dissipate and consequently degrade the meaning of the degree of Bachelor of Arts , the historic symbol of college culture , by using it to label graduation in hundreds of combinations of different studies , from the severest to the easiest , and then to call it a university degree ; whereas the Germans have no Bachelor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as Ph . D. , to label ability for original investigation only , and not miscellaneous attainments . This is not improvement and advancement of our already imperfect education , but the disintegration of even what good we now have . The lesson of Germany and of England and of France for us is , not to build universities high in the clouds and try to drag up the foundations toward them , but to find the foundation first and then build in full faith that the structure will stand . It is a singular fact that the French Revolution , that great leveler of good and bad alike , destroyed the old classical training of France . The experiment of destruction was seen to be a mistake , and if the last and present generation of French educators have devoted themselves to anything with success , it has been to the re&amp;*stablishment of the lyce6s . It is also to be remembered that in the early years of this century Prussia tried the plan of admitting to university privileges students whose maturity was not guaranteed by the gymnasia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let down their bars , and they did so with disastrous effects , notably at the University of Bonn . This produced a strong reaction , and out of this very crisis emerged the present system in full play a few years later , under the leadership of Von Humboldt , Minister of Education , who cut out the pernicious practice by the roots and lodged the great of the Abiturientenexamen in the gymnasia , * thus holdir iasial training un * See Matthew Arnold 's " Higher Schoc rersities of Germany , " ed. of 1874 , chapter on the Abiturienten-exame*. // broken to its completion . From that time dates the manhood of the Prussian university . The spirit of President Eliot 's movement was tested and condemned in Prnssia long before it was born here . More widely known than either of these is the experiment recently allowed by the Prnssian nniversities under protest , that of admitting students without gymnasial preparation as candidates for degrees . It is well to remember that the Realschule pupils , thus allowed to enter , whose preparation the universities consider fatally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greek , less Latin ( though they have nine years of it ) , and more modern languages , mathematics , and science . The opinion of the University of Berlin on this question is so well known as to need no special comment ; it is unmistakable and unanimous . A few words from Hofmann and llelmholtz , professors there , both of the first scientific eminence , and both recently honored with the dignity of Rector of that university , will be of weight here . This is from Hofmann , on the character and secret of gymnasial success : " After a long and vain search , we must always come back finally to the result of centuries of experience , that the surest instrument that can be used in training the mind of youth is given us in the study of the languages , the literature , and the works of art of classical antiquity . " And this is from llelmholtz , on academic freedom : " Any institution based upon freedom must also be able to calculate upon the judgment and reasonableness of those to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to us with a sufficiently logically trained judgment , with a sufficient habit of mental exertion , with a tact sufficiently developed on the best models , to be able to discriminate truth from the babbling appearance of truth . . - - Thus prepared , they have hitherto been sent to us by the gymnasiums . It would be very dangerous for the universities if large numbers of students frequented them who were less developed in these respects . The general self-respect of the students must not be allowed to sink . If that were the case , the dangers of academic freedom would choke its blessings . It must not , therefore , be looked upon as pedantry , or arrogance , if the universities are scrupulous in the admission of students of a different style of education. *** III . The proposal is practically inapplicable to our existing colleges , any or all of them . The essential feature of the American college is a four years ' course of study leading to the degree * " On Academic Freedom in German Universities , " Inaugural Address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Bachelor of Arts . A college may have many other courses besides this ,  --  scientific , literary , or special ,  --  but this one is its historic center , and has been its strength . Acquaintance with our current college catalogues and college history can not fail to prove the truth of this fact . On what does the college stand ? On preparatory schools that rarely , if ever , give more than four years to their special preparation , four years for Latin , and the last three of these four to Greek also . Until within a few years , the college course of study has been prescribed throughout . But as our schools have improved , the leading colleges have been able to allow limited freedom of choice for part of the studies of the last two college years , and have kept the first two entirely or substantially prescribed , with their classical and mathematical training and incidental teaching in modern languages and science ,  --  the very elements of gymnasial instruction . If we take four years of preparatory training with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find six years of fairly disciplinary education , running to the end of sophomore year . From this time such colleges as Yale and Princeton introduce the elective system , but preserve with it a substratum of prescribed studies . This is the attitude of our colleges generally . Harvard , however , has now no required courses except three in freshman year ,  --  one in English , one in modern languages , and one in elementary science ,  --  and these bid fair to vanish soon , and thus leave a complete system of election , subject only to restrictions of college convenience in teaching and the unwillingness that individual instructors may exhibit to open their particular courses to unprepared students . This system goes still further . All uniformity of studies being removed , the students choose as they wish among the hundreds of possible combinations ; and whatever be the character of their courses chosen , severe or easy , rationally connected or wildly miscellaneous , they are all entitled upon examination to receive the degree of Bachelor of Arts . This , instead of meaning one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of courses . Besides thus affecting the degree with which the college stamps its approval on its graduates at the end , it also affects the entrance itself . For if the student may drop all his disciplinary school studies upon entering freshman year , the preparatory four years of Latin and three of Greek ( or , as is more commonly the case , three of Latin and two of Greek ) , if // stopped here , are fragmentary and incomplete , worth little to those who pnrsne them no further . Hence Greek , having received the least time , was attacked first and made optional . Now Latin also is made optional . The student , as he prefers , is to offer one , but need not bring both , in order to enter and gain the degree at the end . The irresistible logic of the situation will not permit this to stop here . When Greek goes , why does it go ? Because it has had but slight attention at the school , and as it need not be pnrsned in college and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at best only a fragment , it goes . But the system allows Latin to be omitted , on condition that the student offers Greek . Latin , it is true , nsnally receives a year more than Greek in the schools ; but as the student need not continue Latin , it is also a fragment . If the student may drop both Latin and Greek as he enters college , why compel him to offer both , or one , or either , in order to enter ? Either alone is a fragment of no great value , both together are incomplete unless pursued further . There is no good reason , and so the next thing to go after Greek or Latin will be Greek and Latin ; and who shall insure the movement stopping even here ? What , then , is the situation ? Simply this : the proposal that comes disguised as an alluring plea for universities , and consequent university freedom , first destroys the meaning of our only existing degree given for academic culture , by making it mean everything , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies commonly found in the last two years of college , but also the prescribed training of the first two years . Thereupon , instead of making every effort to secure what is thus lost from the college ( or attempted university ) by strengthening the schools so that they may make good the deficiency , it not only makes no such attempt , but , by making Latin or Greek optional for the boy who is to enter , it puts a premium on the avoidance of these studies which the best experience of the world assures us are the very essentials of high preparation , and so degrades our already imperfect school training . In short it means not the construction of a real university , but the destruction of what little good we now have in our preparatory education . It means the creation of a so-called university to which students shall be attracted by the plea of freedom , but a place where no strong guarantee of training preliminary to entrance is required , and no assurance of scholarship expected for its degree ; a place I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a common basis of culture , and may study what they please , as they please , if they please ; a place where thousands may come to sit under the shadow of a university and get what they desire , with none to molest or make them afraid - only to discover , too late , that no university has ever cast its shadow upon them . Is this the promotion of higher culture ? Is this liberal education ? Is this what educated experience counsels ? Is there any assurance that such a fabric will contain one element of intellectual unity , strength , or permanence ? It is the part of wkdom to take another plan . Strengthen and improve the good we now have , crude and defective though it be . Build from the base upward , and not from the clouds downward . Make better schools , train better teachers , study a few things well and continuously , and lift the whole level of our preparatory education . Then will the university , so deeply needed at this time in our American life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in studies , freedom in conduct . I have spoken mainly of the first , but these two are one . It is one education of one mind acting and interacting in two lines . The attainments in culture are moral attainments , and conversely . The very means employed to produce intellectual education and the destced products of this education are moral . Discipline in studies is out of the question , unless the moral elements of diligence , attentiveness , candor , ready obedience to law , determination to achieve honorable success , patience , perseverance , courage , assured control over appetites and passions , and unselfish devotion to pending duty are the ruling powers . These are both preconditions and products of genuine education . He who has them not is in the worst sense uneducated . What might such a man as Byron have been if , as Goethe ( no prejudiced witness here ) asserts , " he had but known liow to endure moral restraint also ? That lie could not , was his ruin . " What may , what do men become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in conduct touch this question deeply ? It is urged that the college is not to teach religion or attempt the supervision of morals . Let the student look to these himself , aided by the natural helps of home remembrances , his studies , and his ambition . If this be so , and the home-training in religion and virtue , priceless so far as it goes , is to cease when the inex* // perienced American school-boy becomes a freshman , and finds that religion which he has been taught to revere receiving no public recognition or general respect from the college , and instruction in religion specifically ruled out from the course of study , that the college in no way encourages him to attend any religious exercise , that in matters of morals he can not confidently expect the personal help and succor of his instructors in his various endeavors to act honorably , live purely , and resist temptations to evil that will meet him just as surely as his college days go on ,  --  if this easy-going dealing with faith and morals is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most dangerous element in the whole movement . That this is its spirit , is clear from its record . We must judge it not by what it hopes or expects or promises , but by what it has done , and these things are matters of observation . Our hopes lie another way . What our youth most need is discipline of character , deeply inwrought with their studies . What our culture needs is men first and specialists second ; otherwise , we shall not avoid the intellectual horrors that lie in exclusive specialism in one direction and dilettanteism in the other . What our society needs is a large number of trained , enlightened men , the only sure guarantee for an enlightened public opinion . If these things are true , then let those who believe them resist and expose this new departure , not in , but from education . ANDREW F. WEST .
