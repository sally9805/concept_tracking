comes in like a flood , can lift up a standard against him . " " Ye shall receive power , " said Jesus , " after that the Holy Spirit is come upon you ; " and when did earth in all her previous and subsequent experience , witness such a manifestation of " power " as was seen in the preaching and acts of the apostles , after our other Comforter came upon them ? What are all the achievements of earth 's greatest warriors on the field of battle , compared with those accomplished by the apostles under their invisible Leader ? When we contemplate their miracles , their boldness of speech , their incessant labors , their amazing success , we should almost forget that they were men of like passions with ourselves , and cry out with the people of Lystra , " the gods are come down to us in the likeness of men , " did not the inspired historian assure us , " they are filled with the Holy Ghost . " Those days of success will return when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to honor our other Comforter and lean on his strength , as did the apostles of our Lord . There is something , as it seems to us , highly dishonorable to the Holy Spirit , in the practical estimate in which he has long been held by the church . We have been too much accustomed to consider him a sort of impersonal and unconscious influence , descending at certain times and seasons upon the church and the world , like the rain and dew of heaven . Christ however told his church that when this other Paraclete came , he would " abide with them forever " -uninterruptedly to the end of this dispensation . In him the church was to have an unfhiling , ever-present dependence , in all times and seasons ; that she might be incited to a course of unremitted exertion in the service of God . The church is ever to be under the guidance and government of this divine and omnipresent Head . her rules of order and her course of life she is to learn from the word which He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she is to draw from his indwelling influence  --  the secret power by which he corrects the obliquities of the human heart . She is to acknowledge no other supreme Head . No canons may he enacted for her government opposed to his enactments , and no authority exercised unless sanctioned by his revelations . She is always to look to him as her Head , to obey his laws , and to cherish his presence . Then shall her light rise in obscurity , and her darkness be as the noon day . ANTI-RENT DISTURBANCE . WHILE we write , a part of the state of New York is in an actual state of insurrection , declared so by the executive authority . The cause of such a proclamation is found ic the fact , that the civil power was shown to be insufficient for the just and prompt execution of the laws , and the military has been called out to sustain it . In other parts of the same state , like fearful disturbances , ariaing from ehullitions of misguided popular feeling , have threatened breaches of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by any calamitous circumstance . And in a far distant state of our general confederacy , civil war has been *vildly stalking through her borders , burning the property , and sacrificing the lives of her citizens , while the majesty of the civil law was trampled // in the dust , arid her officers and their authority scouted and derided . The protection of the law has been valueless-popular feeling has usurped its prerogatives , and become for the time being the supreme authority ; and in obedience to its dictates , a portion of her citizens have been compelled to announce their determination to leave their rightful homes and firesides , and scek anew a resting place , where they can peaceably live and worship God according to the dictates of their own consciences . And in another sister state of the mighty West , the wild and uncontrollable mob has scarcely ceased from the destruction of private property , because in this loud boasting land of liberty , the owner dared to speak as he thought , and to publish what his conscience and enlightened reason told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are full of earnest and vital interest . The question whether there is a natural tendency in democratic institutions to degenerate into lawless anarchy-whether the people , when left to govern themselves , will eventually fail of retaining any government is now irresistibly forced upon us , claiming our careful and attentive consideration . In many counties of New York , turbulent and disguised mobs have placed themselves in open and organized opposition to her laws , and have , in too many cases successfully , trodden under foot the rights of her civil authority . But in none has the misguided populace exhibited so much fury , and at times ferocity , and nowhere have such calamitous consequences been produced as in the county of Delaware , heretofore noted for the simplicity and good order of its inhabitants , and distinguished for their general and prompt obedience to the laws . There a few citizens combined and associated themselves to resist a portion of the established law , which they considered as founded in injustice , and from a small number increased to nearly one third of the population , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till as a closing part of the game they were playing , they murdered a valuable and honest public officer , while in the discharge of his duty . While discharging those duties , which his oath of office imposed upon him , the sheriff of the county was surrounded by two hundred and fifty , or more , armed and disguised men , and in the broad glare of the light of day was deliberately shot down . In view of this state of things , the governor was induced to issue his proclamations , declaring the county in a state of insurrection , and in obedience to the directions therein contained , an armed force has been gathered , to assist in the execution of the civil law , and to keep securely those who have been arrested as participators in these outrages . In the little village of her shire town , while we write , the piercing notes of the fife , and the deep roll of the drum are heard , and the measured tread of a military force falls upon the ear , impressing upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebellion , and that the marching soldiery and not the law are the only protectors of the people . But sad as is the scene , where heavy cannon , in time of peace , guard the prison doors , and bristling bayonets are the supports of the court of justice , a more gloomy view meets the eye in those portions of the county , where the excitement has existed with the least restraint , and where nearly all have been drawn within its fatal influence . Although months have already passed since the murder of the*sheriff , the harvests still remain ungathered as they were on that fatal day . Hay heaped together on that morning lies rotting in the meadow unmade and unstacked . Field8 of grain have ripened and // fallen down because the reapers are fugitives from justice . Indeed a curse seems resting upon the land , and a blight to have passed over it . But why is this ? Why has the husbandman forsaken his field , the mechanic his shop , and fled to the recesses of the mountain , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the arm of the law ? The cause is expressed in a word of recent coinage-A nti-rentism . A brief narrative of those commotions which have produced a partial state of anarchy , will give us a better understanding of the reasons generally alleged in excuse . The first agitation of any importance , during later years , was in 1840 , when the tenants of the west half of the manor of Rensselaerwick , living among the Flelderberg mountains , ( whence the name of the Helderberg war , ) refused to pay rent for the use of the soil on which they lived . The sheriff of the county was prevented by large assemblages of men from levying executions , and although no actual violence was offered him , the ordinary process of law was fully stopped . Conciliatory measures were tried , but in vain , for those resisting felt the law was powerless . As a dernier resort the militia of the state was called into service by Governor Seward ; and this force combined with other instrumentalities , eventually sustained the laws , and after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however only a deceptive calm . The disease still remained . The festering sore was only concealed by a healthy surface . The spirit of resistance continued at work , and evidenced itself in such exhibitions , as almost effectually to prohibit the collection of any rent , and continued to gain power , until it broke forth in 1844 , and far exceeded its former bounds and limits . It spread into the neighboring counties of Rensselaer , Schenectady , Columbia , Otsego , Delaware , UI. ster , Greene , and indeed generally found its way whereever leasehold tenures existed , and the occupier was not owner of the right of soil . Compared with the shape it had assumed four years previous , it seemed to spring forth with tenfold fury and power . The years in which it had been forced to assume an ap . pearance of rest , seem to have been a time , in which it was gathering its energies and strengthening its forces , preparatory to the occasion which should next call it forth-to have been only the calm which precedes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new characteristic , which to the reflective mind rendered it more fearful and alarming , and which has probably , more than any other part of its machinery , contributed to those terrible results which have flowed from it . Under disguises publicly worn , the power of the law was more easily rendered impotent , because the probabilities of detection were much lessened . Those who wore them were often unknown , not only to the great portion of the community , but even to one another . With this safeguard against recognition , the worst acts were committed , and seemingly without hesitation . They exercised a strict espionage over every lessee . Whoever acknowledged title in the landlord , under whom they all had held their farms for many years , provoked their wrath . An instance in the county of Rensselaer is in point . A laborer contracted with one of the patroons for the timber of an unimproved lot , and commenced its removal . For daring to make an agreement with a landlord , now odious , he was warned by the natives to desist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was surrounded while on his way to market to dispose of it , by armed and disguised men , when a contest arose in which he was shot dead . And nearly at the same // time another fearful tragedy was acted in another , Columbia county . While the officers of justice were in pursuit of a culprit , a large collection of men provided with arms , and with faces and forms so disguised that none could know them , offered resistance . On the one hand , were the ministers of the law , striving to do their duty , and against them a treasonable mob , in open defiance , both of them and the law they represented . A wrangling contest ensued , and from words the mob had recourse to deadly weapons , until the affray ended in the death of one of the company . Only a few days previous , in the same county , the sheriff while attempting to collect rent was opposed by an assemblage of the same character , and robbed of his papers . It was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion , engaged in taking the sheriff 's papers , that the murder last mentioned was committed . The law once broken by forcibly taking her precepts from her officers , an attempt to screen the guilty naturally followed , and in that attempt a deeper crime was committed . After the arrest of the supposed criminals , threats that those in confinement would be rescued , and other outrages committed , induced Governor Bouck to place a military force at the disposal of the civil power , and the city of Hudson became like a garrisoned town . By this union of civil and military power , arrests were soon made and further outbreaks prevented , and ere long , quiet was again sufficiently restored to warrant the withdrawal of the forces thus temporarily furnished . This event , which was almost new in the annals of our country , and which attracted great public interest , did not prevent the spread of the excitement . In other counties , particularly in Delaware , anti-rent associations were formed , and in many of the towns , tribes of Indians ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sworn by an oath , to be faithful to the cause and to one another . rlhe ignorant , the worthless , and the vicious , flecked together in these disguised bodies , under the promise of daily wages and daily rations , and were easily transformed into suitable material for the accomplishment of any bad object . And they soon showed themselves obedient to the trust reposed in them ; for they resisted the officers of the law , while in the performance of their duty ; took from them their papers ; tarred and feathered them ; heaped abuse upon them ; and detained them as prisoners ; insulted them and threatened them with death . To rescue these prisoners and to ensure the due execution of the laws , it became necessary to call upon the civil posse of the county , and enough were found ready to enter with alacrity and determination upon the unpleasant and dangerous duty . Having accomplished their object , they were again restored to their homes , with the hope that the energy manifested in sustaining the law and her officers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the constituted authorities , and prevent any future disturbance . But the hope proved fallacious , for soon the Indian tribes again assembled to prevent the collection of rent , and an under sheriff was murdered . It now appeared that the civil *O55C was insufficient to maintain the supremacy of law ; and hence Governor Wright declared the county in a state of insurrection , and quartered an armed force within it . Since then additional jails have been built to retain those arrested for murder , and many have been tried , found guilty , and condemned to death or imprisonment . The causes which have produced these events will need a more particular and careful consideration . The counties to which we have al. * // luded , and perhaps others , are mainly occupied and improved by leaseholders , and not by those who are owners of the soil in fee . The sections of country , comprised within their boundaries , have been so held since the commencement of our government , and in some cases the original title dates back antecedent to that event . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , commence " in the olden time . " The oldest manor or proprietary where this leasehold tenure is in existence , is the manor of Rensseinerwick , and it claims an origin almost as early as the first discovery of New York . A short account of this , the oldest , may not therefore be inappropriate or uninteresting . The first recognition we have of the manor is a grant from the Dutch government to Killian Van Rensselaer in 1631 , of a territory with . in the followiag boundaries- " On the west side of the North River , having its length a little higher than Beeren Island , up the river till unto Smackey Island , in breadth two days ' journey into the country . " These boundaries are spoken of , as being the same recognized in deeds from the Indians , of a previous date , to the same Killian . By reference to history , it will be seen that this was but a comparatively short time after the first discovery of this continent ' by that nation . A general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of discovery to the giving of this patent , may help us better to understand what will follow . In September , 1609 , Hudson discovered that river " to which time has given his name , " and asserted title in his government . In 1621 " The Dutch West India Company " was incorporated , possessing the exclusive privilege of planting colonies on this continent from the " Straits of Magellan to the extremest north . " Five branches of this Company were established in the principal cities of the Netherlands ; and to Amsterdam it was given to have the charge of New Netherlands . Nineteen directors had superintendence of the whole government of the Company . In 1629 this college of nineteen adopted a charter of privileges for patrons who desired to plant colonies in New Netherlands . The colonies were to represent the lordships in the Netherlands . " He that would within four years plant a colony of fifty souls , became lord of the manor or patron , possessing in absolute property the land he might colonize . " The extent of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length ; or if they lay on both sides of a river , eight miles on each bank , stretching as far into the interior as the situation might require , yet it was stipulated that the soil must be purchased of the Indians . " ( 2 Ban . 279 . ) His power was to extend over growing cities , subject to appeals . Under such inducements , many emigrated to New Netherlands and commenced colonies . Among the most prominent were the ancestors of the late Stephen Van Rensselaer , or as he was generally termed , " The Patroon . " Killian Van Rensselaer , the original ancestor , " was a large proprietor and director in the Amsterdam branch of the Dutch West India Company . He was also one of the college of nine instituted by the directors in 1629 to direct affairs in the New Netherlands . In 1630 , the year previous to the grant from the Dutch government , lie had , through his agent , purchased the land round Fort Orange , that is , from Albany to the mouth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years after , the purchase was extended twelve miles further south ; and from time to time he increased his boundaries , until in 1637 his full territory was made out , forming a tract twenty four miles in breadth north and south , by forty eight in length from // east to west ; being nearly identical with the manor of the present day . This manor continued in the family under Dutch rule , till the conquest of the province by the English , which took place in 1&amp;64 , under the auspices of the Duke of York , to whom his brother , Charles II , the then reigning prince , had by a pa. tent given that territory now embraced in New York and New Jersey . In 1685 the colony of Reusselaerwick was converted into a regular lordship or manor , with all the privileges incident to an English estate of the manorial kind . In 1704 a charter from Queen Anne , in which former grants , and records , and muniments of title are substantially recited , confirmed the estate to Killian Van Rensselaer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charter of 1704 he was empowered to administer justice in his court-leet or court-baron , and had the right of separate representation in the colonial assembly . And for eighty four years previous to the Revolution , the manor was never without its representative , who was always found on the side of popular liberty , battling against the encroachments of arbitrary power . The last of these manorial represenatives was General Abraham Ira Broeck , uncle of the late patroon . The enjoyment of these rights continued unimpaired till the Revolution ; and after that contest , which resulted so favorably to free principles , the manor still continued in the same line of proprietors , and their rights in the same were confirmed and established by the new state government , as appears from the following extracts from the Constitution . The xxxvi section of the former constitution of the state ef New York , adopted in convention of the representatives of that state at Kingston , 20th April , 1775 , is as follows : - " And be it further ordained , that all grants of land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain , or persons acting under his authority , after the fourteenth day of October , one thousand seven hundred and seventy five , shall be null and void ; but that nothing in this constitution contained , shall be construed to effect any grants of land , within this state , made by the authority of the said King , or his predecessors , or to annul any charters to bodies politic , by him or them , or any of them , made prior to that day . " And in section xiv of article 7th of the present constitution , which went into effect on the " last day of December , one thousand eight hundred and twenty two , " nearly the same language is used : " All grants of lands within this state , made by the King of Great Britain , or persons acting under his authority , after the fourteenth day of October , one thousand seven hundred and seventy five , shall be null and void ; but not thing contained in this constitution shall effect any grants of land within this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or his predecessors , or shall annul any charters to bodies politic or corporate by him or them made before that day . " So far then as the titles and the rights of landed proprietors were concerned , our Revolution left them , as a general thing , in the same position in which they were previous to that event . Except in remarkable and prominent instances , the principle of confiscation was not recognized or tolerated , but legal and rightful owners were confirmed and quieted in their titles , and a general disposition manifested that the private relations of property should not be assailed but protected . In accordance with this principle , the lord of the manor still retained his possession , gaining in fact a new title by the constitution , only being necessitated to swear fealty and support to the new government , instead of retaining his allegiance to the old . Besides the privileges , however , // of holding his own court-leet or court-baron , and of being entitled to a separate representation in the colonial assembly , there was another peculiarity in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection . After reciting that the manor should be held in free and common socage as tl ) e manor of East Greenwich in Kent , the following clause is inserted : - " Yielding , rendering and paying therefor , yearly and every year , henceforth forever unto us , our heirs and successors , at our custom house in our city of New York , or to our collector or receiver general there , for the time being , on the feast day of the annunciation of the blessed Virgin Mary , the rent of fifty bushels of good merchantable winter wheat , in lieu and stead of all other . rents , services , and demands whatever for the same . " In another grant , called the Livingston grant , executed in 1686 by " Thomas Dougan , Lieutenant Governor and Vice Admiral under his majesty King James the Second , of the province of New York and its dependencies , " there is a similar clause , as follows : - " Yielding , and paying therefor , unto his said majesty , his heirs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers as shall from time to time be appointed to receive the same , on the five and twentieth day of March , forever , at Albany , the full and just sum of eight and twenty shillings current money of that country . " There is another patent which demands some attention in this connexion , because covering a portion of that country where the most fatal effects of anti-rentism has thus far been experienced . We allude to the llardenburgh patent , which embraces nearly all that section of Delaware county held under leasehold tenures . Like the one of which we have given a short history , its origin is very ancient , having been granted by the crown of Great Britain in 1708 to Johannas Llardenburgh and seven others . It commenced at the Sandbergh , a place back of Newburgh in Orange county , and run " to the Fishkill or Delaware river ; thence up the same to the head thereof , including the same ; " and from thence to the Canduskill to a point near the Catskill Mountain House ; and thence along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it was made in 1749 , and extended only to the east branch of the Delaware river , though in the next two succeeding years the survey was completed , and bounded by the west branch , appropriating the land intermediate between the two branches : and about the same time , partition was made among the patentees , and mutual releases executed . From the facts , that the first survey extended only to the east branch , and that there has been some dispute , which of the two branches was the " Fishkill , " there has been a somewhat generally prevalent opinion , that the Hardenburghs originally had no valid title to the land lying between them . Disregarding the fact that such title has been held under color of title for more than one hundred years , a period surely long enough to claim it by right of possession , the idea of no title has been advanced and dwelled upon during these times of *xcitement , and has undoubtedly been a fruitful source of much of the trouble and injury which Delaware county has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another part of our article . Under such original grants , of which the two to which we have referred are but representatives , though circumstances have rendered them the most prominent , and with such rights and privileges , reservations and duties contained in them , as we have already seen , most of which grants have been anew acknowledged , and ratified in the most solemn manner by the supreme // authority of the state government , the present possessors and their ancestors have held these lands . As a general thing , the descendants of the original proprietors have held the possession , and claim their right to them from descent , rather than from any of the modes of purchase . Tracing back their own genealogy , their landed title extended side by side with it . The tenures also by which the tenants have held their farms , have always been nearly of the same character ; and whatever title they have gained has only been such as could be derived from the first proprietors , and those deriving from them . These tenures have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warranty or quit claim ; and they can be resolved into four general classes , though there may be slight differences between individuals under each of these kinds . There will be sufficient uniformity however among those thus slightly differing to *varrant this arrangement . The first kind is the durable lease , given for " as long as grass gro*vs and water runs , " or " forever . " Under this lease , the lessee , his heirs and assigns , are entitled to retain possession of the premises described therein , using and im ) roving the same as his judgment or interest may dictate , with full knowledge and confidence , that as long as he abides by the terms of his contract , and pays the yearly rent , a stipulated sum or quantity for the use of his farm , he or they can occupy and hold , and forever . In leases of this kind , given on some of the estates , there is reserved , upon every alienation of the premises , otherwise than by devise or last will and testament , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whence the term quarter sales ; the tenant covenanting to pay such proportion upon every sale . And connected with this reservation , there is sometimes the privilege , that the lessor or landlord shall be permitted himself to purchase from the tenant , when a sale at any given sum is contemplated , at the proposed price , if desirous to do so . But aside from these reservations , and such others as may have been agreed to , as well by the tenant as by the landlord , it rests entirely with the tenant , whether he will have a constant and lasting home , or surrender it . Holding possession of his landed estate under a contract , in which the rent , whether in kind or amount , is particularly mentioned and specified , fulfilling his part of the agreement , he need have no fear that the avarice or hostility of his landlord can place any other burden upon him , than what he himself has consented to bear . Claiming and exercising only such rights and privileges as he has coyenanted to receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has agreed , the growing population of the country , the increased productiveness , and consequent enhanced value of the land , can make no addition to the sums he has to pay for occupancy . If the products of his toil and the beasts of his field bring a more than usual return , no cupidity can demand a proportionate increase in the amount due from him for the soil he cultivates . The farm he tills he knows its bounds : the rent he pays , he knows its present sum and the amount for any future time . Here is stability beyond the possibility of variation , provided he so wishes and so determines . The second kind is the redemption lease , uniting the peculiarities and benefits of a lease , with the vested right to become the owner of the fee . Under leases of this character , the tenant may pay , for the use and occupancy of the soil , the stipulated rent , or he may purchase , at a specifled price , the fee , and in very many cases , upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest is allowed him , which is applied as so much towards the agreed // rent . Two alternatives are offered him , either of which he may adopt : or he may hold under both at the same time , as in the case of part payment of the purchase money , and payment of rent exceeding the interest of the purchase money thus part paid . But accepting either , or holding under both , his choice becomes that of his landlord . He must be bound and governed by such conclusions and determinations as his tenant approves and adopts . If preferable to pay the rent , which seldom equals a seven per centum interest upon the actual worth of the land , the lessor can not take away the privilege : and if unpleasant , and , as he may imagine , degrading reservations attach to him as a lessee , he has but to decide and to act , and his is the pleasure of being a fee owner . Two ways being marked out before him in which to act , no one but himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one most rugged and toilsome , as he alone can select the easier and more agreeable . In many cases1 particularly where the lessee has no capital but his wits , and no labor machines but his own strong hands , redemption leases are much more desirable than a contract for sale . For such , it is much easier to pay the rent , even when the highest pay the annual interest and a certain portion of the principal , than to make a down payment of the whole . In this kind of lease also , the tenant finds the same desideratum we have noticed in the first class mentioned , that no changes or circumstances can increase his yearly rent , as long as he maintains his covenanted contract , while in addition he has the power to change , at any moment , his estate from leasehold to freehold . Surely no one can fail of observing , that such tenants have great and peculiar privileges , and that one must be unreasonable who seeks to rid himself of both alternatives The third kind is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives of any three persons , whose names are inserted in the lease , or until the death of the last survivor . From the necessity of the case , such leases being compulsory on the landlord , and available for the tenant , only during the lives of the persons selected , and the uncertainty of life being so great , there can be none of that stability which characterizes the other kinds mentioned . The insertion of the name of a child as one of the lessees may prolong the leasehold estate for two generations , but can hardly extend it to a third . In most instances , they will but little exceed the duration of a single generation . Viewed in the most favorable light , they are marked by a great degree of uncertainty : an uncertainty , moreover , entirely independent of the parties to them , and one which the tenant can not , by the most prudent and careful watchfulness , obviate . In this respect at least , they must prove themselves very objectionable . Nearly allied to this class are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall here consider , because they depend upon and are characterized by the same uncertainty . The individual name of each of these varieties marks their differences . Each from its great precariousness , would seem to be adopted with hesitation , and if adopted , to prevent the lessee from complaining at any event which might happen . rphe fourth and last kind is the yearly lease , the name of which gives its character . It runs only for a twelve month 's time , and expires on a given day and date , neither party being bound in a future agreement to adopt or follow the terms of a former one . Future rent or use must be arranged as the parties in interest can agree , each having the privilege of acting with perfect freedom . In the familiar instances of a yearly lease of a dwelling or a ware-room , the same principles are // involved , and the same laws govern . To both , the lessor and the lessee , they can be neither desirable nor beneficial ; to the one , as furnishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and consequently weakening his desire to become a thrifty farmer , and deadening his ambition ; to the other , as affording only a poor prospect of any valuable improvemeats , and increasing the chances of deterioration . Under leases belonging to some one of the above described classes , these lands , and many other tracts , have been held and occupied , from a time far anterior to the organization of our state institutions . Under this leasehold system , the tenants were prosperous . By a great and gradual change , the forest had given way to cultivated fields , and the rude hut to splendid or at least commodious mansions . Yet amid numerous gratifying and beneficial changes , at a time when general depression was far removed from the mass , and when prosperity was waiting upon the people , a surmise crept in among them , that the tenures under which they lived , were onerous , anti-republican and unjust , and that as individuals and as citizens a strenuous op. position was demanded from them . A feeling extremely radical , and consequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seeking some escape . This local excitement discovered a way , and the pent up spirit rushed forth and assumed the name of the local cause which produced it . Some , the calmer and more worthy sort , who honestly believed their leases highly objectionable , and , of right , ought to be modified and corrected , adopted the new name , under which in a legal , honorable way , they meant to combat the error and gain the right . Others again , the larger portion , who fancied they saw a new and easy way to pay their debts , which like an incubus were pressing them down , and who stopped not to inquire whether justice and law were with them , provided they could gain their wished for ends , rallied under the gathering word of anti-rentism , and decked themselves in strange and uncouth disguises , and called themselves " Indians , " assuming the high sounding titles of the sons of the forest , and by their actions gave all to understand , that they were determined to prosecute to success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they were firmly resolved to pay no longer any rent , or acknowledge a landlord 's title . Still another class , followers of Fourier and Owen , world conventionists , who give a ready support to every scheme , however wide from nature , or wanting in common sense , joined themselves to the two former , and gave them their sympathy and assistance . And dishonest and designing politicians , who could pierce the future just far enough to see that this excitement , if properly managed , would become a popular doctrine with the great body of those living under such tenures , eagerly seized hold of it , and with brazen lungs trumpeted it to all around , not forgetting to laud their own patriotism in thus coming forth in the support of right , and determined , like many others called honest and pure , to ride into office and gather the spoils . To all these classes anti-rentism has been , as it were , a magic word , and under it , they have attempted to repudiate solemn contracts , and defraud the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this position will be denied ; but in sup . port of it we refer to facts , now well established , and familiar to all cognizant of the machinery and contrivances of anti-rentism . As a general thing , all the tenants have claimed the protection of anti-rent associations , have paid a specified tax per acre for such protection , and under the instructions of such associations , have refused to pay the yearly rent . That they // have so done , is proved from acknowledgments in familiar conversations , and from their own confessions , made before legal tribunals , under the sanctity of an oath . With such objects in view , many counties have rallied under the same standard , and seem determined that it shall be triumphant , even at the expense of law and order . And as the flag of " equal rights " is thrown to the breeze , and misguided and frenzied men are gathering around it , and designing demagogues are driving the rn on , a duty is placed upon us to inform ourselves of the grievances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand the means adopted for their removal , so that we may be enabled to judge and act correctly like honest men and honest citizens . The complaints of tenants are various , but they generally take some or all the following formseither that the claim of those , who assume to be lords of the manor , is unfounded and fictitious ; or that the leases contain provisions opposed to the spirit of our republican institutions , or unjust and oppressive in themselves ; or that they are precluded from inquiring into and disputing the right of the lessor , though he had no right to lease to them the lands . As a remedy for what they thus feel unjust and unequal , they ask such a modifica- ' tion of the law , that the landlord should be bound legally to establish his title , or fail to enforce the conditions of the lease , and also that the right to distrain may be taken away . These charges are supported in part by those , who from their inability to learn the facts in the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sources , and who are unwilling to believe any person would bring forward such grave and weighty accusations , without at least a fair and plausible foundation : and they also receive countenance from another class , who stifle reason 's voice when she speaks not in accordance with their passions , and will not be convinced of the fallacy of the arguments they advance , or if convinced , are like those who " Convinced against their will Are of the same opinion still . " But however supported , it becomes us calmly to investigate the charges and learn their falsity or correctness . The question of title in the " manor of Rensselaerwick " has often come up before the courts of the state , and as often been decided in favor of the proprietors . Yet because only certified copies of the recorded patents were needed , and possession itself was prima facie evidence to sustain the actions for rent , the original title deeds were not produced ; and hence many were led to believe , that what have been held to be titles were mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt concerning the title of " Rensselaerwick " assumed various shapes ; now , that there was no valid title , and then , that it only embraced a part of the territory at present included under it ; at one time that the present proprietors were not lineal descendants of the original grantee , and at another , that the documents purporting to be title deeds were not duly executed ; and still again , that the last great charter of Queen Anne proved its own falsity because it bore the seal of William and Mary . In respect to the validity of title we find the following evidences . The oldest deed of which we have any knowledge , relating to the manor in question , is the one we have already alluded to , which was given to Killian Van Rensselaer , 8th April , 1630 , granting land from Barren Island to Smackey Island , the former of which , marked then , and does now , the southern circuit of the manor ; // and another Indian deed also is found , remarkable because it distinguishes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that direction by the Cohoes Falls . Many other deeds from the same sources are in the possession of the proprietors , ranging from 1630 to 1727 , conveying separate parcels , and extinguishing the Indian title to the entire manor which had previous to the last date reached its pre . sent size . To prove still stronger this extent from north to south , an old map is still extant made in 1630 , whose limits in these directions are the same as those now claimed by the present boundaries . The increase of the manor beyond the size specified in the " Charter of Privileges to Patrons , " may undoubtedly be accounted for from the fact that that charter measured the manor by the number of settlers located , an increased number of whom would enlarge the boundaries . Various documents also are found , recognizing in many ways , from 1630 to 1641 Killian Van Rensselaer as Patroon under the Dutch government . On the 9th of June 1674 , a recommendation also from the States General to King Charles 11. in behalf of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the States General , which is still preserved . Other papers exist in the archives of the Van Rensselaer family , showing the action of the Duke of York in relation to the manor , being petitions to the Duke , references to his council , and his warrant to Sir Edmond Andros of June 7th , 1679 , for the grant of the patent . For various reasons action was delayed , until finally a patent was granted under King James , by Governor Dougan , on the 5th Nov. 1685 . This was executed by Thomas Dougan , Lieutenant Governor and Vice Admiral of New York , and its dependencies , &amp;c. under James the Second , " Su preme Lord and proprietor of the colony and province of New York and its dependencies in America , " and was to " Killian Van Rensselaer the son of Johannas Van Rensselaer , and Killian Van Rensselaer the son of Jeremias Van Rensselaer , their heirs and assigns forever , " " in trust to and for the only use and behoof of the right heirs and assigns of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rensselaer , party to these presents . " To this patent was affixed the seal of the province , and contains the usual evidences of authenticity . From an old gene . alogical chart found also among the papers of the family , it appears that the original proprietor , Killian , had three sons , John Baptist , Johannas and Jeremias . The two latter became the second proprietors of the manor , each of whom had a son Killian , who were the grantees in the deed , or patent of 1685 , from Governor Dougan . In 1687 , Killian the son of Johannas , one of the second proprietors , died without issue , leaving Killian , the son of Jeremias in possession , to whom in 1695 , all the heirs in Holland , claiming through John Baptist , released through their attorney Kilhan , son of said John Baptist . Kilhan son of Jeremias thus became sole proprietor of the manor . And in November , 1703 , he presented to his Excellency Edward Viscount Cornbury and his council a petition claiming an absolute patent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the members of the board or any three of them , who are to examine into the truth of the allegations in the said petitions contained , and make their report to the board how they shall find the same . " On the following day a favorable report was endorsed on the petition , and an order to the attorney general to draft letters patent " at a yearly quit rent of fifty bushels of good merchantable winter wheat . " // Against the passage of the said patent , a caveat was entered , upon which the final determination of the council was unfavorable ; and those who entered the same , afterwards acknowledged title in Mr. Van Rensselaer , by taking a release from him of the premises for which the caveat was entered . The patent was issued the twentieth day of May , 1704 , in the third year of the reign of Queen Anne . It describes the manor as " known by ye name of ye colony of Rensselaerwick , " extending " from the south end of Barren Island " northward to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said river , and extending itself east and west all along from each side of ye said river , backward into the woods twenty four English miles . " By the record in the old Dutch family Bible , it appears that this Kilhan had a family of six , the four younger of whom were sons . By his will made in 1718 , and proved before " Peter Schuyler , Esquire , President of his Majesty 's Council for the province of New York , and territories thereon depending in America , " on the 10th of May , 1720 , he gave the manor to his oldest son Jeremias , and his heirs male , and in default to his second son Stephen , and his heirs male . Jeremias died without issue , and Stephen thus became proprietor . He married and had two children , the youngest of whom was a son , bearing his father 's name , and to whom the estate descended ; This second Stephen married also , the first fruits of which were , in 1764 , Stephen , the late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his sons , the present proprietors , by his last will and testament . To his son Stephen , that part west of the Hudson , and to his son William the part lying east of the same river . Considering the great length of time during which title to the manor has been claimed as being in the ancestral line of the present owners , we rather wonder that it appears so clear and satisfactory and indisputable as these facts prove it . The extent of the manor is still farther evident from two maps , one in the manor office made by a surveyor seventy five years since , and the other published in London in 1779 , by both of which the present bounds are substantially sustained . In reference to the execution of the patents , the Dougan grant bears a signature " about midway on the lower and turned up margin of the parchment , " and the recital of it in the later patent of Queen Anne proves its authenticity . The latter patent is signed on the left hand of the parchment by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer corresponding to the secretary of state . Though the seal of the patent of Queen Anne bears the name of William and Mary , it proves nothing against its validity , because it purports to be a seal , not of the crown , but of the colony . Were it evidence however against its validity , the order for its issuing , to which we have already alluded , would seem entirely to prove its legality and remove all doubts of its authenticity . If we believe it a forgery , we must believe all the corroborating records which exist relative to it , and which like dumb witnesses support it , forgeries also . We can not better express our conviction in regard to the whole matter of the title of the manor of Rensselaerwick , than to adopt the language of a committee reporting to the New York legislature . To this same report we are also much indebted for facts in regard to the genealogy of the Van Rensselaer family , and the execution of the patents under which they claim . " If possession under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and actual title for one hundred and forty years , recognized and confirmed by the various governments through // 1846 . Validit*i of Title . which it has passed , and ratified not only by the laws , but by the constitution of New York , is not a perfect title , it would be extremely difficult to find one ; there can certainly be none in the empire state . " A cool and careful investigation of the title of the Hardenburgh patent must result , we believe , in an equally clear and complete refutation of the charges against its validity . No dispute or difficulty has ever existed in respect to its boundaries , save on one side . The language used in describing this side is as follows : - " to the Fishkill or Delaware river , thence up the same to the head thereof , including the same . " The boundary as it now exists , has been disputed because there are two branches of the Delaware river , the east and west branch , both of which are nearly of the same size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and as a proof that the east branch was originally considered the westerly boundary of the patent , mention is made of the fact that the first survey extended only to that branch , but was subsequently continued to the west one . It is on this disputed territory , between these two branches , that the greatest violence of anti-rentism has been exhibited , and that the murder of a judicial officer while engaged in his official duties has been perpetrated . The first survey , it is true , made in 1749 , extended only to the East branch , but a farther one was commenced in 1750 and completed in 1751 , extending to the branch most westerly . But this omission to make the full and correct location at the first , and at such an early period of our country , proves nothing we conceive , but the indefinite understanding of the patentees in regard to the extent of their lands , or ignorance in the surveyor who was employed to locate them . Had the first survey been acquiesced in , and acted under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duration , and then extended , there might be some plausibility in the charge that the territory was inequitably seized . But the immediate correction of the mistake , as soon as discovered , rather shows that the boundaries were intended to be , as they at present exist . Any one , acquainted with the locating of patents at that early period , will not wonder that such a mistake should happen . Nor does this mistake prove any surrender of any title originally possessed . The action of the state government , however , in 1783 , seems to have put the matter at rest . In that year General Bradstreet applied for a grant between the said branches , and the subject was fully examined by the commissioners of the land office . They found the west branch had retained the name of the " Fishkill or Delaware river , " and adjudged and determined accordingly ; thus , we should suppose , quieting any doubt that might thereafter have arisen . But , even if in the cases of both these patents , there was no valid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal one , which , though perhaps not as gratifying , is certainly for all purposes as effective , because the law sustains it . The whole civilized world have adopted the principle , that possession , for , a certain length of time under any color of title , establishes title , and this principle has been acted upon wisely , and for the best of reasons . The law of New York has specified twenty years as this time ; and none , we presume , will deny , but that by law the landlords have a perfect title . That old titles should be held sacred , that those controverting such titles should be stopped , seems necessary for all . Were it otherwise , in the possession of property , there would neither be stability nor peaceable enjoyment . And this principle benefits the ten* ant as much as the landlord . For // Jan. should the tenant trace back , for a century 's period , his lessor 's title , and find that another than the one actually gaining possessio*i , should have been held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he better his condition . He would but show , that all the title he himself ever had , was false and worthless , and in addition make himself liable to the rightful owners , with whom he had never contracted . As long however as the title remains in the one under whom he has occupied , he has a claim for sympathy , whether he receive it or not . This title being destroyed or shown to be in a third person , even this bond breaks asunder , and he can only hope for what the strict law will give him . That the reservations and conditions of the leases are anti-republican is a charge often made , and perhaps with some plausibility ; but it derives most of its importance , we think , from the very general manner in which it is understood , and the very little careful attention it receives . There seems also to be a great proneness to regard every thing as opposed to the genius of our institutions , which interferes with and is a restraint upon the largest liberty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only unrestrained and excessive liberty , and any restraints are regarded as militating against its enjoyment . That which is unpleasant to them as individuals , or compels them sometimes to yield a natural right , they would fain believe is dangerous to our country and opposed to her institutions . The conditions complained of may be different from what would be adopted , were a new contract to be entered into ; but they have been regarded by the highest courts of New York as valid and binding , a proof that they are not against the policy of our laws . And when we learn , that these conditions are parts of a contract , voluntarily entered into by both parties , and know that no state can invalidate a contract , we only can wonder that any one should ask legislative aid in this particular . We see not how the tenant can have the slightest claim to those things contained in the reservations , because he never contracted for them . To complain of their binding power and ask to be freed from them , is but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and finding fault with that justice which rules him . But there is another view of the question of tyranny and oppression , which grows out of these leases , that will help us to a better understanding of the equity of the matter . Most of the leases of the manor of Rensselaerwick for the first seven years were given rent free , showing kindness from the landlord to the tenant at a time when he most stood in need of it . On the flardenburgh patent , it has become a custom , to grant leases on the same terms for the first five years , and for the next five years to demand but half rent , the tenant thus not paying full rent till the commencement of the eleventh year . Such advantageous terms , the settler on new lands seldom enjoys when he purchases the fee . It is also an admitted fact , that genemIly the landlords have been easy , almost to a fault , in the collection of the sums due to them , waiting years frequently for them , and often relinquishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that on the death of the late patroon , there were thus left uncollected $200,000 ; and we ourselves know of tenants on the Hamdenburgh patent who are in arrears many hundreds of dollars , and who are demanding entire freedom from the rent-paying system . From such facts , which are by no means isolated , we are almost compelled to believe , that the very kindness of the // landlords has been an indirect means of arousing the hatred and hostility of those who have been recipients of it . The demand , that the landlord should prove a title in the premises , or fail in enforcing the conditions of the lease , claims attention rather from its novelty , and the natural consequences of it , should it be granted , than from any principles of justice , demanding its adoption . The leases provide , without an exception , so far as we are aware , that if the rent remains unpaid for a certain number of days beyond the time of payment , the lessor may at any time thereafter prosecute for its recovery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conditions are also inserted , that the tenant shall pay all taxes , shall not commit waste , shall not work mines or possess himself of minerals , and shall not use , except permitted , kills and creeks of water . And there is a general clause , that if the covenants and conditions are not performed , the lessor may re-enter and determine the occupancy of his lessee . These conditions present a great objection to a law like the one demanded , and suggest the important question , whether a tenantwhether any one is morally and legally bound by the terms of his own contract . The tenant , by placing his hand and seal to those conditions , has voluntarily consented to abide by them ; and demanding to be released from them , he virtually asks relief from his own free deeds . But laying aside this question , whether a man is bound by his own agreements , let us take another view of this strange demand . The tenant seeks not only to dispute the title of his landlord , and that he should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also that he should legally establish it , as against the world . And what would be the consequence of such a requirement ? Deprived of availing himself of his right by possession , and of the ratification of his title by the state government , the landlord , if he fails to legally prove every document however ancient , in the chain of his claim , becomes dispossessed of his possessions . The state does not claim them , for she has recognized a title in him , and none other than the tenant contests it . He demands that he shall be perinitted to occupy rent free , unless the landlord can make a perfect title . He fails in some one step . Some link in the chain , perfect two or three generations since , is found faulty , and thereby the tenant virtually becomes the owner . Having entered under a title , which was a protection against all the world except one person , being in possession under that title , he asks to be held the owner , unless that one shall show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this demand of proving title amounts to but this  --  a transfer , by a kind of agrarian legerdemain , of one man 's property to another . But would not a law so framed as to give the tenant the right to demand such proof from the landlord , before the enforcement of the conditions of the lease , be in fact no law , because conflicting with the clause of the Constitution of the United States , relative to impairing the obligation of contracts ? it has been holden by the Supreme Court of the United States , that a state law , making any deviation from the terms of a contract , imposing any conditions not expressed in it , or dispensing with any expressed therein , was unconstitutional ; and this doctrine being correct , as it undoubtedly is , a law such as we have mentioned , acting so palpably in opposition to almost every condition of a contract , would also be held unconstitutional . Neither can such a law be justi // fled on the ground that the leases are detrimental and injurious to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compel a man to part with his property , whether it takes it away from him by force , or places around it such restrictions as make the possession undesirable , is and must be radically wrong , for it violates one of the fundamental principles of society and correct law  --  the preservation of private property . It matters not by how much sophistry it may be supported , nor on what pretexts it may be enacted . Ht*ving such an object , either directly or indirectly in view , the same objection applies , that it does not protect a man in the possession of what he has . Neither can such a law be sustained , because some of the conditions of the leases may seem degrading , and unworthy of freemen . All law , we know , frowns upon immoral contracts , and such as are contrary to public policy ; and universal common law declares them void . But no one would think of extending the application of such a principle to those contracts , which are merely detrimental to public interest , or unpleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would seem forced and unnatural . The request , relative to the abolishment of the right of distress , stands upon much the same principle , and is similar to the demand last considered . Like other conditions it is inserted in the contract , acknowledged by those knowing its nature and tendency . It exists as much from the free will of the lessee as from that of the lessor . It is urged however that it is but a remedy  --  a way to collect the rent , and that we can legislate in regard to remedies , though we may not impair a contract . This we admit , when we can as it were detach the one from the other , and by our laws affect only the former . But we should bear in mind a principle equally well settled , " that there is a great distinction between such laws as affect the remedy merely , and such as affect the contract through the remedy- " The spirit of the constitutional provision is to be our guide , and we can not shield ourselves from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A remedy given by contract , becomes of itself a contract , beyond the reach of law . A remedy given by law may perhaps be changed or modified ; but even then it is a question , whether a contract entered into should not be construed in accordance with the laws existing at the time of its formation , rather than by those since passed and changing entirely the remedy . With how much greater reason may we doubt , whether a remedy , given by contract and not by law , can be influenced or modified . If our views in regard to the constitutionality of such laws are correct , only evil would result from their enactment . The landlord might be compelled to let judgment press against him here , but the Supreme Court of the nation would protect him . In addition to present grievances , the tenants would bring other onerous burdens upon themselves , heavy costs , the result of laws of their own asking . But to go beyor*d the Constitution of our country , and assert that the evil owes its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is useless-is the hight of folly . It is nonsense to assert , at this late day , that the greatest interest any one can have in real property is a life estate for his own life ; that every law recognizing a greater interest is wrong , because untrue to nature ; and that we are not bound to obey or sustain any laws growing out of or recognizing such a right . A sophistical argument might perhaps be raised on such a principle ; but to seek to overthrow those polit // ical axioms , under which the whole civilized world have acted , and prop . erty has been held and occupied , is aiming to upturn the foundations of society . But passing by these complaints , which in our opinion are brought forward as a pretext , let us see what is the real cause of so much excitement . Having observed its rise and progress-having been surrounded by it in its different appearances , and having mingled somewhat with itwe are compelled to believe , that most of the grievances complained of are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by dishonest demagogues , and by inflammatory agrarian papers . rThe quarter sales have been a prolific source of murmuring , and an inexhaustible theme for the assays of itinerant orators ; yet judged and estimated by facts , they dwindle comparatively to nothing . They exist in the leases , we admit ; but for many years , on some of the manors , they have been released for a sum equal to but a small part of the actual quarter value of the premises , or for a trifling addition to the yearly rent , while in others they have not been enforced . In many cases , all reservations and conditions have been offered to be released , on payment of back rent . In the Hardenburg patent , no quarter sales exist , and frequently no reservations . The lease of Mr. Earle , at the selling of whose property for arrear of rent , the under sheriff was murdered , was only conditioned for the payment of thirty two dollars yearly , without any reservations whatever . Such facts present these " hard conditions " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the reservations were intended to make serfs and slaves of freemen ; and so frequently has it been asserted , that many seem to think , honestly we would fain believe , that freedom is not theirs , and never can be , while a leasehold estate contin ues . The degradation of the tenants has been dwelt upon , until they feel sunken in public estimation , and suffer perhaps as keenly under imaginary evils as they would under real . But what are facts in this particular ? Did any one ever imagine , that he who rented a farm or house , enjoyed fewer political rights , or was less a freeman , than if he owned the one or the other ? It may be more gratifying to own the farm we till and the house which shelters us ; but common sense forbids the idea that we are less respected , because circumstances prevent such a pleasure . Else it must be true , that respect and worth are measured , not by the man , but by his property ,  - -  an assumption , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be more degrading . If mere indebtedness is a badge of and in itself constitutes slavery , then how few are freemen . The principle , not the kind of indebtedness produces this state , if produced at all ; and the hirer of money , or the debtor to kindness or personal assistance , becomes alike a serf . The chains which bind men , may be gilded or repulsive ; but they are the fetters of dependence . Such a doctrine is not more false than ridiculous . And these tenants , " slaves and serfs , " as they call themseIve* , have they no ambition for the things of this life ? Are the natural feelings of humanity deadened , because they hire a farm to cultivate ? We grant that in leasehold townships , the lands are not generally as highly cultivated , or the moral tone of society as correct , as where the occupant is the owner of the fee ; but the cause of this we rather ascribe to the fact , that the less energetic gather there , because a nominal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than because there is any thing in the leasehold system which weighs down the energies of man . Far be it from us to make any defense of this system . We would it had never exist . // Jan. ed in our country , or that it had , at the time of the formation of our Constitution , shared the same fate as the rights of primogeniture and entail ; and having been recognized , we would it could now be removed from among us , no more to trouble or favor us with its presence . We profess no sympathy for it , but a dislike to all its shapes and combina. tions . Neither regarding it such an evil as it is asserted to be , nor believing that it originated in a false or strained principle of right , we wish some other kind of tenure could be substituted for it ; and to any just . and honorable and legal means , which may be adopted to bring about such a result , we shall ever and cordially give our support . But we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conciliatory and frank compromise . By a wise provision of the Constitution of our government , the present leases are placed beyond the reach of law . The original parties or their representatives alone can modify them . But we can not see why such an outcry should be raised about degradation , ambition broken , or the tenants made serfs and bondmen . Such charges evidence an unnatural , unhealthy feeling  --  a feeling which prompts us to view every unpleasant and crossing circumstance of our condition , in its worst possible light , and encourages us in fault finding with things beyond our control , leading us to believe the world is united in a confederation to oppress and degrade us . That such a feeling exists among the tenantry , and has shown itself under such phases as to produce alarm and consternation , is evident to all who are conversant with the events of the day . Though this feeling has now become a sort of monomania , it perhaps originated from good motives , a desire to remove in a quiet way the conditions incorporated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in person and through the press , by agrarians and demagogues , who regard revolutions as useful , progressive steps toward what they call perfect equality , another name for unbridled anarchy . That society and government are but contrivances of the rich to oppress the poor-that an equal division of property is just , and that no one should possess more land than in person he can occupydoctrines such as these , popular with those classes whose condition no change can render worse , and attractive to the ignorant , discontented population which always exists , have been advocated , and rooted in the minds of those who are already disturbed ; and lest the flame should die away , appeals , skillfully contrived with cunning sophistry , have been sent forth by world-conventions , and working men s associations , composed of free thinkers and free actors , moved by such men as Owen and Fourier . What may be the end of this deep seated excitement , we of course are unable to determine . So far as it may tend toward the removal of the relation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the means made use of . But unless some bounds are set to the extreme liberty of the press-unless the l ) eopIe can be restrained from lawless acts-unless the law can retain its majesty , and her ministers be sustained-we very much fear that the time will be long delayed which shall witnes* the abolition of this peculiar relation . A desire for the dawning of this day , prevents us from upholding the course adopted by the so called anti-renters . When we know that they have connected with them large numbers of disguis. ed and armed men  --  a fact now rendered indisputable ; when we perceive that they disregard the rights of private citizens , endangering their lives , ? busing , beating , tarring and feathering ; when we hear them threaten the officers of the law ; when we see them gather by hun . // dreds , and in disguise , to resist the execution of legal process , and behold them shoot down one , because a ministerial agent of the law ; and when we see their organs sustaining and excusing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lawful duty , and that those who kill . ed him are murderers ; - we can not but believe that such measures will tend to make the issue to be , between an adherence to law on the one hand , and anarchy on the other , rather than an issue between lease . hold estates and a desire for their extinction . Such acts force us to withdraw the sympathy we should otherwise extend . And we know we speak the feelings of many in asserting , that these radical measures have done very much toward stifling the sympathy which once existed . As long as no leagued , lawdefying bands existed , tacitly at least recognized by general associations , and the tenants stated their wrongs like men who felt that they were suffering , but were determined to remain obedient citizens , so long almost every one gave them ready sympathy . The public ear is ever open to catch . the faintest murmurings of the sufferer , and in a democratic government , where " goodness of intention " peculiarly resides , remedies are eagerly sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deadened , when the petitioner for it , by clamorous , harsh demands , and illegal measures , shows himself unworthy . Accordingly we find many arrayed against the anti-renters , not because they are supporters of the leasehold system , but because they are driven from cooperation by the measures pursued . This excitement however , the cause and history of which we have slightly sketched , has other features , for which we should withhold from it our support and try to withstand it . * Steele when dying spoke to Earle , As startling events in its career , we " If ' you had paid sixty four dollars , you have noticed that private individuals would have saved my life . " The reply was , " I would not pay the money to save have been abused-that officers have forty such lives . " been compelled to surrender their legal processes-have been tarred and feathered-have been imprisoned , and threatened with death ; while another has been murdered at mid-day , breathing his latest breath amid the cruel taunts of those who killed him. * In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been thrown off , her majesty insulted and her power rudely trampled in the dust . Dreadful as are such results , under whatever circumstances developed , they have an importance attached to them beyond the events connected with their production . They tend toward the establish . meat of a most dangerous precedent , and one which most prove , if successful , ruinous to our healthful liberty as a nation . In a country like our own , where we pos. sess the inestimable privilege of being governed by laws of our own making , any wild ebullition of popular feeling and passion is calculated to excite fear , and awaken some slight distrust in our great political principled . But when we see the passions of the multitude raised so high , and become so uncontrolable , as to openly put at defiance the law and her ministers , our fear is changed to dread ; and we tremble , lest the populace once aware that it can place the law in subjection , should be led to make similar attempts to remedy every grievance , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result . Every new attempt is more to be dreaded than the one preceding , inasmuch as each succeeding trial lessens the respect which all are bound to show toward the existing laws , and weakens the feeling of obedience toward them . And upon this respect for laws and a ready obedience to them , rest democratic // institutions . If there is a feeling of love and submission towards the government , firmly fixed in the mind of every one , we need not fear but that democracy will be ensured of perpetuity . But let the idea be encouraged , that the people can disregard chartered rights and mold anew their institutions , and that obedience to law is not liberty , and we may well doubt , whether a fatal blow is not struck at the very root of the tree of liberty . Could we confine , in every case , the consequences of such an act , and prevent its influence from extending , then it might be of minor importance . But when we know that every popular excitement opens the way for future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . The dangerous tendency becomes apparent , because disregard of law in one case becomes a sure precursor of a like disregard in other instances . That those who make their own laws , should so far yield to their passions , in a single instance , as to cease obedience , is cause for alarm ; that the same occurrence should happen frequently , produces consternation A state of affairs like the present , also encourages that spirit of agrarianism , which thrives only where an unhealthy state of society exists . By agrarianism however , we mean , all the forms of ultra radicalism which are springing up among us . By this spirit , every disturbance which shows a distaste to wholesome obedience , and a disrelish for old established principles , is welcomed as an evidence of a new order of things , glorious , though undefined . Every movement , opposed to the present requirements of political and civil society , is hailed as its coworker to hasten the day , when unrestrained liberty shall be in the ascendant . The present age seems prolific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justly suffering for his acts , it sympathizes , while it traduces those sitting in judgment upon him , aiming to render all legal authority unpopular . For proof , we need only refer to the records of the world 's convention , where the brotherhood of that association was claimed for one virtually convicted of treason . And in a working men 's convention , gathered in New England , there has been a like development of this feeling , decrying all who frowned upon the worst features of the antirent excitement . In themselves , such conventions and their acts deserve only contempt ; but when viewed as an evidence of the existence of extreme radicalism , they are clothed with an importance not their own , and we learn the moral , that every thing encouraging the spirit which animates them is to be avoided . In view of these things , what ought we as Americans to do ? These are important questions , and demand a careful consideration : and when deternined upon , claim a corresponding course of action . Though the immediate cause of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we believe , lies deeper , and is confined by no such narrow limits . It is not the leasehold system , but a tendency to throw off legal restraints . Fo guard against these hidden causes , a more careful and critical study of our institutions seems necessary . From infancy and through childhood , we have been taught that our government was preeminently superior . But while thus revering and prizing her great principles , we have seen other nations jealous of them , and watching closely our every action . Perceiving this fault-finding disposition in sister nations we have been ready to regard our country 's faults imaginary , and to reverence her too blindly . Love of country , strong , faithful , earnest and unflinching , we honor in the possessor , but to see // it degenerate into irrational glorying , is no less cause of regret . We rejoice in the prevalence of that pow. er , which binds us to " our native land " and makes us feel , " That with all her faults we love her still . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her faults and imperfections . When contrasting the happiness and prosperity of our people , with that of the citizens of other governments , if we have turned away from the contemplation , still blind to our own failings , we have no ground for confidence . In former periods , her excellencies may have hidden her defects ; but the time has past , in which the world judges of any system , public or private , from its general effect , but it looks into all its parts . An ardent spirit of inquiry and a keen sifting of old systems , characterize our times . Truth and error , right and wrong , are fast gaining their proper level . A democratic spirit pervades the world , and men are feeling their right and privilege to inquire into what is going on around them . To tyrants and despots it is like the distant rumbling of the dreadful earthquake , and for us it is a voice of warning , bidding us search out our nations s errors and inconsistencies , and though hallowed by old associations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prompt removal of the bad . Having studied our country 's institutions , we are to take a firm stand in her defense ; yet we are not to forget her faults but correct and remove them . Neither blinded by false patriotism , nor seduced from our duty by popular clamor , we must defend the right and yield the wrong , and thus elevate our country to a higher and more honorable station . Thus shall we best ensure the perpetuity of our free institutions . And upon the present generation , probably , rest these duties . The world , so to speak , is in a transition state . " Old things are passing away , " and another order of things is advancing . As the disturbed and mingling materials become settled , so they will long remain . How important then the presence of correct principles , that when these materials assume a new shape , it may accord with all that is beautiful in a just and free state . @             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
