Cawein , Madison Julius , 1865-1914 : FRAGMENTS . from Blooms of the berry ( 1887 ) I. STARS . The fields of space gleam bright , as if some ancient giant , old As the moon and her extinguished mountains , Had dipped his fingers huge into the twilight 's sea of gold And sprinkled all the heavens from these fountains . Cawein , Madison Julius , 1865-1914 : TO S. McK. from Blooms of the berry ( 1887 ) I. Shall we forget how , in our day , The Sabine fields about us lay In amaranth and asphodel , And bubbling , cold Bandusian well , Fair Pyrrhas haunting every way ? In dells of forest faun and fay , Moss-lounged within the fountain 's spray , How drained we wines too rare to tell , Shall we forget ? The fine Falernian or the ray Of fiery Ccuban , while gay We heard Bacchantes shout and yell , Filled full of Bacchus , and so fell To dreaming of some Lydia ; Shall we forget ? II . If we forget in after years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hovered all our walks around When ent'ring on that mystic ground Of ghostly legends , where one hears By bandit towers the chase that nears Thro ' cracking woods , the oaths and cheers Of demon huntsman , horn and hound ; If we forget . Lenora 's lover and her tears , Fierce Wallenstein , satanic sneers Of the red devil Goethe bound ,  --  Why then , forsooth , they soon are found In burly stoops of German beers , If we forget ! Cawein , Madison Julius , 1865-1914 : A DIRGE. from Blooms of the berry ( 1887 ) I. Life has fled ; she is dead , Sleeping in the flow'ry vale Where the fleeting shades are shed Ghost-like o'er her features pale . Lay her ' neath the violets wild , Lay her like a dreaming child ' Neath the waving grass Where the shadows pass . II . Gone she has to happy rest With white flowers for her pillow ; Moons look sadly on her breast Thro ' an ever-weeping willow . Fold her hands , frail flakes of snow , Waxen as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world and care . III . Twine this wreath of lilies wan ' Round her sculptured brow so white ; Let her rest here , white as dawn , Like a lily quenched in night . Wreath this rosebud wild and pale , Wreath it ' mid her fingers frail ; On her dreamless breast Let it dreaming rest . IV . Gently , gently lay her down , Gently lay her form to sleep ; Gently let her soul be blown Far away , while low we weep . Hush ! the earth no more can harm her Now that choirs of angels charm her ! Dreams of life are brief ; Naught amendeth grief . V. Speed away ! speed away ! Angels called her here to sleep ; Let us leave her here to stay : Speed away ! and , speeding , weep . Where the roses blow and die , ' Neath them she a rose doth lie Wilted in the grass Where the shadows pass .                    @
