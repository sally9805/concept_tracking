txt An Incomplete verdict was accepted from the star route jury this afternoon , and two of the conspirators . John R. Minor and Montford C. Rerdell , are in jail . William H. Turner was acquitted , aff had been expected , but by this remarkable verdict the remaining defendants , Thomas J. Brady , Stephen W. Dorsey , John W. Dorsey , and Harvey M. Valle , temporarily escaped , although in Vaile 's case only one juror prevented conviction , while only two protected Brady and John W. Dorsey . Three jurors out of twelve voted against the conviction of ox-Senator Dorsey . The jurors whose votes were cast for those defendants wore William Dickson , the foreman , a man whose intelligence can not be questioned ; William Holmead , and William K. Brown , the last a colored man . The other colored juror , Martin , at first voted for several of the defendants , but afterward changed his views . Miner and Rordoll , who have been convicted , were by no moans the most prominent figures in the combination which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of routes , for the Dorseys . Miner was one of the original combination . If Itordell was guilty , what could bo said of his employers , the Dorsoys ? If Miner was guilty , what could be said of his partner , Vailo , or of his associates in the original combination ? If those two defendants outside of the Post Office Department were guilty , what could be said of Brady , the Second Assistant Postmaster-General ? From what over side this remarkable verdict is examined , its inconsistencies are manifest ) But for these inconsistencies the nine jurors who voted for conviction are not responsible ; they must be borne by the three who first refused to find any conspiracy , then convicted two defendants of conspiracy , and at last steadfastly refused to vote for the conviction of those who must have been the leaders ofl the conspiracy , if one existed , and ; without whose aid the two convicted defendants could not have carried out the purpose of the conspiracy . Minor and Rerdell are said to bo without extensive pecuniary resources . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verdict are the talk of the town , and the jury is undergoing examination in the mind of every citizen . The trial will not end in this way . The Government , through its representatives , declares , its determination to pursue and investigate any evidence which may be secured concerning the alleged attempts to bribe jurors . The proceedings following the verdict may exceed in interest those of the trial . When the session of the court was resumed this morning , at 10 o'clock , the crowd in the court-room showed that public interest in the result of the trial had by no moans been diminished . Miner , Rerdell , Turner , John W. Dorsey , and Vane wore in their places . ' Valle , a largo , tall , comfortable-looking person , seemed more cheerful than on Saturday and Sunday . Turner , a y oung Phan , wearing long and heavy side whiskers and sure of acquittal , manifested no anxiety . John W. Dorsey , whom no one wonld recognize as it brother of the ox-Senator , was as calm as ever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ session was regarded , by a legal fiction , as a continuation of that of Friday last , and when the Judge instructed the crier to adjourn the Friday session until this day and then open tho court for Monday that veteran officer made several amusing blunders , which raised a loud laugh in the room . At 10:10 o'clock the jury came in . Several of the members had not been disturbed in mind or body by their confinement , but tho face of the tall and slender foreman bore evidence of anxious thought . He stood before the witness stand and said , in response to the usual question : " 1 will report , Sir , that the jury stand the same as they did when the report was made on Saturday night . We have decided as to four of the defendants , and do not agree as to tile others . Mr. Ingersoll at once arose and requested the court to ask whether there was - tny prospect of an agreement . Judge Wylie replied that jurymen might differ about that . Turning to the jury , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you yet . We will take a recess until 2 o'clock , " Mr. Ingersoll , who seemed to suppose that the Dorseys had been acquitted , or that they were still protected by a disagreement which would be removed by a longer confinement , urged that tile statutes permitted the court to accept nn incomplete verdict , but Judge Wylie was unwilling to give up his hone of a verdict as to all , and he declared that such a verdict was duo to the defendants . Mr. Ingersoll remarked there was very little logic in hunger and not much evidence in inconvenience . " You are assailing the venerable institution of trial by jury , " said the Judge . " No , " replied the full-faced ico-cinst , " I am assailing the barbarisms of 200 years ago . " The Judge then said that he would not enforce barbarisms except so far as to treat this jury as others had been treated . lie did not intend to starve them nor to allow them to have luxuries . Foreman Dickson then addressed the court , saying he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the probability of agreeing . The Judge decided that he would not receive them , but he would enlighten the jury on points of law , if any information of that kind were required . Juryman Matthew McNally suddenly arose and addressed the court : " Your Honor , " he said , " I would like to say that I am firm in my conviction ; that nothing will alter me . " While the audience were wondering on which side this juror had taken this firm stand the court ordered the jury to retire until 2 o'clock . Before that hour was reached the court-room was filled . again , At 2:07 the jury came in . " Have you agreed upon a verdict ? " was the question . Foreman Dickson , standing in front of the Judge 's desk , replied : " The jury stands al last reported . " " I have come to the conclusion , " said Judge Wylie , to the surprise of all , " to accept your verdict . Aro the defendants all here ? " All the spectators who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbed upon the railing of the prisoner 's dock , and others took places in the window . The roll was called ; only Brady and S. W. Dorsey were absent . They soon appeared and took seats besides their counsel . " I am instructed , " said Foreman Dickson , " by the jury upon this indictment to make the following return : . As to John M. Peck and W. It . Turner , not guilty ; as to J. rt . Minor and M. C. Rerdell , guilty ; as to J. Dorsey , as to S. W. Dorsey , as to H. M. Valle , and as to ' 1 ' . J. Brady , the jury are unable to agree . " By order of the court , the name of Peck , who is dead , was omitted , and the verdict was recorded . Minor 's face grow pale with dismay , and ho gazed upon the floor . Rordoll sat nervously biting his mustache . Brady looked stern and thoughtful . The jury was discharged , In behalf of their clients found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notices of motions for arrests of judgments and now trial . Mr. Merrick asked that the bonds of the Dersoys , Brady , and Valle should bo renese.s1 and made larger , but , after genie discussion of the sub : ject , the court decided the bail now in would remain bound , but said that he would consider the motion to increase the amount . la the course of this discussion Mr. Kor declared that the Government was In earnest , and that one mistrial would not prevent the Pursuit of defendants to that and Mr. Ingersoll characterized the motion fo  --  newhondsets : en attempt to annoy his clients , and in. the course of a colloquy which followed , Mr. Merrick declared he did not desire to be respected by Mr. Ingersoll , and the latter retorted in a similar manner . The Judge cried " peace " and the counsel resumed their seats . He then ordered that Rerdell and tdiner should stand committed , announcing that the questions which had been raised could be argued ou Weanesday next , Foreman Dickson then made a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thanked the Jurege for his courteous and kind treatment . The Judge in reply , made some remarks which attracted etteution . He assured the jury that his feelings toward them were friendly . He had hoped they would have been able to reach a conclusive verdict , but he would not impute to any member an improper motive . They had net seen the law as the court had seen it , but they had exercised their power to decide facts conscientiously , no doubt . It was not for the court to express dissatisfaction . He thanked them for their patience and exemplary conduct . Again he remarked he entertained no suspicion against them . It was not such . a verdict as he would have been glad to see , " but it is your verdict , your work ; you are responsible for it and the court is not . " The Judge did not make this little speech with any warmth of feeling . The foreman asked if he could present to the court a sworn statement concerning attempts to bribe jurymen . The Judge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made in another way . " Your own experience , " said he , with a peculiar look , which was better understood afterward , " is probably different from that of other members of the jury . If it is true , as reported to nie by several jurymen , that efforts to bribe have been made , then no more abominable crime can be named , but this is not the place to talk about it . It should be in the hands of the law officers , and it any scoundrel should be convicted of an attempt of thatlkind "  --  ( and a queer smile was seen on the old Judge 's face as he added parenthetically ) ? " i do n't know whether a jury would convict him  --  the court will do its duty. , Mr. Ingersoll was anxious that the story should he told then and there . " The GovernInent will investigate the matter , " said 11r . Merrick . Mr. Wilson arose and Passionately cried , shaking his finger at fir . Merrick : " The Government will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mr. Merrick sprang to his feet and faced his opponent . " Pardon me , Sir , " said he , in ringing tones , l " the Government will , and will put the guilt where it belongs , " the Judge , remarking that as both sides were anxious to expose a crime , a conviction would certainly follow next time , adjourned the court until Wednesday morning . In the meantime Miner was writing a letter to some one , and his counsel leaned over him , awaiting its conclusion . The crowd gathered around the two convicted defendants , and gazed at them until they were led away to the Marshal 's room . At 3:10 the two men were taken to jail in a carriage . For some time a largo crowd lingered around the Court-house . The prominent lawyers for the defense:were very active , and the defendants who had temporarily escaped were riding from one point to another in carriages . The weary jurymen quickly sought their homes , and at last they were followed by the spectators , A statement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trustworthy source . The first formal vote taken on Friday was on the question whether or not William H. Turner was guilty . He was unanimously declared not guilty . The next vote was taken upon the question , " Has the conspiracy as to all of the defendants been fully proved by the evidence ? " Those who voted in the negative were four13rown , ( colored . ) Dickson , ( foreman , ) Holmead , and Martin , ( colored . ) The next vote was upon the question . " Have the overt acts as to all of the defendants named in the indictment been fully proved by the evidence . " The result was as follows as to the several defendants : Brown voted no in each case ; Dickson no as to Brady , Peck , and S. W. Dorsey ; Hohnead no as to the Dorseys , Peck . Valle , and Brady ; Martin no as to all . The question for the next vote was , " Who of the defendants are guilty of conspiracy and of the commission of the overt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1879 ? " The result upon each defendant was as follows : The negative votes were cast by Brown , Dickson , Holmead , and Martin . In this way Rerdell and Miner were eliminated . haying been pronounced guilty . A vote was taken on J. 11 , - . Dorsey , S. W. Dorsey , Vaile , and Brady , the result being as follows : The negative votes were cast by Brown , Dickson , and Holmead . The next ballot , upon the same question , resulted in nearly the same way , Martin adding his vote in behalf of S. W. Dorsey and Valle . On the next ballot he voted guilty , and the result was according to the table given above . On the next ballot there was another change , and the result was as follows : Martin had voted guilty on all and Brown had added nis vote to Holmead 's in favor of J. W. Dorsey and changed his vote In relation to Vaile . In this way the jury stood when their verdict was accepted . The two voting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for S. W. Dorsey were Brown , Dickson , and Holmead ; the one for Valle was Holmead , and the two for Brady were Brown and Dickson . An analysis of the votes taken reveals some remarkable opinions . Four jurors voted that no conspiracy had been proved , and then the same four voted Miner and ; Rerdell into a conspiracy , and found them guilty . On the last ballot the foreman *voted that John W. Dorsey and Vaile were guilty , while Brady and S. W. Dorsey were innocent . On the same ballot it appears that Holmead find all not guilty except Brady . Jurors who had found Rerdell , the clerk , guilty , found his employer innocent . Another who had pronounced Miner guilty found his partner , Vaile , innocent . The verdict having been rendered , the subiect of bribery or attempts to bribe becomes important . It has already become known that the foreman and several jurors reported such attempts to the Judge . . toreman Dickson , a man , very well known in this city , reported to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Government , or a man claiming to be such agent , had tried to buy his vote by a bribe of $5,000 . Counsel for the defense asked two or three days ago that members of the jury should be allowed to communicate to each other the stories of attempts which had been made to corrupt them . The Judge refused to permit this . It is now reported on good authority that Mr. Dickson , after this ruling from the court , swore himself in the jury-room and read a statement about the attempt made by an illeged agent of the Government to corrupt him . It is also said that when he made the lame statement to Judge Wylie the Judge told him that the idea that the Government would lo such a thing was absurd . It is said that another pretended agent of the Department of Justice endeavored to bribe another juror , who voted against conviction . Two persons are spoken of as having played this rOle of agent of the Government . One of them is said to be a resident of New-York , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In relation to the latter , it is said that he Was employed during the early part of the trial by the Government as a detective , but that he was summarily discharged ' nearly two knonths ago because he suggested to officers of the department that bribery should be used . The representatives of the Government are very indignant , and are determined to pare no effort to lay barn the conspiracy , if there was one , to Induce jurymen to believe that the Department of Justice desired to corrupt them . On the other hand , there seems to be an intention on the part of certain persons to create the impression that the AtOrney-General might have sanctioned such attempts for the purpose of preventing defeat in court , because a defeat might make him inecure in the Cabinet . The absurdity of such an dea , which would be patent in any other city of the United States , is not so manifest to many ople here , where nutilio opinion has been persistently poisoned by the organs of the ring . Very strong expressions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the streets this , afternoon and leveeing . The basics or iniustioe of them may become apparent through the investigation which will be made . Mr. Dickson's.statement will be given to the officers of the law , and , inasmuch as the Government knows who the alleged agents of the Department of Justice are , it will not be difficult to prove thereal position of these men .
