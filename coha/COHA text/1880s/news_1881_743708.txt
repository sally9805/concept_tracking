txt Mr. DUTCHER , the State Superintendent of Public Works , reinforces the arguments of State Engineer SEYMOUR in favor of the policy of improving the carrying capacity of the Erie Canal and promoting a reduction of the cost of transportation on that line from Buffalo to this City . The canal system of this State was constructed before the era of railways , and when it had nothing to fear from the competition of any other water route from the interior to the seaboard . For its time it was a grand work , and how much of her commercial supremacy New-York owes to the foresight and energy of DEWITT Curzirozir and his coadjutors can not be calculated . The part which the canals have played in transportation in recent years has continued to be one of great importance . Aside from the bulk of grain which they have brought to this port , amounting last year to more than 70,000,000 bushels , they have been a powerful check upon extravagant charges by the railroads . The State owning the canals and the 5,000 boats floating upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other combination opposed to the public interest is impracticable . The reduction of the State tolls has been followed by a great increase in the volume of traffic , which was 6,402,290 tons last year , against 1,743,320 in 1876 . But works which were ample for any anticipated demand half a century ago may prove wholly inadequate to the requirements of the present or the near future , and both the officials to whom we have referred are impressed with the necessity of doing something to preserve the utility of the Erie Canal as a link in water communication from the lakes to the ocean . The principal source from which danger is apprehended is the improvement now going on in Canada with a view to continuous navigation from the lakes by way of the St. Lawrence River . The Canadian Government is expending some $30,000,000 for the perfecting of the Welland and St. Lawrence Canals , in addition to an outlay of $20,000,000 in former years . These works will be completed in the next three or four years , and then vessels of 1,800 tons can make their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaking bulk . The advantages which this route will present , as they appear on the surface , are somewhat striking . The distance from Chicago to Liverpool via the Welland Canal and Montreal will be nearly 400 miles less than by way of the Erie Canal and New York . Vessels loaded at Chicago can go to Liverpool through Canada without transshipment of freight , while by our route it has to be transferred at Buffalo , and again at this port . And yet Mr. SEYMOUR is of opinion that if the charges on the Erie Canal could be reduced one cent on each bushel of wheat , there would be " very little danger from its northern rival . " How , then , is this object to be secured ? The State Engineer makes several specific recommendations which are substantially reiterated by the Superintendent of Public Works . In the first place , he would have the banks of the Erie Canal raised one foot , which would give an equal addition to the depth of the water . This , he says , would enable each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and as they can not be loaded to their full capacity now on account of the lack of depth , it would occasion no necessity for new boats of increased size . He estimates the cost of this improvement at $1,000,000 . Next , he advocates the application of steam or water power to the working of the locks and getting the boats through . This would , in his opinion , effect a saving of 37 hours in time between Buffalo and this City and enable the boats to make one more trip in a season . Both these improvements would obviously promote a cheapening of rates . But in addition to this , he would abolish all tolls on western-bound traffic . This would enable the boats to bring their freight eastward at a less charge and tend greatly to increase the volume of business . The net result would , in the opinion of the State Engineer , enable our waterway from the lakes to compete successfully with that of Canada , notwithstanding the great length of the canal , the comparative smallness of the craft navigating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the line . There are some minor recommendations , important in themselves , such as that for the use of dredging to clear the prism , of constantly accumulating sediment , and that for throwing the expense of swing and lift bridges over the canal upon the towns which need and use them . There is one difficulty iu the way which can be removed only by a change in the Constitution . The amendment of 1874 restricts the amount to be expended upon the canals of the State in any one year to the re- ceipts of the year ? preceding . As the tolls last year amounted to only $1,164,567 92 , it Ls evident that any surplus over the expense of management which is to be anticipated would be entirely inadequate for such changes and improvements as those recommended . The subject is to be viewed in the broad light of public policy and of general benefit to the interests of the State . The Erie Canal is not to be regarded merely as au investment of the State , valuable only for the direct revenue derived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general interest of transportation and all that depends upon it , and its benefit is by no means to be measured by the tolls collected from its business . Its importance to the public is likely to be greatly enhanced by the completion of the Welland Canal and its connections , and no policy can be called sagacious that does not have this in view . The subject is one which should commend itself to the serious attention of the Legislature .
