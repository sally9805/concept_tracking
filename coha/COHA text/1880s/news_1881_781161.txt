txt Frederick W. Newburgh , the Assistant Secretary of the Board of Public Works , appeared in the Pollee Court this morning , and , through the advice of his attorney , Col. Holmes , pleaded not guilty to the first of the six charges specified . In behalf of Newburgh , his attorney waived examination . The Attorney-General , George K. Nash , was present and requested that the bail be placed at an amount that would cover the suspected cirime , The Mayor decided against exorbitant bail and said that the prisoner could not be required to give bonds to satisfy undeveloped suspicions . The Mayor then placed the ball at $12,000 , $2,000 on each of the six charges . The experts and State officers are going back to 1877 , when the State received the canals back from the lessee . This afternoon the investigators st bled on one order , said to be a forgery , drawn on Aug. 5 , 1879 , and at a late hour other forgeries during 1880 were discovered which swelled the amount of forgeries thus far discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgeries and raised checks thus far brought to the surface is $14,000 . When suspicion was firstaroused by young Newburgh 's free use of money and fast living , the attention of the Board of Public ) Works was called to the matter , but the members were unanimous in expressing the opinion that there was no way in which the accused man could get a dollar from the State Treasury , and , further , that they had the utmost confidence in his innocence . The Auditor of the State was of the same opinion . It now appears that four annual reporss have been made by the board , signed by all the members and sworn to as correct , and during these four years young Newburgh has been drawing from the Treasury on forged certificate , $1,000 at a time . Thera is no means of estimating the aggregate amount of the loss sustained , and the board will be surprised at nothing after the developments of to-day . It appear &; that the members of the Board of Public Works never took the trouble to look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would inquire of Newburgh what amount there was in the Treasury to their credit . Young Newburgh was shrewd enough to keep track of his forgeries , and his books were always found to balance with those of the Auditor and Treasurer of State . Young Newburgh was committed to the County Jail this afternoon .
