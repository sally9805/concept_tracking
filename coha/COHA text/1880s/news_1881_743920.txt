txt Consul Smith , of Cartagena , has sent to the State Department an interesting sketch of the manner in which the natives of the South American States of Colombia extract milk from the rubber trees and prepare it for market . Before entering the woods , the ; rubber-hunters provide themselves with guns , ammunition , flour , salt , and tobacco . The flour is made from plantains. is generally mixed with corn-meal , and will keep sweet for months . When the locality for a camp is decided upon , a roof of palm is speedily made , and , the camp being thus established , every man starts out with gun and machete , each in a different direction , in search of rubber and game . When a rubber tree is found , a space is cleared from the roots by cutting away vines , underbrush , &c.,; and the finder moves on in search of other trees , not returning to camp until night . Custom decides that the rubber tree belongs to the man who has cut around it . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been discovered , the work of gathering the rubber begins . Before tapping the tree a hole is dug in the ground close to it . unless another party is camped near , in which case the hole is dug near the camp of the owner of the tree . The bark of the tree is first cut with a machete as high as a man can reach , the cuts being in the form of the letter V. The milk is caught as it exudes , and is deposited in the holes previously dug in the ground . When the milk ceases to flow from the cuts , the tree is chopped down and its trunk raised from the ground by means of an improvised trestle . After placing large leaves on the ground under the tree to catch the sap , gashes are cut throughout the entire length of it , and the milk that exudes-from the gashes is carefully collected and deposited in the vat . When it first exudes the sap is of the whiteness and consistency of cream , but it turns black upon exposure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milk put into one hole depends on the size of the trees , their distance from each other , and the strength of the man who is to carry the rubber to the river . When the hole is filled with rubber it is coagulated by adding the root of mechvacan , hard soap . &c.; These substances cause the milk to coagulate ' so rapidly as to prevent the escape of the water , which is always present in the fresh sap , and , as the rubber and water will not mix , a piece of rubber coagulated in this way is always filled by small cells , which reduces its commercial value . When coagulated the rubber is strapped on the backs of the hunters by bark thongs , carried by them to the banks of the river , and floated to market in canoes or on rafts . The annual destruction of rubber trees in Colombia is very great , and as the people have not turned their attention to planting trees to supply the wastage , there is some - apprehension that this industry will be seriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulations against the destruction of forest trees , and compels hunters for rubber to tap without destroying the trees by cutting them down . Consul Smith thinks there is a good chance for profitable investment in this direction . He says there are places on the Sinu River where rubber trees will grow from 8 to 10 inches in diameter in three or four years from the seed . The trees require little attention , and begin to give returns sooner than almost any other . The trees that yield the greatest amount of rubber flourish along the banks of the Sinn and Aslato Rivers . The reports of the Bureau of Statistics show that the value of crude India-rubber annually imported into the United States is about S10 , - 000.000 , one-half of which comes direct from Brazil . From the Colombian States we annually receive India-rubber to the value of about 82,000,000 , and , singular to say , England furnishes us with about the same amount , that received from England having been originally shipped to Europe from South America . For the year ending June 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crude india rubber , for which there was paid $1,965,714 . In the same period we purchased from the States of Colombia 3,874,665 pounds , at a cost of $1,909,851 . It will be thus seen that in purchasing direct from Colombia we received 500,000. pounds more rubber than were received from England , and saved $56,000 in making the purchase direct from the country of production . This cash saving in favor of direct importation is nearly equal to 6 per cent . of the total value of rubber imported from England during the period named . to say nothing of the 500,000 pounds of additional rubber .
