THE propensity to kill exists to a greater or less extent in the mind of every human being without exception . In some it consists in a desire to take the life of fish , in others of birds , in others of deer or buffalo , and in still others of larger and more dangerous animals , such as tigers , elephants , and lions . In some , but few as compared with the number of those who delight in taking the lives of the lower animals , the impulse is shown towards other men or women . It is , however , very much a matter of education , the condition of life , or the attendant circumstances . The Prince of Wales kills a hundred pheasants before luncheon  --  the King of Dahomey kills a half a dozen of his wives before breakfast . It is to be supposed that each is actuated by the love of pleasure . If the acts in question of either of these potentates caused him pain it is quite certain that neither the pheasants nor the wives would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibited during the very earliest stages of infancy . In fact it is inborn , instinctive , and no amount of civilization or refinement is sufficient to abolish it altogether . Some individuals may succeed in keeping it down , but even the mildest mannered man that ever lived possesses it ready to dominate him when a sufficient exciting cause arises , and many another struggles against it with tears and prayers to yield to it at last , and then , perhaps , to destroy himself immediately afterward . An apparently motiveless murder is usually regarded as the result of insanity in the perpetrator ; but there is really no such thing as a motiveless murder . If there were no motive there would be no reason why the murder should take place , and , consequently , there would be no murder . The people who possess in an inordinate degree the propensity to kill their fellow-creatures are generally skillful in concealing their motives , and , again , are // actuated by reasons which are altogether inadequate from a normal standpoint . In another class of cases the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an individual contrary to his sense of what is right and proper , and urging him to the perpetration of an act repugnant to his conscience and wishes as developed by the education he has received . Here the inborn propensity to kill or to commit some other act of violence ceases to lie dormant and carries its possessor irresistibly toward the accomplishment of the object to which it is directed . There is no delusion and no necessary emotional disturbance , except such as would naturally result in a well-disposed person from the existence in him of predominant impulse to commit crime , neither does he exhibit any deficiency of intellect . He is perfectly aware of the nature of the act he is prompted to perpetrate , and acts simply because he is impelled thereto by a force which he feels himself powerless to resist . Very often he manifests calmness and deliberation , at other times agitation and excitement . He does not for a moment lose consciousness , as does the epileptic , who may also commit acts of violence under the influence of a paroxysm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed by any momentary but more powerful cause , he recollects distinctly all the circumstances of the occasion . It frequently happens that the subject of a morbid impulse to kill struggles successfully against the force that actuates him even when on the very point of yielding , or when he takes such means as experience has shown him are sufficient to direct him , or the impulse disappears apparently spontaneously or as a consequence of appropriate medical or correctional treatment . Very slight causes are often sufficient to destroy or overcome the morbid impulse . The case is cited of a distinguished chemist and an amiable man who , feeling himself impelled to commit murder and knowing his inability to resist , voluntarily placed himself in a maisom de san1* . Tormented by the impulse to kill , he often prostrated himself before the altar and implored the Almighty to deliver him from the atrocious power that controlled him and the origin of which he could not explain . When he felt that his will was yielding , he went to the superintendent of the asylum and had him tie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of restraint being sufficient to control him . // On the other hand , the case is cited of a man who , rather than yield to an impulse to kill his wifc , which he felt was rapidly becoming irresistible , cut off his right arm . Honest human nature could not go much farther than this . Again , all the efforts of the affected individual are apparently unsuccessful , and the deed to which he is impelled is committed . I say apyarently , because we never can be quite sure that the subject has exercised all his will power , or availed himself of all those means to prevent tho accomplishment of his act which ordinary reason would suggest . When he effectually resists , there are not wanting those who will declare that the case is not one of morbid impulse ; while , when he yields at once or eventually , these same persons will just as strongly affirm that the impulse was irresistible . Several cases have come under my observation in which patients have confessed to me that they have had impulses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to resist . These people have passed through life attending faithfully to their several duties , and entirely unsuspected of contending with themselves in so terrible a manner . I was once consulted by a young man for symptoms indicating the existence of cerebral hyper*mia . He had pain in his head , dizziness , and was unable to sleep . He informed me that he had been for several months constantly troubled by a force , which was inexplicable to him , to kill a friend who was employed in the same office with him . Upon one occasion he had gone so far as to secretly put strychnia into a mug of ale which he had invited the young man to drink ; but just as the intended victim was raising the vessel to his lips , he had , as if by accident , knocked it out of his hand . Every morning he had awakened with the impulse so strong upon him that he felt certain he would carry it out before the day closed , but he had always been able to overcome it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impulse , and very candidly admitted , and I entirely agreed with him , that if he had yielded and committed the murder he ought to have been punished to the full extent of the law . A lady several years ago was brought to me by her husband for advice in regard to her mental condition . She told me her own story as nearly as possible in the following words , which I transcribe from my note-book : // " I had been feeling quite badly for several days , had not slept well , and was suffering from slight but continuous pain in the head and vertigo . Moreover , I had some little confusion of mind , as shown by the fact that I could not collect my thoughts , and called things often by their wrong names . I was not depressed in spirits , though I felt uncomfortable enough . This morning I awoke after a particularly restless night ; I went to the window , drew aside the curtain , and looked down into the street . A slight snow followed by rain had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All at once , with a suddenness and force that were overwhelming , the idea came into my head to throw myself from the window . I opened . it hastily , and was in the act of plunging down headforernost , when my attention was attracted by a boy with a basket of bread on his arm slipping on the pavement , and falling in the street . I burst into a hearty laugh ; my impulse was gone . I closed the window , gave a cry , and fell to the floor in a fainting condition . I recovered consciousness in a moment or two , and found my husband bending ever me . I recollected everything that had happened . The print of my hands was still in the snow on the windowsill , and the boy had really fallen as I had described . Since then , I have been feeling much better , but I am afraid of myself , for I do n't know what impulse may come upon me next . " It will be seen , therefore , that an impulse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself by a single occurrence ; or it may be continuous , lasting with more or less intensity for weeks , months , or even years . It may then disappear without its ever having been fulfilled ; or it may be acted upon and may then either be repeated , or vanish , or it may result in the subject passing into a more generalized type of insanity . The principle of suggestion is often the exciting case of crimes which are thought to be motiveless . The sight of a suitable weapon may prompt to a homicide . Persons have hanged themselves on the suggestion excited by the sight of a rope . A lady seeing a vial labeled " nitric acid " on a table in my consulting room , seized it , and , putting it to her lips , would have swallowed the contents if I had not fortunately perceived her in time and knocked it from her hands . As it was she only succeeded in spoiling an elegant gown . Even a word spoken in jest , under certain circumstances , may // THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received for dissection the body of a man who had commited suicide by cutting his throat , but who had done this in such a manner that his death did not take place until after an interval of great suffering , jokingly remarked to his attendant , " If you have any fancy to cut your throat , do n't do it in such a bungling way as this ; a little more to the left , here , and you will cut the carotid artery . " The individual to whom this dangerous advice was given was a sober , steady man , with a family and a comfortable subsistence . He had never manifested the slightest tendeucy to suicide , and had , apparently , no motive to commit it . And yet , strange to say , the sight of the corpse and the observation made by the physician , suggested to him the idea of self-destruction , and this took such firm hold of him that he carried it into execution , fortunately , however , without profiting by the anatomical instruction he had received-he did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me had ruined several handsome dresses worn by ladies by throwing oil of vitriol upon them . He came to be cured of a propensity which was painful to him , but which he felt powerless to overcome . " A handsome dress , " he said , " acts upon me very much as I suppose a piece of red cloth does upon an infuriated bull : I must attack it . A bull uses his horns , while I use vitriol . I do not know why the idea ever came into my head . But one day I passed a lady in the street who was wearing a very elegant silk gown , and suddenly I felt the impulse to spoil it . I went into the nearest apothecary shop and bought some vitriol . Then brushing by her I managed to empty the contents of the vial on her gown . The act caused me great pleasure . Since then I have ruined a hundred handsome dresses in the same way. ** Marc relates the case of a nurse who felt the impulse to murder the infant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She threw herself on her knees before her mistress and begged to be discharged , declaring that the whiteness of the child 's skin excited in her the idea of murder , and that she could no longer resist the impulse . Several years since I had under my charge a lady who whenever she saw the naked shoulders of a young child felt an impulse , which she declared she could not resist , to bite the skin . She had thus inflicted very disagreeable wounds on the children of // her friends , and was finally arrested on the charge of assault , but the matter was hushed up on her promise to abstain from such conduct in the future . And she kept her word . Closely allied to suggestion , and perhaps a more powerful cause of morbid impulse of the species under notice , is imitation . Thus , many crimes have been committed by persons who have had the impulse excited by reading accounts of the trials of other persons or the detailed recitals of all the particulars of offenses which the age requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suicide , arson , and other crimes are thus produced . " Some years ago , " says Dr. Forbes Winslow , " a man hung himse*lf on the threshold of one of the doors of the Hotel des Invalides . No suicide had occurred in the establishment for two years previously ; but in the succeeding fortnight five invalids hung themselves on the same cross-bar , and the Governor was obliged to shut up the passage . * Epidemics of suicide spread , according to Plutarch , among the women of Miletus , and , as is well known in later day , among the women of Marseilles . A careful study of the cases of suicide recorded in the daily newspapers shows that they are , to a great extent , influenced in character by the principle of imitation . A case of suicide by Paris green is published , and straightway half a dozen others due to this poison are the result , or a man or a woman jumps from a ferry-boat while it is crossing the river , and then this mode becomes the fashion for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some other method . When I was a medical student a young gentleman from Georgia was on one occasion dissecting the same body that I was . He had drawn by lot one of the lower extremities as his part of the subject , and he was assiduous and careful in his work . So far as my observation extended , he did not differ essentially from other medical students . He was cheerful in disposition and gave no evidence whatever of mental derangement or even of excitement or depression of mind . One morning we were told that he had been found dead on the floor of his bedroom . An examination showed that he had divided his femoral artery-in the thigh-and had died of hemorrhage . It was then ascertained that he had the evening before received a letter which had apparently caused him much unhappiness . // Now , suicide by division of the femoral artery is certainly a very unusual mode of self-destruction . T doubt if any case of the kind had previously occurred in New York . Yet , within a week there were two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alleged discoverer of the anaesthetic properties of sulphuric ether . Here we have the principle of suggestion acting on the first victim , and then that of imitation on the others . Imitation is of more force when the intellect is uot fully developed . Even in the normal condition we find it more strongly oxercised in women and children than in adult men . In the latter the influence may be so powerful that the actual disease is acquired . Thus a child imitates the movements of another affected with chorea *r with stammering , and immediately contracts the disorder . Even squinting has been produced in this manner . A lady received such a vivid impression on seeing her maid throw herself down a well that she never passed a well without feeling a strong impulse to throw herself into it . An idiot having killed a pig felt impelled to kill a man and obeyed the impulse on the first one he met . A melancholic person was present at the execution of a criminal and was immediately seized with an impulse , of which he was fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A child , six years old , strangled its younger brother . The father and mother entering the room the moment the act was in process of accomplishment , denmanded the cause . The child threw itself weeping into their arms and answered that it was imitating the devil whom it had seen strangle Punchinello . Another form of mental derangement , and one not readily recognized by the general public , is one which has been aptly called reasoning mania . The subjects of this disorder exhibit no marked change in the understanding , the judgment , imagination , the memory , or any other of the purely intellectual faculties of the mind ; but there is perversion of the emotions , derangement of the will , and blind impulsions to the perpetration of acts of violence , or even a sanguinary fury , without its being possible to recognize the existence of any dominant idea to which the acts in question can be ascribed . In other cases there is ordinarily the most marked coherence of ideas and correctness of judgment . The subject reads , writes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet he is // liable at any time to perpetrate some act or a series of acts of violence . Again , he may be governed by some idea correct enongh in itself , but with which he has no special business to concern himself , and which he endeavors to carry out by unlawful methods and by the perpetration of acts often of such a character as to render him a most dangerous member of society . It is no uncommon event for the reasoning maniac , influenced by his supreme egotism and desire for notoriety , to attempt the part of the reformer . Generally , he selects a practice or custom in which there is really no abuse , or one through which he imagines he has suffered some injury . His energy and the logical manner with which he presents his views , based , as they often are , upon cases and statistics , impose on many worthy people whc eagerly adopt him as a genuine overthrower of a vicious or degrading measure . But sensible persons soon perceive that there is no sincerity in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is advocating ; that his cases or statistics are forged or intentionally misconstrued for the distinct purpose of deceiving ; in short , that the philanthropy or morality which he affects is assumed for the occasion . Even when his hypocrisy and falsehood are exposed , he continues his attempts at imposition , and though the strong arm of the law be laid upon him , he prates with ingratitude of those he has been endeavoring to assist , and of the disinterestedness of his own motives . Although reasoning maniacs are not subject to irresistible impulses to commit motiveless crimes , they are prone to acts of violence from slight exciting causes , and these may be perpetrated either in the heat of passion or after such deliberation as they are able to give to any subject . Generally they are directed against those whom they suppose have injured them or against former friends with whom they have quareled . Again , they may be committed solely for the purpose of gratifying the morbid feelings of pleasure which they experience at the sufferings of others . In the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , homicide , and other crimes in which the motive alleged has been so slight as to be ridiculous . A few months ago a murder of a peculiarly atrocious character was committed in the district known as Whitechapel , London . The victim was a woman of the lowest class of that par* // ticularly low section of the metropolis . iNot content with simply killing the woman , the murderer had mutilated the corpse and had inflicted wounds altogether unnecessary for the accomplishment of his object . Three or four months afterwards another woman of the same class was found dead with over thirty stab wounds in her body , and in quick succession other similar crimes were committed , until now the number amounts to nine . The efforts of the police to discover the perpetrator or perpetrators have up to this time been utterly fruitless , and every supposed clew that has been followed up has proved to be without foundation . All kinds of theories have been indulged in by the police , professional and amateur , and by legal and medical experts , who appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hypotheses in their attempts to account for these murderous crimes . In the foregoing remarks relative to madness and murder I have brought forward examples in illustration of several forms of mental derangement , any one of which may have been the predominating motive which has been the starting point of the crimes in question . Thus they may have been committed by a person who kills merely for the love of killing , and who has selected a particular class from which to choose his victims , for the reason that being of very little importance in the social world , they could be killed with a minimum amount of risk of detection . The fact that unnecessary wounds and mutilation were inflicted gives additional support to this theory . The more hacking and cutting the more delight would be experienced . They may be the result of a morbid impulse which the perpetrator feels himself unable to resist , and which , after he had yielded to its power , is followed by the most acute anguish of mind . It may be said against this view that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments of mental agony and repentance , surrender himself to the authorities ; kut in answer I think it may be properly alleged that fear for his own safety would prevent him doing an act which he might feel to be right , but which he would know would lead to his speedy execution . To test the correctness of this hypothesis it would be necessary to offer him free and unconditional pardon . If he is the subject of a morbid impulse which he can not resist , he will give himself up if immui*ty be promised him . // The murders may have been committed by one who is acting under the principle of suggestion . He may have recently heard or read of similar crimes ( for such murders have been committed before ) and has been impelled thereby to go and do likewise , until after the first two or three murders he has acquired a love for the act of killing , and for the excitement attendant on the risk which he runs . This last incentive is a very powerful one , with certain morbidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some notable series of crimes . Again , they may have been committed by several persons acting under the influence of the power of imitation . This force , owing to the extensive publication of reports of crimes through the newspapers , is much more influential at present than at any other period in the history of the world . The more ferocious the murder the more likelihood that it will be imitated . It is not at all unreasonable to suppose that there may have been as many murderers of these women as there are murders . I am inclined , however , to think that the perpetrator is a reasoning maniac , one who has received or imagines he has received some injury from the class of women upon which his crimes arc committed , or who has assumed the role of the reformer , and who thinks he can annihilate them one by one or strike such terror into those that remain that they will hasten to abandon their vicious mode of life . He is probably a person whose insanity is not suspected even by those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a clergyman , a lawyer , a physician , or even a member of the titled aristocracy ; a cashier in a bank , a shopkeeper , an officer of the army or navy . All apparently motiveless crimes are exceedingly difficult of detection . It is quite conceivable that this man may leave the dinner-table or the ball-room and pass a dozen policemen on his way towards the accomplishment of his purpose . The higher he appeared to be in the social scale the less he would be liable to suspicion , He may be for a man some such person as H6l*ne J6gado was for a woman . This wretch , between the years of 1853 and 1857 , killed twenty-eight persons by poison , besides making several unsuccessful attempts . In none of her murders was any cause alleged or discovered , though undoubtedly the pleasure derived from the perpetration of crime was the chief factor . Her victims were her masters and mistresses , her fellow servants , her // friends , and several nuns , for whom in their lest moments she displayed the utmost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in her defense , but no evidence of insanity was brought forward by her counsel save the apparent want of motive for her crimes . It was shown , however , that she had begun her career when only seventeen years old by attempting to poison her confessor ; that she had , while perpetrating her wholesale murders , affected the greatest piety and was for a time an inmate of a convent ; that she had committed over thirty thefts ; that she had maliciously cut and burned various articles of clothing placed in her charge ; that when asked why she had stolen things thai were of no use to her she had replied : " I always steal when I am angry ; " that she was subject to alternate periods of great mental depression , and excessive and unreasonable gaiety ; that she was affected with pains in the head and vertigo ; that when she was angry she vomited blood ; and that while in prison awaiting trial she was constantly laughing and joking about indifferent subjects . She was found guilty , and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of death should not be pronounced , made answer , " No , your Honor , I am innocent . I am resigned to all that may happen . I would rather die innocent than live guilty . You have judged me , but God will judge you . " Her last words on the scaffold were directed to accusing a woman as her instigator and accomplice , whose name was not even mentioned during the trial , and who , upon inquiry , was found to be an old paralytic whose whole life had been of the most exemplary character . If this woman had stopped after killing twenty-seven persons she would probably never have been detected . If the perpetrator of the so-called Whitechapel murders were to cease now his career of crime , there is no reason to suppose that he would ever be discovered . But it is not at all likely that he will fail to go on in the course which has now become second nature to him . His love for murder has become overpowering , and immunity has rendered him bold . Little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will be caught . When arrested the question of how to dispose of him will arise . In what I have said I have assumed him to be a lunatic of some kind . If a certain degree of maudlin sentimentality should prevail he will be placed in a lunatic asylum and in the // course of a few years may be discharged as cured . But such insanity as his is never cured . Doubtless while au inmate of the asylum his conduct will be of the most exemplary character . He will dissemble for years aud will deceive the very elect among experts in insanity . Superintendents and clergymen and various other high personages will unite in testifying to his thorough change of heart and Christian bearing , and when he is discharged with the blessings of all with whom he has been associated he will begin to commit another series of murders fully as atrocious as those for which he has been sequestrated . There is but one way to deal with a person like this Whitechapel murderer , and that is , to hang him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of society and is entitled to no more consideration than a wild beast which follows his instinct to kill . Laws are not made for the purpose of enforcing the principles of abstract justice ; they are enacted solely for the protection of society . Some fifteen years ago , in a little book entitled " Insanity in its Relations to Crime , " I urged that certain of the insane are properly as much amenable to punishment as though in full possession of all their mental faculties unimpaired . In a paper published in the NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW for November , 1882 , entitled " A Problem for Sociologists , " I said : " A man with murderous tendencies which he is unable to restrain is as much an enemy to society as a ferocious tiger or a mad dog , and ought to be dealt with in quite as summary a manner as we deal with these animals . It is all very well to talk of the inhumanity of such a proceeding , and to urge sequestration in a lunatic asylum as amply meeting the requirements of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may be very difficult for a sane person improperly committed to get out of an asylum , it is the easiest thing in the world for a lunatic who has committed a crime to walk out of its doors with the full consent of the superintendent . Till these things are changed , the law , as recently laid down by Judge Noah Davis , of the Supreme court of this State , and by Judge Cox , of the District of Columbia , and as almost universally held by the English judges , that every one is responsible who knows the nature and consequence of his act , is no more than sufficient for protection , tbe prime object of every law .
