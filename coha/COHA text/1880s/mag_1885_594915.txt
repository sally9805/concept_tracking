A PLEASANT story , that went the round shortly after the close of our Civil War , shows the character of Whittier 's hold upon his countrymen . It was said that one among a group of prominent men , when conversation on politics and finance began to lag , asked the question , Who is the best American poet ? Horace Greeley , who was of the party , replied with the name of Whittier , and his judgment was instantly approved by all present . These active , practical Americans , patriots or demagogues , - some of them , doubtless , of the " heated barbarian " type ,  --  for once found their individual preferences thus expressed and in accord . At that climacteric time the Pleiad of our elder poets was complete and shining ,  --  not a star was lost . But the instinct of these stern , hard-headed men was in favor of the Quaker bard , the celibate and prophetic recluse ; he alone appealed to the poetic side of their natures . We do not hold a press-item to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best " may not have been employed by the questioner on that occasion ; were it not for the likelihood that those to whom he spoke would not have laid much stress upon verbal distinctions , one might guess that he said the most national , or representative , or inborn of our poets . The value of the incident remains ; it was discovered that Whittier most nearly satisfied the various poetic needs of the typical , resolute Americans , men of his own histonc generation , who composed that assemblage . With this may be considered the fact that it is the habit of compilers and brief reviewers , whose work is that of generalization , to speak of him as a " thoroughly American " poet . An English critic , in a notice marked by comprehension of our home-spirit and with the honest effort of a delicate mind to get at the secret of Whittier 's unstudied verse and gain the best that can be gained from it , finds him to be the " most national " of our writers , and the most characteristic through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide sympathy ,  --  language which implies a not unfriendly recognition of traits which have been thought to be American ,  --  loquacity , provincialism , and generosity of heart . In sentiments thus spoken and written there is a good deal of significance . But the words of the foreign verdict can not be taken precisely as they stand . Has there been a time , as yet , when any writer could be thoroughly American ? What is the meaning of the phrase - the most limited meaning which a citizen , true to our notion of this country 's future , will entertain for a moment ? Assuredly not a quality which is collegiate , like Longfellow 's ,  --  or of a section , like Whittier 's , - or of a special and cultured class , which alone can enjoy Whitman 's sturdy attempt to create a new song for the people before the accepted and accepting time . During the period of these men America scarcely has been more homogeneous in popular characteristics than in climate and topography . I have discussed the perplexing topic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these States are blending into a country whose distinctions of race and tendency will steadily lessen ; but whether such a faith is well grounded is still an open question . And whatsoever change is to ensue , in the direction of homogeneity , will be the counterswing of a vibration whose first impulse was away from the uniformity of the early colonies to the broadest divergence consistent with a common language and government . At Whittier 's time this divergence was greater than before-greater , possibly , than it evercan be again . In fact , it is partly as a result of this superlative divergence that he is called our most national poet . If his song was not that of the people at large , * it aided to do away with something which prevented us from being one people ; and it was national in being true to a characteristic portion of America - the intense expression of its specific and governing ideas . The most discriminating prc'cis is that which Mr. Parkman contributed at a gathering in honor of the Quaker bard . The exact eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he is : " The Poet of New England . His genius drew its nourishment from her soil ; his pages are the mirror of her outward nature , and the strong utterance of her inward life . " The gloss of this sentiment belonged to the occasion ; its analysis is specifically correct , and this with full recognition of Whittier 's most famous kinsmen in birth and song . The distinction has been well made , that the national poet is not always the chief poet of a nation . As a poet of New England , Whittier had little competition from the bookish Longfellow , except in the latter 's sincere feeling for the eastern sea and shore , and artistic handling of the courtlier legends of the province . // He certainly found a compeer in Lowell , whose dialect idyls prove that only genius is needed to enable a scholar , turned farmer , to extract the richest products of a soil . And the lyric fervor of Lowell 's odes is our most imaginative expression of that New England sentiment which has extended itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inheritors to the farthest West . Emerson , on his part , has volatilized the essence of New England thought into wreaths of spiritual beauty . Yet Mr. Parkman , than whom no scholar is less given to looseness of expression , terms Whittier the poet of New England , as if by eminence , and I think with exceeding justice . The title is based on apt recognition of evidence that we look to the people at large for the substance of national or sectional traits . The base , not the peak , of the pyramid determines its bearings . There is , to be sure , as much human nature in the mansion as in the cottage , in the study or drawing-room as in the shop and field . But just as we call those genre canvases whereon are painted idyls of the fireside , the roadside , and the farm , pictures of " real life , " so we find the true gauge of popular feeling in songs that are dear to the common people and true to their unsophisticated life and motive . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not and are not America ; not the nation , but a section ,  --  the New Englanders seeming almost a race by themselves . But what a section ! And what a people , when we take into account , superadded to their genuine importance , a self-dependence ranking with that of the Scots or Gascons . As distinct a people , in their way , as Mr. Cable 's creoles , old or new . Go by rail along the Eastern coast and note the nervous , wiry folk that crowd the stations ; - their eager talk ; their curious scrutiny of ordinary persons and incidents , make it easy to believe that the trait chosen by Sprague for the subject of his didactic poem still is a chief motor of New England 's progress , and not unjustly its attribute by tradition . This hive of individuality has sent out swarms , and scattered its ideas like pollen throughout the northern belt of our States . As far as these have taken hold , modified by change and experience , New England stands for the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their native , unadulterated form , they pervade the verse of Whittier . It is notable that the sons of the Puritans should take their songs from a Quaker ; yet how far unlike , except in the doctrine of non-resistance , were the Puritans and Quakers of Endicott 's time ? To me , they seem grounded in the same inflexible ethics , and alike disposed to supervise the ethics of all mankind . Time and culture have tempered the New England virtues ; the Eastern frugality , independence , propagandism , have put on a more attractive aspect ; a sense of beauty has been developed - the mental recognition of it finally granted to a northern race , who still lack the perfect flexibility and grace observable wherever that sense comes by nature and directs the popular conscience . As for the rural inhabitants of New England , less changed by travel and accomplishments , we know what they were and are ,  --  among them none more affectionate , pious , resolute , than Whittier , beyond doubt their representative poet . He belongs , moreover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  to the group , now rapidly disappearing , of which Horace Greeley was a conspicuous member , and to an epoch that gave its workers little time for over-refinement , Persian apparatus , and the cultivation of aesthetics . That group of scarred and hardy speakers , journalists , agitators , felt that he was of them , and found his song revealing the highest purpose of their boisterous , unsentimental careers . These men - like all men who do not retrograde-had an ideal . This he expressed , in measures that moved them , and whose perfection they had no thought or faculty of questioning . Many of them came from obscure and rural homes , and to read his verse was to recall the scent of the clover and apple-bloom , to hear again the creak of the well-pole , the rattle of the bars in the lane ,  --  the sights and freshness of youth passing for a moment , a vision of peace , over their battle-field . They needed , also , their own pibroch and battle-cry , and this his song rang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tenderness from which such men are never wholly free . His ultimate reputation , then , will be inseparable from that of his section and its class . He may not hold it as one of those whose work appeals to all times and races , and whose art is so refined as to be the model of after-poets . But he was the singer of what was not an empty day ,  --  and of a section whose movement became that of a nation , and whose purpose* in the end was grandly consummated . We already see , and the future will see it more clearly , that no party ever did a vaster work than his party ; that he , like Hampden and Milton , is a character not produced in common times ; that no struggle was more momentous than that which preceded our Civil War , no question ever affected the destinies of a great people more vitally than the anti-slavery issue , as urged by its promoters . Neither Greece nor Rome , not even England , the battle-ground of Anglo- // Saxon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in which the poets and other heroes of our Civil Reformation played their parts . II . WHITTIER 'S origin and early life were auspicious for one who was to become a poet of the people . His muse shielded him from the relaxing influence of luxury and superfine culture . These could not reach the primitive homestead in the beautiful Merrimack Valley , five miles out from the market-town of Haverhill , where all things were elementary and of the plainest cast . The training of the Friends made his boyhood still more simple ; otherwise , as I have said , it mattered little whether he derived from Puritan or Quaker sources . Still , it was much , in one respect , to be descended from Quakers and Huguenots used to suffer and be strong for consciences sake . It placed him years in advance of the comfortable Brahmin class , with its blunted sense of right and wrong , and , to use his own words , turned him " so early away from what Roger Williams calls the world 's great trinity , pleasure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poor and oppressed . " The Puritans conformed to the rule of the Old Testament , the Friends to the spirit of the New . One has only to read our colonial annals to know how the Jews got on under the Mosaic law , inasmuch as to the end of the Mather dynasty the pandect of Leviticus , in all its terror , was sternly enforced by church and state . The Puritans had two gods , Deus and Diabolus ; the Quakers recognized the former alone , and chiefly through his incarnation as the Prince of Peace . They exercised , however , the right of interference with other people 's code and practice , after a fashion he more intolerable from a surrender of the right to establish their own by rope and sword . Whittier 's Quaker strain , as Frothingham has shown , yielded him wholly to the " intellectual passion " that Transcendentalism aroused , and still keeps him obedient to the Inward Light . And it made him a poet militant , a crusader whose moral weapons , since he must disown the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scabbards . The fire of his deep-set eyes , whether betokening , like that of his kinsman Webster , the Batchelder blood , or inherited from some old Feuillevert , strangely contrasts with the benign expression of his mouth - that firm serenity , which by transmitted habitude dwells upon the lips of the sons and daughters of peace . There was no affectation in the rusticity of his youth . It was the real thing - . the neat and saving homeliness of the Eastern farm . All the belongings of the household were not the equivalent of a week 's expenses in a modern city home , yet there was no want and nothing out of tone . We see the wooden house and barn , set against the background of rugged acres ,  --  indoors , still the loom and wheel , and still the Quaker mother , dear old toiling one , the incarnation of faith and charity , beloved by a loyal , bright-eyed family group . There was little to read but the Bible , " Pilgrim 's Progress , " and the weekly newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn of the outer world except from the eccentric and often picturesque strollers that in those days peddled , sang , or fiddled from village to village . Yet the boy 's poetic fancy and native sense of rhythm were not inert . He listened eagerly to the provincial traditions and legends , a genuine folklore , recounted by his elders at the fireside ; and he began to put his thoughts in numbers at the earliest possible age . A great stimulus came in the shape of Burns 's poems , a cheap volume of which fell into his possession by one of those happenings that seem ordained for poets . His first printed efforts were an imitation of the dialect and measures of the Scottish bard , and perhaps no copybook could have been more suitable until he formed his own hand - a time not long postponed . He well might have fancied that in his experience there was much in common with that of his master ; that he , too , might live to affirm , though surely in words less grandiloquent , " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw her inspiring mantle over me . " Of our leading poets , be was almost the only one who learned Nature by working with her at all seasons , under the sky and in the wood and field . So much for his boyhood ; his after course was affected greatly by the man then coming into notice as a fanatic and agitator , the lion-hearted champion of freedom , long since glorified with the name he gave to his first pronunciamiento , the Liberator . A piece of verse sent by young Whittier to the Newburyport " Free Press " led Garrison , its editor , to look up his contributor , and to encourage him with praise and counsel . From that time we see the poet working upward in the old-fashioned way . A clever youth need not turn gauger in a land of schools and newspapers . Whittier 's training was supplemented by a year or more at the academy , and by a winter 's practice as a teacher himself ,  - -  fulfilling thus the customary Lekrlakre of our village aspirants . In another year we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Before his twenty-fifth birthday he had experienced the vicissitudes of old- // time journalism , changing from one desk to another , at Haverhill , Boston , and Hartford , still pursuing literature , ere long somewhat known as a poet and sketch-writer , and near the close of this period issuing his first book of Legends , in prose and verse . At Hartford also he edited , with a well-composed preface , the posthumous collection of his friend Brainard 's poems . But the mission of his life now came upon him . He received a call . In 1831 Garrison had begun " The Liberator . " He was Whittier 's ally and guide ; the ardor of the poet required an heroic purpose , and Garrison 's crusade was one to which his whole nature inclined him . It was no personal ambition that made him the psalmist of the new movement . His verses , crude as they were , had gained favor ; he already had a name , and a career was predicted for him . He now doomed himself to years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the honors they would bring him in the end . What he tells us is the truth : " For twenty years my name would have injured the circulation of any of the literary or political journals in the country . " During this term his imaginative writings were to be " simply episodical , " something apart from what he says had been the main purpose of his life . He was bent upon the service which led Samuel May to declare that of all our poets he " has , from first to last , done most for the abolition of slavery . All my anti-slavery brethren , I doubt not , will unite with me to crown him as our laureate . " Bryant , many years later , pointed out that in recent times the road of others to literary success had been made smooth by anti-slavery opinions , adding that in Whittier 's case the reverse of this was true ; that he made himself the champion of the slave " when to say aught against the national curse was to draw upon one 's self @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great majority of men throughout the land . " Unquestionably Whittier 's ambition , during his novitiate , had been to do something as a poet and man of letters . Not that he had learned what few , in fact , at that time realized , that the highest art aims at creative beauty , and that devotion , repose , and calm are essential to the mastery of an ideal . But he was a natural poet , and , if he had not been filled with convictions , might have reached this knowledge as soon as others who possessed the lyrical impulse . The fact that he made his rarest gift subsidiary to his new purpose , in the flush of early reputation when one is most sensitive to popular esteem , has Jed me to dwell a little upon the story of his life , and to observe how life itself may be made no less inspiring than a poem . I would not be misunderstood ; we measure poetry at its worth , not at the worth of its maker . This is the law ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an appeal to the higher law that takes note of exceptions . Some of his verse , as a pattern for verse hereafter , is not what it might have been if he had consecrated himself to poetry as an art ; but it is memorably connected with historic times , and his rudest shafts of song were shot true and far and tipped with flame . This should make it clear to foreigners why we entertain for him a measure of the feeling with which Hungarians speak of PeP5fi , and Russians of Turgueneff . His songs touched the hearts of his people . It was the generation which listened in childhood to the " Voices of Freedom " that fulfilled their prophecies . Garrison started his journal with the watchword of " unconditional emancipation , " and the pledge to be " harsh as truth and uncompromising as justice ; . . . not to retreat a single inch , and to be heard . " Whittier reenforced him with lyre and pen ,  --  though sometimes the two differed in policy ,  --  and soon was writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active in the thick of the conflict . He was the secretary of the first anti-slavery convention , a signer of the Declaration of Sentiments , and , at an age when bardlings are making sonnets to a mistress 's eyebrow , he was facing mobs at Plymouth , Boston , Philadelphia . After seven or eight years of this stormy service , he settled down in quarters at Amesbury , sending out , as ever , his prose and verse to forward the cause . But now his humane and fervent motives were understood even by opponents , and the sweetness of his rural lyrics and idyls had testified for him as a poet . In 1843 the most eclectic of publishing houses welcomed him to its list ; the rise of poetry had set in , and Longfellow , Emerson , Lowell , were gaining a constituency . As he grew in favor , attractive editions of his poems appeared , and his later volumes came from the press as frequently as Longfellow 's ,  --  more than one of them , like " Snow-Bound , " receiving in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Cambridge laureate . After the war , Garrison - at last crowned with honor , and rejoicing in the consummation of his work - was seldom heard . Whittier , in his hermitage , the resort of many pilgrims , has steadily renewed his song . While chanting in behalf of every patriotic or humane effort of his time , he has been the truest singer of our homestead and wayside life , and has rendered all the legends of his region into familiar verse . The habit of youth has clung to him , and he often misses , in his too facile rhyme and // rhythm , the graces , the studied excellence of modern work . But all in all , as we have seen , and more than others , he has read the heart of New England , and expressed the convictions of New England at her height of moral supremacy , - the distinctive enjoyment of which , in view of the growth of the Union , and the spread of her broods throughout its territory , may not recur again . III @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quality of his off-hand work . His verse always was auxiliary to what he deemed the main business of his life , and has varied with the occasions that inspired it . His object was not the artist 's , to make the occasion serve his poem , but directly the reverse . Perhaps his naivet6 and carelessness more truthfully spoke for his constituents than the polish of those bred in seats of culture ; many of his stanzas reflect the homeliness of a provincial region , and are the spontaneous outcome of what poetry there was in it . His feeling gained expression in simple speech and the forms which came readily . Probably it occurred somewhat late to the mind of this pure and duteous enthusiast that there is such a thing as duty to one 's art , and that diffuseness , bad rhymes , and prosaic stanzas are alien to it . Nor is it strange that the artistic moral sense of a Quaker poet , reared on a New England farmstead , at first should be deficient . A careless habit , once formed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renders a new poem by this or that expert a standard , and its appearance an event . His ear and voice were naturally fine , as some of his early work plainly shows . " Cassandra Southwick , " " The New Wife and the Old , " and " The Virginia Slavemother " were of an original flavor and up to the standards of that day . If he had occupied himself wholly with poetic work , he would have grown as steadily as his most successful compeers . But his vocation became that of trumpeter to the impetuous reform brigade . He supplied verse on the instant , often full of vigor , but often little more than the rallying-blast of a passing campaign . We are told by May that " from 1832 to the close of our dreadful war in 1865 , his harp of liberty was never hung up . Not an important occasion escaped him . Every significant incident drew from his heart some pertinent and often very impressive or rousing verses . " It is safe to assume that if he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Tennyson to make even conventional pieces artistic , many occasions would have escaped him . We see again that Art will forego none of its attributes . Sincerity and spontaneity are the well-springs of its clearest flow ; yet , if dependent on these traits alone , it may become cheap and common , and utterly fail of permanence . In the time under notice there was nothing more likely to confuse the imagination than the life of a journalist , especially of a provincial or reform editor . The case of Hood , one of the truest of poets by nature , has shown us something of the dangers that beset a journalist-poet . This Whittier emphatically became , though in every way superior to the band of temperance , abolition , and partisan rhymesters that , like the shadows of his own failings , sprang up in his train . He wrote verses very much as he wrote editorials , and they were forcible only when he was deeply moved by stirring crises and events . Some of his best were tributes to leaders , or rebukes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write weak eulogies of obscurer people ; for every friend or ally had a claim upon his muse . His imperfections were those of his time and class , and he was too engrossed with a mission to overcome them . He never learned compression , and still is troubled more with fatal fluency than our other poets of equal rank ,  --  by an inability to reject poor stanzas and to stop at the right place . Mrs. Browning was a prominent sufferer in this respect . The two poets were so much alike , with their indifference to method and taste , as to suggest the question ( especially in view of the subaltern reform-verse-makers ) whether advocates of causes , and other people of great moral zeal , are not relatively deficient in artistic conscientiousness and what may be called iesthetic rectitude . An occasional looseness in matters of fact may be forgiven one who writes from impulse . We owe " Barbara Frietchie " to the glow excited by a newspaper report ; and the story of " Skipper Ireson 's Ride , " now challenged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost . Whittier became , like a mother 's careless , warm-hearted child , dearer for his very shortcomings . But they sometimes mar his bravest outbursts . Slight changes would have made that eloquent lyric , " Randolph of Roanoke , " a perfect one . Feeling himself a poet , he sang by ear alone , in a somewhat primitive time ; but the finest genius , in music or painting for example , with the aid of a commonplace teacher can get over more ground in a month than he would cover unaided in a year ; since the teacher represents what is already discovered and established . There came a period when Whittier 's verse was composed solely with poetic intent , and after a less careless fashion . // It is chiefly that portion of it , written from i86o onward , that has secured him a more than local reputation . His ruder rhymes of a day bear witness to an experience which none could better illustrate than by citing the words of the poet himself : " Hater of din and riot , He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty , Trod the hard ways of duty . " In prose he soon became skilled . His letters often are models of epistolary style ; the best articles and essays from his pen are written with a true and direct hand , though rather barren of the epigram and original thought which enrichthe prose of Lowell , Holmes , and Emerson . " Margaret Smith 's Journal " is a charming nuova antica ; a trifle thin in plot , but such a quaint reproduction of the early colonial period - its people , manners , and discourse - as scarcely any other author save Hawthorne , at the date of its production , could have given us. iv . His metrical style , except in certain lyrics of marked individuality , is that of our elders who wrote in diffuse measures , and whose readers favored sentiment more than beauty or wit . It is a degree more old-fashioned than styles which are so much older as to become new by revival ; that is to say , its fashion was current within our own recollection and is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with each successive period , such as blank-verse and the irregular ode-measures in which Lowell , Taylor , and Stoddard have been successful . Whittieruses these rarely , and to less advantage than his ballad-verse . He has conformed less than any one but Holmes to the changes of the day . Imagine him with an etching-needle , tracing the deft lines of a triolet or villanelle ! If he could , and would , it would be seen that when one leaves a natural vein , the yield , lacking what is characteristic , is superfluous . Even his recent sonnets , " Requirement , " " Help , " etc. , are little more than fourteen-line homilies . Those who know their author find something of him in them , but such efforts do not reveal him to a new acquaintance . A poet 's voice must have a distinct quality to be heard above the general choir . We turn to his early verse , as still acknowledged , to see in what direction his first independent step was made , and we note an effort to become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story and motive of his own land . For a time it was rather ineffective . The author of " Mogg Megone " and " The Bride of Pennacook " was on the same trail with the New York squadron that sought the red man 's path . It is queer , at this distance , to see the methods of Scott and Coleridge applied to the Indian legendary of Maine . Among works of this sort , however , these were the best preceding " Hiawatha . " Longfellow had the tact to perceive that if the savage is not poetical his folk-lore may be made so . The prelude to Whittier 's " Bridal " is quite modern and natural . It contains a suggestive plea that this experiment in a home field may not seem amiss even to those who are best pleased " while wandering in thought , Pilgrims of Romance o'er the olden world . " And , after all , " Mogg " was a planned and sustained effort , and full of promise . Its writer 's later management of local themes was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are American chiefly in topic ,  --  in manner they are much like what Mackay or Massey might have written ,  --  yet they became popular , and their rhetorical flow adapted them to recitation in the country schools . The poet 's distinctive touch first appears in the legendary ballads which now precede the " Voices of Freedom " in his late editions . " The New Wife and the Old " is almost our best specimen of a style that Mrs. Hemans affected , and which Miss Ingelow , Mrs. Browning , and others have employed more picturesquely . It is a weird legend , musically told , and clearly the lyric of a poet . The early Quaker pieces are as good , and have all the traits of his verse written forty years afterward . His first ballads give the clew to his genius , and now make it apparent that most of his verse may be considered without much regard to dates of production . " Cassandra Southwick , " alone , showed where his strength lay : of all our poets he is the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The manner of that poem doubtless was suggested by Macaulay 's " Battle of Ivry , " and nothing could better serve the purpose . The colonial tone is well maintained . Here is a touching picture of the inspired maid 's temptation to recant , of her endurance , trial , and victory . A group , also , of the populace - cloaked citizens , grave and cold , hardy sea-captains , and others - gathered where " on his horse , with Rawson , his cruel clerk at hand , Sat dark and haughty Endicott , the ruler of the land . " The bigoted priest , a " smiter of the meek , " is a type that was to reappear in our poet 's scornful indictments of the divines who , within pub- // lie remembrance , upheld the slavery system under the sanction of Noah 's curse of Canaan . This ballad is well-proportioned , and thus escapes the defect of " The Exiles , " which is otherwise a good piece of idiomatic verse . On the whole , it is as a balladist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Quakers has always served his muse , from the date of " Cassandra Southwick " to the recent production of " The Old South , " " The King 's Missive , " and " How the Women went from Dover . " Neither Bernard Barton nor Bayard Taylor is so well entitled to the epithet of the Quaker Poet . His Quaker strains , chanted while the sect is slowly blending with the world 's people , seem like its swan-song . It is worth noting that of the nine American poets discussed in these essays , one is still a Friend , and two others , Whitman and Taylor , came of Quaker parentage on both sides . The strong ballad , " Barclay of Ury , " would be almost perfect but for the four moralizing stanzas at the close . It is annoying to see a fine thing lowered , and even in moral effect , by an offense against the ethics of art . Whittier 's successes probably have been scored most often through ballads of our eastward tradition and supernaturalism , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from " Calef in Boston " to " The Witch of Wenham , " he never has long neglected . Some of his miscellaneous ballads are idyllic ; others , in strong relief* were inspired by incidents of the War , during which our non-combatant sounded more than one blast , like that of Roderick , worth a thousand men . His ballads vary as much in excellence as in kind ; among the most noteworthy are " Mary Garvin , " " Parson Avery , " " John Underhill , " and that pure bit of melody and feeling , the lay of " Marguerite . " Yet some of the poems which he classes in this department properly are eclogues , or slow-moving narratives . He handles well a familiar measure ; when aiming at something new , as in " The Ranger , " he usually is less at ease , despite the fact that the nonpareil of his briefer pieces is thoroughly novel in form and refrain , and doubtless chanced to come to him in such wise . " Skipper Jreson 's Ride " certainly is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Imagination , humor , and dramatic force are found in the ballad of the Marblehead skipper 's dole , and its movement is admirable . The culmination is more effective than is usual in a piece by Whittier . We have the widow of the skipper 's victim saying " God has touched him ! why should we ? " - an old dame , whose only son has perished , bidding them " Cut the rogue 's tether and let him run " ; and " So , with soft relentings and rude excuse , Half scorn , half pity , they cut him loose , And gave him a cloak to hide him in , And left him alone with his shame and sin . Poor Floyd Ireson , for his hard heart , Tarred and feathered and carried in a cart By the women of Marblehead ! The change of feeling is indicated by the single word " poor . " This is only a minor piece , but quantity is the plane , and quality the height , of lyrical verse . Were it not for two of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? A balladist should be a good reciter of tales . Our poet 's prose work on " The Supernaturalism of New England " was devoted to the ghost and witch stories of his own neighborhood . In general design his chief story-book in verse , " The Tent on the Beach , " like Longfellow 's " Tales of a Wayside Inn , " - the first series of which it post-dated and did not equal ,  --  follows the oft-borrowed method of Boccaccio and Chaucer . The home tales of this group are the best , among them " The Wreck of Rivermouth " and " Abraham Davenport . " Throw out a ballad or two , and , but for a want of even finish , " The Tent on the Beach " might be taken for a portion of Longfellow 's extended work . As a bucolic poet of his own section , rendering its pastoral life and aspect , Whittier surpasses all rivals . This is established chiefly by work that increased , after he reached middle age , with a consciousness of his lost youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labors , he longed for the renewal of " boyhood 's painless play , Sleep that wakes in laughing day , Health that mocks the doctor 's rules , Knowledge never learned of schools . " His eye fell upon the Barefoot Boy , and memory brought back a time when he too was " rich in flowers and trees , Humming-birds and honey-bees . " To rate the country life at its worth , one must have parted from it long enough to become a little tired of that for which it was exchanged . The best eclogues are those which , however simple , have a feeling added by the cast of thought . Poets hold Nature dear when refined above her . Goldsmith , after years of wandering ; Burns , when too well acquainted with the fickle world . The maker of rural verse , moreover , should be country-bred , or he will fall short . Unless Nature has been his nurse in childhood , he never will read with ease the text of her story-book . The distinction between artifice and sincerity is involved . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Millet gave us the real thing . Long- // fellow 's rural pieces were done by a skilled workman , who could regard his themes objectively and put them to good use . Lowell delights in outdoor life , and his Yankee studies are perfect ; still , we feel that he is , intellectually and socially , miles above the people of the vale . Whittier is of their blood , and always the boy-poet of the Essex farm , however advanced in years and fame . They are won by the sincerity and ingenuousness of his verse , rooted in the soil and native as the fern and wild rose of the wayside . His brotherpoets are more exact : which of them would hit upon " Maud " as a typical farm-girl 's name ? But incongruities are the signsmanual of a rural bard , as one can discover from Burns 's high-sounding letters and manifestoes . Whittier himself despises a sham pastoral . There is good criticism , a clear sense of what was needed , in his paper on Robert Dinsmore , the old Scotch bard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the mere dilettante and the amateur ruralist may as well keep their hands off . The prize is not for them . He who would successfully strive for it must be himself what he sings ,  --  part and parcel of the rural life , . . . one who has added to his book-lore the large experience of an active participation in the rugged toil , the hearty amusements , the trials and pleasures he describes . " I need not dwell upon our poet 's fidelity to the landscape and legends of the Eastern shore and the vales of the Piscataqua and Merrimack . Those who criticise his pastoral spirit as lacking Bryant 's breadth of tone , Emerson 's penetration , and Thoreau 's detail , confess that it is honest and that it comes by nature . His most vivid pictures are of scenes which lie near his heart , and relate to common life - to the love and longing , the simple joys and griefs , of his neighbors at work and rest and worship . Lyrics such as " Telling the Bees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " are miniature classics ; of this kind are those which confirmed his reputation and still make his volumes real household books of song . These rustic verses , as we have seen , came like the sound of falling waters to jaded men and women . Years ago , when " SnowBound " was published , I was surprised at the warmth of its reception . I must have underrated it in every way . It did not interest one not long escaped from bounds , to whom the poetry of action then was all in all . And in truth such poetry , conceived and executed in the spirit of art , is of the higher grade . But I now can see my mistake , a purely subjective one , and do justice . to " Snow-Bound " as a model of its class . Burroughs well avows it to be the " most faithful picture of our northem winter that has yet been put into poetry . " If his discussion had not been restricted to " Nature and the Poets , " he perhaps would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an ideal reproduction of the inner life of an old-fashioned American rustic home ; not a peasant-home ,  --  far above that in refinement and potentialities , - but equally simple , frugal , and devout ; a home of which no other land has furnished the coadequate type . This poem is not rich in couplets to be quoted for their points of phrase and thought . Point , decoration , and other features of modern verse are scarcely characteristic of Whittier . In " Snow-Bound " he chose the best subject within his own experience , and he made the most of it . Taken as a whole , it is his most complete production , and a worthy successor to " The Deserted Village " and " The Cotter 's Saturday Night . " Here is that air which writers of quality so often fail to capture . " Hermann and Dorothea , " " Enoch Arden , " even " Evangeline , " memorable for beauty of another kind , leave the impression that each of their authors said , as Virgil must have said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whittier found his idyl already pictured for him by the camera of his own heart . It is a work that can be praised , when measured by others of the sort , as heartily as we praise the " Biglow Papers " or " Evangeline , " and one that ranks next to them as an American poem . This " Winter Idyl " is honestly named . Under the title , however , is a passage from Cornelius Agrippa on the " Fire of Wood , " followed by Emerson 's matchless heralding of the snow-storm . Devices of this kind add to the effect of such a poem , only , as " The Ancient Mariner . " The texts are needless at the outset of a work whose lovely and unliterary cast is sufficient in itself . From the key struck at the opening to the tender fall at the close , there is a sense of proportion , an adequacy and yet a restraint , not always observed in Whittier . This is a sustained performance that conforms to the maxim ne quid nimis . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which imaginative passages glide into homely , realistic verse : " The wind blew east : we heard the roar Of Ocean on his wintry shore , And felt the strong pulse throbbing there Beat with low rhythm our inland air . " Meanwhile we did our nightly chores ,  - -  Brought in the wood from out of doors , Littered the stalls , and from the mows Raked down the herd's-grass for the cows Heard the horse whinnying for his corn ; And , sharply clashing horn on horn , Impatient down the stanchion rows The cattle shake their walnut bows . " // The gray day darkens to " A night made hoary with the swarm And whirl-dance of the blinding storm ; The white drift piled the window-frame , And through the glass the clothes-line posts Looked in like tall and sheeted ghosts . " The poet 's child-vision makes this fancy natural and not grotesque . The whole transfiguration is recalled : " The old familiar sights of ours Took marvelous shapes ; strange domes and towers Rose up where sty or corn-crib stood , Or garden-wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man sat With loose-flung coat and high cocked hat ; The well-curb had a Chinese roof ; And even the long sweep , high aloof , In its slant splendor , seemed to tell Of Pisa 's leaning miracle . " More imaginative touches follow : " The shrieking of the mindless wind , The moaning tree-boughs swaying blind , And on the glass the unmeaning beat Of ghostly finger-tips of sleet . From the crest Of wooded knolls that ridged the west , The sun , a snow-blown traveler , sank From sight beneath the smothering bank . " The building and lighting of the wood-fire , the hovering family group that " watched the first red blaze appear , 1-Jeard the sharp crackle , caught the gleam On whitewashed wall and sagging beam , " the rude-furnished room thus glorified and transformed , while even " The cat 's dark silhouette on the wall A couchant tiger 's seemed to fall , " - all this is an interior painted by our Merrimack Teniers . His hand grows free in artless delineations of each sharer of the charmed blockade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adventure ; the Quaker mother rehearsing tales from Sewell and Chalkley " of faith fire-winged by martyrdom " ; then a foil to these , the unlettered uncle " rich in lore of fields and brooks , " " A simple , guileless , childlike man , Content to live where life began " ; the maiden aunt ; the elder sister , full of self-sacrifice , a true New England girl ; lastly , the " youngest and dearest , " seated on the braided mat , " Lifting her large , sweet , asking eyes . " The guests are no less vividly portrayed . The schoolmaster , distinct as Goldsmith 's , is of an orginal type . The group is completed , with an instinct for color and contrast , by the introduction of a dramatic figure , the half-tropical , prophetic woman , who was born to startle , " on her desert throne , The crazy Queen of Lebanon With claims fantastic as her own . " The poem returns to its theme , and records the days of farm-house life during the chill embargo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since the great world was heard from last . " But the treading oxen break out the highways , the rustic carnival of sledding and sleighing is at hand , " Wide swung again our ice-locked door , And all the world was ours once more. ** From the subject thus chosen and pursued , an unadventured theme before , our poet has made his masterpiece . Its readers afterward loved to hear his voice , whether at its best or otherwise ; and the more so for his pleased and assured reflection , " And thanks untraced to lips unknown Shall greet me like the odors blown From unseen meadows newly mown . " A claim that he has found , and preserved in fit and winning verse , the poetic aspect of his own section , can be grounded safely on this idyl . We return from the work in which his taste is most effectual to that inspired by his life-long convictions . It is in this that the faults heretofore noted are most common , but here also his natural force is at its height , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - the element of passion . The verse of his period , especially the New England verse , is barren enough of this . For what there was , and is , of love-poetry we must look south of the region where poets are either too fortunate or too self-controlled to die because a woman 's fair . The song of the Quaker bard is almost virginal , in so far as what we term the master-passion is concerned . Its passion comes from the purpose that heated his soul and both strengthened and impeded lyrical expression . Active service in any strife , even the most humane , is unrest , and therefore hostile to the perfection of art . But the conflict often engenders in its cloud the flash of eloquence and song . Three-fourths of Whittier 's anti-slavery lyrics are clearly effusions of the hour ; their force was temporal rather than poetic . There are music and pathos in " The Virginia Slave Mother , " and " The Slave Ship " is lurid and grotesque enough to have furnished Turner with his theme . The poet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very different thing from Longfellow 's , and made // the hearer sure of his " effectual calling . " Even rhetoric becomes the outburst of true passion in such lines as these upon " Elliott " : " Hands off ! thou tithe-fat plunderer ! play No trick of priestcraft here ! Back , puny lordling ! darest thou lay A hand on Elliott 's bier ? " A little of this , however , goes quite far enough in poetry . As a writer of personal tributes , whether paeans or monodies , the reform bard , with his peculiar faculty of characterization , has been happily gifted . Scarcely one of these that might not be retouched to advantage , but they are many and various and striking . John Randolph lives for us in the just balancing , the masterly and sympathetic portraiture , of Whittier 's fine elegy . Chanfling , Elliott , Pius IX. , Foster , Rantoul , Kossuth , Sumner , Garibaldi ,  --  all these historic personages are idealized by this poet , and haloed with their spiritual worth ; his tributes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of view , upon an epoch now gone by . The wreath his aged hands have laid upon the tomb of Garrison is a beautiful and consecrated offering . One of his memorable improvisations was " Ichabod , " the lament for Webster 's defection and fall ,  --  a tragical subject handled with lyric power . In after years , his passion tempered by the flood of time , he breathes a tenderer regret in " The Lost Oc-casion " : " Thou shouldst have lived to feel below Thy feet Disunion 's fierce upthrow ,  - -  The late-sprung mine that underlaid Thy sad concessions vainly made . Ah , cruel fate , that closed to thee , 0 sleeper by the Northern sea , The gates of opportunity ! " But the conception of " Ichabod " is most impressive ; those darkening lines were graven too deeply for obliteration . In thought we still picture the deserted leader , the shadow gathering about his " august head , " while he reads such words as these : " All else is gone ; from those great eyes The soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dies , The man is dead . " Then , pay the reverence of old days To his dead fame ; Walk backward , with averted gaze , And hide the shame ! " Among our briefer poems on topics of dramatic general interest , I recall but one which equals this in effect ,  --  and that , coming from a hand less familiar than Whittier 's , is now almost unknown . I refer to the " Lines on a Great Man Fallen , " written by William W. Lord , after the final defeat of Clay , and in scorn of the popular judgment that to be defeated is to fall . The merit of this eloquent piece has been strangely overlooked by the makers of our literary compilations . It is matter of history that our strictest clerical monitors , during the early struggle for abolition , opposed agitation of the slavery question , and often with a rancor that Holy Willie might envy . Not even this one-sided odium theoZogicum could long debar Whittier from the respect of the church-going classes , for he is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gainsaying to a believer the virtues of one who guides his course by the life and teachings of Jesus Christ . A worshipful spirit , a savor " whose fragrance smells to heaven , " breathes from these pages of the Preacher-Poet 's song . The devotional bent of our ancestors was the inheritance of his generation . Domesticity , patriotism , and religion were , and probably still are , American characteristics often determining an author 's success or failure . A reverent feeling , emancipated from dogma and imbued with grace , underlies the wholesome morality of our national poets . No country has possessed a group , equal in talent , that has presented more willingly whatsoever things are pure , lovely , and of good report . There is scientific value in an influence , during a race 's formative period , so clarifying to the general conscience . We have no proof that the unmorality of a people like the French , with exquisite resources at command , can evolve an art or literature greater than in the end may result from the virile chastity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poets , not emasculate , but vigorous and pure ; he has borne Christian 's shield of faith and sword of the Spirit . His steadfast insistence upon the primitive conception of Christ as the ransomer of the oppressed had an effect , stronger than argument or partisanship , upon the religiously inclined ; and of his lyrics , more than of those by his fellow-poets , it could be averred that the songs of a people go before the laws . Undoubtedly a flavor smacking of the caucus , the jubilee , and other adjuvants of " the cause " is found in some of his polemic strains ; but again they are like the trumpeting of passing squadrons , or the muffled drumbeat for chieftains fallen in the fray . The courage that endures the imputation of cowardice , as in " Barclay of Ury , " the suffering of man for man , the cry of the human , never fail to move him . He celebrates all brave deeds and acts of renunciation . The heroism of martyrs and resistants , of the Huguenot , the Vaudois @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for many a song and ballad . At every pause after some new de // votion , after some supreme offering by one of his comrades , it was the voice of Whittier that sang the paean and the requiem . His cry , " Thou hast fallen in thine armor , Thou martyr of the Lord ! compares with Turgueneff 's thought of the Russian maiden crossing the threshold of dishonor and martyrdom , the crowd crying " Fool ! " without , while from within and above a rapturous voice utters the words , " Thou saint ! " His sympathy flows to prisoners , emancipationists , throughout the world ; and in " The May-Flower " he has a lurking kindness even for the Puritans ,  --  but of the sort that Burns extends to Auld Hornie . This compassion reaches a climax in the lyric of the two angels who are commissioned to ransom hell itself . The injunction to beware of the man of one book applies to the poet whose Bible was interpreted for him by a Quaker mother . Its letter rarely is absent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hymns , than which he composes nothing more spontaneously , are so many acts of faith . The emancipationists certainly fought with the sword in one hand and the Bible in the other , - and Whittier 's hymns were on their lips . The time came when these were no longer of hope , but of thanksgiving . Often his sacred numbers , such as the " Invocation , " have a sonorous effect and positive strength of feeling . It was by the common choice of our poets that he wrote the " Centennial Hymn " ; no one else would venture where the priest of song alone should go . The composition begins imposingly : " Our fathers ' God ! from out whose hand The centuries fall like grains of sand " ; and it is difficult to see how a poem for sacred music , or for such an occasion , could be more adequately wrought . His occasional and personal pieces reveal his transcendental habit of thought . We find him imagining the after-life of the good , the gifted , the maligned . The actuality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in spirit-land ; Not shadows in a shadowy band , Not others , but themselves , are they . " The change is only one from twilight into dawn : " Thou Zivest , Fallen/-not in vain Hath thy fine spirit meekly borne The burthen of Life 's cross of pain . " And in " Snow-Bound " he thus invokes a sister of his youth : " And yet , dear heart , remembering thee , Am I not richer than of old ? Safe in thy immortality , What change can reach the wealth I hold ? " Whittier 's religious mood is far from being superficial and temporary . It is the life of his genius , out of which flow his ideas of earthly and heavenly content . In outward observance he is loyal to the simple ways of his own sect , and still a frequenter of the Meeting , where " from the silence multiplied By these still forms on either side , The world that time and sense have known Falls off and leaves us God alone . " God should be most , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where is neither church nor priest , And never rag of form or creed To clothe the nakedness of need ,  - -  Where farmer-folk in silence meet ,  - -  I turn my bell-unsummoned feet . " He clings in this wise to the formal formlessness of the Quakers , as he would cling , doubtless , to the usages of any church in which he had been bred , provided that its creed rested upon the cardinal doctrines of the Master . Channing seemed to him a hero and saint , with whom he could enter into full communion : " No bars of sect or clime were felt ,  - -  The Babel strife of tongues had ceased ,  - -  And at one common altar knelt The Quaker and the priest . " With thisliberal inclusion of all true worshipers , he is so much the more impatient of clerical bigotry . " Wo unto you , scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites ! " has been often on his lips ,  - -  sometimes the outbreak of downright wrath : " Woe to the priesthood ! woe To those whose hire is with the price of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go , The searching truths of God ! at other times varied with grim and humorous contempt , as in " The Pastoral Letter " and " The Haschish " ; and never more effectively than in the vivid and stinging ballad of the fugitive slave-girl , captured in the house of God , in spite of tearful and defying women 's eyes , and of the stout hands that rise between " the hunter and the flying . " Down comes the parson , bowing low : " Of course I know your right divine To own and work and whip her ; Quick , deacon , throw that Polyglot Before the wench , and trip her ! The basic justification of Whittier 's religious trust appears to be the " inward light " vouchsafed to a nature in which the prophet and the poet are one . This solvent of doubt removes him alike from the sadness of Clough and Arnold and the paganism of certain other poets . In the striking " Questions of Life , " a piece which indicates his highest intellectual // mark and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly confronts his own share of our modern doubts ; questioning earth , air , and heaven ; perplexed with the mystery of our alliance to the upper and lower worlds ; asking what is this " centred self , which feels and is ; A cry between the silences ? " He finds no resource but to turn , from " book and speech of men apart To the still witness of my heart . " His repose must come from the direction in which the Concord transcendentalists also have sought for it , the soul 's temple irradiated by the presence of the inward light . I have seen a fervent expression of this belief , in a voluntary letter of Whittier 's , to a poet who had written an ode concerning intuition as the refuge of the baffled investigator . In fine , the element of faith gives a tone to the whole range of his verse , both religious and secular , and more distinctively than to the work of any other living poet of equal reputation . What he has achieved , then , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needful in modern life and art . Faith , of some kind , in things as they are or will be , has elevated all great works of human creation . The want of it is felt in that insincere treatment which weakens the builder 's , the painter 's , and the poet 's appeal ; since faith leads to rapture and that to exaltation ,  --  the 5assio vera , without which art gains no hold upon the senses and the souls of men . v. THE leaders of our recent poetic movement , with the exception of Longfellow ,  - -  who , like Tennyson and Browning , devoted himself wholly to ideal work ,  --  seem to have figured more distinctively as personages , in both their lives and writings , than their English contemporaries . This remark certainly applies to Poe , Emerson , Whitman , Holmes , and Lowell , and to none more clearly than to the subject of this review . His traits , moreover , have begotten a sentiment of public affection , which , from its constant manifestation , is not to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a beautiful character , critics have not found it needful to measure this native bard with tape and callipers . His service and the spirit of it offset the blemishes which it is their wont to condemn in poets whose exploits are merely technical . A life is on his written page ; these are the chants of a soldier , and anon the hymnal of a saint . Contemporary honor is not the final test , hut it has its proper bearing ,  --  as in the case of Mrs. Browning , whom I have called the most beloved of English poets . Whittier 's audience has been won by unaffected pictures of the scenes to which he was bred , by the purity of his nature , and even more by the cannes/ness audible in his songs , injurious as it sometimes is to their artistic purpose . Like the English sibyl , he has obeyed the heavenly vision , and the verse of poets who still trust their inspiration has its material , as well as spiritual , ebb and flow . It must be owned that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of a high ideal is fully illustrated in Whittier 's reform-verse . Yet even his failings have " leaned to virtue 's side . " Those who gained strength from his music to endure defeat and obloquy cherish him with a devotion beyond measure . For his righteous and tender heart , they would draw him with their own hands , over paths strewed with lilies , to a shrine of peace and remembrance . They comprehend his purpose - that he has " tried to make the world a little better , . . . to awaken a love of freedom , justice , and good will , " and to have his name , like Ben Adhem 's , enrolled as of " one that loved his fellowmen . ' In their opinion a grace is added to his poetry by the avowal , " I set a higher value on my name as appended to the AntiSlavery Declaration of 1833 , than on the titlepage of my book . " Our eldest living poet , then , is canonized already by his people as one who left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their joy and sorrow ; who has been , like a celibate priest , the consoler of the hearts of others and the keeper of his own ; who has best known the work and feeling of the humble household , and whose legend surely might be Pro anis et focis . He has stood for New England , also , in his maintenance of her ancient protest against tyranny . He is the veteran of an epoch that can never recur ; that scarcely can be equaled , however significant future periods may seem from the artist 's point of view . The primitive life , the old struggle for liberty , are idealized in his strains . Much of both his strength and incompleteness is due to his Hebraic nature ; for he is the incarnation of Biblical heroism , of the moral energy that breathed alike , through a cycle of change from dogma to reason , in Hooker , Edwards , Parker , Garrison , and Emerson . In his outbursts against oppression and his cries unto the Lord , we recognize the prophetic fervor , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which popular instinct long ago attributed to him . Not only of Ezekiel , but also of himself , he // chanted in that early time of anointment and consecration : " The burden of a prophet 's power Fell on me in that fearful hour ; From off unutterable woes The curtain of the future rose ; I saw far down the coming time The fiery chastisement of crime ; With noise of mingling hosts , and jar Of falling towers and shouts of war , I saw the nations rise and fall , Like fire-gleams on my tent 's white wall . " Oliver Johnson 's tribute , a complement to Parkman 's , paid honor to " The Prophet Bard of America , poet of freedom , humanity , and religion ; whose words of holy fire aroused the conscience of a guilty nation , and melted the fetters of the slaves . " This eulogy from a comrade is the sentiment of a multitude in whose eyes their bard seems almost transfigured by the very words that might be soonest forgotten if precious for their poetry alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It may be that he has thought too little of the canonswhich it is our aim to discover and illustrate ; yet it was to him above all that the present writer felt moved to dedicate a volume with the inscription " Ad Vatem , " and to invoke for him " the Land that loves thee , she whose child Thou art ,  --  and whose uplifted hands thou long Hast stayed with song arising like a prayer . " For surely no aged servant , his eyes having seen in good time the Lord 's salvation , ever was more endowed with the love and reverence of a chosen people . They see him resting in the country of Beulab , and there solacing himself for a season . From this comfortable land , where the air is sweet and pleasant ( and he is of those who here have " met abundance of what they had sought for in all their pilgrimage " ) , they are not yet willing to have him seek the Golden City of his.visions , but would fain adjure him ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long This brave autumnal presence , ere the hues Slow-fading , ere the quaver of thy voice , The twilight of thine eye , move men to ask Where hides the chariot ,  --  in what sunset vale , Beyond thy chosen river , champ the steeds That wait to bear thee skyward . " Edmund C. Stedman.
