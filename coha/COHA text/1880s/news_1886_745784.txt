txt Among the bills recently enacted by the Massachusetts Legislature is one in which the Bell Telephone Company and the stockholders of many local telephone companies in all parts of the country have taken a deep interest . The act under which the American Bell Company was organized in 1880 , and by which it was authorized to raise the capital stock ( $850,000 ) of its predecessor , the National Bell Telephone Company , to $10,000 , - 000 , provided that the company should not hold more than 30 per cent . of the capital stock of other telephone companies . The authors of this restriction intended that by means of it the rights of small stockholders in local exchanges should be protected ; that the Bell Company should not be able to get possession of these local companies and deprive these stockholders of the profits of their investments . Three years later the Bell Company determined to extend and confirm its monopoly by obtaining control of these companies and watering their stock . Therefore , on May 21 , 1883 , it procured the repeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The repeal in 1883 was followed by proceedings with which all who are interested in local telephone companies are acquainted . Under the manipulation of the Bell Company there was formed the New-England Company , consisting of the National of Maine , the Boston and Northern , the Bay State , the Suburban , the Granite State , and the Boston , with a watered capital of $12,000,000 . The quantity of water injected may be indicated by the capitalization of the Boston local company . The Bell Company had invested in that company for plant , &c.,; $129,550 . In the consolidation this investment was capitalized at $3,894 , - 300 ! Half of this sum was said to represent the plant and the other half the " franchise . " In forming the new consolidation it was the Bell Company 's purpose not only to water the stock , but also to get possession of a majority of the shares . Therefore it exacted from each company a large amount of stock for " franchise , " and when the footing was made it appeared that it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the stock issued ? $10.394,600 -- the Bell Company held $6,215,600 , and was entitled to receive about two-thirds of the remainder . Having exacted so great a sum for " franchises , " the Bell Company continued to collect from the New-England company $14 a year for the use of instruments whose cost was $3 42 . This sketch of the ' formation of the New-England Company may serve to show how the Bell Company proceeded with reference to other local organizations . On May 5 , 1885 , it had in this . way gained possession of $22,016,573 86 in the capital stock ? of 36 companies . It owned $600,000 of the $1,000,000 capital of the Metropolitan Company of this city . It owned $3,326,900 of the capital of the Central Union Company , which operates in Indiana and neighboring States .. It had exacted $15,531,050 for " franchises " after the usual watering of capital , and was collecting the same rents for the use of its instruments that had been collected before the development of this scheme . In some cases local rates had been raised to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the restriction had given the company power to put its hands upon every local telephone exchange in the country , and to give these companies the alternative of going out of business or yielding up a large part of their stock for " franchises . " A telephone exchange can not be operated without the Bell Company 's instruments . When one of these companies was approached by the Bell Company what could it do ? What response could it give to the demand , " Your stock or your life " ? - If it should refuse to water its stock and deliver to the Bell Company the number of shares demanded for the privilege of using the instruments and of paying $14 a year for what had cost only $3 42 , it might be ruined by the withdrawal of that privilege and the establishment of a company that would comply . The bill recently enacted restores the old limit of 30 per cent . The representa - Lives of the Bell Company in . the Massachusetts Senate tried to insert a provision that would have made the bill operative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they were defeated by a vete of 10 to 16 . A proviso was added in the Senate that the . Bell Company should be allowed to take and pay for " its proportionate share of any future increase in the capital stock of a company in. which ft is at present a shareholder of . record . " but it must pay in full and with cash for this additional Stock . The House , which had passed the bill by a large majority , concurred in the Senate 's amendments without debate , and the Boston papers say that the bill was approved by the Governor on June 24 . It took effect upon its passage . Although the Bell Company has already taken many local companies by the throat and exacted its tribute in shares , there are many others which have escaped . The advocates of the bill presented a list of eighteen companies outside of NewEngland which bad not given stock for " franchises ; " one of seven companies in New-England that were still independent ; and a list of five  --  including the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Counties , N. Y. , and the Northern New-York Telephone Company that had given the Bell Company no stock . It is asserted that many stockholders in local companies have lost heavily by reason of the exactions to which their companies have been forced to submit . But it was not for the protection of stockholders alone that such a bill ought to have been passed . It was demanded for the protection of the people , who have been plundered by the Bell Company 's methods and especially as a result of this stock watering and these exactions.
