txt AN UNEVEN PROSPERITY . It will be remembered . that when Mr. Brat first landed upon our shores , fresh from his study of pauper labor from the top of ANDREW CARNEGIE 'S coach , he boldly declared that the menace of the Mills bill had turned the prosperity of a year ago into disaster and . gloom . Reports on our industrial condition and prospects have been giving him " the lie direct " ever since . On Friday at Pnt-in Bay , Ohio , Gen. HARRISON ' , who is occasionally referred to as a candidate for the Presidency , said : " We are prosperous , " and expressed his admiration of our industrial achievements since the war . He did not venture to say , as Mr. BLAINE never hesitates to do , that our prosperity is due to the burden of excessive taxation , but he did try to convey the impression in an indirect and roundabout - way that national taxation is not a burden at alL " There are some who suggest , " he said by way of evading responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able adequately to arouse the popular indignation against excessive taxation because they can not disclose to the people when or how they are paying the taxes . It is taken , they say , so indirectly and . so subtly that these , our plain people , do n't know that they are paving them at all . " It is hard to see the purpose of repeating this suggestion , unless it was intended to imply that the burden of this " excessive taxation " rests so lightly that it is not felt . Apparently Gen. HARRISON approves of taking taxes " so indirectly and so subtly " that the people who pay them shall not know it . but he does not go so far as to claim that they do not really pay them at all , as Major MCKusTLEY practically does . But we imagine that " our plain people " are finding out that they have - to pay the " excessive " taxes and that they are beginning to realize that the burden is one that they feel , and . feel severely . This prosperity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of prosperity . Statistics intended to show how we have been growing in wealth may be used . in a delusive way . and inferences. drawn from them as to the general wellbeing of the people may be very misleading . The figures which show great increase in capital employed and in the value of productions do not show how the results are distributed . The figures are just as imposing if of these many millions of annual production the larger share goes to combinations of capitalists and . the progressive accumulation is in few hands instead of being diffused among the many . Are the farmers of this country , for instance , groaning as many of them are under the weight of mortgages on their land and complaining of local and . State taxes , enjoying their fair share of the national prosperity T The price of their surplus products is inevitably fixed by competition in foreign lands , and they get no benefit from the protective scheme ; but they pay their full share of the excessive taxation " so indirectly and so subtly " taken , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come from or not . The taxes are added to the cost of lumber for their buildings , to the cost of the implements which they use , of the clothing of themselves and their families , and of many articles of household use . It is this addition to the cost of what they have to buy that makes it so hard . to meet expenses from the returns of their labor . Do the workingmen in other than protected interests gat their share of the increasing wealth of the country 7 They , too , have these additions made to the cost of living by excessive taxation on the articles which they buy , and . their wages are not increased . one iota by protection . We know that it is claimed that they depend largely for work and . for pay on the prosperity of other industries in which they are not directly employed . So they do , but these industries would stilt flourish and increase if there were not taxes which enabled those who control them to draw to themselves such an excessive share of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products maintained by the protective taxes . Do the workmen in the protected industries get their share of prosperity , when , for instance , a tax on steel rails enables the owners of a single concern to make $3,000,000 in profits in one year without increasing wages , while the next . year they find business dull on account of overproduction , and reduce wages 10 per cent , or look out their workmen and go to Europe to spend their money in pleasure trips I That $3,000.000 figures in the production of wealth , but who gets it ? How happens it that while this prosperity has been going on ? under protection there has been such an alternation in many industries of activity , yielding great profits , but not high wages , and depression under which workmen suffer and capitalists enjoy life on their accumulations ? Row is it that this period of prosperity has been marked- by so many- strikes and lock-outs and so much social discontent ; such importations of foreign labor , followed by outbreaks of violence when its expectations were disappointed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of capital , and the production of so many millionaires q Yes , " we are prosperous , " but is there not something delusive in a prosperity so uneven , in which wealth is more and . more concentrated in few hands . This is the direct result of a system of taxation by which those who control and direct special interests have the help of the Government to draw to themselves from the natural channels of production an undue share of the fruits of the labor of others .
