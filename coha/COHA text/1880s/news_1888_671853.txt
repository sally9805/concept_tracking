txt PENDING LIQUOR BILLS . Nearly a score of bills relating in one way or another to the liquor traffic have been introduced in the two houses at Albany during the present session . Most of them were foredoomed to failure . Those intended to secure , either generally or in the larger cities of the State , ' thePrivilege of lawfully selling intoxicating beverages on Sunday have been practically killed in the Assembly . Three were defeated on adverse reports yesterday , and the two or three others that remain probably have no chance of consideration . The virtuous Mr. RUSTED protested against such legislation as repugnant to the moral sense of the community , and.made an appeal for the preservation of the " American Sunday . " And yet it is true . that , in the large cities at least , liquor is now sold . on Sunday and will doubtless continue to be sold in spite of the law and under conditions much more objectionable than those provided for in the proposed measures . There will have to be a good deal of change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevented . The Stadler Excise bill which was framed to suit the brewers . and the Hornidge bill to make detection of violations of the law more difficult were also defeated . Senator VEDDEWS bill for the taxation of liquor sales has been ordered to a third reading in the Senate by a party vote . One of the most serious objections to this bill as it was introduced has been removed by amendment . As it stands it provides for . a uniform tax of $100 a year on-all places selling " liquors of any kind to be drunk on the premises " and $20 on those selling malt liquors and wines only , the grading of the tax according to population having been abandoned . The objection : remains that the proceeds of the tax are to be turned , over to the State Treasury instead of belonging to the communities in which they are collected . This is intended only as a revenue measure , imposing a tax for the benefit of the State in addition to whatever fees may be required . for licenses , and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Federal tax on liquors in any State which collects an equivalent amount under its own lairs . Among the other bills pending are three or four which provide for local option by counties , and one of these was favorably reported in the , Assembly yesterday . This Provides for prohibition of the Manufacture or ' sale of intoxicating liquors within any county a majority of whose- electors shall . vote therefor at a special election held to determine the question on a petition-signed. by not less than one-fifth of the qualified Voters . It is our opinion that whatever objection there may be to prohibition as a matter of principle in a State holds with equal force against prohibition in a county , and that , so far as individual rights are involved , they should . not be subject to the will of the majority of ' voters . The advantage of local option is that prohibition may be enforced . in a county when it can not be enforced throughout a State . We believe that the suppression , of drinking saloons comes - within the legitimate exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be successfully accomplished , but that is a very different matter from the suppression of the manufacture and sale of all intoxicating liquors . If local option were adopted , it would emphasize the principal objection to the Vedder tax bill , as counties in which licenses were granted would - pay an increased share of State taxes to the relief of those in which no licenses were granted , and which , if the claims of prohibitionists are sound , would be free from the costly evils entailed by the liquor traffic . There is also a bill recently introduced by Senator VEDDER providing for local option in incorporated villages . Another measure has been reported favorably in the Assembly which is worthy of notice as proposing an absolute restriction upon the number of excise licenses to be granted . It provides that after the expiration of the present year excise licenses shall not be granted . in excess of one for each three hundred of the population as ascertained . by the latest census . This is a very moderate restriction , and we remember that one of the . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ License bill , expressed a willingness to see the number of saloons limited . by law to one for every five hundred of the population . . It is doubtful if he favored. that limit in good faith , but it is certain that one saloon for every three hundred of population , or say sixty adult males , is sufficient for any . legitimate demand . In connection with a high-license system such a limitation would be a good . thing . But rising in importance above all measures bearing incidentally upon the regulation of the liquor traffic is the need of establishing the system . of high license . This should be secured first , and the mischief of such a m'iltiplieity of propositions as have been brought before the Legislature lies in the opportunity they afford for distracting the attention to side ' issues and dividing the support which ought to be concentrated upon the High License bill . There are several excise bills to which we have not specifically referred , but they are not likely to assume ranch importance , except possibly the joiut resolution for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indorsed " by a caucus of Republican Assemblymen.
