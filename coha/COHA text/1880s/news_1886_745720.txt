txt The Legislature should appropriate for the use of the Dairy Commissioner a sum large enough to enable him to do his whole duty . He is fighting for consumers of butter and for the farmers against the manufacturers of sham butter and the , dealers who sell sham butter as a product of the dairy . In this war against fraud , consumers and the , farmers who sell butter are on the same side , and both are opposed by a handful of manufacturers and dishonest dealers . But the sham butter business is very profitable , and while consumers do very little for their own protection the manufacturers and dealers . are at all times active ih advancing their interests and can afford to spend large sums of money in defense of an " industry " that lives only by means of fraud . The farmers can do something for them- selves and for Consumers tbrOugb. their representatives in the Legislature , and they should see to it that the Dairy Commissioner is properly supported and is not deprived of the sinews of war . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Assembly committee gave him $50,000 , and in the Assembly this sum was raised to $75,000 . The Senate committee has reduced the appropriation to $50,000 . It is said that the farmers in the Assembly will not accept this reduction . We hope they will not . But why should the proper support of the Commissioner depend upon the farmers ? Are not all members of the Legislature representatives of the consumers of New-York State ? Will any of them admit that they represent the factories where sham butter is made and the rascals who rob and deceive the people by selling the stuff as real butter ? All who represent the people in their districts should unite in making the Commissioner 's work as thorough , far-reaching , and effective as possible . So far as we know the Commissioner 's work has been well done . It is for this reason that the advocates of fraud and the makers of axle grease are trying to break him down , and are hoping that the Legislature will withhold the money that he ought to have . Every dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well spent , and the expenditure of ten times the sum for which the Commissioner asks would be a good investment if by means of it the stuff could be excluded from the State .
