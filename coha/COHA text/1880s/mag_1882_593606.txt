A NEW PROFESSION FOR WOMEN . THE stranger in New York who may chance to visit the east side of the city in the neighborhood of Twenty-sixth street will have his attention called to a long , grayish , fourstory prison-like structure , with a wing , situated in a block which extends to the East River , and inclosed by a high , forbidding stone wall . This is Bellevue Hospital , the chief free public institution of the kind in New York . For many years it has been famous for the high medical and surgical skill of which it is the theater , its faculty embracing many leading members of the profession in the city . For many years to come it is likely to be popularly associated with another high development of the curative arts ,  --  the results of the founding , in 1873 , of the Bellevue Training-school for Nurses , and of a new profession for women in America . Not long ago , a lady living in the suburbs of one of our eastern cities , whose daughter was ill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a professional nurse . She was loth to do this , but , as the malady increased in virulence , she finally yielded . The following morning the servant announced " the nurse. ** To the mother 's imagination - overwrought as it was by lack of rest and by unremitting watching  --  the words called up the most disagreeable anticipations of a careless and disorderly person , and perhaps even a dark reminiscence of Sairey Gamp scolding trembling invalids , removing their pillows , o* drinking copiously from black bottles , while grim-visaged Betsey Prig looked on with unconcern . With these pictures of the professional nurse before her , she descended to the hall . There , to her surprise , she found a young woman of intelligent face , neat apparel , and quiet demeanor . " You are " The nurse , madam . " Saying which , the stranger exhibited a badge inscribed with the words " Bellevue Hospital Training-school for Nurses , " and decorated with a stork , the emblem of watchfulness . The physician now appearing , the nurse listened attentively to his instructi6ns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with confidence both mother and patient . Her skillful hand prepared the food , her watchful eye anticipated every want . She was calm , patient , and sympathizing ; but , though eager to please and cheer the invalid , she did not stoop to simulate an affection she did not feel , nor to express hopes of recovery that could not be realized . The exaction , the impatience incident to illness , seemed but to incite her to renewed effort in behalf of her charge . She met every emergency with knowledge and unruffled spirit . To the physician she proved an invaluable assistant , executing his orders intelligently , and recording accurately the various symptoms as they were developed . She watched the temperature of the room as closely as she did that of the patient , and , while always polite and obliging , was never obsequious . The mother had doubtless heard indirectly of the school of which her efficient nurse was a graduate , but she was , as many others are , unfamiliar with its work and aims . To understand the almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has been made in the system of nursing the sick , let us look for a moment at the previous condition of this great hospital . The present building was constructed about G. E. A/on fgomrne*y. // sixty years ago , by the poor-house authorities ; for thirty years it was an almshouse , and since then it has been used exclusively for hospital purposes . So unenlightened was the general view of the obligations of a city toward its sick and injured in those days , that for years the only nursing was done by convicts of the Female Penitentiary . The profanity , drunkenness , theft , and profligacy of these attendants were soon too scandalous to be ignored , and in 1848 this system was abolished , and " hired nurses , selected from among poor women of reputable character and decent habits , " were employed in all the wards. * The advance from no nursing to poor nursing told sensibly on the death-rate , which , however , owing to poor hospital supplies , bad ventilation and beds , defects of heating and cleanliness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still continued large ; the best medical skill was useless against incompetence and neglect . So matters continued until the year 1872 , when the attention of the Local Visiting Committee of the New York State Charities Aid Association t was called to Bellevue . This committee was composed of sixty members , chiefly ladies of high social position and intelligence , two visitors being assigned to each ward . Their duties were to visit the hospital weekly , and to report its actual condition to the Association . They found in the building nine hundred patients , most of them in want , many in positive distress . The men 's wards were so crowded that three patients would have to sleep on two beds and five on three . Others were forced to sleep on the floor without blankets or pillows , as there was no supply of extra clothing , except what could be obtained from the stock belonging to deceased patients . A few of the " hired nurses " were still there , and they seemed to have learned nothing by experience , save indifference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only three night watchmen for six hundred patients . They sometimes drugged the patients with morphine to keep them quiet , and drank the stimulants that had been prescribed . In the kitchen it was ascertained that tea and soup were frequently made in the same boiler ; the coffee was nauseous , and the beef dry and hard . " Special diet " existed only in name , and , even if ordered and provided , it had little chance of reaching the patients or even the nurses , being confiscated on the way up from the kitchen by the work-house women , who had been committed for drunkenness or dis *Address of Dr. Reese . t See " A Great Charity Reform , " in THE CENTURY MAGAZINE for July , 1882. orderly conduct , and had been transferred to Bellevue as " helpers . " Judging from these inspections , the committee became convinced that no improvement could be hoped for in the management of the hospital until a complete reform of the nursing should be effected ; and , inspired by the example and success of similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the modern system of nursing , they set themselves to this task with resolution , tact , and intelligence . At first they met with little encouragement from the medical profession , but now their stanchest supporters are found within it . One distinguished physician said , " I do not believe in the success of a training-school for nurses at Bellevue . The patients are of a class so difficult to deal with , and the service is so laborious , that the conscientious , intelligent women you are looking for will lose heart and hope long before the two years of training are over . " * A clergyman well acquainted with the hospital echoed this opinion , and thought it was " not a proper place for ladies to visit . " One or two physicians thought the lives of such people not worth saving . Other grades of opposition or indifference presented themselves-political , social and professional . The experiment was a new one , and the theory on which it was undertaken ran counter to the traditions of those employed in the hospital . Before such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the courageous and intelligent managers were only thereby the more firmly convinced of the necessity of patient and persistent effort . The first step was to learn how to organize the school in the best way , and for this end Dr. W. Gill Wylie , of New York , volunteered to go to Europe at his own expense , to study the foreign systems . Upon his return he brought a cordial letter from Miss Nightingale , in which she set forth the principles upon which the management of the school has been based . Chief of these is the entire subordination of the nursing corps to the medical staW the nurses being under the discipline of a superintendent , or matron , whose duty it is to see that the work is performed to the satisfaction of the physicians . To her report the head-nurses , who have a surveillance of both the day and night nurses . The position assigned to the matron , by which she is made solely responsible for the effi * Exceptions to the general attitude were found in the cordial cooperation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Dr. Stephen Smith , who were fast friends of the enterprise from the start , and have been of the greatest aid as advisers to the Board of Management . // ciency of the nursing corps , is one of the most important features . The tact and judgment displayed by the training-school managers in the practical application of these sensible ideas of the function of nursing , have saved a vast amount of friction , and won for the school the friendship of many physicians who were naturally prejudiced against it , and might easily have been forced into opposition by any encroachment upon their rights . The boundaries of the nurses ' duties having been laid down with circumspection , voluntary subscriptions were called for and made to the amount of $23,000 , and a house was rented near the hospital , in which the nurses should lodge and board . To find a person capable of taking charge of such an institution proved a difficult task . Miss Bowden , otherwise known as " Sister Helen , of All Saints , " then of Baltimore , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was finally selected . Equal difficulty was experienced in procuring assistants for her . Advertisements were inserted in the journals , and physicians were applied to ; but such was the scarcity of educated nurses in this country at that time , that , after a search of many months , and after the most liberal offers , only four were found who were in any wise capable , one of whom proved inefficient . Later on , Sister Helen , compelled to return to England , was succeeded by Miss Perkins , of Norwich , Conn. , under whose management the school has continued to increase in numbers and usefulness . At first but six pupils were obtained . The scheme adopted-that developed by Miss Nightingale-demanded in the applicant a combination of requisites the mere enumeration of which appalled many who had been encouraged to seek admission to the school . These are : Good education , strong constitution , freedom from physical defects , including those of sight and hearing , and unexceptionable references . The course of training consists in dressing wounds , applying fomentations , bathing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managing positions . Then follow the preparation and application of bandages , making rollers and linings of splints . The nurse must also learn how to prepare , cook , and serve delicacies for the invalid . Instruction is given in the best practical methods of supplying fresh air , and of warming and ventilating the sick-room . In order to renlain through the two years ' course and obtain a diploma , still more is required , viz. : Exemplary deportment , patience , industry , and obedience . The first year 's experience was far from satisfactory . Among seventy-three applicants , hailing from the various States , only twenty-nine were found that gave promise of ability to fulfill the conditions . Of these , ten were dismissed for vanous causes before the expiration of the first nine months . To serve medicine to the patients in the wards of a great public hospital smacks not a little of novelty and of romance , and goes far , at first , to compensate for a hospital 's unpleasant surroundings and its odor of disinfectants ; but a short period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every year , young women whose abilities warranted their admittance at the commencement of the course have been permitted to depart before its completion , owing to an evident distaste on their part for the duties imposed upon them . But the managers , though surprised at the result of their first efforts , were not discouraged . As time went by , the number of applicants increased , and , though the high standard first established was not departed from , the proportion of those capable of fulfilling the requirements multiplied . Some applicants , who did not seem especially adapted to the work , proved most efficient , and on this topic the managers say that , after their long experience , they have found that the fitness of an applicant can be determined only by absolute trial . The nurses at the Bellevue school may be divided into two classes : those who study the art of nursing with a view to gaining a livelihood or supporting their families , and those who look forward to a life of usefulness among the poor sick . All are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' course , and are paid a small sum monthly , while in the school , to defray their actual necessary expenses , and , in order to avoid all distinction between rich and poor , every nurse is expected to receive this pay . The " Nurses ' Home , " the head-quarters of the school , is No.426 East Twenty-sixth street , a large and handsome building , erected for the purpose and given to the school by Mrs. W. H. Osborn . From the outside of this building the tastefully arranged curtains and polished panes of its several chambers present a striking contrast to the somber , frowning walls of the great charity hospital opposite . Besides studying from text-books , and attending a systematic course of lectures , the pupils are occupied by the care of the patients in the hospital , and in the general management of the wards . The nurses are taught how to make accurate observations and reports of symptoms for the physicians ' use , such as state of pulse , temperature , appetite , intelligence , delirium or stupor , breathing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , medicine , or stimulant . This instruction is given by the visiting and resident physicians and surgeons of Bellevue , at the bedside // of the patients , and by the superintendent and head-nurse . At first , only the female wards were supplied ; but , as illness makes no distinction of sex , it was found impossible to complete the nurse 's education without practice among sick men , and early in the career of the institution some of the male wards were included , until now 14 wards of from *6 to 20 beds each are under the supervision of the new system . There is no reason , except the want of money , why this system should not be extended to the entire hospital . Look in at the male surgical ward . These young women in white caps and aprons and blue-and-white striped seersucker dresses seem to have had something of the training of the soldier added to that of the nurse . There is little talking and no laughing . When they do speak , it is in subdued tones . Each seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enters , and , beckoning to a nurse , gives her directions regarding a particular patient recently visited . She listens attentively makes no reply , and turns at once to obey . A soldier , pausing in his rounds , presenting arms to his superior officer and listening respectfully for orders , would not have exhibited a more perfect discipline . On either hand the patients lie on their cots , in the various stages of relapse or recovery . As a rule , these are hard-featured , ill-favored men . Some are only waiting here until the healing of their wounds to be tried for felonious assault , housebreaking , or murder . One is a bar-keeper , brought in the previous night in an ambulance , VOL . XXV .. -5 . 4 ' after a m*b*e in which he was shot through the chest . His face wears a puzzled expression as the nurse quietly and skillfully dresses the wound ; such kind attention is a revelation to him . In the next cot is a man who has been run over , while intoxicated , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the almost undivided attention of a skilled nurse* if she had not been at hand , the surgeon would be obliged to amputate the leg that now swings easily upon the strap-support . On the opposite side of the ward , stretched upon a cot near the door , is a workman who has been injured by falling from a scaffold . He has a careworn , anxious expression , that proceeds not from physical , but mental troubles . He has just told the nurse that his wife is very ill , and that there is no one to look after her and the children . He does not know , but will soon learn , that another young woman with even more experience than the one sitting near him , is already on her way to his wife , the number of his house having been ascertained from the hospital entry-book on the ground floor . In another division of this ward are gathered the most complicated cases . The labors of the nurse must here be unremitting ; yet little medicine is required . Some of these poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the influence of that , but the world is still sweet to them , and the spark of life that fitfully lights up their wan , colorless faces may , if carefully tended , still be kept aglow . One patient is undergoing an operation , though not a dangerous one . The nurse stands by , BELLEVUE HOSPITAL AND GROUNDS . // supporting his head and shoulders . Ether is not required , but the man has been already broken down with his malady ; his face twitches with pain , his hands open and shut convulsively , and a groan escapes him , deep , prolonged , and expressive not only of present pain , but of the weary months of suffering that he has experienced . Now the surgeon 's work is done , and the poor fellow , before sinking back again upon his pillow , murmurs a stuttering apology to the nurse for having shown what he takes to be weakness while under the lancet . In the female wards the work of the trained nurses is employed to better purpose probably than elsewhere within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hobble about on crutches , or lie on their cots with blanched , careworn faces , and deep-sunken eyes . A kindly faced nurse is feeding an old woman from a bowl . Whatever it contains , it causes a smile to light up what before had been sullen and frigid features . Another is carefully bandaging a wounded arm , striving , meanwhile , to argue away from the sufferer the specter that haunts her . The most uninviting and wretched tenement-houses do not reveal a class more in need of help and sympathy than the patients in the female wards of Bellevue . The bell of an ambulance which has just arrived strike* three startling strokes , the signal for the medical division . A few minutes pass , and two men bring in a stretcher , on which rests the form of a woman clad in genteel but much-worn apparel . Two nurses lift the motionless form upon a bed , and examine the card made out for each patient upon her arrival . It is superscribed " No Friends , " and a careful examination of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnish additional intelligence . She was found lying insensible upon the pavement , and , though she regained consciousness for a few minutes previous to the arrival of the ambulance , she stubbornly refused to answer questions , to give her name , or tell what ailed her . But the nurses soon discovered this trouble . The woman was starving-had been starving herself purposely . She had had some misfortune , of which she refused to speak . Her first words upon recovering consciousness were of regret that she had not been permitted to die . Later on , however , she was encouraged to partake of nourishing food . With this and good nursing , her spirits to a certain extent revived , until , upon her departure , she had , to all appearance , ceased to reflect upon that which had caused her distress . Upon the completion of their labors in the A DEMONSTRATION IN BANDAGING. // Training-School , and after passing a satisfactory examination , the nurses , furnished with diplomas , signed by the managers and the examining board of the hospital , begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and city hospitals , a continually increasing number seek private practice , or rather are sought by it , while not a few , as has already been said , devote themselves to the sick among the poor . The value of the service performed by these noble women can not be adequately estimated without visiting the tenement-house district wherein it is performed . They lodge in a house provided for the purpose by the Woman 's Branch of the City Missions , by which they are supported , and are to New York what the " District Nurses " are to London . From early morning until evening they endure fatigue , heat , cold , and storm , in their efforts to relieve the distressed . Neither the gruff responses , nor the ingratitude of those for whom they toil , have , in a single known instance , forced them to cease their work . An equally zealous person , without the advan tages of a nurse 's training , would fail signally where she would succeed . For the mere attendance on the invalid is not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She sweeps and cleans the rooms , cooks the food , does the washing , if necessary , goes upon errands-in short , takes the place of the mother , if she be ill . All this has been learned at the training-school . Neither illness nor death itself can appall her : she has served a long novitiate in nursing the one , and the other has long since lost its terrors . Here is the substance of an account given by one of these charitable women , of a typical day 's work . " I heard that a young man was dying of consumption in a tenement-house on the east side . After searching for some time , I found the house , squeezed in between two larger and equally dilapidated structures , in the rear of those facing the street . It had no door , and , like such houses generally , was so dark , even in broad daylight , that I had to grope my way to the upper chambers by aid of the stairrail . A woman in the yard told me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lodged , she thought , on the top floor . Upon my arrival I knocked for some time at the doors of the front chambers , but no one answered . Then I tried the back hall-room . Who 's there ? ' a many s voice roughly demanded . I want to speak with you , ' I answered . Well , who are you ? ' I said that I would explain my business , if he would open the door , and , after a few moments , it was opened just a few inches . The face of a little , weazened old man appeared . What do you want ? ' he demanded , scowlingly . I heard there was an invalid here , and I want to try and do something for him . ' Well , he does n't want anything . ' But , ' I persisted , ca n't I see him for a moment ? ' No , you ca n't . ' He would have slammed the door in my face , but I had caught sight of the poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner . I beckoned to him , and he unwillingly came toward the door in time to prevent its being closed . Do n't you like beef-tea ? ' I asked . No , I do n't , ' he returned . But I have some here that you will like . I 'm sure it 's different from what you 've seen . Let me make some for you . You need n't take it , if you do n't like it . ' I do n't know , ' he said . I might . ' And , despite the scowls of the father , who was opposed to my entrance , I sat down by the stove , gathered some pieces of wood from a pile in the corner , and made a fire warm enough to heat the beef-tea . The young man was in the last stages of consumption , and said he had not eaten anything for some time , though I saw some bits of dry bread and pork upon an adjoining shelf . He had no sooner tasted the tea I made for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure , and declared it very good . It seemed to warm him up mentally as well as physically , seeing which , I plied him with questions regarding his illness and means of support , - questions which , notwithstanding the evident displeasure of his father , he anTHE PATIENT . // swered courteously and intelligently . Before my departure I put the room in order , and brought to the invalid and his father sufficient good food for a few days , and showed them how to prepare it . " My next visit was to a little boy who had been run over while playing in the street . He was dead when I reached him , and his mother , worn out alike by mental and physical exhaustion , for she had not slept at all , and had eaten but little for several days , was lying moaning upon a bed . Another child lay in an adjoining room , quite ill with malarial fever . This is so prevalent among tenement-house children in warm weather , that we usually carry with us something to relieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then began to arrange the rooms and prepare the dinner . The mother appeared indifferent to what was taking place ; but the father , a truck-driver by profession , who sat silent at the window , seemed much pleased with my efforts . The rooms were close and the atmosphere was permeated with bad air coming from the lower halls . The back windows looked into those of ill-kept , tumble-down structures across a court , the odors of which were alike offensive . The family clothes were suspended upon some of the ropes that formed a sort of cobweb between the adjoining buildings . They had remained hanging there for nearly a week , and after serving the dinner , I set about taking them in . This was no easy matter . While tugging upon the lines , they caught upon those belonging to the inmates of the other houses , and clogged up the pulley , and , before I had completed my labors , I had been roundly scolded for my awkwardness by the stout , red-faced occupants of the windows in the quadrangle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neglect his work for several days , in order to assist his wife . His money was almost gone in consequence ,  - -  at a time , too , when an unusual outlay was necessary . So I returned early the following day , and remained until the affairs of the household were again in smoothrunning order . " The most unsatisfactory visits we make are to those addicted to the use of intoxicating liquor . It was upon one of these I next called . In a little , dingy apartment in the wing of an old house which seemed to lean for support upon its neighbor , equally unsteady , I found a woman whose children I had nursed for weeks at a time . I had before seen her when under the influence of liquor , but now she seemed to be almost crazed with it . The children , ragged and dirty , were lying upon the floor , and , when I offered to look after them during her absence-for she was putting on her bonnet-she almost flew at me , with taunts that I had abandoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , I had been with her upon the previous day . " Such is the work , such the experience of those of the training-school graduates who elect to exchange the comforts ( often the luxuries ) of home , and the society of friends , for the exposures and dangers incident to a life among the poor sick . When the managers of the training-school announced , some years since , that they would send nurses to private families in cases of illness , the applications were so few that they were led to fear that this branch of the school would be unsupported , and that the nurses would find themselves deceived regarding their future prospects . But the value of the trained nurse , little known at that time in America , soon began to be recognized , and the demand for such services increased , until , at the present time , there is a greater call for nurses than can be supplied . Many who formerly refused to consider a suggestion to call in a nurse , now eagerly apply for them ; and surgeons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without the subsequent assistance of a trained nurse . Before going to a private house , the nurse is carefully instructed by the superintendent . She must not leave it without communicating with her , nor return from her duties without a certificate of conduct and efficiency from the family of the patient or the physician attending . She is expected and urged to bear in mind the importance of the situation , and to show , at all times , self-denial and forbearance . She must take upon herself the entire charge of the sick-room . Above all , she is charged to hold sacred any knowledge of its private affairs which she may acquire through her temporary connection with the household . She receives a stipulated sum for her services , but this will not always compensate her for the annoyances with which the position is occasionally beset . In addition to this field in New York city and vicinity , there is an increasing demand throughout the country for experienced nurses to take charge of hospitals and schools . Graduates of the Bellevue school have been called to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Massachusetts General Hospital ; Boston City Hospital ; New Haven City Hospital ; New York Hospital ; Mt . Sinai Hospital , New York City ; Brooklyn City Hospital ; Cook County Hospital , Chicago ; St. Luke 's Hospital , Denver ; Charity Hospital , New Orleans , and the Minneapolis ( Minn . ) Hospital ; others are matrons of Roosevelt Hospital , // New York City ; Charleston ( S. C. ) Hospital ; Lawrence ( Mass . ) Hospital , and the Seaman s Hospital , Savannah , Ga . Thus has the great work set afoot by a few noble women of New York developed , little by little , amid difficulties of which it would he useless to complain , since all have been surmounted . The results have amply justified their conviction that a demand for efficient nurses would speedily follow their supply , and that American women could be found willing to nurse the pauper sick , provided they were at the same time assured of a competence . That the profession of trained nurse will rise in estimation as the value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt . Other occupations than hers have successfully met and overcome prejudice . Less than two centuries ago , the English clergy were entertained in the servants ' hall , were sent upon errands , and were expected to marry my lady 's waiting-maid . It was later yet when the surgeon was separated from the barber , as that by no means ancient pile , the Barber-Surgeons ' hall , still standing in London-may remind us . Against any such lingering prejudice the moral and professional character of the school will prove an ample defense . Founded in the belief that the value of a nurse is in proportion to her intelligence , capacity , and refinement , it has proved an important step forward in our civilization , and its standard is not likely to be lowered in order to make a show of graduates . During the nine years of its existence one hundred and forty-nine pupils have received diplomas , seventy-eight of whom are now practicing in New York city . Perhaps twice as many capable women have been turned away because the school can not he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more considerable than at present . In conclusion it must he said that , while Miss Nightingale 's theories are the basis of the Training-School , its managers have found it necessary to depart from the English system in some important particulars . For instance , Miss Nightingale regards it as indispensable that the superintendent and the nurses should live within the hospital . " Our experience is the reverse of this , " say the committee . " American women , being of a sensitive , nervous organization , are at first depressed by the painful aspects of hospital life , and when they become interested in the work they take it greatly to heart . Hence it is of importance to have a cheerful , comfortable home where they can each day throw off the cares of their profession . " To the restfulness of the Home is attributed the exceptional health of the nurses , among whom but one death and very few dangerous illnesses have occurred since the opening of the school , almost ten years ago . Another necessity in an American training-school is the abolition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( who has received thorough training ) is expected to be a lady , superior in social position and intelligence to the nurses , who are drawn from the class of domestic servants . At Bellevue , the preliminary examination , and the high standard subsequently exacted , exclude , and are meant to exclude them . But among those who enter there is no distinction . All submit to the same discipline and perform the same duties , none of which , being connected with the sick , is considered menial. * Fra ; , klin H Nor/li. @
