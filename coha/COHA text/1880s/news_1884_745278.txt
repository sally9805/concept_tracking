txt There is scarcely a doubt that - at least 20,000 votes were lost to CLEVELAND in this city , by , the treachery and corrupt trading of Tammany workers in their effort to elect a Mayor . Probably in a small way there was dickering in behalf of minor candidates increased this loss . ? This made a difference of at least 40,000 in the plurality . t When we consider the narrow margin by which the Electoral ticket was chosen in this State , ' and the fact that the votes of this State in all probability decided the Presidential election and settled all the momentous issues involved in the nomination of such a Man as BLAINE , the tremendous importance of the opportunity afforded ? for this infamous business of ' trading in votes is obvious . ? It might have been possible for it also to . decide the municipal election , on which the cause of reform in the administration of the affairs , of this great city depended . These circumstances very forcibly emphasize the necessity , for separating the city election in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The , argu. - merit for such a-change . already : very strong . . There ? is ? no reason ' why general politics should enter at all into , the contest for city offices . The questions involved . relate solely to the management of the public business of the city , the paving , ' lighting , and cleaning of streets , constructing and repairing of sewers and docks , care of parks and the public health , the protection of life and property , &c.; What is wanted is mainly economy , honesty and efficiency in administration and a jealous care of the city finances . There are no questions of policy dependent upon the position of parties , and there is every ' reason why the people should vote at the city elections with entire independence of party affiliations . But so long as the city canvass is mixed up with that which is dominated by party feeling it will be impassible to prevent party nominations and . their support , in a great measure , on party grounds . ? While that ' is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make their deals and bargains , and have a chance of carrying their ends . If the city election were held in the Spring and conducted by itself on the merits of candidates and of the questions affecting : municipal administration alone there would be a much greater - chance of independence in voting and of the success of movements headed by citizens irrespective of party to secure honesty , economy , and efficiency . There is but a single serious drawback . There would be danger of apathy and a light vote , but the interests of the city are so important and so directly affect the daily life of the people and .4 the pockets of the taxpayers that it ought to be quite possible to awaken interest enough at intervals of two or three years to secure attention to local issues . The power and responsibility now centred in the Mayor are calculated to enhance the interest of voters in the municipal canvass and to overcome in some measure the tendency to indifference . We believe that it would not only be entirely safe to . try this experiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which should be urged upon the attention of the next Legislature . ? It ought to be effected with very little opposition .
