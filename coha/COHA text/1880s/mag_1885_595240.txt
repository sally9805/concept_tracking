THE very difficulty which we must feel in expressing by means of words the chief artistic characteristics of the works of Greek art points to one of the cardinal virtues inherent in it , namely , its simplicity . The works were meant to be gazed upon , and not to be the subject of learned commentaries ; they were intelligible to the people , appealed to their senses , their feelings , their moral and intellectual nature , by means of their own substance and form , without the need of a verbal explanation . But the remains are comparatively scanty and in a fragmentary condition , and therefore require instruction and study in order to be appreciated . Furthermore , they belong to an age removed from us , by more than two thousand years , to a people differing from us in the natural , social , and religious conditions of life ; and thus it is not only from the purely artistic , but especially from the historical point of view that we must regard them . Here it is that art becomes perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of apprehending and realizing the civilization of ancient Hellas . Still , we must never forget that art to the Greeks was a great reality ; that it was a part of their daily life , covering and affecting their smallest , humblest needs , as it was evoked by and expressed their highest aspirations . And , above all , the modern student must remember that the works were not meafft to be stowed away in museums , by which most of us mean repositories of curious , outlandish , and fractured articles , of all out-of-the-way things that have nothing to do with fhe needs of daily life , and from the contemplation of which we return with the sense of having done something uncommon , almost amounting to a moral penance which is followed by a stern but pleasant self-approval . Art with the Greeks was above all the outcome of a real need felt among the people , as it was at the same time the means of conveying to the whole public the most unalloyed and edifying pleasure . It was to the people a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form the highest fruits of the culture of their time . And this it is which makes the position of Greek art so unique in the history of the world 's civilization : the fact that , on the one hand , it was the adequate expression of the very best that the intellectual life of the people could offer , the highest and deepest of their thought ; and that , on the other hand , its expressions were intelligible to the lowliest and humblest of Greek citizens . I will refer you to but one well-known instance in illustration of this fact : In the eastern pediment of the Parthenon Pheidias represented in the forms of mythology , in the most sensuous and easily intelligible form , one of the widest conceptions of cosmogony . The birth of Athene out of the head of Zeus is the cosmical conception of the birth of the clear atmosphere out of the depths of heaven . The clear-eyed daughter of Zeus is born on the heights of Olympus , in the presence of the gods , surrounded by the broadest personifications of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pediment by the rising sun-god , Helios , with his chariot , and at the other angle by the moon-goddess , Selene , descending into the regions of darkness with her steeds . We here have the widest metaphysical conceptions , Time and Space incorporate . And , moreover , they are put in such a form that these widest conceptions were intelligible and appealed to the most childlike of The essay here printed was originally delivered as a lecture at Chickeriag Hall , New York , January // minds among the Greek citizens . * The questions must present themselves to us : How came Greek art to be possessed of these attributes ? And can this state of art be reproduced ? As regards the second of these questions , most people answer hastily , " No , the time has gone by ; that age will never again return , " as if there were some mysterious essence underlying the growth and flower of Hellenic culture . But if we study the main conditions which led to this peculiar growth of Greek art , we may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; nay , that there is always something abnormal and wrong in the social constitution of a civilized community when the conditions are not similar . The conditions which made Greek art intelligible to the mass of the population and adequately expressive of the highest culture of the age are above all to be found ( i ) in the education of the art-appreciating public , and ( 2 ) in the education of the productive artist . In the first place , the chief characteristic of Greek popular education was , that it above all meant to produce men who were mentally as well as physically fully and normally developed on all sides of their nature . It is the roundness and versatility of the types of Greek social and political history which most strike us who belong to an age of over-specialization . A political leader like Pericles was at the same time a skilled soldier with full athletic training , a keen student of philosophy and of literature , and a votary of the highest art . A dreaming philosopher like Socrates was keenly alive to thepolitical questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardy soldier , took part in the warlike expeditions of his country . As in the Pakestra the normally and fully developed human body was held up as the aim of physical education , and the defective growth of any one member was remedied by a series of athletic exercises ; so the musical side , the intellectual training , and the full and normal development of the human mind on all sides was the supreme aim , and any deficiency in power or taste was vigorously counteracted . But the chief distinctive feature of Greek education must be referred back to the distinctive Greek conception of the life for which this education was to prepare . Aristotle distinguishes two main aspects of the human soul : the active , laboring soul ( vo ito*v*tx6* ) , and the passive , enjoying soul ( vob* itc&amp;t*tLx6* ) . * Some readers may here object that the many theories which exist concerning the interpretation of this very work tend to prove the opposite of the simplicity which I claim for Greek art . I need but remind them that the interpretation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispute , and that the differences which exist with regard to the meaning of Education was not only to prepare for the life which consists in the material struggle for existence ; but life to the Greeks had another half of equal importance with and practical bearing upon the material subsistence of the individual : it is the life of intellectual relaxation and enjoyment . Food was here to be provided to satisfy the moral and intellectual appetites of rational beings , in a manner most conducive to the moral health and vigor of the individual citizen and the people as a whole . Education was thus not only elementary or technical in character , but set itself the immediate aim of bestowing upon the fullygrown youth a fund of interests and appreciative power which would restore to its normal condition the mind strained in one direction during the hours of toil , and would furnish with interest old age when toil was no longer possible . Finally , public feeling in Greece was so real a power that it drove the Greeks to demand and to create those forms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great works of art . It was not only the imminent danger of the advancing Persian foe which drove the citizens of Athens to concerted action , but after the war was over they joined with the same vigor and publicspirited eagerness not only to rebuild their needed homes , but to adorn them with the greatest works of art the world has ever seen ; for art was to them a real need , as it responds to one side of human nature and life which remains the same throughout all ages . In the second place , the education of the productive artists was equally characterized by this roundness and versatility of interest and training . They were not only carefully educated in the technical manipulation of their art , so that they could express with facility and clearness of form whatever they desired to express , but their education , even after the period that we should call sch*l-days , as well as their intercourse with men of varied interests , were such as to make them conversant and in sympathy with all the varied intellectual interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man stood on the highest scale of the intellectual culture ot his age . As a man he was the highest type of the civilized Greek ; while as an artist he had the power to express clearly , in the sensuous language of his art , the high culture of which he himself was a living type . That Pheidias had the figures are caused by the fact that the arms holding the distinct attributes are all lost . A Greek child would recognize a male figure holding the thunderbolt as Zeus , a reclining female with fruits or corn as Demeter , or one with sea-animals as Thalassa . For further information on this subject 1 must refer the reader to Essay V. in my work on the art of Pheidias. // political interests , that in daily intercourse with Pericles he shared with him the anxiety of overcoming political crises , that he was well read in the ancient and contemporary literature of his country , that he was a student of philosophy and of mechanical science , made him no less careful a student of the human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though it made him more adequately an exponent of the highest that was in his age . Such were the conditions which made Greek art the clear and intelligible expression of the highest culture of that great age and people . Human nature and the needs of human life have remained the same as they were in ancient Heilas , yet the expression of one side of human nature and the satisfaction of one need of human life are not the same . The best art is not clearly intelligible to the lowliest and most childlike of modern citizens ; and our best art is not fully and adequately expressive of the highest culture that our age has produced . Why should this be ? Some thoughtful people say that . it is necessary . Historical evolution , they say , made the Greeks a great artistic people , and us not . We have developed in the direction of science which requires an attitude of mind opposed to the artistic spirit , and the more we have grown in the one the less can we grow in the other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolution , so fruitful in advancing the sphere of human knowledge , there has grown an excrescence of historical generalization as vicious as it is faulty and readily accepted . And this bec*mes still more vicious when the study of the past is used to regulate action in the future . I would call it Fatalistic Evolutionism . The dictum of such a hasty social philosopher would run thus : " The Greeks were the great artistic people ; natural and social evolution have made us the great scientific and therefore unartistic people ; it is necessary that it should be so . " There are many scientific errors in this reasoning ; such is the oversight of the fact that the Greeks in their time were as scientific , that they expressed as fully the intellectual , cognitive side of their spirit , as they were artistic , and manifested the *motional , creative side of their genius . But among these fallacies the most interesting , is the implied analogy between the life of one individual man and the life of a nation ; another is the misconception of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and functions . Because the individual man is limited in the exercise of his intellectual functions by time and physical power , the diffusion of his interests and attention over many things is to a certain extent at the expense of the power directed towards the consummation of one definite end . Still we . must not forget that , as the human body is an organism , so the human mind is organic in its constitution ; that , as such , the existence of the whole depends upon the proper and normal relation of all the organs and parts to one another ; and that , though definite outer demands in the conditions of life may require a greater development of one organ , still the body and the mind , as a whole , will cease to exist and act if the proper relation of the parts to one another is fundamentally disturbed . Specialization has its limits so long as an organism is not a mechanism , as " l ' /wmme **ac*i*ie " is nothing more than an exaggerated epigram . If this is the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case in so complex an organism as a community , a state , or an age . The chief characteristic of the life of a whole people is its variety and change , and in a large community there is no fear of the same limitation of function and physical power ; for its constituent units are so numerous and varied in their individuality that , if the conditions are properly regulated , full and normal expression will be found for the cultured life of the people on every side . In such a healthy community we shall meet with the proper expression of the immediate needs of the whole people for security and facility of intercourse ; the full expression of the highest intellectual life of the people in the sphere of pure intellect and thought in science ; and the adequate expression of the highest culture of the people in the direction of public enjoyment and the more emotional life of art . I should not like to overshoot the mark and state boldly that the great man is great all round ; for history has given instances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educateff in directions not peculiarly their own ; but I do not hesitate to say that a great age and a great people are great in all spheres , unless there be peculiar causes for some weakness either positively pernicious or positively inert . Because we are a great scientific age , we ought therefore also to be great in artistic creation ; for it is the greatness and spiritual vitality of the age as a whole which show themselves in this one aspect . Now , while the conditions of modern life have been favorable to the adequate expression of the highest intellectual culture in various directions , they have not been so in art . The study of the conditions which gave Greek art its chief characteristics will enable us to see where the weak points lie , and with concerted action on our part a good deal may in time be remedied . It is not in the spirit of fault-finding that I would point to 0 // our weaknesses , but it is because I have the full faith that much may be done , and will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I would fain believe that , from the indications of the present and the promise of the future , it is to the American Republic that this task is given . The reasons which make it appear probable that to this country may belong this vocation will partly become evident as we ' proceed with this investigation . I may here briefly enumerate them as follows : Because we are comparatively unhampered by existing traditions and institutions which might impede the progress of a new or bold step . Because by the nature of our people we are representative of the various currents of culture characterizing European nations , and also by this fact we are predisposed to be historically sympathetic in an age in which historical ( I do not mean romantic ) feeling is a leading feature . Because , furthermore , we are a people possessed of the most general diffusion of education , in an age when , more than ever ( for I maintain that to a certain degree the highest art was always so ) , great art must be democratic , must rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public character . And because , finally ( and I consider this of great practical importance ) , there is in this country no recognized and stereotyped upper class which would lower the social status of the followers of art , and would thus counteract the highest natural selection of the artist from among the most distinguished members of a cultured community . We differ from the Greeks as regards the artistic expression of the culture of the age in that our highest art is not readily intelligible to the simplest understanding of the modern citizen , and in that , though our age is a great one , we have no " great art , " the art that is adequately expressive of the best and highest in us . In minor , especially in what I would call domestic art , we stand very high ; but in an age moved by the very widest conceptions of human brotherhood , there ought to be a high art not merely corresponding to the home of the individual citizen and the secluded life of the private mansion , butexpressive of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as our scientific attainments are fully representative of its culture . We have traced back in the art of Greece the possession of these qualities to the education of the art-appreciating. people and the producing artist ; we must trace their want in our time to defects in the education of both these classes . XVe must examine , then , first , the education of the art-appreciating public , and see where its defects lie , and secondly , the education of the producing artists , and endeavor , to discover the weakness in this sphere . It is the just pride of this nation that more is done here by the government , central and local , for popular education than in any other country , Germany not excepted . The founders of the republic and the devisers of its constitution recognized from the very beginning the fundamental importance of popular education in a republican country , as it is , no doubt , the basis of a well-regulated commonwealth whatever be the actual form of government . And these great men had not in view merely that education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in assisting him in gaining the means of honest subsistence or the power of reading and writing his voting papers , but they had in view the less apparent , though from the social and political point of view the most important , result of general education in its bearing upon the general welfare of the citizen , and in its tendency to create a high intellectual and moral tradition in the political community as a whole . This was expressed tersely by Washington in his farewell address . " In proportion as the structure of a government gives force to public opinion , " he says , " it is essential that the public opinion be enlightened . " Now an interesting article by Mr. Charles F. Thwing , in Harper 's Monthly Magazine ( February , 1884 ) , gives ample evidence of the great efforts made in this country for public education ; while at the same time it shows how narrow and illconceived has been this notion of education , and especially how neglectful it has been of that side which would prepare the public for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need created in them for great works , would lead them to act upon the art-producing portion of the community , modifying the character of their work and encouraging their noblest efforts . According to Mr. Thwing , " the total amount by which the general government has aided the several states in education consists of the gift of 125,000 square miles , or about one-thirtieth part of the entire national domain , and of the gift of nearly thirty millions of dollars . " No doubt this proves the keenest appreciation of the value of public education , but it is important to remember that this is only for what must be called primary education , not for the highest education of the university , and still less of art academies . The exception to this rule quoted by Mr. Thwing is most interesting , as manifesting the general spirit which underlies this neglect of higher education . " In 1862 an act was passed donating lands to states and towns for collegesfor ( lie ' 0 // lenefit of agricultural and mechanical ar/s . " The limitation of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arts betrays the general tenor of mind actuating not only the majority of our political leaders , but also the vast majority of our thinking population . It is that most illconceived and vicious idea of " the practical " and * the useful . " Against this watchword of coarse-minded demagogues and cons*ientious dupes of " experience in the struggle of life " ( as misdirected and viciously egotistical in its generalized form and application as it is oftentimes of long standing and dearly bought ) all well-disposed reasonable people ought to make war . In order to gain the moral support of a community for an institution directly or indirectly educational in purpose , it is but necessary to show that it is what is termed practically useful . The whole community will then feel that there is a moral justification in the expenditure , while they consider this justification wanting if the institution can be classed under what might be termed the luxuries of education and civilization . The grounds upon which their sympathy is based and their moral conscientiousness soothed are the following : the utility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can definitely appeal to the personal interest of each individual , or if he can at least conceive of himself as directly benefiting by it . We can all readily conceive of ourselves as gaining a livelihood as joiners , or at least we can appreciate the utility of this vocation from the need we have of its product*in the surroundings of our daily life ; and thus there would be no doubt in our mind of the decided utility of a school for joiners . But what is here ignored is the fact that in such cases public action is invoked , and that there is a difference between public and private utility . The very nature of public utility , as such , is often that its immediate application to any individual person is vague and more difficult to accomplish . Nay , we may almost put it as a formula , that the more public in character any institution grows , the smaller grows its apparent individual applicability to the use of any individual . The practice of individual doctors is of more apparent and direct utility than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work of this board of health than that of a national sanitary commission investigating recondite questions of medical science . The action of the one body of individuals directly concerns individuals , and is supported by them ; that of the other concerns the public as a whole , and would hardly receive support from individuals , but is maintained by public administration . The practical utility of the policeman for the promotion of public peace and safety is more easily percejved and demonstrated than is that of the United States Supreme Court , of the postman than of the Postmaster-General ; of an elementary village school than of a national university in which are studied and solved the great questions of highest science . But we must here note and insist upon the difference between public and private utility , and remember that in most cases private utility does and ought to stimulate private efforts , while institutions with public utility as their purpose are entirely dependent upon public support . But we find that the public action taken as regards education is the very reverse , and educational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ namely , the universities and the art academies ) are left to the precarious liberality of individuals and corporations , on the very ground ( confessed or implied ) that they are not possessed of that utility which is chiefly characterized by its ready application to the individual citizen . It is , however , but fair to point to another ground which often actuates those who oppose the claims to public support of these highest institutions of education , as compared with the claims of the immediately useful schools . It is on the ground of the more generous feeling of democracy , in which the duty of the government is above all conceived as being directed towards the good of the many , and to let the few ( who are capable of doing so ) look after themselves . But it is against this very vicious circle that we are arguing , concerning which the Greeks teach us the great lesson . We shall see that the very spirit of art is democratic . If it be true that hitherto in our communities the higher education which produces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restricted to the few , it is this very evil which ought to be remedied , and from the many ought no longer to be withheld their birthright of the faculty of enjoying what is beautiful and true and good . If it were true ( which fortunately it is not in our country ) that all superior education is restricted to the wealthy few , it is high time , in a republican country , that this be altered . I do not mean to propose the ( for the present ) impracticable idea that every citizen is to be sentt to the university or art academy ; but the spirit of which these institutions are the embodiment must be made a reality , a recognized tradition ; its public utility must be acknowledged ; its fruits must respond , as was the case with the Greeks , to a real need of daily life , of which an admixture is to be infiltrated from the earliest educational years into the system of every boy and girl . But // this is not the case with the spirit of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among us do not avail themselves of . the existing means of giving their sons and daughters the opportunities of acquiring the highest fruits of civilization , in sending them to universities , bestowing an enlightened and refined taste upon those who will have the material opportunities for encouraging the higher art-production , in beautifying their homes , and in showing their public spirit and liberality in the munificent donations which have distinguished our countrymen . That art is aristocratic in contradistinction to democratic is fundamentally untrue , from whatever side we view it : a Jriori in its inner meaning , and historically as regards the facts of art history . Art is , and has been in its splendid periods , essentially democratic ; that is , it has appealed to larger masses of people in contradistinction to individuals . Kant and Schiller have drawn the true distinction between ordinary pleasures and the pleasures of art ; the first are selfish , the others are public . The ordinary , selfish pleasures depend upon possession or consumption by one person or one group of individuals ; the aesthetic pleasures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An apple is eaten by one person or a horse possessed by him , and the possibility of some other person enjoying the fruit or using the horse is thereby debarred . The acquisition of these pleasures by any individual is potentially always at the cost of the possession of the same pleasure by some other person . In aesthetic pleasure* it is not so . The monumentality of a great edifice , the beauty of a picture , the nobility of a statue , the harmony of a musical composition , the thrilling interest of a drama , and the charm of a book are not diminished in their virtue by the fact that a large number of people enjoy them . On the contrary , we might almost say that they gain in virtue , that they receive the " soul " of their existence through being admired and enjoyed . A building hidden from view , a picture unseen , a statue unveiled , a drama unperformed , a book unpublished or not read , are robbed of the soul of their aesthetic existence . Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is well that the latter should not live . The whole essence of art is its public , unseWish character , as its pleasures are disinterested and free from the grasping voracity of selfish possession , and it is thus essentially democratic in spirit . Historically , too , the democratic character of art has ever manifested itself . The periods in history which are marked by the artistic development are also marked by the spread of appreciation among the people , and repub lican forms of government . Even if these republics were aristocratic in their constitution , the fact rdmains that the mass of the population in these periods and countries were thoroughly responsive to the higher artistic delights ; nay , that they demanded them as a real need . There exists a common notion , as widespread as it is fallacious , that the splendid growth of art was peculiar to the reign of enlightened tyrants and languished under more democratic forms . This is so neither during the highest period of Greek art nor in the history of medmeval and renaissance art . With regard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that art was the popular expression of the genius of a people to whom it appealed strongly as a clear and intelligible language . In its highest period , as well as in the period of transition to this perfection , Greece was republican . It is true that in Greece , as well as in the Italian renaissance , individual rulers and usurpers , such as Alexander the Great , Attalus of Pergamon , the Medici , and the Popes , were liberal patrons of art , giving it especially a character of splendor . But this only means that these tyrants and rulers found in the composition of the people over whom they ruled or had just succeeded in gaining sway the existence of art and the need of its works , and that they felt driven by interest or inclination to increase or maintain this pursuit and to satisfy this popular demand . Art had reached its highest point in Greece more than a century before the rule of Alexander the Great , and the great artists , like Skopas , Praxiteles , and even Lysippus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Pergamene and Rhodian period marks the decline of Greek art , and the splendor which princes like Attalus and Eumenes infused into it was a futile attempt consciously to reproduce the past culture of Greece proper . In medkeval and renaissance history the same facts present themselves . In the North it is a free town like Nuremberg , with its guilds and craftsmen , that produces the highest art . Never were art and literature more thoroughly popular than in the springtide of prosperity at Nuremberg . In Flanders , at Ghent , Antwerp , and Bruges , art had the same homely and popular character ; and though Bruges became the home of emperors and their court , it was in the merchant community that the princes found the means of satisfying their need for splendor and luxury . It must be remembered that the nohlest order of the Golden Fleece is originally symbolical of the commercial prosperity of this market of textile fabrics . And when we come to the South , to Italy , we must not forget that it was not // in the cinque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not with the Popes nor with the Medici , but that it was already a part of the mental condition of every Italian city long before this period , and had produced works of stupendous importance . As early as the thirteenth century we have the popular spread of the fruits of culture in Italy . Each city of any importance was anxious to possess a university . Beginning with Bologna and Modena in the twelfth century , follow Vicenza , Padua , Naples , Arezzo , Treviso , Pisa , Pavia ,  --  in short , all the great free cities . At this early period the whole country was thus checkered with centers of high culture , and from these , immediately through each student of even lowly family , the realization of the existence and the appreciation of higher culture filtered through the whole population , and manifested itself in their desire and finally need for intellectual pleasures . In modem times it is because of this diffusion throughout the whole empire , this decentralization and multiplication , of the highest class of universities in Germany that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among modern nations . And the thirteenth century universities in Italy were well attended ; and though at the more famous ones there were many foreign students , they were no doubt largely recruited from Italy . The University of Bologna at one time had about ten thousand students , a number never attained by a university of modern times . But even in small towns , where there was no hope of attracting large numbers of foreign students bringing immediate gain to the citizens , we have proof of the same recognition of learning and culture . Thus we hear that the small town of San Gimignano gave a special salary to a learned town clerk who was to give public lectures on civic law ; that the same town gave pecuniary help to gifted young men to enable them to study abroad ; that they received and honored with a public festival one of their citizens who had gained fame as a- professor of law . But this sense for intellectual acquirement on the part of the population itself not only manifested itself in this indirect and passive form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly ,  --  on the one hand in the lasting monuments of art which beautified their cities , on the other in the more ephemeral form of public festivals . The communalities had the duty of looking after the embellishment of the town , to . buy private houses if needed to make a public square , to build palaces for public business and splendid cathedrals , and to erect artistic fountains and monuments . They would even assist with contributions the monasteries or private perVOL . XXXI. - 27. sons who undertook to build beautiful churches . It is frequently possible to prove in the present day how the example of one city in erecting a fine city-hall or fountain stimulated the neighboring town to erect another which was to surpass it in beauty . The Florentine document of the year 1300 is well known , in which Florence bestows immunity from taxation on Arnolfo , the architect of the baptistery , because she hoped thereby to possess a more beautiful temple than any other town in Tuscany . The public amusements , illuminations , processions , races , dances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the communities as a real material need of the people , and were therefore provided at public expense ; they were considered by them as being useful . The grand notion of " play " as being neither useless nor frivolous marks a truly healthy community . What can be more simple and touching than the account of the festival given by the city of Treviso to which the neighboring towns were invited ? The chief feature was the storming of a fortress , defended by the most beautiful ladies and their servants , by noblemen who made war with fruits , flowers , sweetmeats , and perfumes . This will suffice to show that the growth of art in its highest form in Greece and Italy rose from the ground of a populace educated to and encouraged in the desire for intellectual edification , and that art is thus thoroughly democratic in spirit , and ought to appeal to the mass of the population . It will be so if the public education acknowledges the claim and stimulates the satisfaction of the need . The whole spirit of modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it must not be guided by this misconceived notion of " the useful . " It is Goethe who said , with epigrammatic exaggeration : " See to the beautiful , the useful will look after itself . " It is often most practical to begin with that which is least manifestly useful , especially when it is most in need of support and encouragement ; while the manifestly useful is more likely to enforce the satisfaction of its own wants . The German architect Ferstel , who died recently , was in the rare position of seeing the completion , while comparatively young , of an immense cathedral-like church built on subscription . The secret of this singular /rac/icaZ success is to be found in the good advice which King Louis of Bavaria gave to the young architect . As he was beginning the Votiv-Kirc/ie at Vienna , " Begin with the tower and finish it , " said the King in Bavarian dialect ; " the others will see to the nave when they ca n't use the church . " Had he not followed this advice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to // qwq // and explain the artistic manifestation of any period they are treating of , or any passages in ancient or modem authors which refer to the works of art under consideration . In the higher classes , finally , there ought to be a definite course of instruction in the history of art , without which no boy or girl ought to pass into the world or enter the university . The subjects just mentioned are not the only ones in connection with which the study of art might well be used to supplement and vitalize knowledge . The study of geography , for instance , as at present conceived , is one of the studies the restricted acceptation of which is a crying evil . It is true that it has been supplemented by physical geography , but it ought also to be supplemented by the study of the history of localities in the widest sense ; that is , the knowledge not only of the political events marking the various localities , but also the culture that prevailed there , and the appearance of the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the famous works of art which they contain . The various studies ought to be used to illustrate each other ; the connection between the groups of studies is to be insisted upon ; they are , in short , to be endowed with their own life as they are to be living in the mind of the student , a part of his own intellectual vitality , and not merely an alien element introduced for the time being under a mechanical process of pressure , and discarded as soon as the pressure is withdrawn . But this leads us to the question of the indirect modification of the spirit of general teachin*which is required in order to remedy the diseased state of the development of art . Expressed or only implied , there is a fear in teachers lest , in giving life , say , to the study of geography , in thus illustrating it by means of pictures and the stories of its men , the study be not made too amusing and interesting to maintain the serious character of work . This is the same spirit which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this case it is the domination of the ethical and moral over the intellectual and artistic . The effect of compulsory learning upon the pupils is no doubt often good in making them realize the idea of duty , and in teaching them to control their inclination towards self-indulgence . But life presents so many occasions for teaching and practicing these moral qualities that they need hardly be multiplied for the young , generally overburdened with the feeling of renunciation and with all that counteracts the spirit of joyousness . At all events , immediate moral discipline is not the chief and direct aim of the pursuit of definite studies , and every means which tends to make systematic knowledge complete and to infuse it into the mental system of the pupil with greatest power or promise of tenacity is highly commendable . The general tone of school education is , above all , to be altered in its groundwork in this very direction . The teacher is to realize that one noble thing to strive after 15 the creation in the pupil of lasting interests and the joy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and not only the nous j5oie/icos , is to be watched over and developed . The aim of school-teaching will not only be to fit man and woman best for the active struggle of existence , for the practically useful , but equally to create in them a great capital of interests which will refresh them when wearied with the active struggle , and will give them lasting elevating interests and pleasures when the power of active work has ceased ; a capital of interests which do not depend upon possession or consumption , that are open to the rich and the poor , that are in themselves ennobling and strengthening as well as satisfying ; in short , the artistic or aesthetic attitude of mind , whether applied to actual works of art or to intellectual and moral pursuits . Let the teacher infuse some of this spirit into whatever subject he teaches . Let him stop and dwell upon the beauty or truth of the passage he is translating , upon the fascination and charm in the history of words , and the graceful fretwork of the huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study of the past , and ennoble and mellow the study of the present by showing its systematic interrelation with all things which form the lasting whole of the universe . Surely it will not be to the detriment of the appreciation of truth or the practical application of facts acquired , but it will satisfy another need which is highly practical , inasmuch as it concerns the mental health and happiness of every man . Thus trained in school , the average boy will grow to a man capable of appreciating the best art of his time . But education does not cease with the boy , and it is in the appreciation of this fact that again in this country we are peculiarly wanting . The capital of interests , once acquired , must be renewed and even increased , or else it will soon die away under the heavy calls from the eager life of interested work . In this country a hard-and-fast line is drawn between the life of play of the boy and the " serious " life of work of the man . A certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) towards the more playful thoughts and dis . tractions of the boy at school ; but when these years are over , play is to cease and work is to begin , and thereafter the one great and engrossing aim is in some form or other to gain // qwq // and budded by the side of the sturdy tree of earnest life-work ; until , when the sap no longer suffices to nourish the great tree , life is not yet extinct , for the flower and shrub now bud and give growth and beauty to the whole life as it wanes . When they can no longer go to their office or their work , there remains to them the interest in books , in pictures or bric-*-brac , in prints , in some study of science , in music , the theater , their garden and botany , in shells , or beetles , or butterflies . Above all , they have learnt the art of being alone . The first and most common symptom of intellectual vulgarity , of intellectual an*mia , if I may use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone or quiet . They are so poor in the intellectual life-blood that the pulse of interest will not throb unless they have the outer stimulus of the chatter of people . A book , a beautiful scene , not to mention their own thoughts , can not fascinate them even for an hour , and they must beg for the offal of interest from the social banquet . I hold that to teach people the art of being alone and enjoying it , is of more practical use than the immediate good that comes from much of the most practical school-teaching . And this power of moral enjoyment is not , and ought not to be , restricted to the rich or the wellto-do . It ought to be a popular good , as it was with the Greeks . It is , moreover , the duty of popular government to foster and cultivate this power among the people , which they can do by means of the encouragement of those pleasures th' very nature of which is that they are common and belong to the many , that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democratic pleasures of art . Nor do I conceive the term art in the narrow acceptation of painting , and sculpture , and architecture . The art that is to be encouraged by public administration is all that comes under the head of intcllec/ual flay common to the many and productive of moral edification . Public feasts . music , the drama , museums , libraries , reading rooms , and the more immediately instructive amusement of lectures ,  --  all these ought to be the great care of state , as they were in ancient Hellas ; nay , even more so in a time which has not the restricted notions of national duties requiring the chief energy of the people to guard or to aggrandize their national domain against aliens whom they considered as their enemies , or at least not their friends . I see the day coming when this fact will have grown in the public consciousness until it will come to be realized by the government , that it is the supreme duty of the state to foster and cultivate the higher amusements of the people more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How little this is realized at present , especially in Europe , is shown most strikingly in England . Eastern and Egyptian questions are of such absorbing importance that the public care of intellectual pursuits and amusements would naturally appear trivial to most persons concerned with government . A relatively small sum for the acquisition of a work of art or the maintenance of a museum is withheld or granted after much discussion , where millions are devoted unhesitatingly to some object of " foreign policy . " As one of the most curious instances of the neglect , not to say contempt , which this group of public institutions suffers in England , I need but point to the administration of the British Museum . Of all the civil service of which the administration of this museum forms a part , this institution requires in its officers and assistants the greatest previous preparation and initial capital of intelligence ; and still its appointments are lowest in the scale of salaries in the civil service . A clerk whose duty it is to add up the salaries of non-commissioned officers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a higher salary , rises at a higher ratio , and ends with a higher final salary , than an assistant who must catalogue and identify Greek and Oriental coins , who must watch over rare manuscripts , and is responsible for priceless articles of science and art . The principal officers of this greatest institution of the kind in the world , who ought all to be the highest representatives of their study , are paid far less than chief-assistant secretaries in the government offices . And this neglect is in a country where the larger schools and universities are richly endowed by private donations and bequests , and where the museums and libraries have been greatly enriched by the same means ; where , in short , the burden is comparatively much smaller than it is in this country or in Germany . But it is encouraging to find that of late there is an awakening to the public duties in this direction , both with regard to school and afterschool education of the people . Though not yet the 3ct of the Government , the establishment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The recent Fisheries , Health , and Inventions exhibitions , with their concerts and promenades , have been made a means towards the cultivation of higher popular amusement . It is here in America , however , where luckily there is no Eastern or Egyptian question , no oppressive standing army , and where the duty of public action with regard to education has been recognized from the very foun // the town and city halls , establishment and maintenance of museums , embellishment of towns in every respect ,  --  these are to form an integral part of governmental function . As a rule government grants for artistic purposes are limited to architecture ; but after the building is complete , a new sphere of public artistic activity ought to begin . The great sculptors and painters and decorators ought to be called in to make of each city hall , each government or public building , in itself a museum , a representative type of the highest advance in art that the place or period has been able to make . Our national capitol is to a certain degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say ashamed , to think that this is all the country can produce of highest art . If it is answered that the great art is wanting , I would but point to the fact that artistic demand will produce supply . I have qwq and worthy . Their answer has been : " Where can we find a market for our great works ? We must work for the house of the well-to-do art patron , and the house will not hold a monumental work . " I dare say that some , perhaps most , of these artists would have failed in this " great " work ; but others , if only one , might have had the noble soul , the a/ma gentile , awakened , and a genius might have been born to us . There are two broad classes of artistic works , the domestic and the monumental . The latter class is public in character , and ought either to be in a museum or part of some public building . Domestic art is growing every day and will find its support ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual ( as it ought to be ) , which must be public property and ought to be encouraged by the representatives of the people .
