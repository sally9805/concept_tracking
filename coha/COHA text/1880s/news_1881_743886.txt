txt At 2 o'clock this afternoon lir . Bliss came from the sick-room to Private Secretary Brown 's office . Dr. Boynton was there , and Dr. Bliss , lighting a cigar , sat down and gave him a long account of the case of the President . Much of his story has already been published , but some of his remarks bearing on the case have not yet been made public , and will be read with interest . He had not talked a minute before he and Dr. Boynton were surrounded by a crowd of eager listeners , and the tenor of his remarks were of such a nature that it interested - all present . " I think , " he said , " that we have now only two symptoms to fear . Pymmia is still liable to set in and the secondary hemorrage is still to be looked for . This- would occur on the seventh day , and we look for it to-morrow .. Even if it comes , I think that we have very little to fear . President Garfield is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhausted by heavy marches and poor diet . He is a strong , robust man , full of vigor , and with a constitution which nature gave him and which he has not weakened by indulgence in vices . It is because of his naturally healthy condition that we feel confident of saving his life , even if the secondary hemorrhage does appear . There is very little drainage of the wound now , and it appears to be healing nicely . We have given him very little to stimulate him . His natural strength was so great that stimulants have not been needed to any great extent . I believe if stimulants had been administered to him at first , when the shot was operating upon him , he would have been a dead man to-day . My experience in the Army taught me that in case of wounds of this kind stimulants should be used cautiously and only when the patient was so low that no other means for retaining life were available . In the case of the President there was no necessity for using them . Perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given him as far as it was possible to do so . If the ball is still in the liver , " continued the Doctor , " there is danger of an abscess , but we are not inclined to think it is in the liver . We believe that it passed through . If an abscess does form , however , we are thoroughly prepared to deal with it , and we have no fears of the result of our treatment . In the stage which the President 's case has now reached it is of very little importance where the ball is at present . President Garfield has made a remarkable journey through this case , and it was a happy wound after all . The ball deflected in such a way , after striking the ribs , that it saved his life . His chances for recovery are more than even , and they are improving with every hour . I believe that with an even chance for life , the President , with his physique and strong will-power , would win the fight , and , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain that we shall pull him through . He is acquiring a voracious appetite , and this noon he wanted some toast . We thought it best not to give him that , but we gave him oat-meal gruel instead , and he has taken quite a quantity of that . He is very anxious to talk at all times when he is awake , and this morning he began to talk about the business of the departments . I told him that he must dismiss that subject from his mind until he was fully recovered . He said that it was on his mind and he had to let it off ; but he obeyed me as implicitly as a schoolboy would obey his teacher , and he has said hardly anything since . He is the most admirable patient I ever had . He obeys me to the letter in everything , and he never makes any complaints about my orders . Very much of his present favorable condition is due to the bravery shown by Mrs. Garfield . She is a wonderful woman , and has astonished all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least despondency since her arrival , as women generally do in cases of this kind , and her courageous demeanor has inspired the President and been of incalculable benefit to him . She is a good , Christian woman , and I think she relies a good deal on the powers above . "
