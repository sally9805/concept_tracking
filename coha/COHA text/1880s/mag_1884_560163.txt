Tm* phrase " wild justice , " frequently used in discussing what is called lynch law , is Lord Bacon 's , and occurs in his essay " On Revenge2* " Revenge , " he says , " is a kind of wild justice , which the more man 's nature runs to , the more ought law to weed it out . " It is curious that Bacon should have hit speculatively upon an idea which many of our modern verdicts have rendered practical . " The most tolerable sort of revenge , ** he adds , " is for those wrongs which there is no law to remedy ; but , then , let a man take heed the revenge be such as there is no law to punish , else a man 's enemy is still beforehand , and it is two for one . " This suggestion of " wrongs which there is no law to remedy , " is a familiar one in men 's mouths and in the newspapers at the present time . It is employed oftenest , perhaps , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affront has been offered to conjugal honor , when the virtue of a daughter has been betrayed , or the good reputation of a sister destroyed . When such has been the provocation , the majority seems ready to forget every other consideration , and to forgive the plainest violations of statutes upon the observance of which the peace of society and the safety of life are presumed to depend . This feeling may arise from a lack of confidence in judicial tribunals , as well as from a sense of the necessary incapacity of the law adequately to punish offenses against personal feelings , and especially against personal honor . Usually , however , it is a result of sudden anger , of unbridled indignation , and of impatience of the processes of the law , which , even if they were sure , must inevitably be slow and formal . When it affects considerable bodies of men , they keep each other in countenance . When , as in the case of the Vigilance Committee of San Francisco , it urges all but a mere handful of the inhabitants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temporary , of all civil government , and the body politic comes near to a resolution into its original elements ; though even anarchy pays to legal tribunals the involuntary compliment of preserving their forms . We have the same violence repeated , under the same forms , in our very court-houses , when jurors , governed by emotion rather than law , render verdicts against all the evidence , which the judges either will not or can not set aside . When a man plainly guilty of murder is , under one pretense or another , acquitted , lynch law , in a respectable and quiet guise , is morally as rampant as when in some frontier town of the far West all the citizens turn out to hang a gambler or to shoot a horsethief . Indeed , the latter is the more defensible proceeding , because it comes more nearly within the category of self-preservation . When no courts exist , or when the servants of the law are in league with its violators , honest and peaceable men will not be much blamed if they take care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and well-settled communities there is little danger of such defiance ; and nothing is more remarkable than the patience with which for centuries mankind , even in the most enlightened lands , have usually submitted to the delays , the pedantries , the extortions , and the uncertainties of the law . Occasionally , but not often , they have been driven to seek redress in private and unauthorized ways ; and it has not seldom occurred that discontented populations have retained a lingering allegiance to the bench long after even a shadow of respect for the throne had disappeared . Respect for and confidence in the judiciary is an Anglo-Saxon instinct . It is therefore of evil import when the right of private ve*igeance is either theoretically or practically asserted . Lord Bacon 's caution , that the revenge " be such as there is no law to punish , ' * intimates with sufficient clearness thai in his time the modern defense of temporary insanity and the modern plea of intolerable provocation were unknown . Men did not then so readily , and by no means with such impunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge , and executioner . Assassinations , as the State Trials abundantly show , were not then unknown in England , while the cowardly resource of poisoning , brought there from Italy and France , was occasionally resorted to . But the people of England , always open and frank in seeking restitution or revenge , even by violence , were // still religious enough not to question the prerogative of the Deity , and the words , " Vengeance is mine , " had yet a restraining power and were yet reverenced in the courts of justice . While we do not propose to discuss the subject from a religious point of view , it should be considered that he who refuses to put his trust in a divine retribution , sure and sufficient , even when human laws are wanting , or have proved insufficient , substantially accuses God of procrastination , and thus , by arraigning his wisdom , really denies his existence . We have here one of the strongest evidences of the atheism of modern times and of the waning influence of Christianity . Who now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks of forgiving his enemy ? What now has become of that great doctrine of love , which we are told should be superior to despiteful usance ? A second consideration , rather moral than religious , is that revenge is usually inconsistent with justice , which should be calm and dispassionate , whereas revenge may proceed upon mere conjecture , and be stimulated to violence by furious and uncontrollable wrath . Coffins , in the Ode on the Passions , sings of revenge with " each strained ball of sight bursting from his head . " Oiie exposed to such mania , who has been taught by long observation that courts will be lenient and that juries will condone , will for that very cause make little or no effort to restrain himself , and will not without reason expect an impunity , whatever he may do , to which he may be little entitled . He has numerous bad examples before him . In many a conversation he has declared what deed of death he would do under such and such circumstances . He has been trained to exaggerate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world demands of him some extraordinary manifestation ; and he feels that should he not give reins to his rage he will be thought but a meanspirited creature . He must commit murder or he must lose caste . He must kill or be sent to Coventry . Such is the morality which bad rulings from the bench , sophistical arguments at the bar , absurd verdicts from the jury-box , inconsiderate pardons from the executive chamber , and hasty generalizations in the newspapers , have taught him . He will be no common felon . He wears a good coat ; he is of a respectable family ; he is well educated ; he is wealthy ; he has troops of friends ; and , above all , he has been really wronged , or he thinks he has been . Ho feels that there is a higher law which authorizes him to break // the lower , and he breaks it , while society , not venturing in set terms to applaud the deed , regards him not unkindly , and says : " Poor man ! He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ npou him ! " Now , we do not mean to say that all this passes seriatim through the mind of a man who , having been , as he thinks , dishonored , proposes to mend the matter by committing murder . On the contrary , he may rush to violence without any reflection of this sort whatsoever . What we do mean to say is that his whole moral nature has been affected disastrously by the general tone of the society in which he has lived , and by the lame and impotent results of many criminal trials the details of which he has read with avidity . Verdicts of " Not Guilty , " which should be verdicts of " Guilty , " and which the whole world , seriously reflecting , knows to be contrary to the law and the evidence , can not be frequently rendered , especially in cases that strongly attract public attention , without blunting the general conscience and filling the general mind with loose notions of justice . It is the duty of the law not merely to punish crime , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last , it will inevitably find the volume of criminal offenses increasing . Unque*tionably the inefficient way in which law has been administered in some parts of this country has , with other causes , greatly impaired the power of self-control . It is not so common as it was to find men governing their passions with absolute sway . The temper of our forefathers may have been as hot as ours , but they knew better how to control it . They had passed , through the influences of civilization and religion , beyond that rude idea of retribution which confounds justice and revenge . They had brought within its due limits the natural impulse to reprisal which marks the savage , who has no doubt of the perfect legality of his vengeance , and who sometimes consuramates it by eating of the body of his dead enemy , as the Corsicans sometimes ate the heart of the victim of the vendetta . From a similar feeling arose the custom among barbarians of torturing prisoners of war . For considerably over two centuries , society in this country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to have out . grown that characteristic of human childhood which strikes instinctively when it is angry . Duelling , which was bad , having disappeared in all parts of the country , assassination , // which is infinitely worse , has to a certain extent taken its place , while those whose lack of refinement would forbid them to think of the duel , with all its artificial punctilio , follow the example of their superiors , and resort to murder upon comparatively slight provocation . Morally the crime of either is the same , saving always those extenuations to which a man lacking opportunity in life may possibly be entitled . The gentleman who in a frenzy shoots the destroyer of his domestic happiness , as well as the carter who brains a rival blocking his way , may each be hanged or not hanged ; but in either case the mischief is the same and proceeds from the same cause , an unbridled temper . We see this exhibited in a minor way in the quarrels of the Stock Exchange , where bankers sometimes scuffle and pound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We find this exotic ferocity exhibited even by children ; and if we go on as we have been going during the last generation , we may , to our sorrow , find it as thoroughly established in the next as it is among the lazzaroni of Naples , or the lascars of the East , or as it was in the Highlands of Scotland in the days of Rob Roy . National character is but an aggregate of personal peculast may act upon the first and t harities : the , he first react upon the last , until that becomes the rule which was the exception , and what was of merely private interest assumes a public importance . We are undoubtedly approaching a period in which the control of the personal passions can alone save us from something very like anarchy . This , however , is a political view of the affair , upon which at present we do not intend to enlarge . There are terrible problems to be solved ; Heaven grant that their solution may not be in blood . In considering the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have first to take into view those injuries for which the law provides no redress , or none which the world has agreed to consider adequate . At the first glance it is evident that these are necessarily few in number , because the tendency of law-making is to protect the material rights of the individual , and to redress his grievances , whenever it is possible , in a material way . The theory , for instance , is , that the loss of a wife , through her infidelity , is simply a loss of labor and service ; and the seduction of a daughter is placed upon the same low ground ; but all this , it is evident , is merely a fiction of the law . It is all that it can do . Really , in either case it has nothing to // offer which an honorable man , under such a burthen of distress , would care to accept . Upon the first revelation of his dishonor , for such he feels it to be , the wretched man , the sport of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blind impulse , to the readiest resource , and , spurning the slow processes of the law , wreaks his vengeance upon the guilty head of the offender . Nobody may say that this is wise , nor , indeed , that it is absolutely just ; but anybody may say , with perfect truth , that it is simply natural . To kill is quickest and most convenient . But this would be equally the impulse of the savage . Have religion , wisdom , philosophy taught this outraged man nothing ' ? The religious man would remember the commandment , " Thou shalt not kill . " The wise would remember that another crime would not in the least lessen the offense , and would only increase that publicity which is one of the sharpest stings of the whole affair . The philosophical man , with an intuitive feeling that he had made a mistake , and that the love of his heart had been foolishly bestowed , would profit by the experience and nerve himself to bear with indifference the gossip , pitiful or contemptuous , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human nature , , even under the best conditions , it still remains that a desire for revenge , amounting to a homicidal frenzy , is neither religious , wise , nor philosophical . There is nothing , therefore , to make its indulgence anything less than criminal . The commission of any crime argues a degree of intellectual weakness . If the brains of thieves , defaulters , and common cheats were properly balanced , such characters would not find themselves so often in the penitentiary . In these days of wild political notions many a deluded speculator may argue himself into a belief that property is theft , and that a portion , at least , of the estate of his neighbor belongs to himself ; but if he carries his theory into practice and helps himself to what he deems a restitution , he is locked up in spite of his fine dialectics . The law , while it has not been regardless of the weakness of man , and sometimes makes for it considerable allowances , must still , in the nature of things , presuppose the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has fixed the punishment of the adulterer . There was a time when it would have been capital , but the wisdom of the law has mitigated that penalty ; and he who undertakes , of his private motion , to make it capital again , // sets himself above the law , at his own risk , and should suffer accordingly . The various forms of private vengeance which have become common in this country , are in many respects allied to the Italian vendetta as it existed and may to some extent still exist in Corsica and Calabria , and with modifications in Naples , where , as has been said , " it is reduced to rule and recognized by public opinion . " It originated in Italy , no doubt , from a feeling of the inadequacy of legal tribunals to avenge personal wrongs , and from the fact that such wrongs were of an artificial character , and not to be righted by any possible judicial proceedings . This matter of personal honor is a curious one , and might repay discussion if there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a feeling of family honor , and feuds thus become hereditary ; while if a woman be seduced , the duty of revenging the wrong falls upon the nearest male relative . Though the violence of the Italian vendetta has been considerably reduced , it is said that in Naples several persons are found daily stabbed in the streets . Not one of them perhaps has been robbed ; the killing has been purely a matter of personal vengeance . The assassin , too , is protected by a popular sentiment which would make it infamous for any person to give evidence against him . Even when a victim has been wounded and recovers , though he knows very well who was his assailant , he never denounces him . His lips are sealed by an unwritten code . In many cases fair warning is given the offender . The whole bloody irregularity is most regularly conducted , and the very beggars who assassinate do so with a chivalry which contrasts strangely with their barbarism . This , then , is comparatively an elevated form of assassination . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party may not be taken unawares . The vendetta in this country , not only upon the frontier , but in civilized towns and cities , has some of the cunning treachery of the aboriginal tribes . Its victims are shot down suddeuly in the street , in their own homes , in the corridors of hotels , in the carriages of railways , on the exchanges , or while they are traveling alone upon the highway . He who knows that he has , by any violation of an extra-judicial code , made himself amenable to this method of revenge , may well walk in fear and trembling . Often it happens that men must live in a kind of mutual fear . When Fisk // was shot in New York it was by one who thought that Fisk intended to shoot him . The looseness , the uncertainty , the recklessness , the possible misapprehension of this form of vengeance , apart from higher considerations , is its condemnation . To this we must add its radical inequity . The assassin proceeds , it must be admitted , upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such value to a man as his life , and there is good reason why we should pray to be delivered from sudden death . Capital punishment , which we often regard as necessary for the sake of example , may or may not be best defended logically from that point of view ; but it rests upon something higher - upon the intrinsically precious character of life itself . The Mosaic code , so often quoted in defense of the gallows , was based upon this . Those who shed man 's blood must give their own as the ouly adequate reparation . This alone was right . This alone could satisfy the demands of justice . This alone could be pleasing in the sight of the All-Just . Strangely mixed up with wrath for the loss of honor , with a feeling of having been cheated at cards , with disappointment at the adverse termination of a lawsuit , with anger at the application of opprobrious epithets , at the loss of *i wife , at the ruin of a daughter , is this recognition , even by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To take it from an enemy is the only revenge worth having . In that way , and in that only , can the fierce feud be adjusted . It may seem paradoxical , but we are obliged to confess that in. this feeling of the value of life , entertained by those who would most recklessly and rashly destroy it , we find the highest hope of a mitigation , if not an abolition , of the evil which we have been discussing . By a parity of reasoning , those who think that the unlawful taking of life is the highest revenge which is within their power , may all the more certainly be brought to a sense of their own error when they find that society agrees with them in their estimate , and will expect them upon the gallows to abide by it . With every homicide unpunished life grows cheaper and cheaper , so far as facility of vengeance is concerned , and yet more and more important as murder becomes safer and safer . The business of our tribunals is to raise it in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are appointed and juries are impaneled . For this prisons are built , gallows erected , and the whole machinery of the criminal courts put in motion . When we talk of the duty of making // life safe , we mean that it should be made not merely valuable but valued . In newly settled aud sparsely populated territories the progress toward a regular administration of justice must be necessarily slow , but it ought not to be so in an educated and religious community , or in States which have behind them the social culture of centuries . It ought not to be so where courts of law have been long established , and where provision for the punishment of crime has been long upon the statute book . There is nothing about which so much nonsense is uttered as Trial by Jury , but the fact remains that it is a thoroughly artificial method , based upon a condition of the race which no longer exists , and absurd in many of its technical provisions . What was meant for a small neighborhood , of identical interests , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different conditions . But , whatever its deficiencies , it is the best we have or are likely to have . Our trust therefore must be in juries more intelligent and conscientious and courageous . At best , selected by chance , they are merely representative . They may be no better and no worse than the community from which they are drawn . To this community we must look for that elevated sense of justice which will not ti*fie with grave matters nor regard outrageous verdicts with complacency . Let us hope , as the body politic is not incapable of improvement , and change for the better not impossible , that we shall not look in vain ! There is , indeed , another side of the question . Sometimes , when the inefficiency of the courts has frightened the public into a serious apprehension for life and property , there is a sudden revolt against the danger of a chronic maladministration of law . It is a mixed Theling , partly of indignation at the perversion of the forms of criminal procedure and partly of personal fear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A murder had been committed for the purpose of robbery . The prisoner had again and again confessed his guilt . Through the cunning and adroitness of criminal lawyers he was found guilty merely of manslaughter , and there was a reasonable suspicion that the jury had been corrupted . Moreover , it was painfully evident that , through the frequent miscarriage of justice , murder had become a common crime in Cincinnati , and the evidence of this was plain enough when in the jail of that city there were not less than twenty-three persons either capitally // convicted or awaiting trial for a capital offense . It was not strange , therefore , that the most respectable citizens should . assemble to consult together concerning the common safety . The meeting , under the circumstances , may have been a mistake , but if so , it was temperate , lawful , and orderly . Nothing was said which could have incited a mob if the public feeliug had not been already aronsed . What followed- the destruction of life and of public property , and the lamentable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first impulse is unsparingly to condemn the mob , but after uttering all our platitudes about the sacredness of the law , we begin to cast about for excuses and extenuations which shall make the popular crime a virtuous sort of misdemeanor . In proof of this we have only to refer to the newspapers , which always keep as near as possible to popular opinion . All the editorial comments which we have seen have been a see-saw between censure of the jury which gave Bender his life , and of the mob which would have taken it in defiance of the law . It is hard that tribunals which the State has established for the vindication of the statutes , and to which the majority yield a cheerful obedience , should thus betray it into a gross and dangerous inconsistency . Nothing could be more melancholy , and nothing better calculated to arouse our profoundest fear . Law should not only be just and certain , but it should also be strong , imperative , and even despotic . When its administrators become weak , hesitating , careless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose , but it beguiles the community , actuated by the best of motives , into the perpetration of offenses against its own majesty . We may regret ; we may condemn ; but we ought not to be surprised . The honest and well-meaning and peaceable feel that they have been betrayed . Their ideas of right and wrong become hopelessly confused . They cease to reason . All their civilization can not save them from going back to barbarism . They are ready to do wrong that good may come of it - the very worst fallacy which can mislead one man or many . But while we can keep no terms with their frenzy , while we have no resource but to treat them for the time being as wild beasts , it is fair that we should remember the reason of their aberration , and provide as well as possible against the recurrence of such lunacy . Two figures will occur to every rational thinker . The one is of Justice standing calm , mild , but inexorable , governed by // immutable principles of right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not deceived by chicanery , and unmoved by the baser temptations . The other is of Justice , still bearing the name , and still wearing the ermine , however soiled and bedraggled , false to all the traditions of the temple which it desecrates , ready to be bought , easily deceived , reckless in its decisions , thoughtless of the consequences of its shortcomings - a weak , inefficient , tottering , and distorted caricature of the Themis to whom ancient and modern times have looked for peace , prosperity , and progress , and have seldom looked in vain . There is no safety for us except in courts which will bring us back to this old reverence , and especially there is no safety in suffering ourselves to be misled by our very virtues ; since riots are only a reappearance of the same evil under a new and less manageable form .
