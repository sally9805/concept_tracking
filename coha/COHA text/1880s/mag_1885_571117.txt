ARTICLE VII. - PROHIBITION NOT DESIRABLE . PROHIBITION is very generally assumed to be in theory the most perfect method of suppressing drnnkenness and the most advanced temperance legislation . Many reformers join in its praise who yet do not attempt it in practice , fearing that its enforcement would be impossible as above the moral standard of their communities . The reality and possibility of enforcing it are the points of anxious dispute . The previous question , whether successful prohibition would be desirable , has not been much discussed . When the Maine law was adopted more than thirty years ago , the writer did what he could to secure a similar law in Connecticut . The simplicity of the new plan of reform made it seem like a bright discovery . Total abstinence which had been the salvation of multitudes , but had been unwisely rejected by many , would become compulsory and universal . The law was passed . His faith in its excellence continued after he had seen it become a dead letter . But later observation and reflection have brought about the belief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of government , in the relation of individuals to each other , and in the exercise of responsibility that we are better off without it . This disapproval does not apply to all that is called prohibition , but only to that combination of laws that is supposed to be indispensable to successful prohibition . Prohibition is a recent **25;513;TOOLONG are a new party . To prohibit from getting drunk , to prohibit from selling to a drunkard or to a child , to prohibit reckless or immoral men from selling at all , are old laws , tried and approved a hundred years ago . But States with these laws are not called prohibitory States . Prohibition alliances are not formed to adopt and enforce these laws , laws which temperate drinkers sometimes support in hearty union with teetotalers . In the new prohibition teetotalers turn their gnus on temperate drinkers themselves . // The prohibition now to be considered is such prohibition of alcoholic liquors as makes it impossible for even the temperate to procure them for a beverage . Of course such a law , like every other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some exceptions of little importance . With these limitations the essential characteristic of a prohibitory law is that it prevents the procuring of liquors . That the friends of prohibition use the term in this sense may be further illustrated . In States where the law of local option happily prevails many towns have banished from their territory the saloons with their temptations to the thirsty and the social , the young and unwary , with their offensive smells and sights , their noise and rowdyism . But men who will drink can get all they wish by going or sending a few miles . In these towns there is prohibiting , but not prohibition with a capital P , not what prohibitionists seek , at least not the prohibition now to be considered . In the State of Iowa for many years the sale of all intoxicating liquors was prohibited except wine and beer which each town could act upon for itself . But most Iowa people lived where they could obtain whiskey in twenty-four hours by express from a neighboring State . This law can be called prohibitory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not only taken away all local option , but have also provided for the punishment of any person who " shall knowingly bring within this State for any other person except importers from foreign countries and licensed dealers " any intoxicating liquors . " It was claimed that without this law against importation prohibition was not complete , and so it is plain what its Iowa advocates include in the idea . Some prohibitionists may shrink from such stringency and feel that it should not be charged on their system . That some of the chief benefits they expect* can be secured as well or better without it , we do not doubt ; but the only prohibition whose merits we care to discuss is that which takes away the temperate man 's liberty of obtaining liquor as a beverage . Such an operation works serious evils . * " This is what the temperance men of Kansas are aiming at , and what they mean to accomplish  --  to close the open saloon , which is an open threat and an open nuisance . " - Rev . Richard Cordley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sept. , 1 . One evil of prohibition would be that it might prevent a man from regulating his food and drink according to his own best judgment . The combination which one constitution requires may be suitable to no other . " What is one man 's food is another man 's poison . " Men differ in wisdom about diet as about everything else* but every man has means of judging of what is best for himself which no one else possesses . Appetite is given not only to stimulate him to eat and drink* but to guide him in his choice . Besides , each man has a special interest in choosing what is best for himself . It is he that is to have the health or the pain , the lengthened or shortened life caased by his diet , and he for this reason should be free to make his own choice . That choice , to be sure , may seriously affect the happiness of others , as may one 's choice of abode , occupation or recreation , and therefore friends may rightly use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice ought to be heeded , where the wisdom of the world and the golden rule of the Christian alike seem to require the self-denial of perpetual abstinence from some attractive article of food or drink , it is safer to let him do wrong , than to go counter to what most will admit as a sound general rule . The total interests of the whole people will be best promoted if each man 's course in such matters is finally decided by himself rather than by his neighbor . Take an example . Gladstone says that he can do hard bodily work with no drink but water , but he finds a glass of wine necessary for his best mental work . A friend who thinks him mistaken may ask him to try the experiment of mental labors on a cold-water diet , but ought to be satisfied if Gladstone should reply that he ha8 tried , and is now too busy to repeat experiments with a body which he has lived in for seventy years , and has become well acquainted with . No man is infallible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigor , whose opinion is authority with millions , is the best person , in office or out , to decide how to treat his own body . Prohibition would deprive him of this privilege , power and duty , and would so far do harm . // from the nature of the act forbidden . ( a ) Both parties to a sale , the seller and the buyer , consent to it and are interested to prevent interference . Quite different is an act of robbery , where the party robbed would often be glad to serve gratis as sheriff , judge or executioner . Even in gambling , the successful player is often afraid of being betrayed by the loser . ( 6 ) In the ordinary sale of liquor there is no third party who feels his rights invaded . In the unlawful sale of patented articles the holder of the patent furnishes the motive power to start and keep in action the machinery of the law . ( c ) The sale of liquor is limited to no place , but may occur wherever the parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes place only on the frontier and yet requires an army to suppress . ( d ) It is not limited to any time , as ballot-box stuffing to election days , or as the discharge of dangerous fireworks , which is little to be feared except on Fourth of July or Christmas . Not only is the sale from its very nature easy of concealment , but a strong and sometimes depraved appetite brings it eager protectors , if the supply of liquor is endangered . Prohibition advocates say that it is almost past belief what arts and inventions are used to baffle the search of the police . Places the most private have to be watched and searchedbed-rooms , partition walls , chimneys , wells , cemetery vaults , hearses . The desperate resolve to have the prohibited article calls for alertness and ceaseless vigilance in the pursuit . To enforce universal prohibition we should therefore expect beforehand would require great governmental power . Of the ten States which attempted it from 1851 to 1855 , in five it is said that the laws were declared unconstitutional by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sonic friends of the law to the strong appetite or corrupt sympathy of the judges . But a truer interpretation is that such repressive law naturally leads to government operations and methods of a sort which the English race have found dangerous and hurtful through generations and centuries ; against which therefore our careful forefathers set barriers in their constitutions and bills of rights . The New York prohibitory law was held by the court to interfere with what is essential to the idea of property and therefore to violate rights guaranteed by the // Constitution . In Kansas where the law has been sustained , the Supreme Court said in reference to a manufacturer of liquor , " The legislature has probably gone a long way in destroying the values of such kinds of property as the defendant owned , and has possibly gone to the utmost verge of constitutional authority . " Such is the adverse criticism that the courts of justice are forced to make . The prohibitory laws , moreover , are made stringent by many unusual requirements and severe penalties . The Kansas law , 1882 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who shall manufacture , or aid in the manufacture of any spirituous , malt , vinous , fermented or other intoxicating liquors except for specified purposes . " The giving away of intoxicating liquors , or any shifts or device to evade the provisions of this act , shall be deemed an unlawful selling within the provisions of this act . " " If any county attorney shall fail or refuse to faithfully perform any duty imposed on him by this act , he shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor , " and on conviction " shall be deemed to be removed from office . " Similar penalties impend over " all sheriffs , under-sheriffs , deputy-sheriffs , constables , marshals and police officers of cities and towns . " An amendment , approved March 7 , 1885 , provides that in prosecutions under this law a witness shall not be excused from testifying " by reason of his testimony tending to criminate himself ( the witness ) , but the testimony given by such persons shall in no case be used against him . " It does not appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rape , forgery or murder . The law of Iowa ( 1884 ) imposes a fine of $50 for the first , and $300 for the second offence upon any one who sells liquor " on any pretense , or by any device , " without first procuring a certificate signed by a majority of the legal electors of his township , town or ward , and a permit from the county supervisors , and giving a bond for three thousand dollars . A person who has complied with these conditions will forfeit one hundred dollars ( half of it to the informer ) to be recovered on his bond with costs , if he shall fail within five days from the last Satur* day of every month to make a return " showing the kind and quantity of the liquors purchased by him since the date of his // last report , the price paid , and the amount of freights paid on the same ; also the kind and quantity of liquors sold by him since the date of his last report , to whom sold , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and quantity of liquor remaining on band . " These restrictions on the sale of alcoholic drinks as medicines were adopted to make prohibition successful . The great force which prohibition calls for can not be defended on the plea of necessity . True , great perils may call for great powers , and extreme force in governing is sometimes justified by emergencies . In a great crisis some free nations have committed absolute powers to a dictator . Nor do they repent , though when it is over and they hasten to restore the precious things that have been shaken or thrown down , they have to toil long and painfully against the evil consequences of the necessary shock . But intemperance is not like slavery or monarchy which can be overthrown by one mighty paroxysm , but like covetousness or slander , an evil likely to last till the millennium . New-born millions of the race will continue to crave stimulus till Evolution brings a new variety of the species . A law to check intemperance should not be patterned after what is tolerated only in a national spasm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good government . It should not demand the exercise of powers , of which our forefathers were deeply and wisely in dread . The continued tension of government authority , without which prohibition can not succeed , is an injury to the commonwealth and a menace to liberty . 3 . Successful prohibition brings annoyance to a large number of citizens and makes a hurtful breach in the community . The language of some prohibitionists seems to show that they misconceive who their real opponents are . They emphasize the fact that it is only the sale of liquor that is prohibited , and not its purchase , as if buying could continue where there was no selling . They talk of making war on the saloons ,  --  of the audacity of a few thousand saloon-keepers who defy the authority of a great State . The truth is that the sellers of liquor are but a small part of the opposition-only the scouts and sutlers of the besieged garrison . The force which prohibitionists are // trying to keep on short rations is the vast host besides who are neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own temperate use . The number that drink liquor is not given in the census , but it can be estimated accurately enough for the present purpose . In Iowa a vote was taken on a prohibitory amendment in 1882 , which probably shows pretty nearly the ratio of nondrinkers to drinkers , 155,000 to 125,000 . That is , in every hundred voters forty-five nse liquor . If one-tenth of these are intemperate and as many more are liquor sellers , there remain still thirty-six voters in a hundred , or 100,000 in Iowa , who have heretofore exercised the right of procuring liquors with very little restraint . It is upon them now that the new law lays a heavy hand . They have not attempted to make teetotalers drink , but they choose to drink themselves and perhaps to recommend it to others . The arguments for total abstinence they do not accept , its benefits they do not appreciate or are willing to forego . Some of them have been often urged to give up liquor , but on the whole have preferred to use it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their chosen beverage . It is an attempt to change by force the habits of freemen , after having failed to persuade them by reason . The force is not applied in only a single act , but by a prolonged repression . The hundred and twenty-five thousand are to have their appetite disappointed many , many times , some of them daily or even several times a day . No reflections on the majesty of the law will make them coSperate in coercing themselves , or look without indignation on the hundred and fifty-five thousand gentlemen who are applying the heroic treatment . To unite with their oppressors in any matters which require cordial concurrence will be , if not impossible , at least too disagreeable a task for men of average sensibility . The prohibition majority , on the other hand , will feel themselves crowded from their originally benevolent attitude to one of hostility . For a time they may consider themselves triumphant and act accordingly. * Some of them are human enough * " To THE SALOON KEEPERS AND LIQUOR DEALERS OF IOwA : Gentlemen-The temperance people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of July , 1882 , desire to call your attention to // to be amused at their neighbors ' waste of labor , thought and expense to get their accustomed drinks . Like wanton boys that ring door bells , and steal gates and signs , they are tickled at the annoyance they make . Many are really surprised at the immediate magic of the law . It seems to work of itself . The public standard of morality has been raised . There is no more license . Incidentally prohibitionists and their allies have risen into places of political trust and power . Why should they not rejoice ? But after a time difficulties arise . One hundred thousand men wish to continue drinking liquor , a practice not against the law but obnoxious to prohibitionists as frustrating its purpose . Leaders arise among the malcontents , encouraged by pecuniary , social and political motives . A disposition to resist and evade the law provokes combination for its enforcement . Fancying and compromise are denounced . Discipline is established , and to a certain extent the community becomes two camps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hostility will be only temporary because it seems so unreasonable . For most of those who drink liquor admit that it is no necessity of their life , however pleasant they may consider it , or healthful or necessary for their highest usefulness . They can find substitute drinks , nutritious or refreshing , warming or cooling , tonic or acid . The human body easily adapts itself to a new diet . It is hoped that the results of the law will be so plainly beneficial that all opposition will in time be overborne , and a better educated generation will as a whole be total abstainers and without desire to drink what it is unlawful to buy . But this hope of Prohibitionists does not have solid ground to rest upon . Experience does not justify it . It is true that the progress of total abstinence in the United States has been remarkable , both in the numbers that have adopted it and for the change they have produced in public opinion as to alcoholic drinks . But if that progress had been likely to continue we might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain facts . . . The decision is with you . We hold out to you the olive branch of peace , fair and honorable alike on this one supreme condition , that the manufacture and sale of intoxicating beverages shall cease . " // keep on with the means and methods that had been successful so far , until the expected reform had become complete . Prohibition was attempted , not from mere caprice nor from simple impatience at the earlici ' rate of progress , but becanse its advocates were convinced that their system would not be adopted more widely without resorting to constraint . Their conviction was probably sound . It is likely that for an indefinite period the number of men will continue large who will drink liquor , if they can get it , notwithstanding its evils and dangers , and in disregard of all the influences that teetotalers can exert . The processes of reform then known by experience did not have force enough to change the habits of the whole community . By the new method of prohibition a little further change may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is manifested and the regular use of it becomes substantially impossible , it is reasonable to expect that some individuals , especially those of weak appetites and weak wills , may accept the principles of total abstinence . But most men , feeling that their choice of food and drink is not rightly subject to the constraint of government , are made more stubborn by a show of compulsion . What they thought proper to do before , they will be proud to do now whenever there is opportunity . The occasional chances which no law can be expected to prevent will enable them to cherish the appetite themselves and teach it to their successors . However extensive and agreeable their intercourse may in time become with the prohibition majority , a special tie of sympathy will bind the lovers of liquor by themselves , as the colored people of our Southern States have been united by the sense of common wrongs . Whether hoping that prohibitionists will grow weary of watching their neighbors , or hopeless that the law will ever be repealed , they will remain a discontented and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closely limiting their supply of liquor . This hostile division will keep the community weak . The party strife which attends an election is one of the perils of a free people . Through all the excitement , how ever , of a political campaign , it is a relief to think that it will soon be over and the hostile sides be friendly again . And if the // heat sometimes overstays a while , the sober men of the community appeal to the alienated combatants to let by-gones be by-gones , while they work together again for the suffering interests of business or the church . " The land needs rest . " But a prohibitory campaign brings no such rest . The growth of good feeling would lead to toleration and break down the law . The State where prohibition is enforced under popular government will be divided and weakened by a perpetual political campaign and irreconcilable factions . 4 . It is a further evil that successful prohibition will wear away reverence for the forms and the administration of law . The demoralization which has followed every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being resisted and nullified . But the trouble really lies in the law itself , as may be seen in other instances . The enforcement of passport laws in Europe or of game laws in England may inspire citizens with fear , but it intensifies disrespect for the law , and hence for the machinery and officers which sustain it . So to the freeman whose wish to purchase liquor is perpetually thwarted by a prohibitory law , it becomes an engine of oppression . IBis feelings may be realized by anti-slavery men who remember how they felt toward the oppressive Fugitive Slave Law . The friends of that law defended it as carrying out the will of the sovereign people , expressed in the sacred Constitution . It was the law of the land , accepted by both political parties . Men who disliked it were advised to conquer their prejudices ; those who resisted it were denounced on the platform and condemned from the pulpit . It was enforced at the point of the bayonet . But , oh ! how deeply it weakened the reverence for United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counteract the operation of the law , to baffle its officers and evade its penalties . Tricks , dissembling and equivocations were applauded . Every failure in attempting to enforce it lighted up ten thousand faces with joy , and drew thanksgiving from cheerful , grateful hearts . Men who did not want to hurt a United States officer , would yet trip him up when chasing a runaway . To be a United States Marshal was no honor . Reverence for law and its administration and officers was sensibly weakened in the community . // So with the hundred and twenty-five thousand citizens of Iowa who now wish to purchase liquor . They have an interest in learning how the law may be evaded . It is their only way to get an occasional draft of " wine that maketh glad the heart of man . " When they see a person prosecuted for selling , they recognize him , however sordid his character , as having incurred danger to supply a want they feel . The man who sells is in a certain sense their servant , their minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discrediting of the law , a reluctance of individuals to prosecute , a willingness on the part of magistrates to dismiss suits , miscarriage from any cause will be construed as a sign of coming freedom and therefore be hailed with joy . Those who indulge such feelings may not appreciate how they are weakening respect for righteous law or they may consider their feelings justifiable notwithstanding . The friends of prohibition , too , in their natural indignation are liable to overlook the greatness of the moral harm caused in their vexed fellow citizens . It deserves however the most serious estimate as an evil sure to come with successful prohibition . Other laws may cross individuals , but prohibition irritates neighborhoods and communities , and thus weakens that general reverence for law which is the chief support of order in a free people . 5 . A fifth objection to prohibition is the encouragement it would give to the misuse of government powers . The community which forcibly suppresses alcoholic drinks will sooner or later be agitated by attempts to suppress other articles . A benevolent object will always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many , but selfish interests will soon be at work , even if they are not the prime movers . When men deny the right of an individual to decide on his own food and drink , it will be natural for manufacturers and dealers to seek for legislation against substitutes for their wares . Farmers of England and of New England decry Chicago beef . Butter dealers are against oleomargarine . Sugar planters curse sorghum and glucose . A hue and cry can be raised on grounds of health and morals against even these articles-still more readily against tobacco , opium , chloral , alcoholic medicines , tea , coffee , or ice-water . In fact there is scarcely anything // which man enjoys but is obnoxious to somebody , and liable under some circumstances to be assailed by a crusade of force . By a little skillful management , interested ( or disinterested ) persons could persuade the majority who disapprove of any article to combine and pass a prohibitory law. * One year of the law might be long enough to repay and enrich its authors . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law of the kind were kept in force as that for the suppression of liquor . In vain would reformers appeal to the old maxim that the world is governed best when governed least . The disposition lately shown in our country to exalt the interests of the community above the rights of the individual is just occasion for alarm . Communism has its advocates and is making converts . For it is not a mere system of confiscation and plunder , though such may be its issue and some demagogues may have adopted it in that hope . But it has a philanthropic aim which dazzles its talented leaders . The most calm and prudent of them expect to operate through a process of prohibition . The letting of property and the loan of money on interest they declare to be privileges which have been abused : so also manufacturing and selling and other operations . They would therefore prohibit all private individuals from these employments and have the government undertake them without competition . The following would do for one of their prohibitory laws . " No one except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any article whatever . " Such revolutionary views make slow progress here , for they meet on every side a spirit jealous of encroachment on individual rights . " Our liberties we prize and our rights we will maintain . " " Inalienable rights " have been the golden shields of America . The advocates of prohibition are inclined to depreciate and circumscribe rights . They ridicule " the so-called personal-lib * A law against oleomargarine has already passed the New York legislature , providing that " no person . . . shall manufacture out of any oleaginous substance . . . any article designed to take the place of butter or cheese , . . . or shall sell . . . the same as an article of food . " But the Court of Appeals unanimously decided it unconstitutional , saying , June 16 , 1885 , " It invades rights , both of person and property , guaranteed by the Constitution . " // erty claims . " It is no violation of right , they say , to keep liquor from a man , for it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communist takes up a similar strain , and uses their arguments , catch-words , and phrases for his own cause . He too has much to say of the welfare of society , and argues as follows : " Manufacturing has caused untold evil , making the haughty owners rich and hard-hearted and the workmen slavish and wretched . No one has a right to produce evil , and therefore no one has a right to manufacture . The right of the individual ceases where the right of society begins . No one can claim the right to manufacture or sell for his own support , for he can support himself by work on the government farms or in the pablic factories . The pursuit of happiness ' is not a right against the will of the majority , and when the State has declared private manufacturing or trading unlawful , it is the duty of every honest man to obey and enforce the law . Society can make no compromise with rebels . " Much of the above talk of communists is true in itself , and would justify communism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful , will hold up to view a political process which the shrewdest communists will admire and teach their followers to imitate . The machinery of free government is so constructed that excess of action at one part may derange others which at first sight appear quite detached . It is one of the great arts of the law maker and statesman in carrying out his good designs to observe a scrupulous regard to the rights of every individual . He who scoffs at claims of liberty is a dangerous leader. * No human government is expected to repress all wrongs , but when it becomes a trespasser itself , it sets a mischievous example . Better leave the individual with means to do some wrong than to oppress him even a little . Freedom is a noble thing , * Statements like the following used to come from enemies of emancipation : " The social fabric rests upon the principle that the individual has not a right to demand that anything shall be done which society judges to be prejudicial to the common good . " - Rev . Dawson Burns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right of society is self-protection . Hence all this talk about natural rights , ' and personal liberty , ' and sumptuary laws is sentimental nonsense . " - IOWa Correspondent of Chicago Advance , Dec. 4 , 1884. // and we may bear some evils with it rather than make its great blessings less secure . Great as are the evils of intemperance , the antidotes are many and powerfuL To mix with them an element of oppression may poison widely our social relations and our political life . The benefits likely to follow prohibition have been so freely published by its friends that they need not be repeated . Our review of the necessary means and result of enforcing it , goes to show that it costs too much . A free Christian people is entitled to more good at a lower price . Prohibition subverts the established order of nature that every freeman should be free to direct his own diet of drink as well as of meat . It aims to prevent multitudes of intelligent , moral , and temperate men from using their chosen drink except by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes it impossible for them to cooperate in punishing intemperance without interfering with their own lawful indulgence . This is not wise nor right . In depriving temperate men of alcoholic beverages it is a misuse of the powers of government , a breach of the good understanding which must prevail in a truly free State . Prohibition , as we have defined it , is not a temperance advance , but an unfortunate backward movement , returning again to obsolete and despotic methods of government at a time when speculators and communists want an apology for doing the same . If our reasoning is right and prohibition is not desirable , the question may arise , What improvement ; if any , can be made in temperance laws ? None , we fear , for a long time . For after the oppressive element of prohibition is eliminated , its memory will remain for evil , and all effective legislation will for a while be discredited . The attempt to suppress the purchase of liquor has united all its users for self-defence under the leadership of the trade . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discreet control will at length be resumed with the general approval . Regulations will vary as circumstances vary , and will be enforced with varying strictness . Probably no public drinking rooms will be allowed except in a few peculiar localities . The practice of delivering goods at customers ' houses has in recent times become so common that it may be made obligatory on sellers of liquor . Repeated // drunkenness will bring on the offender longer and longer periods of confinement , in asylums rather than in prison . Penalties will be inflicted for recklessness in drinking , as by men on duty , army officers , policemen , engineers , and legislators . Whatever guards may be adopted to protect men of diseased appetites against temptation , will be such as the users of liquor generally assent to . Where a saloon is left open , its cnstomers will help to guard against some of its evils . But laws will not be framed to accomplish what should be done by other agencies , if done at all . If the mass of men become total abstainers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reformers will study how to persuade them . Ministers will preach , and the Christian church will labor , against intemperance as long , as faithfully and as successfully as against Sabbath-breaking , covetousness , laziness , and falsehood.
