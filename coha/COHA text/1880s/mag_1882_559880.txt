ON the 27th of November , 1862 , a court-martial was convened in the city of Washington , for the trial of Major-General Fitz John Porter , of the volunteer force . The court consisted of nine members and a judge-advocate ,  --  the Judge-AdvocateGeneral of the Army . The charges against General Porter were : First . Disobedience of orders under the 9th Article of War . Second . Misbehavior before the enemy under the 52d Article of War . Under the first charge there were three specifications of which the court found Porter guilty . These were , substantially : First . Disobedience to the order of August 27th , requiring him to march from Warrenton Junction at one o'clock on the morning of the twenty-eighth and be at Bristoc Station by daylight . Second . Disobedience on August 29th , while in front of the enemy , to the joint order to McDowell and Porter , directing them to march toward Gainesville and establish communication with the other corps . Third . Disobedience on August 29th , w1*e in front of the enemy , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ *ii YOrder , " requiring Porter to attack the enemy's flank and rear . Under the second charge the specifications upon which Porter was tried and convicted were , in substance : First . Shameful disobedience to the 4.30 p. * Order on August 29th , while in sight of the field and in full hearing of its artillery ; and retreat from advancing forces of the enemy , without attempting to engage them or to aid the troops who were fighting greatly superior numbers , and who would have secured a decisive victory and captured the enemy 's army , but for Porter 's neglect to attack and his shameful disobedience . Second . Failure of Porter all that day to bring his forces on the field when within sound of the guns and in presence of the // enemy , and knowing that a severe action of great consequence was being fonght , and that the aid of his corps was greatly needed ; and his shameful falling back and retreat from the advance of unknown forces of the enemy without attempting to give them battle . Third . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a severe action was being fought , to go to the aid of General Pope 's troops , when he believed that they were being defeated and were retiring from the field ; and his shameful retreat away and falling back under these circumstances , leaving the army to the disasters of a presumed defeat ; and failure , by any attempt to attack the enemy , to aid in averting a disaster which would have endangered the safety of the capital . These are the accusations that were made against General Porter for his part and failure in the battles generally known as those of the second Bull Run campaign . The court found him guilty of the charges and specifications . If he was so guilty , the punishment awarded was not commensurate with the offense committed . I believe lawyers have taken exception to the formation of the court and to some of its technical rulings ; but neither at the time nor since has General Porter attempted to evade the consequences of his acts by any special pleading , or by taking advantage of any technical error @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its being ordered , but has relied entirely upon his innocence of all the charges and specifications , and would not be satisfied with an acquittal on any other ground than that of his entire innocence . It will be seen from the foregoing that General Porter 's alleged misconduct was embraced in three separate cases of disobedience of orders : one on the 27th of August , and two on the 29th of August ; and iu having retreated unnecessarily from the enemy , by that act endangering other portions of the army with which he was cooperating . It will be seen that , though these offenses were alleged to have been committed in August of 1862 , he was continued in the command of an army corps until some time in November following , taking an active part in the battles of the day following the date of the last charge , and in command of the defenses of Washington on the west bank of the Potomac , and also at the battle of Antietam , some weeks later . It would look at first very singular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his duty as General Porter was alleged to have // been on the 27th and 29th of August , should have been continued in so important a place as the command of an army corps , when so much was at stake as there was on the 30th of August , and in the defenses of Washington , and in the later battles in Maryland , when the invasion of the North was threatened . These facts would indicate to an unprejudiced mind that the charges against Porter were an after-thought , to shift the responsibilities of failure from other shoulders and to place them upon him . In regard to his disobedience of the order of the 27th of August , he is alleged to have without justification deferred his march from Warrenton Junction to Bristoe Station from one o'clock until three of the morning of the 28th . It was about ten o'clock on the night of the 27th when Porter received the following order : " HEAD-QUARTERS ARMY OF VIRG*IA , " BRISTOR STATION , August 27 , 1862 , 6.30 r* LI . " Gr*NuRAL : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and come forward with your whole corps , or such part of it as is with you , so as to be here by daylight to-morrow morning . Hooker has had a very severe action with the enemy , with a loss of about three hundred killed and wounded . The enemy has been driven back , but is retiring along the railroad . We must drive him from Manassas , and clear the country between that place and Gainesville , where McDowell is . If Morell has not joined you , send word to him to push forward immediately ; also send word to Banks to hurry forward with all speed to take your place at Warrenton Junction . It is necessary , on all accounts , that you should be here by daylight . I send an officer with this dispatch , who will conduct you to this place . Be sure to send word to Banks , who is on the road from Fayetteville , probably in the direction of Bealton . Say to Banks , also , that he had best run back the railroad trains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not with you , write him to that effect . " By command of Major-General Pope , " GEORGE D. RUGGLES , " Colonel and Chief-of-Staff . " Major-General F. J. Porter , Warrenton Junction . " P. 5 . If Banks is not at Warrenton Junction , leave a regiment of infantry and two pieces of artillery as a guard till he comes up , with instructions to follow you immediately . If Banks is not at the Junction , instruct Colonel Claryto run the trains back to this side of Cedar Run , and post aregiment and section of artillery with it . " By command of Major-General Pope . " GEORGE D. RUGGLES , " Colonel and Chief-of-Staff . " His troops had been marching all day , were very much fatigued , some of them only having just arrived in camp and had their supper , when the order to march at one o'clock was received . The night , as shown in the testimony before the court // which tried Porter , and as confirmed by the evidence given in what was known as the Schofield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with numerous cuts and streams passing through it ; bounded by woods on both sides in many places , with no place where the open country could be taken for the march of troops ; and blocked up with about two thousand army wagons , many of them mired in the narrow road , so that the officer who conveyed this order to General Porter was over three hours , on horseback , in making the distance of ten miles . Porter was expected , with fatigued troops , worn with long marches , on scanty rations , to make a march on a very dark night , through a blockaded road , more rapidly than a single aide-de-camp , unineumbered , had been able to get through on horseback . When he received the order , he showed it to his leading generals , and , apparently with one accord , they decided that the movement at that hour was impossible ; further , that no time could possibly be gained by so early a start , and that if they should start at that hour and get through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not be fit for either fighting or marching on their arrival at that point . Porter replied , however , " Here is the order , and it must be obeyed " ; but , after further consultation , he decided , as did his generals , that a postponement of two hours in starting the march would enable them to get through as quick as if the men were kept on foo*t and under arms while the road was being cleared , and that the men would be in a much better condition for service on their arrival at their destination . He was entirely justified in exercising his own judgment in this matter , because the order shows that he was not to take part in any battle when he arrived there , but was wanted to pursue a fleeing enemy . He did not leave the commanding general in ignorance of his proposed delay , nor of the reasons for it , but at once sent a request that the general commanding should send back cavalry ( he had none himself ) and clear the road near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be unobstructed . It is shown that a literal obedience to the order of the 27th of August was a physical impossibility . It is further shown that General Porter was desirous of obeying it literally , so far as was practicable , but was prevailed upon by his leading generals - against whom a suspicion of disloyalty to their commander , or to the cause , has never been entertained - to do what his own judgment approved as the best thing to do  --  to make a // later start with a view of arriving at his destination as early as it was possible for him to arrive there , and to give to his jaded and worn troops two hours more of neeled rest . If the night had been clear and the road an open one , there would not have been as much *justification for the exercise of his discretion in the matter ; but there is no doubt but that he would have arrived at Bristoc Station just as early , and with his troops in much better condition , if he had started at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the intervening time had been used in clearing the road for his troops when they did march . Where there were open spaces along the line of the road , they were either marshy , lulled with stumps of trees , and impossible to march over , or were crowded with army wagons , so that the track of his army was limited to the incumbered narrow road between the two points designated in the order , which could be cleared only by the wagons being moved ahead , as requested of Pope . Much of the testimony before the court and before the army board might be quoted to confirm what is here stated ; but as this is all accessible to the reader , I will not lengthen this statement by quoting it . I question very much whether there was an engagement during the war , or a series of engagements continuing over as much time as was consumed in the battles about Bull Run in August , 1862 , when not only one , but a number of generals , did not exercise their discretion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less justification . The commanding general who gave the order desired to have the troops at a certain point by daylight , and he gave his orders so as to accomplish that result . Under the circumstances , his order required of the troops an impossibility . That was as evident to Porter , and those with him , before the attempt was made as it was after . It is a little singular that any one high in rank , connected with the Army of Virginia , should be in ignorance of the arrival of at least a portion of Lee 's army , by the very route designated by Pope , many hours before the 4.30 order was published . Porter was not in ignorance of that arrival . Between twelve and one o'clock , on arriving at his advanced position , Porter was shown by McDowell a dispatch from General Buford , sent at 9.30 on the morning of the 29th , stating that from seventeen to eighteen regiments of the enemy had passed through Gainesville three-quarters of an hour before , or at a quarter before nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to re-enforce Jackson , so that the head of the column must have been not only in supporting distance of Jackson , but at the place of deployment by ten o'clock in the morning ; and now it is known by others , as it was known by Porter at the time , that Longstreet , with some twenty-five thousand men , was in position confronting Porter by twelve o'clock on the 29th of August , four hours and a half before the 4.30 order was written . While at the head of their united forces , between twelve and one o'clock , and while Porter was preparing to attack the enemy in his immediate front , McDowell , then in command , showed Porter the " joint order * and also Buford 's dispatch . It was evident from this dispatch , corroborated by the enemy 's movements in their immediate front , that the main forces of the enemy , which the " joint order " said were far distant , had not only arrived , but had formed a junction with Jackson and deployed in their front . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisoners from that force-Longstreet 's troops . The object of moving toward Gainesville had been thus defeated , and any further advance , if practicable , would only the more widely separate them from Pope 's forces then checked at Groveton , at least two miles distant , and with which they were ordered to " establish communication . " McDowell , as he had the right , at once withdrew his troops , leaving Porter with ten thousand men to confront Longstreet 's twenty-five thousand , while he went by a circuitous route to a point between Porter and Pope , to establish the communication enjoined . Thus left alone , facing superior numbers advantageously posted , and ignorant of the needs of Pope , if indeed he had any , Porter had necessarily to bide McDowell 's arrival on his right . In the meantime his duty was manifestly to engage Longstreet 's attention and prevent him from moving against Pope , especially while McDowell was out of support of both Pope and Porter . Porter all that day did not hear of McDowell , or of what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the former wellinformed of affairs with him , and presumed that his dispatches were sent to the latter . He , however , engaged Longstreet*s attention by demonstrations nearly harmless to himself , and so successfully as to cause Longsfreet to take Wilcox 's division from in front of Pope , in order to strengthen the line confronting Porter , who , at the time , was aware of this movement of forces coming from the right to his front , and notified McDowell // of it . Thus Porter , without sacrifice of men , and without endangering any interests , did more for Pope 's relief than if he had gone directly to that general 's assistance . To have done so would probably have sacrificed his corps without any benefit , and jeoparded the safety of Pope 's army . So far as I have investigated the case  --  and I have studied it , I think , pretty thoroughly-I see no fact to base the charge of retreat upon . I do not see that any argument to prove this is necessary , because any reader of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Porter retreated during the time specified . In my judgment , this disposes of the charges , and consequently of all specifications under them , except the alleged disobedience of the 4.30 p M. order . In regard to the charge of disobedience of the 4.30 order7 which is the principal one and the one that has most deeply impressed the mind of the general public , there are evidences which look to me important and conclusive , showing that the court-martial which tried General Porter found him guilty under a mistaken idea of the actual facts , now accessible to any one in search of the truth , and which Porter knew to be the facts at the time . As maintained by the prosecution , to the apparent satisfaction of the court , the situation of the belligerent forces were in numbers and position about as here given : Jaek8oTI , 22,000 men . Pope , 33,000 men . The 4.30 r . M. order of the 29th of August required Porter to attack the enemy 's right flank and to get into his rear , if possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genezol , // and , no doubt , of the court , was Jackson 's force of twenty-two thousand men . Porter was supposed to occupy , with ten thousand troops , the position assigned to him in the diagram given . The court also seems to have been satisfied that the order to make this attack was received by Porter from five to half-past five o'clock in the afternoon , leaving him abundance of time to obey the order . That the commanding general believed the positions as given in the foregoing diagram to be the positions of the different cornmand* is shown from the fact that in his joint order of that morning he stated that " the indications are that the whole force of the enemy is moving in this direction at a pace that will bring them here by to-morrow night or next day , ***that is , the evening of the 30th or the morning of the 31st of August ,  --  and from the fact that in the 4.30 order he stated that " the enemy is massed in the woods in front of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is confirmed in his map No. 5 , furnished to the Government . If these had been the facts of the case , there would have been no justification whatever for Porter 's failing to make the attack as ordered ; but , instead of the facts being as supposed by the commanding general and the court which tried General Porter , they were as shown by the following diagram . This Porter knew on indisputable evidence . 22 , o* vo ? OpO The* As shown by this diagram , Porter was not in a position to attack the right flank of Jackson , because he was at least three miles away , and not across his flank , as shown in the first diagram . With Longstreet 's presence , to have obeyed that order he would have been obliged , with ten thousand men , to have defeated twenty-five thousand men in a chosen position , before he could have moved upon the flank of the enemy , as the order directed . But , even if the position of Lee 's army // had been thirty-six to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to McDowell and Porter , it would have been impossible for Porter to have obeyed the 4.30 order , because it did not contemplate a night attack , and was not received by Porter until about dark . To have obeyed it would have required some little preparation , movement of troops , and distribution of orders , so that it would have been some time after dark before he could have moved from the position he was then occupying , and at least as late as nine o'clock at night before he could have reached Jackson 's flank to engage it . His efforts to execute the order , notwithstanding its apparent inappropriateness , demonstrate this assertion . I consider that these facts , with many more that were brought to the knowledge of the Schofield Board , fuily exonerate General Porter of the charge of disobedience of what is known as the 4.30 order , and also of the imputation of lukewarmness in his support of the commanding general . A great deal that might be said of the movements , the marching and countermarching of troops between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the receipt of the order of the 29th , which would throw light upon this question ; but I abstain from giving it , because I believe that what is stated here covers all the points wherein General Porter has been charged with being delinquent . General Porter has now for twenty years been laboring under the disabilities and penalties inflicted upon him by the court-martial of 1862 , all that time contending for a restoration to his position in the army and in society , and always , as stated in the beginning of this article , on the ground of his entire innocence . The investigation of the Schofield Board has , in my judgment , established his innocence of all the offenses for which he was tried and convicted . The sufferings of twenty years , under such findings , for himself and family and friends , is something it is now impossible to set right . Twenty years of the best part of his life have been consumed in trying to have his name and his reputation restored before his countrymen . In his application now before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restored to the rolls of the army , with the rank that he would have if the court-martial had never been held . This , in my judgment , is a very small part of what it is possible to do in // this case , and of what ought to be done . General Porter should , in the way of partial restitution , be declared by Congress to have been convicted on mistaken testimony , and , therefore , to have never been out of the army . This would make him a major-general of volunteers until the date might be fixed for his muster out as of that rank , after which he should be continued as a colonel of infantry , and brevet brigadier-general of the United States Army from the date of the act , when he could be placed upon the retired list with that rank . In writing what I have here written , I mean no criticism upon the court which tried General Porter , nor upon the officers under whom or with whom he served . It is easy to understand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1862 , when the nation was in great peril , and when the Union troops had met with some severe reverses , how the public were ready to condemn ,  --  to death if need be ,  --  any officer against whom even a suspicion might be raised . For many years , and till within a year , I believed that the position and number of the troops on both sides were as stated in the first diagram given here , and that the order to attack was received at an hour in the day sufficiently early to have made the attack feasible ; and , under that impression , it seemed to me that the enemy , unless through very bad generalship on the Union side , could not have been able to escape while a superior force confronted him and ten thousand men flanked him . But a study of the case not only has convinced me , but has clearly and conclusively established , that the position and numbers of the armies were as given in the second diagram . If a solemn and sincere expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innocence of General Porter will tend to draw the public mind to the same conviction , I shall feel abundantly rewarded for my efforts . It will always be a pleasure to me , as well as a duty , to be the instrument , even in the smallest degree , of setting right any man who has been grossly wronged , especially if he has risked life and reputation in defense of his country . I feel , as stated on a previous occasion , a double interest in this particular case , because , directly after the war , as General of the Army , when I might have been instrumental in having justice done to General Porter , and later as President of *eUnited States , when I certainly could have done so , I labored under the firm conviction that he was guilty ; that the facts of the receipt of the 4.30 order were as found by the court , and that // the position of the troops and numbers were as given in the first of these diagrams . Having become better informed , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give , my earnest efforts to impress the minds of my countrymen with the justice of this case , and to secure from our Government , as far as it could grant it , the restitution due to General Fitz John Porter .
