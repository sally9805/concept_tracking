txt HThe trial of James A. Redden , Cashier of the broken First National Bank of Newark , was concluded to-day by the argument of counsel and the charge of the court , Mr. A. Q. Keasby , the District Attorney , arguing for the Government , and the Hon. George M. Robeson for the defendant . In the charge to the jury , Judge Nixon said that to embezzle implied that the act was of some benefit to the defendant : that to misapply did not carry that meaning . He referred to the charges set forth in the bill of particulars saying that the amount of a misapplication made no difference : it was the act that was the offense , as a misapplication of a hundred dollars or ten dollars was as much the offense as if it was the full amount claimed . As to the Lockwood notes , be charged the jury that the transaction in reference to them did not appear to be a misapplication . As to the certification of the three-thousand-dollar check for Thomas , the court held that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account was good for the amount , and if he did not use the means provided for doing so he was guilty of a misapplication . Anything forbidden by the statute , any use of the funds forbidden by it , was a misapplication . It was his duty to have known that the money was in the bank , and his want of knowledge was no excuse . If this was the law , then the jury could do nothing else than find the defendant guilty . In conclusion , he said he trusted that it would give the whole case an honest and careful consideration . After the Judge had charged one or two points submitted by Mr. Robeson , the jury retired . The District Attorney then arraigned Redden upon another charge of embezzlement in misapplying $16,151 49 on a check given to the Hon. Joel Parker , Receiver of the New-Jersey Mutual Insurance Company , to take up a mortgage . Redden pleaded not guilty , and this trial was set down for Tuesday , May 31 . Bail was fixed at $20.000 on that indictment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pending against Redden , to which he will probably plead guilty on May 31 . The jury , when it came in , brought a verdict of misapplication of the funds of the bank , and not guilty of embezzlement .
