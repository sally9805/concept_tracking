txt On the question of the Cunard Steamship Company 's liability for baggage lost on the Oregon , Chief-Justice David , of the City Court , said last evening : " The carrier across the seas of passengers or merchandise is not an Insurer , and is not therefore liable for any loss of the goods intrusted to his charge without affirmative proof that the loss was occasioned by his fault or neglect . If the collision which caused the Oregon to sink was without any fault or neglect on the part of those in charge of the steamer , there is no responsibility on the owners either for the lose of goods shipped as freight or for passengers ' baggage . If the ship had gone down by the act of God , ' such as a tempest at sea or a stroke of lightning , it is clear that no liability would attach , but as such was not the case with the Oregon , tho question of responsibility hinges upon the determination of the question as to whose fault caused the loss : and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " As a general rule a steamer meeting a sailing vessel must take measures to avoid the latter , which has a right to keep Its course . If therefore , those in charge of the Oregon saw M time the vessel which collided , or if they might have seen it by the exercise of proper care and duo diligence , then the collision was caused by the fault of those in charge of the steamer ; but if , after exercising every care , those on board the Oregon , either by darkness or the fact that by reason of the sailing vessel not carrying proper lights , its presence could not be discovered in time , then , of course , ? those in charge of the steamer were not guilty of fault or neglect . In case of a suit against the owners , it-would be sufficient , in order to establish a prima facie cause of action , to show that the baggage or merchandise was delivered to the steamer on the other side , and that the steamer failed to deliver it here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excusing the non-delivery . The company could only do this by affirmatively proving the fact of the collision and that it occurred without its fault . If it proved this , It would be a valid defense . If it failed to do so , ita owners would be held liable for all losses . "
