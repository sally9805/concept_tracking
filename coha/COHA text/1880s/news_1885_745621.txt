txt Two Yale Juniors , Victor Brush Caldwell and Warren Samuel Yates , both of Omaha , Neb. , went tout gunning in boats off Stony Creek , 12 miles east of this city yesterday . There was a strong off-shore bieeze which , soon after the men started out , stiffened into a gale . The two hunters were unable to row their boats back to the shore , although Caldwell succeeded in getting upon one of the small Islands of the Thimble group , which lie just off Stony Creek . Yates was not so skilled an oarsman apparently Sound . The gale was blowing with snob force that when Caldwell 's boat struck the island he had not strength enough to hold it . He was barely able to jump to the shore . The boat was washed away and was soon far out upon the tumbling water . As Yates drifted away from the island he lost or broke one of the oars with which he was pulling desperately . People on the mainland followed his course for an hour with glasses . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea , completely at the mercy of wind and waves . The sea was growing rougher as he was lost to sight . With the gale blowing as ? it did when Yates was last seen , he may , provided he keeps his boat from capsizing , be able to reach Long Island , toward which he was drifting . Yates 's father and sister , who happened to be in Brooklyn at the time:of the accident , were summoned to this city . They made inquiries about hiring a tug to go in search for him , but were told that such a search would be useless . Telegrams have been sent to all the Long Island towns asking for any information of the missing man . It is reported here to-night that a search Party is at Port Jefferson , and will begin a search along the shore to-morrow . It is feared that even if Yates 's boat lived through the gale he himself may have died of exposure .
