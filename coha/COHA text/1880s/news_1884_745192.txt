txt On the 7th of August , 1851 , a county convention was held here , which organized in the name of the Republican Party , nominated a full county ticket , and adopted the Republican platform . It is claimed by the people in Franklin County that this convention gave birth to the Republican Party of the United States . The claim is disputed , but surviving members of the convention assert that it was the first to formally adopt the name " Republican " and a distinctively Republican platform . They say no records can be produced to offset theirs , which they have preserved . They celebrated the thirtieth anniversary of the convention to-day . The celebration was postponed from the 7th to the 19th in order not to interfere with other celebrations . The " Baby Railroad , " which connects the village with Lewiston , was taxed to its utmost capacity to carry the crowds , every freight car being used for this purpose . The town was decorated with flags , streamers , and banners , on which were printed the original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blaine and Logan flag , 40 feet long , was raised . The procession was formed at 12:15 to convey the speakers to the grove where the ith exercises were held . Seven Grand Army posts headed the procession . Then followed about 50 of the political veterans who were present as delegates 30 years ago . The exercises were held in the Hardwood Grove on the hillside , where people began to gather as early as 8 o'clock . Nelson Dingley , Jr. , was elected President and made a brief speech , which was principally a review of the birth and career of the Republican Party . He closed with an eulogistic reference to the party 's present candidates . Mr. Blaine , accompanied by Hannibal Hamlin and ex-Gov . Robie , arrived at 2 o'clock , the party being received with enthusiastic cheers . The Hon. Hannibal Hamlin stood erect as a sapling , notwithstanding his extreme age . He spoke with vigor , reviewing the work of the Republican Party , and paid a warm tribute to the value of the work done in : the convention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that veteran to come upon the platform . He was greeted with much enthusiasm , and made a brief speech . Gov . Robie created considerable merriment when he spoke by calling for all in favor of Blaine for President to raise their hands . The whole assembly , apparently , responded . " And now , " continued the Governor , " all those in favor of any one else raise their hands . " One man held ' up his hand amid roars of laughter , whereupon the Governor exclaimed : " May God have mercy on his soul . " Mr. Blaine was then called for , and upon coming forward was received with applause . Re said : FELLOW CITIZENS : The place and the time ' where the Republican Party was first organized will , I presume , remain , like the birthplace of , Homer , a subject of unending dispute . Seven ? cities claimed the latter , and seven States may elaim the former . It could hardly be doubted that ' a great thought common to the minds of a million of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places widely separated : but I : think it is historically true that the patriotic men ' , who met in this town of Strong in 1854 were the pioneers of the great movement which resulted in the organization of the Republican Party . The men of that day builded better than they knew , and initiated a movement whose grandeur ' and whose destiny could not then be measured . , Great parties never come by a whereas and a rule. , Parties can not be improvised or extemporized. : They grow . They come from instinct and the masses of the people , and are not the product of political labors . Thus it was with the ? Federal Party , with the old Republican Party , with the Democratic Party , with the Whig Party , and with that great party whose existence we celebrate to-day . I am hero to exchange congratulations with old neighbors and ' old friends , congratulations on all that has been accomplished to-day , congratulations on the spirit and courage of the party to continue its great works in the future . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Congressman Burrows , of Michigan was the last speaker .
