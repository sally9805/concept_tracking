txt In the discussion following the recent explosions in London it has been suggested that to attempt to control murder clubs upon our own soil is a hardship and an infringement of the rights of free printing and free speaking . The suggestion has been heard that the punishment of those who control the " assassin press " would be an infringement of the liberty of the press . This seems to us to disclose singular ignorance as to what constitutes that liberty . Surely the press is not free from all restraint , etA . mail may not publish what is obscene without risking his liberty , and a libelous publication is at the peril ! of his pocket . The liberty of the press consists in simply this : A man may print what he pleases without Government censorship , and under responsibility which a jury must pass upon . The exemption from a licenser is the essence of the right of free printing . So it is not now proposed to forbid a man to print the proceedings of murder clubs or to accept funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . its obvious uses ; so , too , has the fit discussion of foreign affairs . But there is a limit beyond which foreign affairs are none of our business as individuals or as a people . We may sympathize with the Nihilists or the Home Rulers , and we may say so . We may give them moral support and the benefit of valuable advice . But we may not , consistently with comity , take a hand in the fight ourselves . The point does not seem to us a fine one .. Any way , no harm could be done under a law dealing with the subject in the way we have indicated , because every presumption as to a jury 's findings under it would be in favor of the accused . Those who speak of the liberty of the press as imperiled by such legislation are , with all due respect , ignorant or demagogic . This brings us to the principle which might properly guide us through this maze . The problem is not difficult , and the principle is equally simple , viz. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free of the fight . Neutrality is the motto which will protect us from the mistake of helping Ireland by permitting conspiracies on our own shores or of helping England by undertaking to guard her against dynamite explosions under the nose of the Queen and thousands of miles away from us . And it is a singular fact , recently pointed out , that while we assumed new neutral duties by the treaty of Washington , dated fourteen years ago , the law of neutrality is half a century behind the alert dynamiters . They have invented crimes not within the law , and when Americans fond of a quiet life suggest an amendment of the law they are met with quibbles about the conflict between local and Federal jurisdictions . Did we take the plea of non , possumus from England ? Would England take such a plea from us ? What was the judgment of the Geneva Tribunal as to that plea of incapacity under municipal law to discharge an international duty ?                 @ @ @ @
