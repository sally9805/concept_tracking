txt Manager of the New-York Central and Hudson River Railroad Company , presents in the clearest and most concise form that we have yet seen the objections of the railroads , and particularly of the line which he serves , to the Anti-Discrimination bill now pending in the State Senate . Mr. HAYDEN thinks that the proposed law would impale that great corporation upon the horns of a dilemma from which it could not escape in a condition to operate its road without disastrous loss to itself and to the State and City of New-York . There will be little comfort in the reminder that it has brought itself to this perilous situation by the injustice that it has done in discriminations which have been based on no principle or reason and can find no justification . A deep sense of wrong is at the bottom of the popular demand for regulation and restriction , and if the company had used its discretion with a proper regard for personal and public rights , there would have been no danger of its serious curtailment . But the measure upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful deliberation , was not intended for the punishment of the railroad companies , nor has there been any purpose to cripple them in their business , much less to injure the transportation interests of this State and all that depends upon them . It is not conceivable that any class of citizens should insist upon action which they supposed would have this result . Having presented the ' case of the people against the railroads as its merits have been generally understood , we are quite willing to give the other side- the benefit of its own statement . The first two ' ' sections of the pending bill simply provide against discriminations between persons in the charges made for the same service , and between places in this State by greater rates for shorter than for longer distances . This , which is substantially the same as the Massachusetts law , Mr. HAYDEN thinks might be tolerable , if administered in the liberal spirit which has characterized the action of the Railroad Commission in that State . Its abstract justice he does not presume to question , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both to the railroads and to shippers , unless the discretion were lodged somewhere to permit variations from it in special cases . The particular way in which it would work hardship he does not specify , and the main force of his argument is in favor of a commission , properly constituted and with judicial powers , rather ' than against the requirements of such a law . But his chief objection is to the third section of the bill . This prohibits the granting to any person or association of secret rates , rebates , drawbacks , unreasonable allowance , or undue advantage of any kind . So far it aims at a prolific source of abuse , and Mr. HAYDEN has nothing to say about the prohibition . But it proceeds to declare that no railroad corporation shall charge a different rate to one person or association than to another for like and contemporaneous service , or more from one point on its line than a fair and just proportion of what is charged from any other point ; or more from one local station to another or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " for like and contemporaneous service . " Here is where the Traffic Manager of the Central Road finds the horns of his dilemma . A. large part of the business of the line comes from the great region lying beyond the western boundary of this State , and , consequently , beyond the terminus at Buffalo . In obtaining this through business it is in competition with the other trunk lines from the West to the Atlantic sea-board , two of which terminate at Philadelphia and Baltimore and are altogether beyond the jurisdiction of this State . ' The rates from Chicago are at present fixed by agreement , but the various lines come in contact in their competition for freight at something like 250 other points . From these their agents give through rates , based chiefly on those agreed upon from Chicago , but varying according to distance and the routes taken . As this freight comes upon the New-York Central Road at Buffalo , bound . to its other terminus in this City , the share of the rates to which that company is entitled varies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the , original charges at the places of shipment . Mr. HAYDEN assumes that under the provision of the law requiring uniform charges for like service they would have to be equalized ' at the lowest rate , and then this would have to be taken as a standard for all local rates through the State , subject to the necessity for , proportionate charges for varying distances . This would impose upon the company the almost impossible task of a continual adjustment of its entire schedule with every incoming train from the . West . It is , of course , absurd to suppose that the bill contemplates any such necessity , and it is doubtful whether it would ever be construed as involving it . The other alternative would be to fix the rates for Western agents , and permit no departure from them , and this , the manager believes , would allow competing lines to kill the Western bushier of the New-York road . Another part of the plea is that the Central Road can not control the rates for through transportation , but must conform to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its part of the revenue from that source , which constitutes its compensation for service from Buffalo , to such a figure that if local charges are conformed thereto its entire income will be insufficient to meet operating expenses . Therefore , in his view , if this law were to go into effect and be thoroughly executed , there would be nothing for the Central Road but to abandon its through traffic from the West or run at a disastrous loss . He thinks , and rightly enough , that neither the Legislature nor the people of New-York are prepared for such a direful result . Mr. HAYDEN probably puts a more rigid construction upon the provisions of this bill than they are intended to bear , but at all events , he furnishes a powerful argument for the intervention of the Federal authority for the regulation of inter-State traffic in a way that shall put all through lines on an equal footing , and for the establishment of a commission , with properly-restricted ju- deleted 2 lines - merged columns           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
