We reign supreme ! TUTTI . We do ; we do . SPINDLE . In fact , we could , if we saw fit , Be masters here . TUTTI . No doubt of it . SPINDLE . And knowing this , I think we may Without the least compunction say , TUTTI . There is no firm of which we know That can compare with Pounce &; Co .

But still the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Co. ! TUTTI . Success to Pounce &; Co. ! Enter POLLY CHROMO . POLLY ( gayly ) . So you are here ! WOMEN ( disdainfully ) . Decidedly ! Since nowhere else we chance to be . POLLY ( wounded and tearfully ) . Please , to-day , do n't snub me so ! That you dislike me well I know . MEN ( sympathetically ) . We like you , Polly ! Yes , we do ! POLLY ( naively ) . But I want them to like me , too ! I can not gain their approbation Because I 'm not above my station . WOMEN ( with contemptuous indignation ) . Above your station ? MEN ( remonstrating ) . Polly , dear , Do n't use that sort of language here ! Oblige us ! Do oblige us , pray ! POLLY ( piqued ) . Well , I have nothing more to say Except that folks in humble places Should not indulge in airs and graces . SONG .  --  POLLY . Life is ever as we make it ; Sad or happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And employ it , In laughing and singing , And merrily flinging All envy , for aye , Far away . We can not change the decree of fate By even the hardest endeavor ; So on its pleasure we all must wait , For aid us , complaining can never . Crows , you 're aware , gorgeous peacocks are not , Still may a crow be content with his lot , And have his measure Of pleasure . Yes ! that is so , You well know Station high or low is naught , Merely viewed as station . How to fill it is the thought That calls for cogitation . Why should you scorn my ambition To take with content my position ? No fate so perverse That it could not be worse ,  --  Except  --  and to this you 'll agree  --  ' T was already as bad as it ever could be . Life is ever as we take it , etc . WOMEN . And very proper , too ! MEN . We quite agree with you ! We therefore will resume , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Success to Pounce &; Co . Enter GRIP , followed by RUGGS , MUGGS , TUGGS , and SLUGGS . GRIP ( recit . ) . What do I hear ? You wish success To those who honest toil oppress ? It makes my indignation kindle ! Where is your manhood , Mr. Spindle ? RUGGS , MUGGS , TUGGS , and SLUGGS . It makes our indignation kindle , Where is your manhood , Mr. Spindle ? SPINDLE . For you , and for your censorship , I have no answer , Mr. Grip . OMNES ( except GRIP and followers ) . For you , and for your censorship , We have no answer , Mr. Grip . GRIP ( sardonically ) . Ha , ha ! RUGGS ( and followers ) . Ha , ha ! GRIP Will no wrongs make your bosoms burn ? D'ye think you 're worms , that you spin silk ? Know that at times the worn will turn , POLLY . And so at times will milk ! OMNES ( GRIP and followers sardonically ) . Ha , ha ! Ha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the noble sons of toil , And from morn to eve we moil . And for what , I 'd like to know ? Just that others rich may grow ! Do you think that 's quite the cheese ? Not by a jug full , if you please ! CHORUS ( doubtfully to each other ) . It really do n't seem quite the cheese . Not by a jug full , if you please ! II . Why for them should we toil thus , Any more than they for us ? The wealth and ease in which they live Unto them we 're forced to give ! Do you think that 's quite the cheese ? Not by a jug full , if you please . CHORUS ( decidedly ) . Indeed , it is not quite the cheese ! Not by a jug full , if you please . SPINDLE . In spite of this I think we may Without the least compunction say :  --  CHORUS ( except GRIP and followers ) . There is no firm of which we know That can compare with Pounce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , And only labor when we please ! POLLY . You 're always grumbling , Mr. Grip . Do n't Pounce &; Co. give us all we want ? GRIP . They do n't give me all I want . POLLY . What , in mercy 's name , do you want ? GRIP . What they have n't given me . POLLY . But what have n't they given you ? GRIP . All I want . RUGGS and followers . All we want . ( Suggestively to GRIP . ) GRIP ( discomfited ) . It 's the same thing ! POLLY . Yes ; it 's always the same thing , as far as complaining goes . Have n't you struck regularly once a month for the past two years , and have n't Pounce &; Co. yielded every time ? GRIP . That 's only a reason for striking again ! Are we not men ? WORK-WOMEN ( as a suggestion ) . And women ! GRIP . And women ? RUGGS and other conspirators . We are , we are ! Not a doubt of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not trample on the rights of honest labor . POLLY . But what if bloated labor trample on the rights of honest capital ? GRIP ( sententiously ) . Capital is never honest . Labor never has a chance to get bloated . RUGGS and companions . No ! look at us ! GRIP . Besides , capital has no rights . Its time is wholly taken up in wronging labor . POLLY ( indignantly ) . Pounce &; Co. wrong labor ? Have n't they built you houses ? Have n't they furnished them ? Do n't they feed you on the fat of the land ? Do n't they give you everything you desire ? And do n't you take it ? GRIP . We are entitled to it ! We are the hard-handed sons of toil . What would capital be without us ? POLLY . What would we be without it ? GRIP ( discomfited ) . I 'm not talking about that . But go on ; grovel in the dust ! Be trampled on if you like it ! I do n't ! I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ! I carry my heart in my hand . POLLY . I knew your heart was n't in the right place . GRIP . Indeed ! ( Looking off . ) See ! yonder come the pampered Pounce &; Co. to gloat over their work . POLLY . What work ? Giving you a holiday ? GRIP . Oh , the pride and insolence of wealth ! They give us a holiday to make us feel our dependence . Could we give them a holiday ? No ! Then why do they give us a holiday ? Because it is Pounce 's birthday . Would they give us a holiday if it were our birthday ? RUGGS and companions ( gloomily ) . The poor have no birthdays ! GRIP . And he makes even his birthday a source of self-glorification . Is there any merit in a birthday as a birthday ? No ! but he would make a merit of his . As if he had chosen this day of all others to be born . Bah ! it was only a mere chance that he was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Aye ! or even next week . POLLY ( sarcastically . ) Or never . GRIP . He comes ; with his voluptuary birthday pride in his eye . CHORUS ( GRIP and followers silent ) . Hail , Mr. Pounce ; our best duty we pay , And wish to you many returns of the day . We can not find words to express how sincere Is our joy that you 've entered your sixty-fourth year . Sound , sound the lyre To Thomas Pounce , Esquire ! During chorus , enter POUNCE , followed by CRANK . POUNCE bows , smiles , and shakes hands with everybody . As he goes to GRIP and his followers they shake hands with him with sycophantic eagerness , but as soon as his back is turned they resume their scowling aspect . CRANK stands apart and smiles at everything ostentatiously . POUNCE . Thanks , friends ! for I may call you such , I fear you honor me too much . GRIP and followers ( ironically ) Hear , hear ! POUNCE . Believe me , I will ne'er @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and followers ( as before ) . Hear , hear ! POUNCE . ' T will ever be my constant care Your very best esteem to share . CHORUS ( except GRIP and followers ) . Sound , sound the lyre To Thomas Pounce , Esq . POUNCE . As some return my gratitude to show , I 'll tell you how I rose to Pounce &; Co . SONG .  --  POUNCE . When a youngster , I had A peculiar dad , Of a querulous , obstinate turn ; Who to me one day Thought it proper to say , " Go forth your own living to earn , And see that you roam Till you come again home With servants , and horses , and sich ; In fact , till you 've made An acquaintance with trade , And become independently rich ! " That is what my dad said . CHORUS ( confidentially to each other ) . That is what his dad said . POUNCE . And away then I sped . CHORUS . And away then he sped . POUNCE . Ah ! then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see The proud day when I 'd be A most prosperous Pounce with a Co . CHORUS . He could not then see That he ever should be A most prosperous Pounce with a Co . II . I first was a clerk , And I stuck to my work , Never coming down late to the store . When labor was done , Off the others would run , But to do so I always forbore . My master observed With what zeal he was served , And he called me unto him , to say : " You 're a pious young sneak , And so , after this week You may pack up your traps , and away ! " That is just what he said . CHORUS ( surprised , to each other ) . That is just what he said . POUNCE . And away then I sped . CHORUS . And away then he sped POUNCE . Ah , then ' t was not easy to know That I was to see , The proud day when I 'd be A most prosperous Pounce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see The proud day when he 'd be A most prosperous Pounce with a Co . III . The next place I got Was uncommonly hot ; For my master would have his own way . Whatever he said , Right or wrong , his pig-head Would allow not a soul to gainsay . I always said " no " When he chanced to say so ; And his " yes " was my " yes " to a spell ; Till he said unto me , " You my partner shall be , We agree so exceedingly well . " That is just what he said . CHORUS ( with pleasure ) . That is just what he said . POUNCE . Blessings on his pig-head ! CHORUS . Blessings on his pig-head ! POUNCE . Ah ! that was the first step , you know ! And now , as you see , Just as plain as can be , I 'm a prosperous Pounce with a Co . CHORUS . Ah , yes ! we now see , Just as plain as can be , He 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm glad to see you all so happy . But you know my principles . My work-people must be treated as if they were my own family . What they have you have . The laborer is the equal of his employer . You live on the fat of the land ; and very properly . Your wages  --  GRIP ( with a wounded air ) . I beg pardon  --  salaries ! RUGGS and companions . Sal-a-ries ! POUNCE ( apologetically ) . True , your salaries are constantly increased whenever you ask it ,  --  and you always ask . We do not wish you to look upon all of this as a favor , but as a right . The Co. , Mr. Crank , would tell you the same thing , but he is a silent partner , and , of course , ca n't speak . ( CRANK smiles . ) POUNCE . We are all equals ! GRIP ( aside ) . Egotist ! ( Contemptuously . ) POUNCE . We have built you houses and furnished them in the most sthetic manner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the philosophy of Kant ; you have teachers for singing , for the piano , and harmony ,  --  all of you , except Polly , who , I am sorry to say , I can not prevail upon to improve her condition . POLLY . I am a work-girl , and have no business with these accomplishments . CRANK knocks his stick on the ground approvingly . POUNCE ( severely ) . Mr. Crank ! As a silent partner you have nothing to say . ( CRANK looks abashed and apologetic . The women and men all evince disdain at POLLY 'S speech . ) POUNCE . Polly , you are wrong ! POLLY . Perhaps so ; but I am content to earn my wages  --  OMNES ( shocked ) . Wages ! Oh ! POLLY . And do not want to be under obligations to anybody for making me above my station or my business . CRANK about to approve with his stick again , but checks himself . POUNCE . Well , as you will . But I believe in a brotherhood of capital and labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy . OMNES . You have , you have ! POUNCE . Whatever you demand you get ! OMNES . We do , we do ! POUNCE . You have struck repeatedly . OMNES . We have , we have ! POUNCE . And I yielded , invariably . OMNES . You did , you did ! POUNCE . And the consequence is that you will strike again . OMNES . We will , we will ! POUNCE . The upshot of which is , that Pounce &; Co. do not make any money . OMNES . They do n't , they do n't ! GRIP ( sardonically ) . Ha , ha , ha ! RUGGS and companions . Ha , ha , ha ! ( Deliberately . ) POUNCE ( to them ) . You do not seem to be happy . You have no fault to find , I hope . GRIP . Salmon and green peas have been in for a month , and also spring lamb ; and we have not had as much as a smell of them . POUNCE . Bless me ! Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RUGGS . The lobster bisque we had for dinner yesterday was very badly cooked and wretched in flavor . POUNCE . Ah ! Mr. Crank , why was this ? But I forget . You are a silent partner and can not speak . MUGGS . And the pt de foie has been anything but first-class of late . TUGGS . Moreover , the new cook has not the slightest idea of a mayonnaise . SLUGGS . And I have twice had to use milk on my early strawberries instead of cream . GRIP . While I 'm utterly tired of the eternal fillet and mushrooms , and would like a change . POUNCE ( bewildered ) . By all means ! Anymore ? Polly , as the principal grumbler in the mill , you surely must have some fault to find . POLLY . Yes ; I ran a pin into my finger this morning , and do n't want it to happen again . POUNCE . It sha' n't , it sha' n't ! Your comfort must be obtained at any cost , or the whole purpose of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not labor that of capital . Is it not so , Mr. Crank ? Excuse me . As a silent partner you can not speak . But enough of this ! Go and enjoy yourselves . The musicians are ready and waiting for you . You will have a great treat . They are going to play Liszt 's " Inferno " for you . Mr. Crank will see to your comfort in his efficiently silent manner , as a silent partner . CHORUS . Sound , sound the lyre To Thomas Pounce , Esquire ! Exeunt POLLY , CRANK , and work-people . GRIP and his companions go last , in a gloomy and discontented manner . POUNCE . I am afraid I have undertaken too much in trying to make these people entirely happy . But I 'll persevere . I wish my girls would take more kindly to them . But they scorn to recognize the son of toil as their equals . And Crank 's daughters , too ! I should think , however , that they might refrain from saying anything , as their father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , also , which my poor sister left me when she left the world . They , too , although they have nothing , object to my work-people for husbands . But I have registered a vow that they all shall wed nobody else . If I could only induce them to unite themselves to my laborers , what a delightful family we should be ! It would make a perfect union of capital and labor ; and the ambition of my existence would culminate . I could then die in peace . As it is , when I speak to them about it , I am more in danger of dying in pieces . ( Looks off L. ) Hello ! my daughters ! CONCERTED SCENE . Enter ELEANOR , MILICENT , and SYLVIA , each with a bouquet . ELEANOR , MILICENT , and SYLVIA . Dear papa , one moment I pray . We bring to you , each , a bouquet . In manifestation Of congratulation And daughterly love on this day . POUNCE ( affected ) . Children , my feelings I scarce can compose ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , LAURA , and OLIVIA , each with a bouquet . ESTHER , LAURA , and OLIVIA . And , dear Mr. Pounce , let us show , In the very slight gift we bestow , With this genuflection ( courtesy all ) The sincere affection That unto pa 's partner we owe . POUNCE ( moved ) . Girls , I ca n't tell how my nature you touch , You honor me truly too much . Much too much ! ALL THE GIRLS . At some other time That perhaps might be so ; But certainly not On your birthday , you know . POUNCE . How silly I am . I your pardon implore ; But I failed to perceive it In that light before . Enter ANTIGONE , IPHIGENIA , ANDROMACHE , MEDEA , JOCASTA , and ELECTRA , carrying bouquets of blackberries in their bosoms , and black fans in their hands . IPHIGENIA bears a wreath of cypress . ANTIGONE and companions . Dear uncle , we come our best duty to pay , And to wish very many returns of the day . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your kindness to us you will never regret . Let this attitude ( prayerfully ) Speak our gratitude , As our gift on your cranium we set . They place cypress wreath on his head . POUNCE ( diffidently ) . Why , really and truly , You praise me unduly . ALL THE GIRLS ( remonstrating ) . Oh , no ! Not at all ! ' T is but right . POUNCE ( suggestively ) . It seems quite excessive ! GIRLS ( apologetically ) . We hope not oppressive ? POUNCE ( considerately ) . Oh , no ! GIRLS ( very earnestly ) . On your word ? POUNCE ( with hand on heart ) . Honor bright ! GIRLS . Then , prythee , have no more to say , But take in a sensible way Our manifestation Of congratulation And joy on this notable day . POUNCE ( weeping ) . No more , then , no more ! ELEANOR . You are now sixty-four . If in twelve months from this you 're alive There 's scarcely a doubt You will live this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are now sixty-four , etc . POUNCE and GIRLS . ' T will ensue , It is true ! POUNCE Ah , girls , you make me very happy ,  --  except when you make me miserable . ELEANOR . But , papa , our only object in life is to make you happy . POUNCE And , my dear child , my only object in life is to be made happy . That being the case , why do n't you do as I wish and marry  --  ELEANOR . Your workmen ? Never . ELECTRA . Except me ! I 'll marry anybody . POUNCE Dear child ! so would I were I in your place . ( To the others . ) But let me tell you that , though you despise the humble workingman , an honest heart beats in his breast . ELEANOR . Where would you have it beat , papa ? POUNCE True ; I did n't think of that . However , seeing all I have done for you , I think you might gratify me in such a trifle as marriage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerns our happiness  --  POUNCE Your happiness ? Is a father 's happiness nothing ? And as for a husband , what can it matter to you whether you make one man miserable , or another ? But as you will . You do n't marry with my consent unless you marry my way . ELECTRA . I 'll marry your way or any way . POUNCE ( affectionately ) . I know you will , darling . You are the only obedient one of the lot , and I wish from my heart that somebody had you . You would prove a mother to him . ( Kisses her . ) But I must go and look after the comfort of my people . Enjoy yourselves in the mean while , and take my advice . SONG AND CHORUS . POUNCE You want a husband ? GIRLS . Yes , we do ! POUNCE Then pocket the first that comes to you ! The only way To make your hay Is while the sun is shining ! GIRLS . But hay is not the thing we need , We want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I To you supply . Or else go on repining ! Exit POUNCE . ELEANOR . He is careful enough about the happiness of his work-people , but he cares nothing for ours . ESTHER . It is certainly romantic to stoop from our high position to wed an inferior . ELEANOR . Yes ; but it would be fully as romantic if we did n't stoop at all , and married an equal . SYLVIA . Or still more romantic , if somebody stooped from a high position to marry one of us . ELEANOR . Ah ! you refer , perhaps , to Arthur Dobbins ; or , in other words , to Lord Alfred Peerage . OMNES ( admiringly ) . Ah ! ELECTRA . Heigho ! ELEANOR . What a grand idea for a lord to come to the mill to learn a trade in case he should ever become poor ! ELECTRA . But he does n't work , unless smoking cigarettes and reading the last new novel means work . SYLVIA . I found reading the last new novel to be very hard work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Oh ! ELEANOR . And we 're all to love with him ! OMNES . We are ! ELECTRA . I are  --  I mean I am ! ELEANOR . But we ca n't all have him , you know , under the existing state of the marriage laws ; and , as he has n't yet made a choice of any one of us , we must , of course , look out for ourselves and not neglect our other opportunities . ELECTRA . When we get them . ESTHER ( looking off ) . Bless me ! Look ! There are the bicycle young men , returning to their camp . ELECTRA ( craning eagerly on tiptoe ) . So they are ; the darlings ! SYLVIA . But why do bicycle young men go into camp ? ELEANOR . I ca n't imagine , unless it be for the common weal . ESTHER ( ecstatically ) . Ah ! what joy to be a bicycle rider . What a repose it must be to the weary head to be able to throw all one 's thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see a daring rider mounted on his fiery bicycle , speeding along over pebbles and across ruts , and jolting up and down , I envy him the exquisite illusion that he is enjoying himself . Such touching beliefs in the impossible are , alas , too rare ! ESTHER . Ah , yes ! How earnest he looks . ELEANOR . And how hopelessly sad ! A bicycle rider has never been seen to smile . There must be some hidden mystery , like Freemasonry , some deep heart anguish that drives an innocent fellow-being to bicycle riding . ELECTRA ( convulsively ) . Oh , lovely thought ! ESTHER . They go on their way as if they were performing some solemn penance . SYLVIA . As if they were ready to preach a sermon . ELEANOR . Or , rather , had just heard one . ELECTRA ( waving her handkerchief off ) . Poetic beings ; I love you all ! How d ' ye do ? ELEANOR . Oh , for shame ! OMNES . That is n't fair . ELEANOR . I do believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ See what you have done , Electra . Girls , shall we run away , or stand our ground bravely ? ELECTRA . I run away from no man . ESTHER . I have frequently observed that in you . ELEANOR . We will scorn to fly . But we must not be taken by surprise . Let us do something ! OMNES . But what ? ELEANOR . Ah , yes ! We will be discovered studying our French lesson , and refuse to notice them . OMNES . Yes , yes ! ( All the girls take small books from their pockets or reticules and begin to study . ) CONCERTED SCENE . OMNES . J'aime , I love ; Tu aimes , thou lovest ; Il aime , he loves !

Nous aimons , Nous aimons , we love ! Enter SPOKE , TYRE , HUBBE , and others of the Bicycle Club , in picturesque costumes . They have heard the last portion of the preceding . The girls show to each other a coy consciousness of the presence of the men , of whom , however , they take no notice , but turn their backs , pretending not to see them , and studying . ALL THE MEN . J'aimerai , I shall love ; Tu aimeras thou shall love ; Elle aimera , she shall love ! Nous aimerons , we shall love ; Vous aimerez , you shall love ; Elles aimeront , they shall love .

The men approach the girls , who coquettishly retreat to the other side and continue studying . HALF OF THE GIRLS . Have you the knife Of the admiral 's wife , Or the butter and flute of the tailor ? THE OTHER HALF . I have the gold shoe And the leather corkscrew Of our neighbor , the niece of the sailor ! HALF OF THE GIRLS .

If we had not intruded , how would it have been possible to speak to you ? ELECTRA . You might have written ! ELEANOR . But what is it that you want to say to us ? SPOKE , TYRE , and HUBBE ( together ) . That we have long loved you ; that you realize the dream of our life . ELECTRA ( ecstatically ) . I the dream of your life . Oh , joy ! SPOKE ( politely ) . May I request you to remember that we said dream , not nightmare ? ELECTRA ( placidly ) . So you did . SPOKE ( to ELEANOR ) . Our object in camping was to find an excuse to be near you . ELEANOR . But we do n't know you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look upon it in the light of an advantage , for us . ELEANOR ( dreamily ) . Perhaps you are right . But without knowing us , how can you love us ? SPOKE .

And are n't you going to ? SPOKE . It is difficult to foresee what may happen ; but , at present , I think it is doubtful . ELEANOR . But who are you ? SPOKE . I 'll tell you . SONG AND CHORUS . SPOKE . We 're the Champion Bicycle Club , That all others in riding can drub . Not a snap of the thumb Do we care whence they come , We 'll with any or all try a rub !

For the Bicycle Club . II . The bicycle goes on its course , And never grows tired , like a horse ; Though we own it is true That its riders oft do , Plus occasional ground for remorse . Of all luxuries under the sun . To compare with our sport is there none , For the rider perforce Does the work of the horse , So combines two enjoyments in one !

But loving as we do love , The poet 's words may soothe , Which say , " The course of true love Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blighter , Denying comfort 's crumb , Our love may burn the brighter In the happy days to come . CHORUS . Our love may burn the brighter In the happy days to come . SPOKE . But what is this blighting obstacle that stands between us and the realization of our dearest hopes ? Why can we not marry you ? ELEANOR . Because , in the first place , there is a wealthy English lord in the mill who might choose any one of us at any moment ; and you must confess that a lord would be a more desirable match than you . SPOKE ( sadly ) . Undoubtedly ! Far superior to us , we admit  --  ( with reservation ) socially ! ELEANOR . And , in the next place , papa will not consent to our marrying any except the workingmen in the mill . SPOKE . Ah ! a gleam of hope ( resolutely ) . Well , then , we will all become working men in the mill . ELECTRA . How sublime ! You are worthy of us ! SPOKE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once . CHORUS ( reprise ) . We 're the Champion Bicycle Club , And at labor we 'll now try a rub . Not a snap of the thumb Do we care whence they come ; All workmen we can drub . MEN and GIRLS . Huzza ! Huzza ! For the Bicycle Club ! Exeunt all the men , kissing their hands to the girls , who kiss their hands in return ; ELECTRA effusively . ESTHER . How noble of them ! SYLVIA . How self-sacrificing . ELECTRA . How deliciously devoted ! ELEANOR . And all for love ! How proud we should be that we have the privilege of being girls . Otherwise we could not have inspired in them this generous determination to do something useful . Love masters all ! ELECTRA . I ca n't say as to that ; but I know he masters me . He has emptied his quiver into this poor little heart until it does nothing itself but quiver . SONG .  --  ELECTRA . What is this love ? Ah , well I know .

CHORUS ( seraphically ) . Yes , there is love divine , The love we ca n't define . II . What is this love ? Ah , well I know . ' T is dreaming he will ever be The same as when he was your beau , And begged your hand on bended knee . ' T is musing sweetly , that if e'er He should see fit to change his course , You need not yield unto despair While there are lawyers and divorce !

Oh , young ladies , Mr. Pounce has sent me for you ! ELEANOR . Of course ! He wants us to wait on the work-people again , while they are eating . That is one of his ideas of the union of capital with labor . POLLY . And oh ! A number of new young men have offered themselves to work in the mill . Such a splendid lot ! ELEANOR . Do n't speak of them as if they were dry goods ! Polly , did papa engage them ? POLLY . He found out that they knew nothing about spinning silk , and told them he did n't want them . GIRLS ( disconsolately ) . Oh ! POLLY . And then they offered handsome premiums to be allowed to come and learn the business , and he took ' em all in . OMNES ( pleased ) . Ah ! POLLY . And then the other work-people began to scowl and to mutter , and there 's trouble brewing . But I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know nothing of the business , and get no wages , I do n't see how it can hurt anybody . But your pa is waiting for you . ELEANOR . Come , girls , let us go at once . Perhaps we can throw oil on the troubled water . POLLY . As some of the hands have been drinking , I 'm afraid you 'll have to throw oil on the brandy and water . CHORUS . No delay then , Let 's away , then , And attempt this fire to smother . Goodness gracious ! How vexatious ! First ' t is one thing , then another ! He his hobby must forsake Or our woes will never end . If , in time , a stitch he 'd take , Things would very quickly mend . Exeunt girls . POLLY . This comes of trying to do too much . Pounce &; Co. wanted to equalize capital and labor , and now labor wants to equalize Pounce &; Co . Equality is a very nice thing in its way , but it does n't seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , it means that nobody is any better than you are ; but that you are infinitely better than anybody else ! Enter ARTHUR DOBBINS , in workingman 's attire , elegantly and fashionably made , with clean and elaborate cuffs and collar , polished high-lows , etc . He is smoking a cigar in a languid way . DOBBINS . Ah ! Polly ! Why are you not with the rest of the company enjoying yourself ? POLLY . They do not want me . I am too plebeian for them , because I am not above my station . But I might ask the same question of you , my lord . DOBBINS . Excuse me , Polly . I again feel obliged to call attention to the important fact that I am simple Arthur Dobbins here , and I must insist upon your calling me so . POLLY ( impressing it on her memory ) . Simple Arthur Dobbins ! DOBBINS ( dryly ) . Arthur Dobbins will do , Polly . When I entered the mill to learn a trade I dropped my title and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have dropped them all the girls are trying to pick them up . DOBBINS . And are you among them ? POLLY . Oh ! I would n't presume to stoop to such a thing , Mr. Dobbins . DOBBINS . Would n't you , really ? I respect you for it . POLLY . But how are you going to learn a trade in the way you are going on ? You never come near the work-rooms . DOBBINS . I am learning how to learn to learn , and that is something you know . POLLY . Is there surely no other motive in your coming here ? DOBBINS . There is another motive , but that is my mystery . You 'll find it out by and by . POLLY . But ca n't I know it now ? A mystery is such a luxury ! DOBBINS . Listen , then . I owe Mr. Pounce a debt of gratitude I can never repay . One night he rescued the nephew of a particular friend of my brother from shame and misery . This nephew had been dining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much of an insidious cup , which he afterwards insisted was lobster salad ,  --  but I have always had my doubts upon that point . However , while under the confusing influence of lobster , and while trying with a patent corkscrew to open the coal-hole of his residence , which he doubtless mistook for his front door , Mr. Pounce found him , dragged him up the steps by the coat-collar , rang the bell , and modestly hastened away . That man was the young and noble Marquis of Bogginagar , the nephew , as I say , of a particular friend of my brother . I shall never forget it . That is why I am here . The rest is my mystery , which I shall carry to the grave with me ,  --  unless I divulge it before I die . POLLY . How remarkable ! DOBBINS . You are the only mortal to whom I have breathed a word of this ; and you would never have heard it if I did not feel toward you a something or other which , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very peculiar . POLLY ( casting down her eyes ) . Oh , sir ! And am I to look upon that in the light of a formal declaration of love ? DOBBINS . By no means ! simple child of nature that you are . Oh , how refreshing you are to me after the gaudy and mocking artificialities of the gilded and heated salons of nobility . You 're a flower of the fields  --  a daisy ! Polly , can a nobleman stoop from his high rank to marry far , far beneath his station ? POLLY ( fervently ) . He can , he can ! DOBBINS . Can he bear the reproaches of his caste for the degradation of such an alliance ? POLLY ( ecstatically ) . Oh , yes ! DOBBINS ( reflectively ) . I have often thought so in the empty hours of my hollow life . And , Polly , do you think you could love such a titled and wealthy waif as I am ? POLLY ( enthusiastically ) . I know I could . ( Buries her face in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ premature , Polly ! ( She is about to recede . He checks her and returns her head to his bosom . ) But  --  it is not unpleasing to me . DUETTO.  --  POLLY and DOBBINS . DOBBINS . Would you mind telling me If e'er your heart has fluttered At sight of any he , Or aught he may have uttered ? POLLY . Not since I long ago Played house with little Willy . He was my baby beau , When I was young and silly . Though but a child , And scarce knee high , My heart beat wild When he was nigh , Since then I have not known love 's flame Till I met one I will not name . DOBBINS . Tell me , tell me , is it I ? POLLY . Pray do n't press for a reply . I ca n't say , Yea or nay ! ENSEMBLE . POLLY . Ask me no more , I beg and implore ; For I ca n't say Or yea , or nay ! DOBBINS . I beg and implore , This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or nay ! POLLY . I fully am aware , I 've won your admiration ; But know I must forbear To look above my station . DOBBINS . A cat may at a king Look , if he is inclined to ; And you at me may fling A glance , if you 've a mind to . When but a child , And scarce knee high , Your heart beat wild When one was nigh . Since then have you not known love 's flame ? POLLY . Not ere I saw one I 'll not name . DOBBINS . Tell me , tell me , is it I ? POLLY . If you press for a reply I must say , Truly , yea ! ENSEMBLE .

At last we have a sight of you ! We do not think it right of you , And more , quite impolite of you From us to keep away . Because of your passivity , A painful inactivity Has marked the whole festivity Of papa 's natal day . Can we do anything for you ? What is there we can bring for you ? An ice , a chicken 's wing for you ? You only have to say ! We 'll get some lemonade for you Or else a marmalade for you , Or something stronger made for you , Without the least delay .

They gaze in astonishment , and then remonstrate . SPOKE , TYRE , and HUBBE . Ah ! what is it we behold ? Do we here a rival see ? Can it be that we are sold ? Dreadful thought ! It can not be ?

They frown on Arthur ! Dobbins too ! To Arthur Dobbins they 'll not sue . As either he 's the same to me , To either will I bend the knee . DOBBINS ( aside ) . They frown on Arthur ! Dobbins , too ! But will unto Lord Alfred sue . Strange that such difference should be ' Twixt tweedle-dum and tweedle-dee . Enter POUNCE , in excitement , followed by CRANK . OMNES ( recit . ) .

CRANK , in a state of great excitement , comes forward and sings a song in gesture , as the silent partner . He manifests his discontent with the entire proceedings , shakes his fists at the workmen , and expresses indignation at their course . CHORUS . No , no ! It is not so . Upon my word , It is absurd , Such awful language I ne'er heard ! At end of song CRANK strikes his stick on stage , goes up indignantly , and meets the sympathy of the girls . GRIP ( to POUNCE ) .

We 're masters here , at last , what bliss ! We 'd not the least idea of this ; The mill is properly our own , For we the money make alone . These girls who e'er on us have frowned , Now kneel before us , on the ground . We 'll sneer and jeer to view them thus , As they have sneered and jeered at us . DOBBINS and SPOKE , TYRE and HUBBE . I ne'er saw such a move as this ; Or fate so queerly go amiss , These dogs will quarrel o'er the bone , And each insist it is his own , But fortune 's wheel will turn around , And those who now are on the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who use them thus . GIRLS ( to work-people ) . You can not mean to act like this , And drag us all to woe from bliss ; You will not Pounce &; Co. dethrone , And take from them what is their own . ( Kneel . ) See , meekly kneeling on the ground , At your large feet in grief profound , We beg you will not treat us thus , But show you are magnanimous BICYCLE-MEN ( to GIRLS ) . We ne'er saw such a change as this , Or fate so queerly go amiss ; A wealthy firm thus overthrown By silly sentiment alone . Do n't kneel before them , on the ground , But here , against our hearts , be found . The course you take in acting thus Is far from flattering to us . POLLY ( to POUNCE ) . Do n't take it , pray , so much amiss , You 'll even get with them for this . You owe it to yourself alone That such bad treatment you have known !

( Aside . ) ' T will not be long ere they have found They 've got into a hole profound ; And then for help they 'll look to us And think they were ridiculous .

Dinner time ! Yes , and a nice dinner , too . Cold ham and tea ; and we have to provide it for ourselves . When I think how Pounce &; Co. fed their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry my crimps out of curl . POLLY . Do n't grieve . It will come all right again , by and by . It 's the old story . The cat and the mouse do n't play together . You know the fable . SONG .  --  POLLY . A calico cat sat beguiling His time near a hole in the floor , And his face so completely was smiling It could not contain a smile more . The cause of his pleasing reflection Was a mouse , upon which he could feed . So he waited with keen circumspection For the dinner of which he had need . And he watched and he blinked , And he lazily winked . GIRLS ( interested ) . He winked ? POLLY . Yes ! But never he purred , As he thought  --  GIRLS . Ah ! he thought ! POLLY . Of the mouse , yet uncaught , Till it seemed to him rather absurd . At last , after careful debating , To him it was made very clear , That ' t was idle the mouse there awaiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( conclusively ) . It was idle the mouse there awaiting , If the mouse did not choose to appear ! II . A mouse in his hole lay a-thinking ,  --  A very green mouse , I must add ,  --  And his sharp little eyes were a-winking , And his thoughts were exceedingly sad . His heart overflowed with dejection At the war which the calico cat Made , with cruel and sad predilection , On the lives of the mouse and the rat . So he pondered and thought , And carefully sought  --  GIRLS ( inquiringly ) . He sought ? POLLY . Yes , he sought , and at last , He found  --  GIRLS ( in surprise ) . Ah ! he found ! POLLY . What appeared neutral ground Upon which he could bind friendship fast ! After breakfast he went in the morning To make on the cat a short call ; But the cat ate him up without warning ,  --  Good motives , and folly , and all ! CHORUS ( sententiously ) . Ah ! the cat ate him up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all . POLLY . On the moral I 'll now raise the curtain ,  --  ' T is brief and should ne'er be forgot : When a cat hunts a mouse ' t is uncertain ; When a mouse hunts a cat it is not ! CHORUS . When a cat hunts a mouse ' t is uncertain ! When a mouse hunts a cat it is not ! The girls take their dinner pails and dance off . POLLY . I am very sorry for them ; but then , of course , they are naturally sorry for themselves , and it does n't seem to do them any good . A week ago they would n't condescend to look upon the workmen , and to-day the workmen do condescend when they look on them ,  --  and so the world goes round ; but if it did n't go round something dreadful would happen , so , perhaps , in the long run , it is just as well . Enter POUNCE , dressed as a common workman ; he has a square paper hat on his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ POUNCE . Ah , Polly ! Are you there ? But of course you are , or I could n't see you . POLLY . How are you , sir ? POUNCE . Do n't be respectful to me , Polly , please ! Call me Tommy , or " Hi-say ! " or something of that kind . I 'm only a common workman , you know . POLLY . A workman , perhaps , yes ; but a really uncommon one . Never will I be disrespectful to you after all you have done for me . POUNCE . But I never did anything for you . Perhaps that accounts for it . You always insisted upon knowing your station , and it would seem that a person who knows his station will never feel out of place in it . But leave me now , Polly ; I want to eat my frugal meal in select privacy . POLLY . What can I do for you ? POUNCE ( reflectively ) . Do for me ? Nothing , Polly . The others have done for me . POLLY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want anything . Exit POLLY , R. 1 E. POUNCE . Call on her if I want anything ! But I want everything . She surely ca n't mean to say she has it . And if she has , will she give it to me if I ask for it ? Of course not ! The decrees of fate are very strange . A week ago I was master ; to-day I am a workman . I must say I do not exactly understand the principle yet . Neither does Crank , though as silent partner he was obliged to go with the assets of the firm . By the way , he is making up for lost time . His appetite for talk is really gluttonous . He wants it all . I liked him better when he was silent by contract . Of course , as he is no longer a silent partner , silence can not be demanded of him . Enter CRANK as a workman . He carries a tin dinner pail . CRANK . Ah ! there you are ! I thought so ! POUNCE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you saw me before you arrived at that conclusion . It 's the only conclusion you 've come to since you began to talk . CRANK ( very rapidly ) . That 's a joke . I enjoy a joke . I enjoy everything that gives an opening to conversation . POUNCE ( interrupting ) . But you do n't seem to enjoy anything that gives a close to it ! CRANK ( always rapidly ) . Ha , ha ! Have you had dinner yet ? Of course not . We 'll dine together and share . We 'll have two courses . Mine is all coarse . Pie and coffee . Not particularly nourishing , but I do n't know that nourishment is necessary . Quite different from our model workmen , with their salmon and green peas , and fillet and mushrooms . The reason they came up so quick was because you fed them so much on mushrooms . Well , I do n't complain ; as a common workman I am content to put up with workman 's commons ( stops suddenly ) . POUNCE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done ? CRANK . Yes , till I get breath again . It 's such a luxury to speak after my long silent partnership that I do n't seem to get enough of it . POUNCE . I do , though ! If you 'll remain quiet for a moment I 'll tell you of an idea I have got . I have resolved to strike , and to keep on striking till we get the mill back again , and I 'm going to begin to-day . It 's our only plan . CRANK ( always volubly ) . Superb idea ! if it works out in all its details . I ca n't see for my part why it should n't . In fact , from a practical point of view it is worthy of the most profound intellect of the time ; and from other points of view it is worthy the intellect of the most profound thinker of anytime , past or to come ,  --  particularly to come . ( With enjoyment ) . Ah ! what a luxury it is to talk ! I envy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great talkers ! ( Suddenly stops , winded . ) POUNCE . You need n't , You can talk enough for all of them . DUET .  --  POUNCE and CRANK . POUNCE . ' T is pleasant oft to dance , With easy complaisance , In graceful consonance To music 's witching flow . Again , it seems to me , That there may chance to be Some kind of ecstasy , In drawing of the bow . CRANK ( volubly ) . I catch at your thought with rapidity , Own to its perfect lucidity , Take to it with a fervidity Nothing can ever undo . You mean you have danced with agility , Mingled with patient docility , Now you would show your ability Making the piper dance , too . POUNCE . They shall dance excitedly , CRANK . They shall dance benightedly . POUNCE . Also undelightedly , When I the melody play ! CRANK . And for their austerity , And their insincerity , POUNCE . Likewise their temerity , They shall dearly pay ! CRANK . The hateful , elateful , ungrateful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismaying Usurpers of what should be ours ! POUNCE . If e'er we Masters again should be , Then you 'll see , They 'll dance to the best of their powers ! Enter GRIP , followed by RUGGS , TUGGS , SLUGGS , and MUGGS . They wear blue coats with brass buttons , nankeen trousers and gaiters , and have a general air of great respectability and easy condescension . GRIP . Ah ! my lads ! Enjoying yourselves , eh ! Well , I like to see our people taking recreation . CRANK . Yes , that is all you have left them to take . RUGGS and companions . Ah ! ( All take a pinch of snuff , close their boxes , dust their shirt frills , and return their boxes to their pockets , simultaneously . ) GRIP . The happiness of our workmen is our chief care . CRANK . Yes , after your own has been fully attended to . When they are happy you get more work out of them , and it is scarcely necessary to add to a person of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work you pay for and as much more as you can obtain free of cost . Under these uncommonly exceptional circumstances , therefore  --  GRIP ( interrupting ) . Ah , yes ! As we do not pay for your very eloquent conversation we do not feel that we have any right to expect you to throw that in . It would be unjust to you , and painful , peculiarly painful to us . RUGGS and companions . Distressingly painful ! ( About to sneeze , but do not . ) CRANK ( volubly ) . But have you the remotest idea how much more painful it is to me to restrain my brilliant flew of thought and its expression in still more brilliant language ? Man is essentially a speaking animal . It was never intended in the economy of nature that there should be such things as silent partners . They are an artificial product of a degenerate era . Language may have been given to man to conceal his thoughts , but surely thought was not given to man to conceal his language . Absurd ! In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the daily happiness of mankind is conceded by all reflective minds with a uniformity that very closely approaches universality . ( Stops , winded . ) GRIP ( sarcastically ) . You are eloquent . CRANK . Oh ! that 's nothing to what I can do upon a nutritious diet . GRIP ( grimly ) . Indeed ! You have given me , then , an excellent excuse for starving you . CRANK goes up offended , and begins to busy himself with the machinery . POUNCE . What I want to say to you is , that we have resolved to strike for an increase of wages . GRIP . A strike ! RUGGS and companions . A strike ! ( All sneeze in their handkerchiefs and return them to their pockets simultaneously . ) GRIP . Could n't think of it , my good man . CRANK , who has been meddling with the machinery , suddenly sets it going . CRANK . Hallo ! stop there ! Help me ! It has nearly taken my finger off . GRIP ( stopping machinery ) . I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you remember , sir , Pounce &; Co. always yielded when you struck . GRIP ( with moral loftiness ) . Yes ; and see where they are ! RUGGS and companions . Or rather , where they are not . POUNCE . Without any desire to be disrespectful to my employers , might I observe that I fed you on the fat of the land . GRIP ( considerately ) . May I observe that you should have put away some of the fat for a rainy day . But capital must not be too hard on labor ! Of what do you complain ? TRIO AND CHORUS . POUNCE ( with fervor ) . We 've had no green peas , Though they 've long been in season ; No salmon one sees ! And I ask you the reason . ' T is exceedingly strange , you must frankly admit , That of early spring lamb we have not had a bit ! GRIP . What you say is quite true ! I 've no reason to doubt it ; But remark unto you We care nothing about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not see why Peas and salmon you hesitate longer to buy . ENSEMBLE . CRANK and POUNCE . Is there , then , no compensation For this cruel deprivation Of these objects of gustation , That we like unto excess ? Our indignation And vexation , Then , at least , we can express ! GRIP . In your humble avocation Such a taste needs palliation , It is folly ,  --  nothing less ! OMNES . Salmon and peas ! Nothing but these ? POUNCE . It is not this alone ; We 've had no new potatoes . CRANK . And you likewise must own , Neither early tomatoes . GRIP . Unto this I have nothing to answer but " Bosh ! " POUNCE and CRANK . We have said nothing , either , of young summer squash . TUTTI . Salmon and peas . Tomatoes . Potatoes . They ask us for these ! We ask you for these ! GRIP . My good people  --  CRANK ( interrupting volubly ) . I know what you 're going to say . You are about to observe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the better supply of the larder from which our inner man is recruited , you will see us considerably farther than it is likely we shall travel before our spirit is released from its earthly prison ; and that  --  GRIP ( interrupting ) . Nothing of the kind . What I am going to say is that we ca n't be expected to find our people their meals or to feed them on luxuries . POUNCE . But Pounce &; Co. found your meals and fed you on luxuries . GRIP . True , and kept me constantly bilious . RUGGS and companions . And dyspeptic . CRANK . Will you permit me to impress upon you that , to our past joy and our present sincere sorrow , we did our best to make you happy ? GRIP . Did you ? CRANK . Did n't we ? If we did n't we did n't ; but if we did n't , we did n't fail because we did n't try . POUNCE . Of what do you complain ? CHANT .  --  GRIP . Life was joyous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you rashly tried to change me To an Oscar Wilde sthete ; Till my walls you daubed with sunflowers , And my soul you froze with frieze ; And with bric -- brac and dado Robbed my days and nights of ease ; Till through you the world and nature In a stained-glass light was seen ; And my milk was tinted purple , And my butter emerald green . All because of your insanity On the subject of Queen-Anneity II . When I asked that you my wages To a living point should raise , You replied with an old teapot Or a cracked Satsuma vase ; And my roof you painted scarlet , And my doors had cabbage-hued ; And for windows gave me bull 's eyes , Through which nothing could be viewed . Ugly plates in every corner Of my walls you tried to squeeze ; And what was not hideous English Was more hideous Japanese ; Till I tired of your insanity On the subject of Queen-Anneity . POUNCE . The strike is evidently a failure . CRANK . Ghastly and irrevocably . POUNCE . And yet it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did when you tried it ; there is something remarkable in the fact that it wo n't work both ways . GRIP . My good man  --  CRANK ( interrupting volubly ) . I know what you 're going to say . You would infer that because one man is an ass there 's no reason why another man should be a donkey ; that if one man is a goose there is no law of nature that compels nine other men to become ganders for the mere sake of keeping him company ; that if a man who has a bird in his hand lets it go he can not expect that two birds in the bush will come to him and entreat him on their bended knees to take them by the necks . This , I surmise , is the sum and substance of most earthly philosophy . Life is made up of things that ought to be , but are not . POUNCE . And of things that are , but ought not to be . These thoughts never occur to us before we are born , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As an humble concomitant in the family of the humanly developed protoplasm  --  GRIP ( interrupting ) . Enough of this ! CRANK . It is very strange that I can not find an opportunity to speak without interruption . If I am not permitted to say what I think I 'll sing it . SONG .  --  CRANK . There 's little in life of variety ,  --  You either succeed or you fail ; You 've nothing , enough , or satiety ,  --  At fortune you smile or you rail . And so , do I say , Time goes on its way From day unto day ,  --  And there you are ! II . My mind is made up most conclusively , The pavement of life is strewn o'er With orange peel , scattered delusively , To cause you to trip evermore . Unthinking of wrong , Perhaps humming a song , You wander along ,  --  When  --  there you are ! III . In our path Fate has slyly distributed Slight obstacles free from alarm ; There a stone she has quietly contributed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trick , You give it a kick , To find there 's a brick , And  --  there you are ! IV . In fact , life is full of contrariness , A species of thimble-rig game , In which , though you watch with all wariness , You 're certain to lose , all the same . You 're ready to swear The pea is right there , When , lo ! it is here , And  --  there you are ! GRIP . That 's all very well  --  POUNCE . On the contrary , it 's all very ill . GRIP . We really can not permit our work-people to address us in this fashion . It savors too much of insubordination . RUGGS and companions . And of equality . CRANK . If I might be allowed  --  GRIP . Which you ca n't be ! CRANK . Only a few words . GRIP . Impossible ; you 'll talk us to death . CRANK . I wish I could . Enter SPOKE , HUBBE , TYRE , and the rest of the Bicycle Club . SPOKE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! As a laborer I must insist upon being called Tommy , Old Man , a Cully , or something of that companionable kind . SPOKE . Never ! Because you have made a jolly old idiot of yourself , do you think you have fallen in my estimation ? Never ! I like you the better for it ; for it shows how simple you are . Does n't it , boys ? BICYCLE MEN . It does , it does ! POUNCE . It 's very kind of you , I 'm sure . During this conversation CRANK tries to speak , but is prevented . He then goes to RUGGS and his companions and converses with them volubly , using rapid gesticulation . They are aghast at his volubility and try to avoid him , but he follows them about . GRIP . Excuse me , Spoke , but I 'm glad you are here , because I have a few words to say to you . Business in the mill is neglected , owing to your propensity to flirt with the girls . RUGGS and his companions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follows them off , still gesticulating and conversing . SPOKE . But we came here expressly to flirt with the girls , and if we are deprived of that privilege we shall go ! GRIP . But you can not go ! You have paid a premium to learn the business and must stay . SPOKE . True ! I did not think of that . All the bicycle men hang their heads sadly . Re-enter CRANK , following RUGGS and companions . GRIP . Besides , the girls were betrothed to us long ago . It is true that they are only the daughters of workingmen , and if we marry them we shall stoop beneath our station ; but we have no doubt they will appreciate the honor we do them in raising them to our level . Moreover , they do n't want us , which is an additional incentive to the course we are resolved upon . RUGGS and companions . Ah ! ( with satisfaction ) . POUNCE ( deeply moved ) . Come , Crank . I can not stay . This generosity touches me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream ,  --  the union of Capital with Labor . ( Takes CRANK 'S arm . ) Let us hence . CRANK . If I might make a few remarks , I would observe with all due humility  --  GRIP . Silence ! I have before told you  --  CRANK . I know what you 're going to say . You have before told me in that peculiarly eloquent manner of yours that my conversation is apt to be too verbose in comparison with the paucity of the ideas upon which it is so freely and so elaborately expended ; but if you take into consideration that I have long been condemned to a taciturnity wholly revolting to my feelings and still more unjust to my capacity for expressing myself fluently upon all necessary , and , for the matter of that , all unnecessary occasions , you will appreciate my joyous yearning for availing myself of the opportunity afforded me of speaking again . ( Comes to a stop for want of breath . ) POUNCE . Come , Crank ! GRIP . No , stay , Pounce . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you , you had better remain and hear it . POUNCE . I can not , I can not . It is too much for me ,  --  as you have been . ( Exit , dragging CRANK . ) GRIP ( feelingly ) . Poor fellow . He is a strange compound of low cunning and the most unblemished dishonesty . But as for you , Spoke , and your rebellious companions , I have only to say that you had better bear in mind what I have said to you . You will find it to your advantage . Exeunt GRIP and followers with stately dignity , SPOKE and the others snapping their thumbs under their noses till they are off . SPOKE . Now , what is to be done ! Oh , what agony it is to be a baffled man , and we are all baffled men ! OMNES . Alas , yes ! SPOKE . Here are we bound to this delusive mill by the premiums we have paid ! Is there no way out of it ? Perhaps , too , dreadful consideration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and who love us devotedly ,  --  or will as soon as Lord Dobbins has made his choice . But they shall yet be ours ! Are we resolved ? OMNES ( decidedly ) . We are ! Enter girls . They express delight upon seeing their lovers , and are going to them , but suddenly recollect themselves and draw back . SPOKE . Why do you shrink from us ? ELECTRA . I , oh I did not shrink ! ELEANOR . We shrink from you because we are work-girls ,  --  because we can not now link ourselves indissolubly with one ,  --  or perhaps I should say , several ,  --  who will blush for us . SPOKE . But the man who can blush is not wholly lost to shame ! Hear me ! We love you still ! ELECTRA ( with a deep sigh ) . Ah ! I live again ! SPOKE . You may be poor , humble , unworthy of us , but we live for you alone . ( To bicyclers . ) I believe I express the general sentiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ELEANOR . You are all rich , it is true , and we should want for nothing ; that is a great inducement , certainly ; but though poor now , we still cherish the hopes we had in our brighter days , and dream that Lord Alfred may choose one of us . ELECTRA . Alas , yes ! ELEANOR . If it were not for that we should not hesitate a moment . ELECTRA . I 'm sure I should not . SPOKE . I will speak to him this very day about it , and if he is a man he will make up his mind at once . ELECTRA . Thanks , oh thanks ! Enter DOBBINS . The girls all sigh as they see him , and then cast down their eyes with humility . SPOKE . Excuse me for what I am about to say , but I am compelled to the course I am taking . To come to the point at once ; you do not deny that you are a lord . DOBBINS . I do not . I am a lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother 's care ! DOBBINS . Born at a period of my existence when self-care was wholly out of the question , I was thrown early upon a mother 's attentions . Ah ! unhappy they who have not had a mother ! SPOKE . Under those circumstances it is of course imperative upon you to marry . ( All the girls interested ; ELECTRA pushing others back . ) DOBBINS . There have been numerous marriages in our family since it first originated . I presume I shall follow in the beaten path . I 'll tell you of one marriage that was rather remarkable . Pay attention . SONG .  --  DOBBINS . A brother-in-law weds his sister-in-law , Who the first cousin is of his mother , The niece of his step-father 's aunt , and the son Of his grandfather 's oldest twin brother . Now , tell me , I pray , Without any delay , What relation each bore to the other . CHORUS ( interrogatively ) . A brother-in-law ? DOBBINS ( affirmatively ) . A brother-in-law ! CHORUS ( as before ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weds his sister-in-law . CHORUS . Who , the first cousin is , of his brother ? We frankly confess We 're unable to guess The relation each bore to the other . DOBBINS . I 'll tell you ! II . She is daughter-in-law of her mother-in-law , And he is his sister 's own brother , And as they are married ' t is plain to be seen They are husband and wife to each other . ' T is as plain as can be , And I hope you now see What relation each bore to the other . CHORUS ( reflectively ) . She is daughter-in-law ? DOBBINS . She is daughter-in-law . CHORUS . To her mother-in-law ? DOBBINS . To her mother-in-law . CHORUS . And he is his sister 's own brother ? ( Laughing . ) How stupid that we From the first did not see They were husband and wife to each other ! Enter GRIP . He starts on seeing girls . GRIP . Ah ! I thought so . Since there is no other way of controlling the mill and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the girls shall henceforth work up-stairs . In the prospect that the firm may possibly marry them their hearts must be kept disengaged . ELECTRA . Marry us ! Oh , you dear soul ! ( Falls on GRIP 'S neck . ) GRIP . Enough of this ( disengaging himself ) . You flirt with these bicycle people constantly . I shall discharge them all ! SPOKE . Ha , ha ! Discharge us ! You can not . As you have admitted in the presence of reliable witnesses , we have paid a premium to learn the business and can not go until we have learned it . And , as we never intend to learn it , we shall stay here forever ! GRIP . Baffled ! Maledictions ! But one thing I can do , and that is to send the girls up-stairs . So go ! At once ! ( Sends girls off , chasing them like chickens . The girls kiss their hands to men as they depart , GRIP trying to prevent them . ) SPOKE ( indignantly ) . I can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I  --  I  --  DOBBINS . Not a word ! My mystery is working . Say nothing , but watch . You , too , are a part of my mystery . Silence , and obey me . ( Looks sternly at them . ) The eye of the nobility is on you . As it is superior to other eyes you will succumb to its influence , of course ! Let us go ; and in order that our confidences to each other , if overheard , may not be understood , we will seek safety in a foreign tongue . CHORUS ( with fingers on lips ) . Mysterioso , Non strepitoso ; E whisperoso , Silenzio ! Ever fearing , Some one hearing , Silenzio ! Exit DOBBINS , followed mysteriously by all except SPOKE . SPOKE . Why , ah , why , should I strepitoso at the bidding of any proud lord when my heart pants for my Eleanor ? SONG . I. No love have I e'er known Save that for you I own . As far as I recall One , very likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the most , that 's all . But unto you Will I be true Forever and forever ! II . Come , love , into the shrine Within this heart of mine , I give you for your own . You 'll find it rather small , But do n't mind that at all , For you 'll be quite alone . And true to me I 'm sure you 'll be Forever and forever ! ELEANOR creeps down stairs cautiously . ELEANOR . Hist ! Hist ! SPOKE . Ah ! my Eleanor ! ELEANOR . Softly , or we shall be overheard by that dreadful Grip . What is to be done ? SPOKE . You are ! ELEANOR . What do you mean ? SPOKE . That Grip and his fellows are to marry you and the girls . ELEANOR . Never ! What do they take us for ? SPOKE . For wives , I suppose . ELEANOR . Do n't be silly , I beg ! Oh dear , dear ! This all comes of papa 's ridiculous ideas of equality . I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I were a protoplasm . SPOKE . Do n't wish that , beloved . If you were , what would become of me ? ELEANOR . True ! It was selfish in me , I admit . DUET .  --  ELEANOR and SPOKE . ELEANOR . Oh , could but I Take wings and fly Up to the sky , There would I stay Till you that way Could speed to meet me . Say , would you come And with me roam The azure dome , And full of glee And ecstasy , Make haste to greet me ? SPOKE . Could you but fly Up to the sky , I 'm sure that I , Without delay , Would haste away To come and greet you . Be't understood , That is , I would In case I could , And I had , too , Wings just like you , With which to meet you . For you must own , With wings alone Have any flown Particularly high Into the sky . ENSEMBLE . What joy to float Upon the air In case the weather should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should , of joy , Have not a bit . Enter GRIP . GRIP . What ? Again ? Rebellion ? ( Separating them . ) Enough of this ! ELEANOR . Oh , no ! Not half enough . GRIP . Away with you ! Embracing each other before my very eyes ! SPOKE . How could I know you were looking ? ELEANOR . And if it was unpleasing to you , why did you look at all ? GRIP . Not a word . Up stairs with you ! ELEANOR exits up stairs , kissing her hand to SPOKE . GRIP . And as for you  --  Enter CRANK , precipitately . CRANK . Mr. Grip , I have a few important words to say , which will not take up more than half an hour of your valuable  --  Exit GRIP hastily , followed by CRANK . SPOKE . Parted again . Heigho ! Ah ! ( Sees telephone . ) A telephone ! She is in the room above ! Ha , ha ! Grip , the unrelenting Grip , is circumvented ! ( Goes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SPOKE ( rings bell of telephone ) . Hello ! Hello ! Who is it ? I ca n't hear ! Hello ! hello ! Is that you , Nellie , dear ? Hello ! ELEANOR ( outside ) . Hello ! SPOKE ( at telephone ) . Ah ! my heart is wholly thine ! Tell me , dost on me bestow An affection like to mine , Speaking naught but calm ,  --  " Hello ! " Tell me , dost thou wish me near , As in the lovely short ago , When thy first kiss ,  --  " Hello ! "  --  so dear , Filled me wholly with  --  " Hello ! " If thy heart its faith retain , Tell me , darling , tell me so ; And relieve me of the pain That now makes me all  --  " Hello ! " II . ELEANOR ( outside ) . Yes , I love thee with a love That a change can never know ; And near I with joy am all aglow ; When away from thee I hear Nothing but thy soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mine , But one wish  --  " Hello ! "  --  I know : To be thine , and only thine , In the sweet , sweet  --  " Hello ! " TOGETHER . Thou'rt mine ! I 'm thine . Hello ! Now go ! Last call ! That 's all . Enter POLLY , hasti POLLY . Mr. Dobbins wants you and the girls to meet him here at once . SPOKE . What is the matter ? Is the mill on fire ? POLLY . No ; but I think it is going to be . He says he is going to explode his mystery at once ; and I suppose that means something terrible . So go , please , and find the young ladies and tell them to come down . SPOKE . Anything to oblige you ( aside ) and to see the adored unapproachable . POLLY . Ah ! I shall soon know Arthur Dobbins 's mystery that he has guarded so carefully . I wonder if he has the slightest suspicion of mine ? SONG . Loving doubtless is a pleasure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to treasure , And that sort of thing . But still , to undergo This most ecstatic woe , Unless you chance to know He suffers too , As well as you , Upon my word , Seems quite absurd ! Yet  --  the fact I ca n't disclaim  --  We do it all the same ! Why , if you love , delay so , And cause me to bewray so ? When you might kindly say so , And fill my life with joy Without alloy ! II . If men feel the tender passion They may speak outright ; But poor we are placed by fashion In another light . To speak we must forbear ; To hint we may not dare ; No heed how we despair We must be mum Until they come And condescend Suspense to end ! So I have to wait and wait To learn from him my fate ! Why , if you love , delay so , And cause me to bewray so ? When you might kindly say so , And fill my life with joy Without alloy ! Enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so long carried beneath this workman 's waistcoat is about to be divulged . I shall pay my debt of gratitude and then return to the halls of my ancestors . POLLY . Were the hauls of your ancestors very big ? DOBBINS . Very , Polly ! POLLY . Were they as big as the hauls of the politicians about which we hear so much ? DOBBINS . Misguided but innocently shrewd Polly , your acquaintance with the mysteries of spelling needs enlarging . Enter SPOKE , HUBBE , TYRE , and their companions , together with all the girls . SPOKE . You wanted us ! We are here . DOBBINS . I have already observed it , but I thank you for the information all the same . What I have to say to you must not be suspected . In order to mislead attention in case we are interrupted you will oblige me by simulating the raptures of terpsichorean joy . In other words , dance ! QUINTETTE AND CHORUS .  --  POLLY , ELEANOR , ELECTRA , DOBBINS , SPOKE . DOBBINS . I 've no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll drive . ( To girls . ) You these gentlemen would marry ; ( To men . ) With these ladies you would wive . SPOKE . You the truth present compactly , That is clear , beyond a doubt ; But I can not see , exactly , How you chanced to find it out ! ALL . Yes , they can not see exactly Yes , we can not see exactly How he chanced to find it out . How you chanced to find it out . ELEANOR . Since the subject thus you mention , May we ask if you will tell If you have the least intention To assist our love , as well ? ALL . Yes , have you the least intention To assist their love , as well ? To assist our love , as well ? DOBBINS . That depends on circumstances And on what to me you say . ELECTRA . We 're prepared for all advances You may make us in that way . ALL . We 're prepared for all advances You may make us in that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , They with instant expedition With its mandates will comply . ALL . We 're prepared with expedition With its mandates to comply . DOBBINS . Very well , gentlemen ; make your choice . Select your wives . MEN ( bowing respectfully ) . After you , my lord . All the girls come forward and surround DOBBINS with an air of anxious resignation , ELECTRA obtrusive . DOBBINS . Though I feel deeply the honor done me by these fair maidens , I am obliged , in justice to the sentiments with which they inspire me , to confess that I do not want any of them . The girls all sigh with relief , except ELECTRA , who looks hurt . ELEANOR . Well , that suspense is over , and we are free ! But bless me ! We ca n't marry them , after all . Papa promised us first to the others , and they now claim us . DOBBINS . Were not the terms of the contract that you were to marry workmen ! GIRLS ( sadly ) . Yes , yes ! DOBBINS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not workmen , but employers . GIRLS ( eagerly ) . Yes , yes ! DOBBINS ( triumphantly ) . Then you can not be theirs ! OMNES . Saved ! saved ! ( They all kneel at the feet of DOBBINS . ) DOBBINS ( benignantly ) . Rise ! this gratitude moves me . The eye of the nobility is dim with emotion . Rise and choose . SPOKE chooses ELEANOR ; HUBBE ESTHER , TYRE SYLVIA , and the others the remaining girls ; ELECTRA being left alone . ELECTRA . But where is mine ? Am I to have none ? I suppose I 'll have to accept you . DOBBINS . No , no ! I am going to give the nobility a new sensation by marrying beneath my station , so I choose the unspoiled Polly , who never forgot hers . OMNES . Polly Chromo ! ELECTRA ( spitefully ) . A chromo given with every lord ! QUINTETTE ( reprise ) . OMNES . To this welcome proposition , Pointing matrimonially , All with instant expedition With its mandates will comply . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and work-people , followed by POUNCE and CRANK . GRIP . Ah , dancing . Enjoying yourselves instead of working . What does it mean ? CRANK . As it seems to me , I would suggest  --  GRIP . Silence ! Are you revolting ? DOBBINS . No ! It is you who are revolting . CRANK . Eminently so ! DOBBINS . This has gone far enough . I had a mystery ; hear me divulge it . CRANK . I am attentive . Let the rest retire . DOBBINS . No ! it is for all to hear . The folly of Pounce &; Co. needed a lesson . CRANK . Excuse me ; Pounce may have needed one , but the Co. , my humble self , stood in no need of  --  DOBBINS . One moment , Mr. Crank . CRANK . Make it short , then , and give somebody else a chance to speak . I have a flow of eloquence on the tip of my tongue , which  --  DOBBINS . Let it remain there for the present , Mr. Crank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I had a debt of gratitude to repay and that lesson to teach . Both are accomplished . CRANK . Are you through ? DOBBINS . Not yet . Now listen . I have consulted an eminent lawyer . CRANK . Now , if there 's anything I admire it 's an eminent lawyer . The law , from my point of view , is one of the profoundest  --  DOBBINS ( remonstrating ) . Pray , Mr. Crank  --  CRANK . I do n't feel like praying ; I want to talk . DOBBINS ( to GRIP ) . From this eminent lawyer I have learned that , as you have no written agreement with Pounce &; Co. , they are still owners of the mill and you are liable to damages for a large amount for obtaining property under false pretences . CRANK . I am struck speechless . SPOKE . I wish you were . DOBBINS . But no legal action will be taken if you return to your places as workmen ,  --  without the delicacies of the season . ( To POUNCE . ) You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust , learned your lesson . I have no longer a mystery . You once did a service to the nephew of a particular friend of mine . Lobster salad . I came here to pay that debt . I will also pay the debts of the firm . Bless you ! I am no longer Arthur Dobbins , but Lord Alfred Peerage . GRIP . Down-trodden work-people again ! It is the chance of war . I can now complain again ,  --  and suffer . POLLY . As you ought to do , you abandoned man . ELECTRA . No ! not abandoned ( throws herself on his neck ) . I 'll comfort you ; I 'll never leave you . GRIP ( aghast ) . What ? DOBBINS . Hold ! The lady 's marked attentions to you have made you liable to a suit for breach of promise , which will ruin you . Take her , and no more striking . ELECTRA . Have no fear . Henceforth I 'll do all the striking . POUNCE . And we are masters again . CRANK . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You are once more a silent partner . Thank goodness for that . ( CRANK resumes his former taciturn manner . ) From what I see , the girls have paired off . Well , I give my consent . You give yours , of course , Crank ( CRANK remains silent ) . Ah ! silence gives consent . FINALE . All our troubles now are ended ; All is as it was before ; And the broken firm is mended , As we hope , to break no more ' T is not perfect , but we never Find that anything is so ; But ' t is moved by good endeavor ; So , success to Pounce &; Co . Back matter CURTAIN .
