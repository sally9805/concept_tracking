txt In his annual message of December the President showed that of the 3,837,112 persons classed in the census as employed in manufacturing and . mining , there were only 2,623,089 " employed in such manufacturing industries as are claimed to be benefited by a high tariff . " This number is reached by deducting from the total the following : deleted table Mr. BLAINE has seized upon this statement to write an article for the current number of the American Magazine on what he is pleased to call " The President 's Error . " He starts out with the explanation that " the argument of the President , plainly though indirectly expressed , is that those not employed in what may be termed ' protected industries ' have no interest in maintaining a Protective tariff . " He proceeds to assert that carpenters and . joiners will lose the building of factories and storehouses and factory village structures if the protective system be seriously impaired ; that masons and plasterers are engaged on work " derived from enterprises that would never have come into existence but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that these , in common with all skilled laborers would " undoubtedly " have their " earnings in the aggregate reduced by millions of dollars annually " by the " arrest of manufacturing enterprises by unwise reduction of the tariff . " And he concludes by the statement that the " reduction of the tariff which he the President recommended strikes Labor a far more severe blow than it inflicts upon Capital , and that in the end its most baleful effect , if enacted into law , would . be in giving Capital an exasperating control of Labor  --  a result already attained where free trade is complete . " That Mr. CLEVELAND does not believe these assertions of Mr. BLAINE is the " error " that Mr. BLAINE denounces . So far from being an " error " the neglect or refusal of the President to adopt these naked assertions is a proof of his common sense . They are not new with Mr. BLA/NE . They have been made over and again before . The President was doubtless familiar with them , and knew them to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from being erroneous that it falls far short of the truth . Not only are the classes he mentions not benefited directly or indirectly by the high tariff , but they are injured by it . The carpenters , joiners , masons , and plasterers are injured . because the materials of their trade are made dearer , and thus the demand for their labor restricted and their wages limited . The same is true of blacksmiths and the makers of agricultural implements . It is still more true of milliners , dressmakers , seamstresses , tailors , and tailoresses . The taxes on lumber , metals , paints , on cloth and the materials of cloth , and on thread , all check the demand for employment of one or another of these classes , and increase the cost of their tools or the machinery with which or on which they work . Moreover , every member of each of these classes of working men and women , and of all others , has the cost of living increased by the taxes on building materials and on the necessaries of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman who owns a house or hires a room . no matter how small , who is not compelled . to pay tribute to the lumber barons of Michigan and Maine and . the steel and iron barons of Pennsylvania and Ohio . And , not content with this needless , unjust , and cruel increase of the burdens of every-day life , the little ring of wealthy tax-eaters , who alone get the benefit of the tariff , actually tax the housewife 's tinware , the workman 's tin dinner pail , and , every tin roof that shelters them and their children  --  for what In order that some time in the future some of them may make fortunes out of manu  - -  facturing tin , though they do not pretend to do it now . If it is an " error " for the President to ignore Mr. BLAINE 'S assumptions , what is it for Mx . BLAINE to ignore these facts ? Mr. BLAINE pretends that the tariff is essential to the prosperity of workmen not engaged in " protected industries . " It does not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the advantage ; the workmen get none . The argument is that because the tariff increases the profits of the employer he can give high wages . He can , but he does not . Take a few instances from the report of the Hon. CARROLL D. WRIGHT , the Commissioner of Labor . The blanket manufacturer gets a protection of $1 90 on a pair of blankets that cost him $2 51 . He only pays for the labor on them 35 cents , less than one-fifth of the tax . On a yard . of flannel costing 18 cents to make the employer has a protection of 8 cents ; he gives the laborer only 3 cents . On a yard of cassimere cloth costing $1 38 the employer enjoys a tax of 80 cents ; he gives his workmen only 29 cents . On a ton of steel rails costing $31 the tariff tax is $17 ; the employer  --  possibly BLAINE 'S friend CARNEGIE  --  gives his men but $7 57 . The same shameless extortion goes through the whole list of " protected " industries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laborer gets no more than he can compel the employer to pay in open competition with the laborers of the world . Competition against the employer is shut out by law . Competition with the laborer is let in . Mr. BLAINE was for a short time at the head of the diplomatic service of the United States . He did not need that schooling to learn the art of " using language to conceal the truth . "
