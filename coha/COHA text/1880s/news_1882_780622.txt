The receipts of wheat were again light , and the few car-loads of regular were quickly absorbed at the price fixed by the IdcGeoch syndicate . For the April deal , the settling price vibrated between $1 353- and $1 36 , most of the settlements being made at the outside figure . The syndicate does not seem at present it:Wined to force prices . The shorts acknowledge the situation , and can see that it would be only five minutes ' work to put the price up to $1 r.0 , and they therefore quietly walk up and settle . The future movements of the - Milwaukee clan are shrouded in mystery , but there is a widespread feeling that the deal may be carried through to the new crop , and that the July shorts will catch the worst squeeze of all . At Motteoch 's office today Si 36 was the figure for April , but if the victim kicked extra hard and pleaded a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below that mark . The uncertainty concerning the intentions of the Milwaukee clan has helped to keep the market on an even keel for all the deferred options , though much was done to-day in July and August futures . The wheat market presented the unusual condition of confidence on both sides . The bears seemed to ho satisfied that the longs have got a bigger task than they bargained for . while the longs took little notice or appeared to regard the situation with serenity . They had sold May wheat freely the day previous , and let others act OR it to-day . Private telegrams indicated that tomorrow 's statement of the visible supply will show a diminution of 800,090 to 1,000,000 bushels during last week , but lookers-on were generally disposed to think that this kind of weather would make it up-bill work for the bulls , and there was a good deal of stuff offered , some of it on outside acconnt , which boared prices . in spite of alleged " pointers " that the market is going to the neighborhood of 150 . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was quite strong at one time , but it fell hack later . The Neeley elevator matter still bangs fire . All the grain damaged by the recent conflagration has been removed , but the admission of the elevator as regular is opposed by some persons . It is suspected that the " elevator clique , " so called , does not want the Neeley in its ranks , and the wheat clique does not want to have the Neeley wheat delivered on Auril contracts . On the other hand , the men who nocepted in good faith the Neeley receipts previous to the fire and still hold them claim that it is unfair to rule them out for no act of theirs and when their property is just as good as It was at the date of purchase . A billwankee house telegraphed here to-day that $1 46 was bid there for No. 1 Duluth hard wheat . A sale of 20,000 bushels No. 2 wheat was made here to-day by the longs to a miller . The price Is understood to have been $1 28 . This is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little above it , if the proper allowance be made for the change from Winter to Summer storage . A London correspondent of a commis-4km firm in this city . writing March 4 , says : " We shall have plenty of business again when your markets get into shape . You must come down to 38s. per quarter for No. 3 Spring and about 42s. to 44s. for No. 2 Red Winter , for unless we have bad weather or anything political to influence the markets we shall have prices down to these or lower during the Summer . The constant rings and cliques on your side , which have prevented legitimate business for PO long , have raised up a competitor in India which you will never get rid ef . Fancy our having nearly 4,000,000 quarters from Bombay and liarracheo alone last season I With a little further improvement in the cultivation India will give us all the wheat we want without our taking a bushel from the United States , unless at low prices .

Those on the inside pronounced this a case of " ballast , " and this opinion generally prevailed , but the movement , independent of the weevil , tended to stiffen the market . Corn freights to Buffalo by sailing vessels were taken at 214 cents , and room was so freely offered that some shippers tried to get a two  --  cent rate . This the vessel agents did not accede to up to the hour of adjournment . The weevil scare has practically dissolved into thin air , and uo longer outs a figure . The Danville house has posted its corn receipts . Murray Nelson . owner of the National , has not determined what he will do . To-day he loaded a cargo for David Dows . The inspector kicked at the weevil when the vessel was little more than half loaded . and the result was the hurried summoning of an appeal committee .

From an examination of some samples of corn from the National , it seems that there are two varieties of the bug . One is very like the red ant oocasionally found in sugar hogsheads ; the other is black , about one-eighth of an inch in length and built very like a beetle . A blast of cold or very hot air is fatal to both kinds . The new rule to discipline Directors who fail to enforce the corner rule does not meet with much favor .
