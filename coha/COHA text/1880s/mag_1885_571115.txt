ARTICLE V.-GOVERNMENT BY PARTY . I. THE PARTY AND TRE PEOPLE . I HAVE defined in the preceding paper what I understand by the sovereignty of the people , in what sense it may be said that we have , in the phrase of Mr. Lincoln , a government of the people , by the people and for the people . The conclusion was that the people has its way to the extent that it has made up its mind . As the State is nothing but the organic association of all the constituents they are the sole source of its power , and their entire agreement upon any matter of State policy disposes of the power absolutely , determines the end and the manner of its employment beyond all possibility of resistance or evasion . In that event the will of the government , if it could be supposed to have one of its own , counts for nothing at all . It is , for example , impossible that it should so much as entertain the idea of bringing back here an hereditary aristocracy or an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undo any other of those things irrevocably settled in the convictions and purpose of the people . Given this perfect consent of the body politic , one form of government or sort of administration is about as effective as another . The most perfect adaptation of the political institutions to the people does not avail if the people is without purpose or hopelessly divided in counsel ; the most ill-adjusted and obstructive machinery suffices to do its work when it has made up its mind . It appeared further that the preeminent political quality of the American people is its capacity for coming into agreements of this unanimous and constraining character . No other community of modern times has worked its way to so many of them , while in the ancient communities the capacity of reaching them at all gave out entirely . There was a critical period in the affairs of the Roman Empire , after it had absorbed its predecessors one by one , when the vast population upon which it was based lost what we may call its nervous irritability and power to react , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // insensible to the encroachments of the government . It ceased to divide upon the issues submitted to it ; and abandoned to its rulers not only the initiative inseparable from all government but the nncontested disposal of the whole power of the State . But a people insensible to the provocations , is also a people incapable of participating in the action , of the State . It turned out that the governing body , confirmed in the exclusive possession of power , was shut off from the natural sonrces of its supply . At last over-burdened and overworked it gave ont in the exhanstion of its own reactions , bringing the whole fabric down with it . None of the German , or Germanized , commnnities which have arisen among the ruins of the Roman Empire have as yet shown any signs of this abstention of the people or this isolation of the government . Even where the qnality of the ancient blood and the pressure of ancient institutions tell with most effect the non-governing class shows something of the German vitality , and what is quite decisive of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any previous stage of its development for a thousand years . It is increasingly able to respond to the initiatives of the government , while every successive response puts it in possession of a clearer political consciousness and a higher political capacity . However slowly it moves , it does move , continuously* toward a wider distribution of the sovereign prerogative and a larger accumulation of the sovereign power . I suppose it would be admitted anywhere that this capability of prompt and efficient reaction of the body politic is found at its best in the youngest of contemporary communities , the American Republic . Its vitality seems to be higher , its sensibility more acute . Any commotion at the organic centre is followed by discharges along all the lines of transmission to the extremities and motive apparatus of the system ; that is , dropping the figure , any action of the government takes immediate effect beyond it , putting into motion the men who approve and the men who disapprove ; who in turn commnnicate the impulse to the inattentive and unconcerned , until the whole mass is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Now for a people of the right temper and in fitting political circumstances , this is the kind of // trouble that begets order , and the kind of conflict from which comes agreement . Our brightest lights have been struck out in the collisions of hostile bodies that come together from opposite sides of some question raised by the action of the government . Each of the contestants plays his opinion for all it is worth , brings it forth in its most exhaustive statement and its highest possible relief . When the opposing alternatives have been thus sifted in the excitements of popular controversy from irrelevant and confusing accessories , comparison between them becomes easy and a choice is soon made . Here again it will probably not be disputed that the American comniunity is in advance of its contemporaries . As it accepts the issues presented to it more promptly , so does it find its way mere promptly out of them than any other . It refuses to rest in the futilities of interminable debate , to *terniser la situation as the French say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . This is what Mr. Arnold really refers to in his recent paper as that intelligence of the American which sees so straight and sees so clear . In this way a multitude of questions still in dispute , or not so much as raised elsewhere , have been finally settled here , and have yielded those great regulative ideas which animate and control the whole machinery of our government . The paradoxes or the distant dream of foreign politics , they are the realities and commonplaces of ours ; the habitual , the almost instinctive and inconscious axioms in virtue of which the people is absolutely supreme in its own domain . But in recognizing actual results it is not at all necessary to credit ourselves , as we so often do , with any special favor of that overruling Providence which is supposed to have the fortunes of the democracy at heart , or with any exceptional genius and virtue of our own . The truth is that , along no doubt with a remarkable amount of political capability , we have in large measure been forced into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inexorable logic of the situation . The founders of our State got out of Europe with the most advanced ideas of the 17th century ; on arrival here they found themselves relieved at once , by sheer force of geographical isolation , of the ponderous burdens and active interference which still obstruct those ideas in the Europe of to-day . That // was what they came for and what they found . A hundred years later when political independence was added to geographical separation , we had the good fortune to begin our career as a people with the doctrine which has been the goal of all political evolution since the rise of society , the doctrine that the control and the benefits of power should go back where they belong , namely to those who furnish it ; that the constituents , whose association for common ends is what we call the State , should determine its forms and profit by its action . But this , it is clear , is a generalization of the widest kind , a principle whose adoption commits us to all its consequences one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their coming and the shape in which they come have been determined by events , but the necessity of accepting each in its turn and time has existed from the first . We have been caught in the toils of a stringent and beneficent syllogism which , in the last resort , has saved us from the " fumbling " and " floundering " of foreign politics by forcing us to vote the conclusions whose premises we had voted before . Accordingly it will be found that the agreements into which the American people has come hitherto are all related as parts of a whole , and bear upon a single point . From the first proclamation of the revolted provinces down to the adoption of the 15th amendment to the constitution they are concerned with the constituent unit of the system , and taken together supply an exhaustive definition of the person of the citizen in his relations to the State ; his responsibilities as one of the contributors to its power , his prerogative as joint-owner of the power so created , and his right to a proportional part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respects he is declared to be the peer of each of his associates in the association , to have an equal measure of responsibility , of prerogative , and of right , and to have no more . The only class distinctly known to our polity is the class of offenders , who have forfeited their prerogative and right in the measure of their offending . They are our kakistocracy , and are recognized in specific provisions of the law for the purpose of being punished and put down . The exception to this statement is the political position of women who constitute a class because their relation to the // State has not been perfectly defined except in certain omissions and negations . The reason for this is not in their political demerit or incapacity , which has not been put to the proof . It is in the fact that , unlike other outlying classes which have found their way to a share in the sovereignty , they have never made themselves troublesome to the State . Whenever woman , or the friends and foes of woman , create @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abolitionist created for the black race , she will find her place in the system all ready and waiting for her . Until that is done it will stand empty . Even under our generous polity no class has got anything it was not ready to fight for and to make itself disagreeable about if it did not get it . We do n't vote any of the conclusions to our premises until the occasion arises and we are obliged to . With this one omission the long era which has just closed has solved its problems and finished its work by decisive agreements of the people which perfectly define the person of the constituent in his relations to the State . But it has not done this for the property of the constituent , although nothing can be more evident than that the possession of property intimately concerns all his political relations . He ha* more to contribute to the joint-power of the association and more benefits accrue to him , but how much more ? And should he not have a prerogative proportioned to his responsibilities and rights ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into account and finally disposed of . The reason again is evident . It is partly because the relations of person are the fundamental ones and naturally present themselves first , partly because they are much simpler and easier of definition , and most of all because , as in the case already referred to , those who are directly interested have not forced the issue by making trouble about it . Like the women the owners of property have suffered so little or so willingly , or have been so little conscious of suffering , that they have not made the definition of the rights and responsibilities of property a State necessity . But that they are about to do so is manifest by a thousand unmistakable signs . Already we may say that the specific questions of the era we are entering will be questions of wealth in all its aspects , social as well as political , and that the new agreements into which the // American people will come are agreements defining the relations of citizens as owners of property to the State . Standing therefore as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history , the point where one era closes and another opens , we may profitably inquire how the new questions arise out of the old ones , and what obstructions are likely to get in the way of the people in settling them ; what special interests or prejudices will confuse the issues and prolong the controversy , and what agencies they will be able to dispose of to effect this end . This is the really picturesque and instructive phase of our politics , when the action of the government brings the opposing forces into the field , and the inattentive mass of the people , troubled in the preoccupations of its daily life , is gradually involved in the controversy , and at last ends it by making up its mind . I. In t856 the policy of the government as maintained for many years had distinctly committed the State to the doctrine that the negro , including the child of a white parent with any trace of negro blood in its veins , although presumably a human being , was no person in the eye of the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the panther or the alligator , as Mr. Douglass was good enough to allow , but what the Darwinists call an animal nuder domestication , to be worked without wages , coupled without marriage , punished without trial , and sold without his consent . This being so it followed according to the Fugitive Slave Law , a perfectly logical enactment , that the owner could pursue his stray cattle into the States where the negro was a political person ; and according to the Dred Scott decision , another piece of pure logic , that he could drive his herds , his bullocks and horses and hogs and niggers-for the creature had gotten a name that fitted it-into all the territories of the United States . The gathering disgust and wrath of the nnwilling accomplices of this high reasoning at last decided that the line must really be drawn somewhere , and drew it in the unreasonable proposition that slavery must go no farther than it had gone already-as if a thing fit to be left anywhere were not good enough to go everywhere . In the election of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the voters , and their representatives took the government pledged // to the exclusion of slavery from the territories of the United States . Within six weeks they had added the proposition , good logic this time , that for a State to levy war on the United States is armed rebellion to be put down with arms ; within eight years the propositions that the negro is a person , that he is a citizen , and that the right of citizens to vote shall not be denied or abridged on account of race , color , or previous condition of servitude . These were the ideas of the Republican party , that the State must stand intact and entire , and stand to maintain the political equality of all its constituents whatever their differences of culture , religion , fortune , birth , or race . Now let us carefully observe this situation , for it contains the standing anomaly of our own as of every other representative system . We say that the people governs here by virtue of certain ideas which it has in common-as that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ male citizens over 21 shall have the right to vote  --  and about which it has made up its mind . But the government , meaning thereby the men through whom the people governs , do not represent these ideas , or rather are not chosen because they represent them , for any other set of men , for example the men who have just gone out of office , would do that quite as well . They are chosen for the very reason that they do not represent them-any better than anybody else , and do represent the ideas of a part of the people . The Republicans were not even an absolute majority of all the voters of the country , but the representatives they had chosen took possession of the State , with the whole available power of the State , to coerce the will of the other half , or even more than half of the people . By what right and for what purpose ? We are so habituated to this as the natural and necessary result of the working of our institutions that we fail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to look upon the submission of the less number , although guilty of no offence , to the greater as the very end for which the State exists , as if the majority had that infallibility and absolute right to rul7e pretended to elsewhere by the monarchy or the theocracy . Yet it is clear that these things are not born with a mere majority . They may be claimed , and have often been actually held , if by anybody , // by the minority . The Republicans for example were as much in the right in 1856 when beaten as in 1860 when victorions . The transfer of a single vote may create a constitutional majority  --  the transfer of a thousand votes in New York did create it the other day  --  and would carry the whole power of the State with it ; but it could not create more than a constitutional right . Accordingly the real end of the State with ns , that to which everything else is a means , is not in the least that one part of the constituents may rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is verily meant to be a government of the people and not merely of the Whig , or Democratic , or Republican party . If therefore we invariably hand over the government to the representatives of the majority and to no one else , we do so for the time being , in a tentative and provisional manner , because with all its obvious inequality and inconvenience this is better than the other alternative , the rule of the minority ; better , not in a vagne and general way , as if somehow the right must be on the side of the bigger battalions , bitt in this specific way that it is better fitted to bring us in the end to the rule of the people . Our fundamental assumption is that , whatever their differences of opinion for the moment , all men are reasonable beings at bottom and fit for self-government ; and we simply argue that when there are differences the greater number are more likely to be correct in their reasoning than the less , and therefore more likely to bring the less number , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is to bring about the ultimate agreement and rule of the whole people . So we deliver the State to the party victorious at the polls and we say to them , You hold that Slavery should be restricted to the area it occupies already . Your adversaries hold that it should go into all the territories of the United States . With the resources of the government at their disposal they have failed to convince you who are the greater number . Therefore do you take the government and convince them . Y on have outvoted them , you are presnmnably in the right ; now bring yonr doctrine to the tests of public and official experiment , put it into the form of law and enforce the law against anyone who resists it . You add that as the negro is a man he ought to be free , to be a citizen , and a voter . Very well , make him // so and see what will come of it . Your mission is to do with your doctrine what your predecessors could not do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a universal and abiding agreement of the people . This is the meaning of popular suffrage and the appeal to the ballot ; it is even , in the case of civil war , the meaning of the appeal to arms . What I said of the law in its first enactment , that it is a conjecture and an experiment , an interrogation put to the constituency whom it concerns , is true of the rule of the majority in general and the initiative of government confided to it . The opposing parties express the opposite alternatives of the question which divides the people ; the party outvoting the other conquers the right to take the government provisionally , that in governing it may bring the alternative it stands for to practical tests and so convince the people that it is the only possible or the better one of the two . If we are out in our calculation here , if all this searching ordeal and public exposure are unavailing to bring forth the truth and the right to the satisfaction of all men , then our system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the perpetuation of the majority in power becomes a despotism of the most authentic and formidable kind . In the name of ideas which it will not relinguish and can not propagate it confiscates to itself the dignities and emoluments of the State , to rule against the will and at the expense of its victims . Nor is the situation bettered when the people is divided into two rival bodies , with incommunicable ideas and irreconcilable interests , who dispute the possession of the government on nearly equal terms . In that case our political history becomes a war of ruinous reprisals between alternating despotisms , each body in turn the oppressor and the victim of the other . If what the Senatorelect of New York said not long ago is true , that the two great parties are in principle and temper what they were twenty-five years ago , then it is nearly certain that they will be what they are now twenty-five years hence ; that is we have got here in chronic form that very dualism of the State which we were supposed to have escaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by universal accords . It concerns therefore the honor of the American people , // 683 Government by Party . whose institutions and character are in question , to repel this impntation upon the Republican party . Now if ever is the time for all men to remind one another how magnificently it did its work . It has just gone out of office , not gloriously . Gone out why ? Because it had failed ? I say no , but because it had succeeded . It did not take office for the paltry purpose of putting its adversaries out , but for the purpose of making its ideas good and therewithal , in the truest and noblest sense of the words , of bringin9 its adversaries in . Its task was to convince them and all men of the shocking unreason of a free State founded on the atrocities of slavery and triumphant over the ruins of the Republic ; to carry out to its logical conclusions the consecrated doctrine which puts this country in the forefront of civilization , that all men who contribute to the power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its benefits ; in a word , to close the first great era of our history by fixing forever the authoritative definition of the personal responsibility , prerogative , and right of each member of the association . It is not only a dishonor to the Republican Party and to the North , which for this purpose was Republican , to deny that this was done ; it is absurd . What if it be true that the rancors of the war still live in the breast of many an impenitent rebel , or that persistent animosities of race obstruct the progress of the emancipated slave ? All this inevitable Jacobinism and Bourbonism , with its unavailing retrospects and regrets , is impotent against its own conviction that there is to be no slavery here and no disruption of the Union for the sake of it . it has been discovered and is acknowledged all round that the North , victorious at the polls and on the battle-field , was right in its reasoning . What were a little while ago the convictions of a belligerent party are to-day the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this came true the retention of the government by the Republican party became an unmeaning anachronism . A portion of the constituents can have no reasonable pretensions to rule over or rather than the other portion in virtue of ideas and purposes which are common to all . He who was a slaveholder and a rebel , or is still a Democrat , is as good a Republican as anybody to the extent that he has accepted // the Republican principles . The party has disappeared by assimilation so that it is no longer distinguishable in doctrine from the mass of the people which is now at one . Nothing was more evident throughout the late campaign than that the wind had been completely taken out of its sails by the assent of everybody to all it had ever contended for . Having lost its distinctiveness , its continuing rai8on d'e*tre , why should it continue to hold as its own the honors and profits of government ? This was the question really voted on at the polls , and no pout . ical party was ever caught in a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its long control of affairs had left the people unconvinced that its doctrine was the true American doctrine  --  the confession of Mr. Evarts-in which case it deserved like its predecessors , to be turned out as a preposterous failure ; or that the people was convinced , in which case its mission was ended . As a matter of fact it had perfectly converted its opponents , and in converting them had prepared their return to power upon any new issue which gave them a majority . But was it reduced to this dilemma through no negligence or error of its own ? A party so long in administration must have either failed or succeeded in vindicating its original ideas . Is it necessary that it relinquish office as the consequence alike of failure and of success ? Nothing would seem more unreasonable if we consider that in the invaluable matter of experience and training it is never so fit to remain as at the moment it is called upon to retire , while its opponents are never so little prepared to come in . This consideration has often told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It has been widely felt that apart from all differences of opinion long exclusion has disqualified its leaders for taking the places of men whose lives had been passed in the responsibilities of practical administration ; a feeling justified by the fact that they had repeatedly been guilty at critical moments of that passionate and reckless action begotten of irresponsibility and the disuse of power . But besides this there is nothing in the natural relations of parties to one another , or to the State , which requires the party in power to give way to the other . The rights and the liberties of the opposition are not in the // least dependent on the return of its representatives to office . What makes the rnle of the majority a despotism is not any , even indefinite , continuance of it , for in that case to rule at all would be in some measure despotic ; it is its continuing to rule in virtue of ideas which it can not persuade the opposition to accept , or of ideas which the opposition has accepted . In any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest form of party government possible , that in which previous experiences are utilized and the continuity and coherence of public measures assured . II . Accordingly there was a way out of the dilemma so obvious with all its difficulty , that the humblest political intelligence , or at any rate the highly trained intelligence of the Republican leaders , ought not to have missed it . All they had to do in order to retain the government in the interest of the entire constituency was to hold their majority by rightly anticipating the new issues ; having converted one set of partisan ideas into abiding agreements of the people , to find in the conclusions of their own logic and the altered state of affairs other ideas waiting for the same treatment . They had made themselves unnecessary by settling for all time the questions of one era ; they had only to make themselves indispensable by fitly raising the questions of another . This was so far from being denied to them as one of the privileges of power that it was , in theory at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of government is confided to any body of men , first of all , no doubt , to give effective expression to the will of the party by whom they are elected . But this does not exhaust or begin to exhaust the whole right and obligation of initiative . The doctrine and purpose of the party , however far-seeing and comprehensive they may be , can not possibly cover all the prospective exigencies of a great community in active evolution , or even those exigencies nearest at hand as the immediate consequence of the party 's action. * From the situation actually * Here belongs the much debated question of the extent of the obedience due by a representative to his constituency . The principle is a simple one . So far as the constituency , or the party , has made up its mind and issued a clear and imperative mandate to him at the time of his election , he is absolutely bound to obey , as the government in general is absolutely bound by the agreement and expressed will of the peo // acquired in settling past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differences requiring further agreements of the people . They concern everybody alike , and one party as much as the other ; but it belongs to the government to take the first cognizance of them because , as the sole depository of public power , it must take action upon them . It can not refuse the initiative if it would ; the very refusal to act raises the issue as distinctly as any action . It has only the option between putting itself and its party in the right or in the wrong , between a political blunder and political success . This being so , all men are concerned that its action should be a wise one , determined by sound deductions from fundamental principles settled in the past , and by clear provisions of the agreements into which the people must come in the future . That it should be so mistaken in its estimates as to put the State from the start on the wrong side of the new issue , should make of it an aberrant and obstructive power which must be gotten out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be a disaster to both parties alike ; for the parties , however interested in prolonging the controversy , are after all the people , and the interest of the people is to end controversy and settle the principle as promptly as possible . Here , too , it must be added , are all the real dignity and pleasure of governing . To the extent that the people , or even pie . He need not have accepted the mandate had he disapproved , and he ought in honor to resign if his opinions change . But for all public interests not covered by the mandate he is bound only by his own conscience and reason . Any new instructions issued to him after his election are advisory and not mandatory . If he disapproves of them he should resist them and should retain office in the interest of the people for the express purpose of making his resistance effective . So of a delegate to a party convention . He is bound by the instructions he accepts with the notification of his election , but in no manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty of a representative is in the nature of things undefined and indefinable so far as his functions are prospective and concern interests of the people upon which the people has not yet divided . It is essential to his proper discharge of it that his right of private judgment should be protected from all encroachments even of his principals . They have in fact chosen him for the distinct purpose of using his own reason in all cases where they have not already furnished him precise instructions . // that the party has made up its mind , the government is the helpless instrument of the will of another and its action so far automatic and mechanical . But where the people , although its interests are in question , is unconcerned or divided in counsel , there the government recovers its freedom of choice and the use of all its faculties . It has now to deal with an element of the incalculable , to adjust its measures , not to the precise instructions of State or party documents , but to novel emergencies and all the undetermined applications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it possesses , it must decide for itself which one of several alternatives will get the better of the others in the impending trial ; a question of high and attractive dialetics , troubled by all the thousand hazards of popular controversy , but steadied by one immovable certainty , that the American people can never be permanently united upon any conclusion at war with the principle which expresses its abiding political conscience . In this instance everything apparently invited the government to prompt and courageous action . The new ideas it required for maintaining the party majority and justifying its retention of power were all there , perfectly defined and obtruded upon its notice by the situation it had itself created . On the one hand the close of the war had left the State burdened with a current expenditure and a capital debt so great as to modify the political relations of every person in it . When we reflect that , directly or indirectly , all public power is now created by contributions of money and exercised by disbursements of money , it may almost be said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revQlution as the admission of the slave to the constituency . How was the enormous burden to be apportioned ? By the rough-and-ready taxation of the war ? But it was found that the war tariff was yielding a revenue far beyond the needs of the State after the war had ended . For whose benefit was this sudden surplus to be spent , and how was the diminishing burden to be redistributed ? The double question of taxation and expenditure in all its details , the readjustment of the entire fiscal system of the United States , was at once thrown forward as the imperative and commanding problem of the time . Equally on the other hand , its solution // was to be had only in a further application of iRepublican doctrine , now declared and admitted to be authentic American doctrine . What has been affirmed to be true of the unit of the constituency which makes up the State must be accepted as true of the unit of property which supplies the power of the State . Every constituent is , in his person , the peer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with equal rights . But his responsibilities and rights , so far as the creation of a State power are concerned , are , as I have said , almost wholly those of an owner of wealth . He may indeed be called upon to serve on a jury or a poe*e comitatue or in a conscription , but in general what is required of him is a payment of money . To discriminate between any unit of his wealth and any unit of another man 's is to deny at once , in the matter of most concern , that he is the peer , or that he is no more than the peer , of any other constituent . You can not tax him beyond the uniform rate for everybody without violating political rights you have just consecrated ; or tax him under the uniform rate without remitting responsibilities you have just exacted . Precisely so of expenditure , when any man is paid more or less than the equivalent of his services , which is the uniform rule for all . There was absolutely nothing left to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their own creating with the direct conclusions of their own doctrine ; by a new initiative to sweep out of the constituency the new inequalities , to suppress the classes brought into being by the stupendous development of the money power of the State , as they had suppressed the slave-holder and the slave . But pure logic of this wide-seeing and comprehensive kind is as rare in politics , or even in statesmanship , as pure disinterestedness , and the two will probably come together if they ever come at all . The kind of reasoning which deduces the Fugitive Slave Law from the obtrusive and insistent fact of slavery is abundant enough , but not the reasoning which fathoms the character of a great people in all the phases of its long development , and from the accordant traditions of the past foresees the certainty of its unanimous agreements in the future . That is a philosophy which we need not look for until we get a race of public men lifted above the reach of personal interests and // the strife of parties by their intelligence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With that sort of men in power the initiative of government would acquire a quality and a strength it has never had in any State ; and would avail to reduce the obstructive rivalries of parties to their just limits , to shorten all our controversies and hasten all our final settlements by putting the State on the right side of every issue at the start . But we have not got men of that sort , nor are likely to have them , in sufficient number to determine the character of the government . What we have is what we have always had and what other States have , men , often of abundant ability and high character , but who shrink from any action not demanded , or suggested , by the party , or by some state of public opinion likely to affect the immediate fortunes of the party . As I have said no class with us gets anything it is not prepared to make trouble about if it does not get it ; and the same thing is true of the general interests of the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State should be recalled from its perversions and brought under the general law that all public power is to be furnished at the cost and exerted for the benefit of all the constituents alike . But the mere certainty that the people will never be at one until the reform is effected does not suffice to prompt the action of the government ; there must be the further certainty that it is distinctly and resolutely bent on effecting it , or that some formidable body is . In the absence of salutary pressure of that kind the government will surely yield to pressure , never wanting , of another , the urgency of the classes which have grown up around the abuses of public power and whose prosperity depends upon their perpetuation . We need not wonder , therefore , that exactly as the question of the personal rights and responsibilities of the constituent was raised in its final form by the alliance of the government with the slave-holder , so the question of his rights and responsibilities as the owner of wealth has been raised by the alliance of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the State on the wrong side of the question both times .
