HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW . YOUTH never forgets the earliest vis - ion of the gracious presence which glorified its opening day . The impression of it deepens with years , and is at no time so vivid as in late life , when new sensations come rarely , if at all , and old ones , felt when the mind was plastic and receptive , steal out from the background of experience . One whose youth is far behind him recalls distinctly a figure which appeared many times at a house in Summer Street , where lived a man of letters , scholar and poet , about whom the fine spirits of the day clustered . To my boyish fancy , the name Longfellow had a strange , unfamiliar , foreign sound , as that of some inhabitant of a distant sphere ; but a sight of its owner dispelled any such whirnsical vagaries . It was a clear-cut figure , of middle size , handsome , erect , the countenance cheerful , the step buoyant , the manner cordial , the voice mellow and musical ; a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man , with character and cultivation iu it , - the voice of a gentleman and a scholar . His conversation had a jocund flavor , as if he enjoyed his thoughts about books and the men who wrote them . It was pleasant ; not deep , but hearty and appreciative ; flowing in a full , easy stream along the channels of literature , making music as it flowed . The great masters of song he loved without respect to their nationality , their age , or their creed ; taking them on their merits , and rendering hearty honor to their genius , it mattering little to him whether they wrote in English , French , German , Italian , Spanish . When the youth met , a few years later , at Harvard College , the professor of modern languages and literatures , he found the same delightful person . The ordinary lecture-rooms being occupied , Longfellow met his classes in a kind of parlor , carpeted and furnished with comfortable chairs . The comparative elegance was so completely in keeping with the teacher and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and for the hour seemed to be no peculiarity at all . The professor sat and read his lecture in a simple manner , showing an entire familiarity with whatever concerned the literature of the subject ; never discussing points of philosophical difficulty , never diving into abysses of abstraction or rising to heights of speculation , but fully equipped for the task of translation and exposition , especially the former , in which he excelled . his style of writing was flowing , picturesque , abounding in literary illustration , exuberant in imagery ; more than pleased the prosaic members of the class , but none too florid for the imaginative and enthusiastic . This was about 1840 . Mr. Longfellow , though a young man , was accomplished and even learned in his department . He had published Outre - Mer and Hyperion . He had written the essays on Frithiof 's Saga , Anglo - Saxon Literature , Dante . He had traveled in Northern Europe , Germany , France , Spain , Italy , observing and studying as he went . He had read many books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as William of Malmesbury , Bede , Turner , Fh4chier ; the early Italian poets , - Ciullo d'Alcamo , Brunetto Latini , Beato Benedetti , Guido Guinicelli , Guittone d'Arezzo ; the NibelungenLieds , the Helden-Buebs , the songs of Minnesingers and Meistersingers ; the strange allegories , legends , and fables embodied in German Yolk - lore ; the Ship of Fools , Reynard the Fox ; the quaint stories which furnished themes for later dramatists , romancers , poets . He had made translations from the // 820 German , the Spanish , the Italian , the Swedish . He had the passion for elegant wisdom which made him patient , laborious , careful , exact , and the conscientiousness that compelled him to gleau every scrap of information which his occupation required . His courtesy was proof against the rudeness of the boys , and his readiness to answer questions was inexhaustible . He was not jocose , humorous , or witty , but he was always gentle , kind , sympathetic , generous ; meeting the young men as a gentleman should meet gentlemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn , quite in the spirit of his own saying in the printed Table Talk : " There is so much aspiration in them , so much audacious hope and trembling fear , that all errors and short-comings are for a while lost sight of in the amiable self-assertion of youth . " lie could not lose his dignity or his suavity , and he was more than good to any who took interest in noble or beautiful things , giving them welcome to his library , and opening to them the storehouse of his mind . My meetings with him in the classroom were few , but they stand out in memory with a vividness in singular contrast with their rarity , showing how much their quality was superior to their quantity . The drudgery of teaching the rudiments was committed to tutors , an inferior grade of instructors , - an arrangement which left him free to follow the leading of his genius over the high levels of literature . Many years afterwards , while spending an evening at his house in Cambridge , I met William IDempster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a final tour in the United States , and coming , as celebrities of every kind did , to visit the hospitable poet . He sat at the piano and sang Enid 's song from Tennyson 's Idylls . " Turn , Fortune , turn thy wheel and lower the proud ; Turn thy wild wheel through sunshine , storm , and cloud ; Thy wheel and thee we neither love nor hate . " June , It was interesting to watch the poet 's face as the music proceeded ; to note the complete absence of self-consciousness , the simple , cordial appreciation of the noble words , and the courteous reception of the rather indifferent adaptation - of them by the musician . The poet was a member of the family , for whose entertainment , and not for his own honor the performance was given . Yet by this time his fame was established as one of the most popular poets of the century , and he might have set himself up as an oracle , if not as an idol . By this time the poems of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to literary cultivation . Young people read them . Lovers took them into the woods . Old people had the volume in their hands as they sat musing by the firelight . The bereaved repeated them over and ever , and thought more tenderly of their dead . The lonely , disappointed , tired , desponding , knew them by heart . The longing , aspiring , struggling , repeated them with fervor . In hours of leisure , weariness , weakness , thoughtful men and women were soothed and uplifted by the melodious verse . It was poetry of the heart in its peaceful , not in its martial , moods , and it met those moods not lackadaisically , but hopefully , cheerily , bravely . It was customary then to say that his poetry was sentimental . So it was , but the sentiment was healthy , sweet , and true , such as the best , even the most* high-souled and intellectual , know at times , or ought to know ; such as the large majority of men and women rest in at their highest moments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sentiment which fills with most the place of reasoning , with some is a substitute for faith ; a sentiment , tender , humane , devout , trusting , submissive , but manly , touching all objects with romantic charm , associating the lowest with some human interest , connecting the highest with the mysteriousness of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. // 1882 . Henry Wadsworth Longfellow . Providence and the unchanging benignity of God . A strain of pathetic hope , veneration , awe , ran through it . A temper of happy resignation breathed in it . In its way it was religious . In his own language it seemed to say , " Round about what is lies a whole mysterious world of what might be , - a psychological romance of possibilities and things that do not happen . By going out a few minutes sooner or later , by stopping to speak with a friend at a corner , by meeting this man or that , or by turning down this street instead of the other , we may let slip some great occasion of good or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our lives would have been changed . There is no possible solution to the dark enigma but the one word , Providence . " The state of mind expressed in these words , the common state of bewilderment and perplexity under which such multitudes suffer , is met by this simply human poet as it never was met before , in language so choice , so simple , so sincere , so various , so musical , that all can understand , and in certain moods enjoy it . The great masters are out of reach and difficult to comprehend , and besides that their lines suggest " life 's endless toil and endeavor ; " they rather apologize for than sympathize with the softer emotions of the soul , allowing for them , but excusing them as a weakness of human nature . Here is a poet who accepts them , appeals to them , builds upon them , takes them for granted as a holy attribute , puts them forward as ministers of heaven , to serve as guides to the immortal seats . To ordinary humanity this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be the most exalted state of man , but , seeing that it is the lot of the great majority to do so , we ought to be profoundly grateful to the man who takes them as they are , and carries them higher on the power of their own wings . Thus regarded , what is made Longfellow 's reproach should be accounted his glory . The charge of being European more than American has been urged by another class of minds . It is alleged , and not without truth , that he was indebted to the Old World for his mental furniture ; that his culture , his taste , his habitual cast of thought , were foreign , and lacked the flavor of his native soil . To some extent the criticism is just , but it should not be pushed beyond reasonable limits . Longfellow was essentially a romantic poet . This appears in some of his . earliest poems , written before his first visit to Europe , while yet a youth at college . The closing verse of Sunrise on the Hills suggests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beset With sorrows , that thou wouldet forget , If thou wouldst read a lesson , that will keep Thy heart from fainting and thy soul from sleep , Go to the woods and hills ! No tears Dim the sweet look that Nature wears . " The lines on the Spirit of Poetry express the same or a kindred sentiment : " And this is the sweet spirit , that doth fill The world ; and , in these wayward days of youth , My busy fancy oft embodies it , As a bright image of the light and beauty That dwell in nature ; of the heavenly forms We worship in our dreams , and the soft hues That stain the wild-bird 's wing , and flush the clouds When the sun sets . " Outre-Mer is really a " pilgrimage beyond the sea , " saturated with the very spirit of the Old World ; a good deal more than a record of travel in strange lands , it is a hearty reproduction of the foreign soil , scenery , mode of life , habit of feeling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable of . It breathes the atmosphere of France , Spain , Italy . It shows a lover 's delight in legend and song . There is no homesickness in the book , no retrospect except of a fabulous past , which in America has no existence . The second book , Hyperion , is frankly called a romance . The author had been a professor nearly ten years , at Bowdoin and at Harvard , // Julie , yet his duties , instead of blunting the edge of his feeling , seem to have made it keener . The volume is overcharged with foreign sentiment . The traveler revels in European lore . His quaint conceits , his curious learning , his fondness for color , his passion for music and tale , enrich every page . He is at home in Germany , at Frankfort , heidelberg , Nuremberg . The Epistle Dedicatory to the first edition of Outre - Mer ( 1833 ) craves the reader 's " forbearance for having thought that even the busiest mind might not be a stranger to those moments of repose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and trifles become the amusement of the wise and great . " And in the hook itself the author confesses , for his own part , " that there are seasons when he is willing to be the dupe of his imagination ; and if this harmless folly but lends its wings to a dull-paced hour , he is even ready to believe a fairy tale . " Leaving out the words " trifles " and " folly , " we may accept this as the poet 's conception of his office , namely , to give repose and cheer to the busy mind by touching the chords of melody in the heart . At the same time , in his sympathies he was a true American , as any reader of his poetry may see . By conviction and conscience , as well as by birth and circumstance of life , he belonged to the foremost rank of believers in republican institutions . Even as poet he did so . In a review of Hawtborne 's TwiceTold Tales , written in 1837 , he notes as one of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the author has chosen his themes among the traditions of New England . " This is the right material for story . Truly , many quaint and quiet customs , many comic scenes and strange adventures , many wild and wondrous things , fit for humorous tale and soft , pathetic story , lie all about us here in New England . There is no tradition of the Rhine nor of the Black Forest which surpasses in beauty that of the Phantom Ship of New Haven . The Flying Dutchman of the Cape and the Klaboterman of the Baltic are nowise superi or . The story of Peter Rugg , the man who could not find Boston , is as good as that told by Gervase of Tilbury of a man who gave himself to the devils by an unfortunate imprecation , and was used by them as a wheelbarrow ; and the Great Carbuncle of the White Mountains shines with no less splendor than that which illuminated the subterranean palace in Rome , as related by William of Malmesbury . " Many of his own best known pieces , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Evangeline , said to be the author 's favorite , The Song of Hiawatha , The Courtship of Miles Standish , the Poems on Slavery , The Building of the Ship , The Wreck of the Hesperus , The Arsenal at Springfield , The Village Blacksmith , and numerous poems not so well known , the suggestion of which came from local objects , and the imagery of which recalls familiar things . Therefiective habit of his muse soon carried him away from his starting-point , whether it lay in the New World or in the Old , and made his verses human , but the flight was taken from his native land more often than is commonly supposed . True , he seldom chose a theme which did not present a romantic aspect . He transfigured Evangeline , he idealized the Indian , he exalted Miles Standish , he saw the dreamy , pathetic side of the negro . In carefully re - reading the passage above quoted , we can not overlook the fact that he compares the New World favorably with the Old , on the ground that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spots as much color , is susceptible of as romantic treatment . The elements of romance , he would say , are the same all over the earth . " It seems as natural to make tales " ( and poems too , we may add ) " out of old , tumble - down traditions as canes and // snuff-boxes out of old steeples , or trees planted by great men . The dreary old Puritanical times begin to look romantic in the distance . " Naturally , a poet of this order seeks his material where there is the best chance of finding it ; and , beyond question , it is more abundant in Germany , Holland , Flanders , than in New England or any of the United States . Still , he did use the native product whenever he could find it , and sometimes , perhaps , thought he found it where it did not exist . For the rest , should we not he grateful to the man who diffused the softening haze of sentiment , though it were foreign , since no other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts of our common American life ; to the man who imparted something of the spirit of Spain and Italy to the sandy coast of the Atlantic and the monotonous prairies of the West ; to the man who did for Massachusetts , Louisiana , Texas , in part at least , what Irving did for the Hudson River and the Catskills ? Longfellow is still an American poet , though with a European fancy ; and Americans should love him all the more because the fancy irradiated places which were prosaic before he came . The Poems on Slavery were written in 1842 , when the agitation was in the moral phase , before the republican party was formed , nearly twenty years before the final appeal to arms . The poet was at that period personally intimate with men who afterwards were leaders in the political battle . That the pieces express intense feeling , and performed their part in forming the public sentiment of the North , can not be doubted . That they were never followed up , that they were almost forgotten , allowed to sink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abhorrence of violence in word or deed . He was a man of peace beyond his friend Charles Sumner , who pronounced an oration on it . Yet when Sumner died no garland on his grave was more tender or lovely than Longfellow 's : - " His was the troubled life , The conflict and the pain ; The grief , the bitterness of strife , The honor without stain . " In a country where political animos*-ties ran high , and party vituperation flew about at random , the gentle poet withdrew into the solitude of his study . During the war he made no public demonstration , nor was quoted either in defense or in reprobation of any public policy ; yet his loyalty was never called in question , nor was the course of his sympathy ever misunderstood . Whoever penetrated even a little way beneath the surface found an enthusiasm for liberty as hearty , a faith in justice as firm , a confidence in the final issue as lofty , as any combatant could desire . In a country where there was no national church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and where , consequently , theological opinions were vehemently debated , he kept his religious thoughts to himself ; but he was an honest friend to liberty of inquiry , and associated himself with those who put it sincerely into practice . He was no controversialist , no sectary . Religion , with him , was an affair of the heart rather than of the intellect , and , for his part , he was content to believe reasonably . At one time the Roman Catholics claimed him as being of their communion , finding justification in certain generous words that came from his pen in praise of some cathedral , rite , or holy custom . But it was merely a touch of sentiment , a spark of that broad , poetic feeling which recognized beauty under all forms of ritual . He was a poet , and he was religious : that is the whole secret . A religious reformer he certainly was not , could not be . He could not be a partisan or a polemic . But shall it be reckoned against him that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convictions ; that he was silent yet devout , noncommittal yet worshipful ? Most of the dissent about us is indifference ; most // of the dumbness is denial . If he did not speculate , at least he did not quarrel , denounce , or sit down in sullen discontent . He was neither optimist nor pessimist , but a submissive disciple . " The gale that blows from God we must endure , toiling hut not repining , " he says in Kavanagh . Similar sentiments abound in his writings : " Peace , peace ! Why dost thou question God 's providence ? " " Tell me , my soul , why art thou restless ? Why dost thou look forward to the future with such strong desire ? The present is thine , and the past ; and the future shall be ! Oh that thou didst look forward to the great hereafter with half the longing wherewith thou longest for an earthly future , which a few days , at most , will bring thee ! - to the meeting of the dead as to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh that I could behold thee as thou art , the region of light and life and love , and the dwelling-place of those beloved ones whose being has flowed onward , like a silver-clear stream into the solemn-sounding main , into the ocean of Eternity ! " " Yes , death brings us again to our friends . They are waiting for us , and we shall not long delay . They have gone before us , and are like the angels in heaven . They 8tand upon the borders of the grave to welcome us , with the countenance of affection which they wore on earth , yet more lovely , more radiant , more spiritual ! He spake well who said that graves are the foot-prints of angels ! " Speaking of Holbein 's designs for the Dance of Death , he mentions as striking that one where , from a group of children sitting around a cottage hearth , Death has taken one by the hand , and is leading it , quiet and unresisting , with no fear or grief on its countenance , but only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It is a beautiful design , in all save the skeleton . An angel had been better , with folded wings and torch inverted . " " When I take the history of one poor heart that has sinned and suffered , and represent to myself the struggles and temptations it has passed , the brief pulsations of joy , the feverish inquietude of hope and fear , the tears of regret , the feebleness of purpose , the pressure of want , the desertion of friends , the scorn of a world that has little charity , the desolation of the soul 's sanctuary , and threatening voices within ; health gone , happiness gone ; even hope , that stays longest with us , gone , - I have little heart for anything but thankfulness that it is not so with me , and would fain le4ve the erring soul of my fellow-man with Him from whose hands it came . " These passages are from Hyperion , published in 1839 , and they express the gentle faith in which he lived . The same Romance contains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Silent Land , - with which all readers are familiar . When , many years later , his noble and beautiful wife went up in a chariot of flame , the same child-like faith kept him patient and submissive . He did not question , complain , or doubt . He was not tempted to discard his liberality of belief under the pressure of bitter personal experience . It is a common remark that Longfellow was singularly fortunate ; that Providence treated him with indulgence , and spared him the struggles and disappointments which attend the lot of most literary men . Hence , add some , faith to him was unnecessary , and all expression of it was sentimental , unreal , literary . But , to say nothing of such afflictions as are so tenderly hinted at in Voices of the Night , the multitude have yet to learn what they have to endure who , along with success , popularity , honor , and worldly competence , are endowed with sensitiveness of conscience and tenderness of heart . If it be true that opulence bears more heavily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that responsibility entails more mis- // cry than toil does , - misery in the form of regret , uneasiness , dissatisfaction , a sense of weakness , failure , ill-desert , not to speak of multitudinous demands that can be neither met nor dismissed , questions that can be neither answered nor put aside . In spite of ease , Longfellow labored . Success stimulated him to toil ; praise made him modest ; popularity threw him back on self-knowledge ; privilege kept him mindful of duty ; honors educated him in charity ; and the perpetual presence of a world filled with pain drove him to the bosom of a divine love . Conditions which might have encouraged a self-conscious man to think this the best possible order of things , and a morbid man to regard it as the worst possible , simply rendered him submissive and thoughtful . Perhaps he did not choose to think , being constitutionally ordained to feel ; but feeling is as importunate as thought . Whoever , in a world like this , can maintain a still heart is quite as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calm intellect . To outward seeming Mr. Longfellow was a prosperous man . To what extent this impression of him was due to his own equability no one will ever know . That he was endowed with a highly sensitive nature , that in consequence of possessing it he enjoyed and suffered keenly , we do know from his writings , not only in verse , but also in prose ; as well original , as selected for translation from the writings of others . After all , temperament counts for a good deal in this matter of optimism or pessimism , and the poetic temperament is exposed to the severest strain . The poet must either be born with a child-like heart , which is proof against the shocks of fate , or he must earn his composure by hard discipline of will . In the first case we admire , in the last we venerate , him . In which category our poet stands is yet to be revealed when his life shall be laid open . But this is digression from our main purpose , which is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man of letters . Much of his time and much of his talent was devoted to the task of reproducing in English the work of foreign authors . Apart from the translation of Dante , he made not fewer than forty-nine or fifty versions , from nearly every European language , and from writers otherwise little known . Especially in the smaller pieces is his talent conspicuous , for in them sentiment is condensed into a few stanzas , and the single thought soon spends itself . In this difficult work his skill is unsurpassed , if not unequaled . His sympathy with the author he chose to render , his copious vocabulary , his sense of the value of words , his ear for rhythm , his resources of rhyme , fitted him in a peculiar degree to pour fancy from one vessel into another . He made the stranger 's production so entirely his own that it might easily pass for his . lie caught the very spirit of the poem that fascinated him , learned it by heart , as it were , and sang it as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whither ? Beware I The Castle by the Sea , The Happiest Land , King Christian , will occur to every one . The range was not wide , but within the prescribed limits the workmanship was perfect ; and none but those who have tried it have any conception of the labor involved in this kind of achievement . None save the genuine poet can venture on the undertaking ; yet the genuine poet , who is equal to spontaneous creation from the activity of his own genius , must restrain himself , lest he fill with his wine the cup which a brother artist holds out to him . The more he is in sympathy with his fellow-bard , the more careful he must be to present him , and him only , laying all his private treasures at the feet of his inspirer . For a laborious , literal , mechanical versifier , the task , though by no means easy , is much easier , because , being absorbed in admira // tion of his model , and stimulated by thoughts wholly beyond his own reach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reproduce what he could not create . But for a natural singer like Longfellow the undertaking must be arduous . Jadeed , it is surprising that Longfellow did so much of this kind of work ; and he would probably have done less had his sympathy been less than it was , or his ambition greater . The version of Dante 's immortal poem has been criticised on the score of its excessive literalness . One of its ablest reviewers thus describes two methods of translating a poem : " The translator of a poem may proceed upon either of two distinct principles . In the first case , he may render the text of his orir ,  - -  inal into English , line for line and word for word , preserving as far as possible its exact verbal sequences , and translating each individual word into an English word as nearly as possible equivalent in its etymological force . In the second case , disregarding mere syntactic and etymological equivalence , his aim will be to reproduce the inner meaning and power of the original , so far as the constitutional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the first of these methods that Mr. Longfellow has followed in his translation of Dante . " The critic admits that in carrying out this principle the . translator achieved a degree of success " alike delightful and surprising ; " that " the method of literal translation is not likely to receive any more splendid illustration ; " that " throughout the English portions of the world his name will always be associated with that of the great Florentine . " He nevertheless firds fault with the method as involving the too frequent use of syntactic inversion , permissible in Italian , but forbidden in English , and as favoring a preference of iRomaic over Saxon words . We have no disposition to dispute the criticism . It is doubtless well sustained . The version of Mr. Longfellow , with all its astonishing merits , is open to the objections alleged . But a further question remains* which the critic does not venture to answer , which no one can finally answer , which Mr. Longfellow himself might have been a little puzzled to answer , namely , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the whole , it was preferred , or because it was more congenial with the talent of the translator ? Some have thought that the genius of Longfellow shrank before the task of reproducing from the inside so profound a work , and instinctively took refuge in a humbler style , to which he could do justice . Others , presuming his ability to perform the more arduous feat , have suggested that his reverence for the mighty master and his desire to present him as he was induced him to adopt a method which rendered impossible any infusion of his own ideas . In the first supposition , there is implied a limitation of the translator 's power ; by the other , a tribute is paid to his modesty of character . For our part , we prefer the second , as being most in accordance with the poet 's nature . He was a hearty worshiper of other men 's genius . There was in him no jealousy of his neighbor . He was without envy as he was without guile . In the present instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As it went on friends were called in whose judgment as scholars , men of taste , poets , could be relied on , arid to them the cantos were read in English ; they comparing the version with the original , which they held in their hands , and making suggestions as the reading proceeded . Thus the utmost accuracy was obtained . In this way every line , every word , was tested by those most competent to pass judgment . We will not start a discussion whether Longfellow 's earliest or latest pieces were most worthy of his genius . A Psalm of Life , The Reaper and the // Flowers , The Light of Stars , Maidenhood , Excelsior , though remarkable in their time , exuberant , level to the common feeling , are less interesting as literary achievements , and even as expressions of human experience , than many of his later picces . The Morituri Salutamus voices a much higher strain . With due submission to the author 's own preference ( did ever author fairly estimate the relative value of his performances ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of art , but as a moral achievement , greatly in advance of Evangeline . In fact , Hiawatha , published in 1855 , is , in our opinion , the poet 's masterpiece , the fullest expression of his mind . Theme and treatment perfectly correspond : the former calling forth all the poet 's peculiar talent ; the latter taxing , yet exquisitely illustrating , his literary skill . The descriptions of natural scenery ; the joyous , sunny sympathy with the primitive life of the children of the forest ; the romantic delight in wild situations ; the humor , the pathos , the avoidance of critical learning , dissertation , fault-finding , erudition ; the exuberance of fancy which characterized the poet , and is scattered up and down the pages of his books , are here brought together in the most delicious combinations . We are tempted to quote passnges to confirm this judgment , but lack of space forbids , for the quotations would have to be many and full to convey our admiration of that artless , graceful poem , that swan song of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with eyes smiling through tears ; the Indian 's enemy will not begrudge him so dignified and beautiful a dirge . This song came from the singer 's heart . Some of his latest pieces betray the marks of effort , as if the writer were making verses as a profession ; but this is spontaneous , simple , fresh , child-like , a revelation of the man who chanted it . Longfellow will never stand high as a critic . The character of his genius forbids . He was too broad in his sympathies , too catholic in his taste , too generous in his appreciations , to make fine discriminations . He was lost in praise . One of the first to greet Hawthorne , his admiration was arrested by " the exceeding beauty of his style . It is as clear as running waters . He uses words as mere stepping-stones , upon which , with a free and youthful bound , his spirit crosses and recrosses the bright and rushing stream of thought . " It was something in 1889 to speak of Goethe rationally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort a book of personal confessions , but a nearer approach to criticism he does not undertake . Dante he describes from the outside . Chaucer , Shakespeare , Milton , Keats , are subjects of admiring sonnets , which suggest nothing like criticism of their respective work as poets . Chaucer is spoken of as " the poet of the dawn ; " Shakespeare , as the " Poet paramount , Whom all the Muses loved , uot one alone . " Milton is the " ninth wave , " " England 's Meeonides , " the " sightless bard . " Keats is " The shepherd-boy , whose tale was left half told . " The volume containing specimens of the poetry of Europe gives an admirable idea of the wealth and variety of foreign production , long with enough of biography to make the reader acquainted with the writers ' lives and times , but makes no attempt at discrimination , as indeed it scarcely could do . The office of the critic requires coolness . He is a looker-on , standing outside , with scales in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His aphorisms were tropes . " The tragic element in poetry is like Saturn in alchemy , - the malevolent , the destroyer of nature ; but without it no true Aurum Potabile , or Elixir of Life , can be made . " " In the mouths of many men soft words are like roses that soldiers put into the muzzles of their muskets on holidays . " // It would be interesting to contrast Irving with Lou gfellow , in Spain , at Seville , Granada , or the Aihambra , - the cast of their enthusiasm , the tone of their impressions . The comparison would bring out the exuberance of Longfellow 's nature , his passion for light and color , his brimming appreciation of everything he saw or heard . It is remarkable that neither in Rome , Florence , nor Madrid does he appear to be impressed by the masterpieces of art , in painting , sculpture , or architecture . He is possessed by the joy of existence , the daily aspect of human life , the beauty of the hills , the splendor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peasants , the poetry of local traditions , the bits of song , the fragrance of flowers , the foliage of trees . He catches the invisible aroma of existence , and is so enchanted with that as to be almost unaware of more ambitious or demonstrative wonders . In his calmer moments he reveals a delicate sensibility to every form of productiveness in art , but when made the subject of strong impressions an inordinate sensibility seems to have overmastered his power oC reflection , and drawn him away . It is worthy of note that in giving an account of Goethe , in the Poets and Poetry of Europe , he quotes Hauff , Biirne , Gleim , Menzel , Heine , Niebuhr , Jean Paul , Carlyle ; thus presenting different views of the man instead of giving his own opinion , as if distrusting his private judgment in a case where personal feeling was strong . Respecting Schiller , for whom he had a less qualified admiration , he cites Menzel . Ileine , whom he vehemently disliked , he passes sentence on . No estimate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be just that makes small account of his character . He was not man and poet , but a poetical man . His verse was a reflection of himself , - of his simplicity , sincerity , gentleness , sweet dignity , and gracious goodness of heart . To some it seemed shallow because it was translucent . He was without disguise or affectation . He abhorred vagueness and writing for effect . In truth , he was deep of thought , but his thought was so saturated with feeling that its intellectual edge was lost . Yet whoever will take to pieces his most prosaic lines will be aware of the profound reflection which lay beneath them . 1-Je was a man of reserve , quiet , meditative , interior , rather reticent than demonstrative ; wholly destitute of vanity , - a remarkable trait in any man so attractive , a singular quality in one so flattered and adored . He was tile soul of honor and of kindness , with a patience unweariable and a charity that could not be exhausted . " Who will be kind to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a remonstrance against his ductility under the pressure of bores . What he said of Heine never could be said of him : " With all his various powers , he wanted one great power , - the power of truth . He wanted , too , that ennobling principle of all human endeavor , the aspiration after an ideal standard that is higher than himself . " One who was Longfellow 's friend for many years , who knew him as intimately as any , and who was as little as any liable to be imposed on by a great reputation , has said , " But beautiful and ample as the expression of himself was , it fell short of the truth . The man was more and better than the poet . " lie was such a man that London working - men thought it an honor to kiss his hand . An immortality like this the most illustrious might envy ; an immortality , if it may not be more properly called a universality , which is immortal too , for tile sentiments which are common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few in this generation are questioning and becoming skeptical , but the many are still growing towards a faith tender and trusting as his was , and the doubting , denying few are happy // when they feel at home in the bosom of their kind . A poetical atmosphere , an aroma , hung about him as about no other of our poets . Among strangers and foreigners this was of course due in great measure to the sentiment of his verse . Among his countrymen it arose from various causes . His abstinence from public life gave him an air of seclusion : men did not think of him in their hours of political or commercial rivalry ; when they read their paper , discussed party candidates , or smoked at the club . He was associated with the old Craigie house ; with memories of the early years of the republic ; with the picturesque epoch of our national existence ; with the dawn of democratic institutions ; with the flushing hope which reddened the sky when the young nation committed itself so cordially to the faith in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophy and social ethics which divide parties in these days . His residence at Cambridge , the oldest seat of American learning , linked his name with those of other men well known in the world of literature ; thus he stood aloof , in calm retirement , as Bryant , for example , did not , and came in no bruising collisions with his fellowmen . His very sorrows idealized him , making him seem touchingly human , and in a peculiar way calling up thoughts of the divine compassion with mortal helplessness and blamelessness . His name was seldom spoken except in connection with charity and good-will . The academic honors which were heaped upon him he bore so meekly that some forgot be ever had them , so little impression did any mark of distinction make on him , or on others through him . He valued them as recognitions , not as authentications or certificates . He was simply Henry Wadsworth Longfellow . If that be true which an English sonneteer , writing in memory of him , has said , calling Longfellow C* The bard whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two worlds to , ethcr , " it is true purely by force of that humanity which unites together the family of mankind . When they heard of his failing health , how many recalled the lines which he put into the mouth of Walter the Minnesinger ; of the Golden Legend ! " Ah , what a cruel sense of loss , Like a black shadow , would fall across The hearts of all , if he should die ! His gracious presence upon earth Was as a fire upon a hearth ; As pleasant songs , at morning sung , The words that dropped from his sweet tongue Strenbt.hened our hearts , or , heard at night , Made all our slumbers soft and light . " And when he died the sorrow of the greatest and of the least was equally sincere , but the grief of the little ones will be deep and lasting for the poet who gave voice to their fears and their hopes .
