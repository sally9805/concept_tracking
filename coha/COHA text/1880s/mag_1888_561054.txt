TE* years ago I contributed to the NORTH AMERICA1* REVIEW ( May-June , 1878 ) , a paper on the " Phonograph and its Future , " in which I sketched the solution of certain problems accomplished by my invention , and predicted some of the uses to which it would be put . Other weighty matters engaged much of my time and attention after that article was published , but the future of which I then spoke has now arrived , and the predictions which I made at that time are now verified . For , when these words appear in print , the demonstration of the phonograph 's practical adaptability to the purposes mentioned by me will have been completed , and the perfected instrument itself will be in the hands of the public , to be tested and employed by them at will . Rumors , I understand , have been circulated to the effect that , subsequently to my announcements made ten years ago , I allowed the phonograph to go adrift , leaving its further development to chance and to the tender mercies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as might conceive that they were doing me a favor by claiming to have developed my idea . Those who may have been taken in by these rumors would do well to inform themselves concerning the prolonged labor involved in carrying out important inventions . They are also referred to my former statements in this REVIEW , as proof that the signer of those statements at least knew clearly what he was talking about and predicted only that which he has now fulfilled . Since the time of Lucretius , the movements of atoms have been invested with an intense interest for philosophers and scientific students , and the wave-motions of light , heat and sound have engaged , with a constantly increasing degree of importance , the attention of modern investigators . When we consider the relation of these motions to mathematics and to music , the conception of Pythagoras that number and harmony constituted the // principle of the Universe does not seem to be very far out of the way . In the phonograph we find an illustration of the truth that human speech is governed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of these laws , we are now able to register all sorts of sound and all articulate utterance-even to the lightest shades and variations of the voice-in lines or dots which are an absolute equivalent for the emission of sound by the lips ; so that , through this contrivance , we can cause these lines and dots to give forth again the sound of the voice , of music , and all other sounds recorded by them , whether audible or inaudible . For it is a very extraordinary fact that , while the deepest tone that our ears are capable of recognizing is one containing 16 vibrations a second , the phonograph will record 10 vibrations or less , and can then raise the pitch until we hear a reproduction from them . Similarly , vibrations above the highest rate audible to the ear can be recorded on the phonograph and then reproduced by lowering the pitch , until we actually hear the record of those inaudible pulsations . To make the general idea of the recording of sound more clear , let me remark one or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which even the faintest sea-waves impress upon the surface of a beach the fine , sinuous line which is formed by the rippling edge of their advance . Almost as familiar is the fact that grains of sand sprinkled on a smooth surface of glass or wood , on or near a piano , sift themselves into various lines and curves according to the vibrations of the melody played on the pianokeys . These things indicate how easily the particles of solid matter may receive an imparted motion , or take an impression , from delicate liquid waves , air waves , or waves of sound . Yet , well known though these phenomena are , they apparently never suggested until within a few years that the sound-waves set going by a human voice might be so directed as to trace an impression upon some solid substance , with a nicety equal to that of the tide in recording its flow upon a sand beach . My own discovery that this could be done came to me almost accidentally while I was busy with experiments having a different object in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeat Morse characters , which were recorded on paper by indentations that transferred their message to another circuit automatically , when passed under a tracing-point connected with a circuit-cbs ing // apparatus . In manipulating this machine I found that when the cylinder carrying the indented paper was turned with great swiftness , it gave off a humming noise from the indentations-a musical , rhythmic sound resembling that of human talk heard indistinctly . This led me to try fitting a diaphragm to the machine , which would receive the vibrations or sound-waves made by my voice when I talked to it , and register these vibrations upon an impressible material placed on the cylinder . The material selected for immediate use was paraffined paper , and the results obtained were excellent . The indentations on the cylinder , when rapidly revolved , caused a repetition of the original vibrations to reach the ear through a recorder , just as if the machine itself were speaking . I saw at once that the problem of registering human speech , so that it could be repeated by mechanical means as often as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phonograph as it was then devised and manufactured in small quantity , merely for purposes of public exhibition and explanation , need not be repeated here . The idea occurred to me in the spring of 1877 , and , according as I could get leisure , I gave my attention to preparing the few exhibition machines which were placed before the public in 1878 , and then universally recognized by scientific men and every one else as an absolute novelty . These machiues , of course , exemplified only a small part of the capacity of the phonograph . I was hard at work describing and noting down the various parts of the machine as it would appear when perfected , and making drawings of them in various forms . As it was impossible to drop my work and sit down to tell the public what I was doing every day , I noted briefly in my NORTH AMERICAIN REVIEW article of May-June , 1878 , some of the things which I proposed to accomplish . The details of the electric light and other inventions afterwards absorbed much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a factory in order to supply the demand for the electric light , and my progress in carrying out my ideas about the phonograph , though continuous , was necessarily retarded . For months past , however , I have had a special factory in operation , producing the component parts of the perfected phonograph , so as to bring the machine within the reach of the public in the form which I originally designed it to take . // It may be of interest , here , to contrast briefly the perfected phonograph with the mere exhibition models shown , all over the world , in 1878 . Those models were large , heavy machine , s which purposely sacrificed distinctness of articulation , in order to secure a loud tone which could be heard in a large room when emitted through a funnel-shaped transmitter . Tin-foil was used as the material on which the indentations were to be made . The cylinders were revolved by hand , or by clock-work ; and there were numerous other details of constructiou which differed from those of the instrument as now completed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a special kind of electric motor , differing from all others , to run the machine , in place of clock-work ; and the phonograph as we now manufacture it is provided with such a motor , which turns the cylinder noiselessly , uniformly and easily . Instead of tin-foil , I now use a cylinder of wax for receiving the record of sound-pulsations , as in the original experiment . One diaphragm ( the " recorder " ) receives these pulsations , which are incised on the wax , in exceedingly fine lines , hardly visible to the naked eye , by means of a small point pressing against the wax . A turning tool attachment , near this recording diaphragm pares off the surface of the wax , removing any record which may previously have been left there , and smoothing the way for whatever you wish to speak into the " recorder . " When you have finished speaking , two simple motions bring the reproducing diaphragm into place directly over the wax ; and this diaphragm , provided with a very delicate but durable needle , takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of indentation , bringing them to the ear by means of a tube . Sometimes , indeed , one can hear the recorded words as they are thrown off by the needle from the revolving cylinder , without using a tube at all , and simply by putting the ear close to the wax . The adjustments of these receiving and transmitting diaphragms , known as the " recorder " and the " reproducer , " are very exact , but very easily arranged . And a machine , once adjusted after being set up , will run well with very little attention or readjustment , for a long period of time . The battery , also , conveniently placed in a box under the desk which holds the instrument , will last for six weeks or more , according to use , without renewal . A scale and indicator running the whole length of the cylinder , in front , enable you to observe at what point you began talking , so that the reproducer // may be set at that point on the wax as soon as you wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplies a key for suspending the reproduction of sounds when it is going on too rapidly for the copyist who is writing it out . A second key , when pressed down , will run the reproducer back so as to repeat anything which has not been clearly understood , and this may be done any desired number of times . A sin rle wax cylinder , or blank , may be used for fifteen or twenty successive records before it is worn out . But if the record is to be kept , the wax blank must not be talked upon again , and is simply slipped off from the metal cylinder and filed away for future reference . It may be fitted on to the cylinder again at any time , and will at once utter whatever has been registered on it . One of these wax blanks will repeat its contents thousands of times with undiminished clearness . Further , we are able to multiply to any extent , at slight cost , phonographic copies of the blank , after the talking , or music , or other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curious to reflect that the Assyrians and Babylonians , 2,500 years ago , chose baked clay cylinders inscribed with cuneiform characters , as their medium for perpetuating records ; while this recent result of modern science , the phonograph , uses cylinders of wax for a similar purpose , but with the great and progressive difference that our wax cylinders speak for themselves , and will not have to wait dumbly for centuries to be deciphered , like the famous Kileh-Shergat cylinder , by a Rawlinson or a Layard . With our facilities , a sovereign , a statesman , or a historian , can inscribe his words on a phonograph blank , which will then be multiplied a thousand-fold ; each multiple copy will repeat the sounds of his voice thousands of times ; and so , by reserving the copies and using them in relays , his utterance can be transmitted to posterity , centuries afterwards , as freshly and forcibly as if those later generations heard his living accents . Instrumental and vocal music-solos , duets , quartets , quintets , etc. - can be recorded on the perfected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be to future generations to learn from the phonograph exactly how Rubinstein played a composition on the piano ; and what a priceless possession it would have been to us , could we have Gen. Grant 's memorable words , " Let us have peace , " inscribed on the phonograph for perpetual reproduction in // his own intonations ! We are in a position to obtain results of this sort , by the present phonograph , from the wave-motions of sound ; so that it seems to me we realize here the " poetry of motion " in a new sense , combined with the science of motion . In my article ten years ago , I enumerated among the uses to which the phonograph would be applied : 1 . Letter writing and all kinds of dictation without the aid of a stenographer. 2 . Phonographic books , which would speak to blind peop1e without effort on their part . 3 . The teaching of elocution. 1 . Reproduction of music . 5 . The " Family Record "  --  a registry of sayings , reminiscences , etc. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voices , and of the last words of dying persons . 6 . Music boxes and toys . 7 . Clocks that should announce in articulate speech the time for going home , going to meals , etc. 8 . The preservation of languages , by exact reproduction of the manner of pronouncing . 9 . Educational purposes ; such as preserving the explanations made by a teacher , so that the pupil can refer to them at any moment , and spelling or other lessons placed upon the phonograph for convenience in committing to memory . 10 . Connection with the telephone , so as to make that invention an auxiliary in the transmission of permanent and invaluable records , instead of being the recipient of momentary and fleeting communications . Every one of these uses the perfected phonograph is now ready to carry out . I may add that , through the facility with which it stores up and reproduces music of all sorts , or whistling and recitations , it can be employed to furnish constant amusement to invalids , or to social assemblies , at receptions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone may order an assorted supply of wax cylinders inscribed with songs , poems , piano or violin music , short stories , anecdotes , or dialect pieces , and , by putting them on his phonograph , he can listen to them as originally sung or recited by authors , vocalists and actors , or elocutionists . The variety of entertainment he thus commands , at trifling expense and without moving from his chair , is practically unlimited . Music by a band , in fact whole operas , can be stored up on the cylinders , and the voice of Patti singing in England can thus be heard again on this side the ocean , or preserved for future generations . On four cylinders eight inches long , with a diameter of five , I can put the whole of " Nicholas Nickleby " in phonogram // - - form . In teaching the correct pronunciation of English , and especially of foreign languages , the phonograph as it stands seems to be beyond comparison , for no system of phonetic spelling can convey to the pupil the pronunciation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so well as a machine that reproduces his utterance even more exactly than a human imitator could . The speeches of orators , the discourses of clergymen , can be had " on tap , " in every house that owns a phonograph . It would not be very surprising if , a few years hence , phonographic newspaper bulletins should be issued on wax cylinders . Even now , so soon as the phonograph comes into general use , newspaper reporters and correspondents can talk their matter into the phonograph , either in the editorial office or at some distant point , by a telephone wire connected with a phonograph in the composingroom , so that the communication may be set up in type without any preliminary of writing it out in long hand . The wax cylinders can be sent through the mails in little boxes which I have had prepared for that purpose , and then put upon another phonograph at a distant point , to be listened to by a friend or business correspondent . To obviate the difficulty caused by the friend 's not having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to which any one may take the phonogram that he has received , have it placed on the instrument , and the contents recited to him from the machine , as well as copied out at the same moment by a type-writer . Thus the phonograph will be at the service of every one who can command a few cents for the fee . And which of us would not rather pay something extra , in order to hear a dear friend 's or relative 's voice speaking to us from the other side of the earth ? Authors can register their fleeting ideas and brief notes on the phonograph at any hour of day or night , without waiting to find pen , ink or paper , and in much less time than it would take to write out even the shortest memoranda . They can also publish their novels or essays exclusively in phonogram form , so as to talk to their readers personally ; and in this way they can protect their works from being stolen by means of defective copyright laws . Musical composers , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instantaneously on the phonograph . For the present it has been decided to make all the phonographs of uniform size ; so that a record put upon the machine // in New York may be placed on another machine of the same pattern in China , and speak exactly as it was spoken to on this continent . Each wax blank will receive from 800 to 1,000 words ; and of course several blanks may be used for one document , if needed . This uniform size and pattern make the thing perfectly practicable in offices which have business connections all over the globe . My private secretary to-day speaks all letters into a phonograph , from which they are taken off by a type-writer or ordinary long-hand writer , with an immense saving of time and trouble . Persons having a large correspondence can talk all their letters into the phonograph in a very short time , and leave them to be listened to and copied by an assistant , without the delay involved in stenography or the trouble of going over and correcting the copyist 's work , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Furthermore , two business men , conferring together , can talk into the recorder by means of a double transmitting tube , with perfect privacy , and yet obtain upon the cylinder an unimpeachable transcript of their conversation in their own voices , with every break and pause , every hesitation or confident affirmation , every partial suggestion or particular explanation , infallibly set down in the wax . They can then have this conversation written out or typed by a secretary , for future reference ; or can , if they prefer , have it multiple-copied by our mechanical process . In this way , many misunderstandings may be avoided . Interesting philosophic or literary discussions and dialogues may be recorded in the same way . In fact , the phonograph will do , and does at this moment accomplish , the same thing in respect of conversation which instantaneous photography does for moving objects ; that is , it will present whatever it records with a minute accuracy unattained by any other means . The most skillful observers , listeners and realistic novelists , or even stenographers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The account they give is more or less generalized . But the phonograph receives , and then transmits to our ears again , every least thing that was said-exactly as it was said-with the faultless fidelity of an instantaneous photograph . We shall now for the first time know what conversation really is ; just * we have learned , only within a few years , through the // instantaneous photograph , what attitudes are taken by the horse in motion . Letters of introduction may be spoken on to a phonograph blank , without any of the formality of address and phraseology now customary , or the trouble of folding , enveloping and addressing a written communication . In fact all correspondence will be greatly simplified and wisely abbreviated by the use of phono* grams . A telephone subscriber can place at his telephone a phonogram which will announce to the exchange , whenever he is called up , that he has left the office and will return at a certain time . Similarly , one man calling at the office of another and not finding him , will talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saves the trouble of writing*a note , and obviates the uncertainty of giving to clerk , office boy or servant an oral message that may be forgotten or incorrectly delivered . Hotels and clubs will , naturally , find this function of the phonograph extremely serviceable ; and their guests , or patrons , will avail themselves of phonograins constantly . The accuracy of interviews with newspaper reporters will also be determined , no doubt , by phonographic record . And travelers in vestibule trains will be glad to use phonograph blanks in place of letter paper and telegraph blanks , owing to the difficulty of writing while on a rapidly moving train . It must be borne in mind that I am not talking now of things which may be made possible in the future . I did my predicting ten years ago ; and the functions above mentioned are those which the present perfected phonograph is able to fulfill at this moment . To use the phonograph , a little instruction and practice are needed , but much less than the type-writer requires and hardly more than the training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses for which the phonograph is now fully ripe might be mentioned ; but I do not want to give to these memoranda the character of a catalogue . Enough has been said , I think , to indicate that the phonograph , unlike children , should be " seen " and " heard . " It is no longer in a state of infancy . It may be still in its childhood ; but it is destined to a vigorous maturity . The phonograph , in one sense , knows more than we do ourselves . For it will retain a perfect mechanical memory of many things which we may forget , even though we have said // them . It will become an important factor in education ; and it will teach us to be careful what we say-for it imparts to us the gift of hearing ourselves as others hear us-exerting thus a decidedly moral influence by making men brief , businesslike and straightforward , cultivating improved manners , and uniting distant friends and associates by direct vocal communication .
