txt George Compton and wife , with their four children , the youngest an infant , and the other three aged respectively 5 , 7 , and 9 years , started on Sunday from the west side of the Okaw River for their home on the east side , in Holland Township . They were in a two-horse *lumber wagon . Arriving at the river , the woman begged her husband not to attempt to cross , as the late storms had swollen the stream very much . But Compton thought he was well acquainted with the ford , and decided to try it , as otherwise he would have to travel six miles or more further around by the bridge . He therefore tied the bed of the wagon to the running-gear and plunged in . The horses swam to the centre of the river , where both wagon and horses found bottom . Then the wife said : " You are too far down ; drive further up . " He turned , and , in doing so , cramped the wagon so that it rolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . Compton says he caught one of the children , and sat it . upon the wheel at the time , but Mrs. Compton says they did not see the three children after the wagon turned over . Mrs. Compton . standing breast-high in the water , clung to her babe , holding it un out of the water . At this time a Mr. Banning happened along , and went to their assistance , finding both the man and woman so badly scared that they were unable to do anything for themselves . Compton was clinging to a wheel , and Mrs. Compton was standing in the current , holding her child at arm 's length . One of the horses fell when the wagon turned , and the other stood over it , or upon its mate , thus causing it to drown in water not more than waist deep . Mr. Banning did not see the three children at all , and thinks the whole family would have gone down had he not come along .
