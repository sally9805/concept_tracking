Trowbridge , J. T. ( John Townsend ) , 1827-1916 : A TALE OF A COMET . from A tale of a comet ( 1881 ) We had seen the streaming meteors ' light , With their trails of fire , the autumn night , And talked of falling sky-rocks hurled From some long-since exploded world ; Of comets frisking among the stars With tails like fiery trains of cars , And asked , " Should the reckless engineer Of some rakish comet steer Crashing into our atmosphere , How would the planet 's shell resist him ? " Then we conversed of the solar system , And lunar men ; And Doctor Ben Brought out his globe , at half-past ten , And lectured , giving conclusive reasons For tides , eclipses , climes and seasons ; Till , weary at last , I went to bed , With a jumble of wonderful things in my head  --  Moons and comets and meteorites , Globes and circles and polar nights ; And there I lay thinking , And drowsily winking At something  --  a ray  --  thro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and growing still brighter , Making the moon-lighted chamber yet lighter , Which very much astonished the writer ! I gazed from the casement , And wondered , with ever-increasing amazement , What the look of alarm on the Moon 's frowning face meant . For there was the Moon , and , strange to say , There too was the Earth , just over the way , Like the Doctor 's globe , or a huge balloon , Forty times larger , perhaps , than the Moon , All covered with circles , and looming in space : There were groups upon it , and every face Was turned one way ; and very long-jointed Telescopes at the sky were pointed ;  --  And there , with a terrible rushing and humming And hissing of breath , was a Comet a-coming ! So long and so queer , and as it came nearer It grew every moment longer and queerer ! Until I made out such a comical chap , In a red-flannel coat with a very long flap , His nose peering out from a very close cap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrap , Like a tourist prepared for a very cold snap ! On , on he sped , through the regions of space , With very short legs at a very long pace , His well-filled knapsack lashed to his back , Extra shoes and canteen strapped under his pack , His coat-tails flying away on his track  --  Entangled far off in the Pleiades , On the horns of the Bull and Orion 's knees . On , on he came , With nose like a flame , So red I was sure the fellow 'd been drinking ( His canteen was empty , I knew by the clinking ) ; " And what can a sober Comet be thinking , " I cried " not to see there , plain as the day , The Earth , like a target , hung right in his way ? " The groups were beginning to hurry about , And hustle and bustle and signal and shout , And the Moon looked scared , while I shrieked out , " Dear sir , I beg pardon , I do n't know your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's the same To you , here 's planet ! I do n't think you knew it ; But , sir , it will be A great favor to me And a very large circle of friends , as you see , If you will drive round it instead of right thro ' it ! " He put up his head with a stupefied stare , And says he , " I declare ! No , I was n't aware ! And I 'm going at such a deuce of a rate  --  I 'd stop if I could , but I fear it 's too late ! Bless my stars ! here I am ! " He had just time to stoop , When through it , head-foremost , he went at a swoop , As a circus rider dives through a hoop ! With a crash , And a smash , And a roar as of thunder , It quivered , And shivered , And flew asunder : The Moon , looking down , shed tragical tears ; While , winking hard and holding his ears , The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , swore loud , and ruefully eyed The ruin ; sneezed two or three times ; then drew His long tail after him down the blue . " Heavens and earth ! what have I done ! This does beat everything under the sun ! I do n't care the wink of a star , " said he , " For all the damage done to me  --  " ( Feeling his nose , and then with a flirt Carefully brushing away the dirt From his coat and its stained and draggled skirt )  --  " But look at this dear little , queer little planet ! I 've done the business for her , and I van , it Is quite too bad ! The fairest of creatures  --  How well I remember her pleasant features , The smile on her face and the light in her eye , When I 've touched my hat to her , hurrying by , Many a time , on my way through the sky ! I 'd mend the poor thing if I could  --  and I 'll try ! " How he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; But thereupon he drew up a chair , Hung his long coat-tail over the back , Sat down by the pieces and opened his pack , Brought forth from its depths a stout needle and thread , And there he sat squinting and scratching his head , As if rather doubtfully questioning whether ' T was possible ever to patch her together ! Meanwhile  --  but how can I hope to tell Half that to my friends befell On the shattered and scattered shell ? How depict the huge surprise Of some , at the very astonishing rise Of their real estate , shot off in the skies ? How describe the flying blocks , The fall of steeples and railroad stocks , The breaking of banks , and the stopping of clocks ; And all the various knocks and shocks ;  --  Frantic reporters rushing about , And correspondents setting out In a big balloon , intending from it To interview our friend , the Comet ! While the wide-awake daily press unfurled Its rival bulletins : " End of the World ! ! Frightful collision ! America hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England ! The Union split ! ! ! Interruption of travel and trade ! The Comet coming to our aid ! " For now the Comet  --  odd to see ! Although it did n't seem odd to me  --  With thimble and glue-pot , sewing and gluing The shattered globe , was cheerfully doing All he could to restore the ruin ; Patiently replacing all The scattered fragments , great and small ; Stitching here and sticking there , With a hopeful smile and a satisfied air , Putting the planet into repair ! When all was done , with a dexterous twirl Of his fingers , he set it once more a-whirl , While the Moon looked pleased as a smiling girl . Off he sped ; and the planet spun Away on its axis round the sun ; When , watching with curious eyes , I found He had n't made it precisely round ! The zones , moreover , were strangely mixed : Constantinople was squeezed betwixt St. Petersburg and Baltimore ; South Carolina and Labrador To Massachusetts were snugly tied ; New York and Paris were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fates , England was in the United States ! Greenland ( he could n't have made a greater Mistake ) was on the new equator ! While in each crack of the crust some bit Of broken China was made to fit . Whereupon I cried , with a wild halloo , " Hold on ! come back ! this never will do ! Just see what a botch you 've made ! " Before He had time to turn , with a clang and a roar , And a glare of its one great Cyclops eye , The Lightning Express went whizzing by With a rushing of steam , And a howl and a scream , That waked me from my curious dream ; Which the Doctor avers ( and he makes it plain ) Must all have passed through my busy brain With the passing of the midnight train !
