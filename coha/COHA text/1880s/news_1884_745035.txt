txt The general feeling among persons interested in the wheat trade is that the downward movement in prices which has been in progress during the past 10 days insures a speedy reduction of the immense stocks which have been held in this country during the Winter . In Milwaukee the amount taken for shipment within the past 10 days has amounted to 400,000 bushels . The panicky feeling in the market this week has naturally put a stop to foreign orders . No one wants to purchase while there is a chance that the market will go lower , but there is no end of buyers who are ready to step in and purchase as soon as prices become settled . The break has been one of the sharpest which has ever occurred in the history of the trade . On Saturday last the May option sold in Milwaukee at 95 cents . This morning it touched 86% cents . To-day has been one of great uneasiness and excitement on ' Change , and there are rumors in the air of the failures of several commission houses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things very panicky . The last 5 cents of the decline was due not to the efforts of the bears , but to the throwing of long wheat on the market in cases where margins expired . The bears commenced to cover above 90 cents . Their purchases would have exerted a strengthening influence sufficient to stop the decline but for the fact that the margins of country operators expiring , the wheat held by the latter had to be offered for sale , swamping everything . Every cent decline brought out a fresh lot of this stuff . Very little money was made by the late decline , as the bear element among the operators was not prepared to take advantage of it . The general feeling now is that the cereal is very cheap and that an active movement of stocks will take place as soon as prices become settled . Anticipating this and seeking to profit by it .. a large number of operators stand ready to jump in and buy as soon as they think the bottom has been reached . A good many who want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haVe been buying since the May option touched 90 and selling out again every time there was a decline of a cent or so , in order to take a fresh grip lower down . This has tended to make the market very active during the past few days . The latest sensation in wheat circles is that D. 0 . Mills and Winslow , of New-York ; Albert E. Kent , of San Froncisco ; S. A. Kent , P. D. Armour . A. George Pullman , of Chicago , and John Plankinton , of Milwaukee , have formed a combination to bull wheat , and that their brokers have been vigorously but quietly buying up the cereal for several days . This story is emphatically denied by Plankinton and Armour . CHICAGO , March ** was wild excitement on ' Change this morning when wheat dropped 14 cents , and the result was that several operators who have been strained by the constant decline were forced to lay down . Among them was Shepard &Peacock,; who began business Sept. 1 . Mr. Shepard is from Milwaukee , and Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Our customers were bulling wheat , " said Mr. Shepard , " and did n't respond with margins , and we had to close out our trades . Things are mixed , and I ca n't tell how much we owe . We expect to go ahead again . " It is believed that no one will lose heavily by this suspension . H. 0 . Kenyon , who is out of town , but will be back to-morrow morning , was also long on wheat and had to settle up . His condition is not known , but his friends say he will come to the top again soon . Adolph Herbst , of the open board , went under for about 83,000 , and another operator there closed out and paid the differences . A rumor was afloat to-day that P. D. Armour &; Co. were short 1,000,000 bushels of wheat . This follows the recently published statement that Mr. Armour and his friends had made a shipment East by rail of 500,000 bushels . Mr. Armour did not appear to think the matter one of any particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are moving more or less grain , and have been shipping some to Europe . The market is moving , but there is actually nothing much out of the usual run . We are not in the deal to any extent . "
