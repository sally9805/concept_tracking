txt At the meeting of the New-Orleans Auxiliary Sanitary Association last night the sanitary condition of the city was pretty thoroughly discussed . Dr. Robert A. Holland , Rector of Trinity Church , stated that a gentleman connected with one of the largest business interests of the country , while on a recent visit to this city , desired to make a thorough examination of its worst portions after having been shown its most favored . The reverend gentleman then related the experience of a trip made by the gentleman and himself through Burgundy , Franklin , Liberty , and North Robertson streets , where blocks of garbage , reeking with the odor of dead chickens and cats , offended both the nostrils and the eye . Thence they went through St. Louis , North Gaivez , and North Roman , and never before had he seen such evidences of filth in any civilized city : not even in Cairo , nor in Constantinople . They next visited Clio-street from Villere to Claiborne , and the dumpinggrounds , the climax of the whole . Hereafter when he should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand in the nostrils like Cliostreet . He did not believe there was another city on the globe where such sights would be permitted , and he could not understand bow any municipal government , no matter of what party , could tacitly allow the citizens to be murdered through negligence and ignorance . Considerable time was taken up in discussing the best , if there were any , method of reaching the City Council , so that through them the city can he cleaned . The general impression appeared to be that nothing could be expected of the authorities in charge who have just re-entered office for another term of four years , in spite of the efforts of three-fourths of the voters of the city to dislodge them . The Board of Health has already directed the attention of the sanitarians to the filthy condition of the city , and asked for financial aid . Since the city officers to whom such work belongs seem indisposed to do anything , the only hope seems to be in Major Burke , Director-General of the Exposition , who will enforce compliance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessity , on account of the great gathering of strangers coming here from abroad .
