TIlE American college is a well-defined institution . It may be large or small , rich or poor , good or bad , old or new , for men or for women , but it has characteristic features which are as familiar to the general public as they are to teachers and scholars . It is often compared with the gymnasium in Germany , the lyc6e in France , and the public school in England ; but it differs from them all as they differ from one another . Its historical development , which can be traced , step by step , during two centuries and a half , has produced a national type , differing from the German , the French , and the English . Like the Constitution , the Senate , the House of Representatives , the public school system , and other civil institutions of the United States , it is here , and here to stay . For better or worse , it is our own . The offshoot of an English root , it bears the marks of that strong stock from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vine in California , by peculiarities of climate and of soil ; and it deserves to be nurtured and pruned , according to the circumstances in which it is placed , without regard to the preservation of its likeness to ancestry or kindred . By its fruits it must be judged . Great changes have taken place in its organization , some of them so long ago that their advantages and disadvantages have been tested by experience , and others so recently that it is still a question whether the good effects surpass the bad . Discussion on college management , always rife in educated circles , has lately been more than ever outspoken . While it has touched on a number of details in which none but professional teachers or actual pupils can take part , it has also involved those general principles in which everybody is interested . To understand what is going on , the reader must remember that the earliest American colleges were based upon the notion of a liberal education as it prevailed in England during the early // part of the seventeenth century ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a period antecedent to the writings of the principal authorities in English literature and science ; a period when Protestantism was in the ascendant , but was still fettered by the usage of medi√¶val ecciesiasticism ; a period when books were costly and when the instruments of scientific precision , which are the glory of these days , were utterly unknown ; when the vocations of educated men were but few , and when " research , " as we would use that word , was in adequately appreciated , except here and there by a man of genius who was superior to his age . The early American college was planted in poverty , and in poverty it has thriven . That tenacity of purpose with which a few settlers in the wilderness held on to the idea of a liberal education , in spite of their scanty crops and scantier libraries , their wide separation from the old-world seats of learning , and their lack of professional teachers , is one of the noblest of many noble traits possessed by our forefathers , who were never so weary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altar-fires in the temples of religion and of learning . Their primitive foundations did not depend on royal bounty or on feudal liens ; they were supported by free-will offerings from men and women in moderate circumstances , by the minister 's savings and the widow 's portion . It is only within the present generation that large donations have reached their coffers . The good and the bad we inherit in our collegiate systems were alike developed in the straitened school of necessity . The founders of the original colleges were not only highminded and self-sacrificing , but they were devoted to an ideaL They believed in the doctrine that intellectual power is worth more than intellectual acquisitions ; that an education of ali the mental faculties is better for the happiness of individual scholars and for the advancement of the community than a narrow training for a special pursuit . Accordingly , their educational system did not begin with professional seminaries , for the special training of any one class , but with schools of general culture , colleges of the liberal arts , as good as could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an academic staff made up of those who professed to teach some special branch of knowledge , these colleges had a master and fellows ( or tutors ) , men who were fit to teach others those rudiments of higher learning in which they had Vhemselves been taught . Moreover , // as years rolled on , instead of concentrating personal and pecuniary support upon a few of the oldest and most promising foundations , far-sighted men built up in every portion of the land colleges corresponding in their principal features with the original foundations , and depending for maintenance on the beneficence of individuals . The history of the colonial foundations abounds in examples of the wisdom and self-sacrifice with which they were conducted under circumstances which called for devotion to a lofty ideal . No one can study the biography of their graduates without discovering that they were the men who molded the institutions of this country . It is easy to point out deficiencies in these academic organizations , as it is to criticise the defects of the emigrants ' cabins and the foresters ' paths ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not made upon the scholarship of the world ; easy to mention influential men who never passed a day within college walls ; easy to provoke a smile , a sneer , or a censure by the record of some narrow-minded custom or proceeding . But , nevertheless , the fact can not be shaken that the old American colleges have been admirable places for the training of men . Let the roll of graduates of any leading institution be scrutinized , or even the record of a single class selected at random , and it will be seen that the number of life failures is very small , and the number of useful , intelligent , highminded , and upright careers very large . It may , therefore , be said that the traditional college , though commonly hampered by ancient conditions and by the lack of funds with which to attain its own ideal , has remained the firm and valiant supporter of liberal culture , and that any revolutionary or rapid changes in its organization or methods should be carefully watched . Nevertheless , as we proceed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most desirable improvements are in progress . The child is becoming a man . One other fact deserves notice . As the English prototypes were religious foundations , so their American descendants were ecclesiastical organizations . It is no disparagement to the colonies or to the colonial colleges , but it is rather to their lasting credit , that the Christian ministry among the early settlers was so generally , decidedly , intelligently , and persistently devoted to the idea of liberal education , not for clergymen only , nor for laymen only , but for all who would enter the service of the Church or State . // It may be positively asserted that under all the restrictive and all the favorable conditions which have governed the growth of American colleges , they have perpetuated this idea of thorough intellectual training , antecedent to or independent of professional study . To secure it they have insisted that there must be good teachers and an orderly plan ; that the average wants of a considerable number of scholars , and not the special needs of an exceptional genius , must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been found most useful in the discipline of the mind ; that the various faculties of the intellect must be developed , and that the scholar must not be allowed to neglect what is difficult , because he " does not like * These are the points on which reliance has been wisely placed . I. First of three causes assignable for the modifications which are in progress in American colleges , is the increase of wealth in the community , and the consequent increase in educational funds . If any one will make an educational tour , he will soon discover what an amount of money has been spent in college buildings since 1860 . Let him go to Cambridge , New Haven , New York , Philadelphia , Princeton , Ithaca , Ann Arbor , and so on through the Western States to California ; let him not fail to look at Amherst , Williamstown , Hartford , Easton , Haverford , Bethlehem , Cleveland , Oberlin , Urbana , and at a dozen other college towns upon his route , and he will see that the primitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laboratories have been built and equipped ; library buildings , which are unfortunately , in some places , more costly than the books which they contain , have arisen ; dormitories , museums , art galleries , memorial halls , and chapels have been erected as monuments of generous benefactors . Obviously , in this new growth of collegiate architecture there is a survival of the beautiful quadrangles , the gothic chapels , and the castellated residences of Oxford and Cambridge . In short , the material acquisitions have been very great , not only in old and renowned institutions , but in new foundations . If a liberal education is dependent upon such auxiliaries , the better colleges are now well prepared for work , and most of them may urge their benefactors to direct more attention in the future to less showy but not less serviceable objects . Thus far , with all the gifts which have been made to the older colleges , comparatively small additions have been made to // the funds which are devoted to the maintenance of the academic staff . But the cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college professors before the war is no longer an adequate support , even in the modest style to which their good sense and the traditions of their office have accustomed them . In consequence of this , many professors have been forced to rely for their support on preaching , lecturing , magazine writing , the preparation of school-books , or on other extraneous resources . One result of this is that young men of talent are deterred from entering upon the academic careers which are on other accounts attractive to them , and for which they are fitted . I met , for example , not long ago , a recent graduate who , by talents , acquisitions , hereditary tendency , and opportunities , was predestined to the life of a scholar . In reply to my inquiry as to what he would study after taking his baccalaureate degree , he surprised me first by saying that his student-life was over ; and next , by assigning this reason , that he had uoticed how the world rewarded life-long service in a college , and that he did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man was sagacious . He was right in thinking that a college professor has ordinarily but little satisfaction in looking forward to his financial future . If his expenses are augmented , if his health breaks down , if he lives to old age , unable to lecture longer , no enlargement of salary , no retiring pension , no provision for his family is to be expected . Many a teacher grows sad with this prospect . Is it not time for all who are interested in college foundations to cali for large donations for the increase of " the wages fund * Ought not the college authorities to keep in the background their desire for better buildings , and insist that adequate means must first be provided for the maintenance of instruction ? It will be suicidal if a prosperous country like this suffers its institutions of learning to be manned by men of second-rate abilities because they are cheaper , and because the men of first-rate powers are turned away from the work of higher education to the professions of law and medicine , to the ministry and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfort , and more freedom , with equally good opportunities of usefulness and with prospects of higher honor . It will be a shame if the hoary head in a college , instead of being a crown of glory , is a sign of poverty and neglect . A college professorship should be liberally // paid , and with an augmenting salary , so that , in this respect , it may be at least as attractive as other careers which are open to intellectual men . If the very best men are not secured for the work of instruction , and if they are not made so easy in their pecuniary circumstances as to be free from care on that account , farewell to intellectual advancement , farewell to literary progress , farewell to scientific discovery , farewell to sound statesmanship , farewell to enlightened Christianity ; the reign of bigotry and dullness is at hand . But we have no fear that this is to be the future of American education . There are already indications that salary funds are to be increased , and every friend of liberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The increase of wealth is also manifest in the increase of luxury in daily surroundings , in the love of costly athletic sports , and in the growth of those microcosmic , cryptogramic " societies " which lead a curious life within the college circles . It is useless to argue or legislate against these manifestations of wealth . They can not be uprooted , but they can be guided and directed by wise and sympathetic counseL At the moment , it is not an imaginary but a real danger , that parents in moderate circumstances will choose for their sons , and that self-supporting young men will choose for themselves , that college which will cost the least , instead of that which will teach the most . Many a student goes not where he would but where he must . The bills for tuition-though commonly higher than they were a few years ago , are a moderate item in the budget of a student , but miscellaneous outlays have become extravagant , and yet so imperative that the youth who declines to do his part is in danger of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Although sumptuary laws are of no more value in an institution of learning than in society at large , the pressure of public opinion may certainly be exerted , and should be directed to the suppression of the evil . There is a partial remedy for this state of things which ought to be tried on a generous scale ,  --  the establishment of purses and scholarships for under-graduate students , to be won exclusively by intellectual merit . Hitherto , with a few exceptions , undergraduate scholarships have been usually offered to the needy , and among them to those who had the ministry in view . In other cases they have been restricted to the family of the founder or // to the person whom he or his successor nominated . It is time for something better . Intellectual superiority is to be found both among the rich and among the poor . The colleges , like the State , depend on the support of the great middle class who are neither rich nor poor- who can not afford luxury and will not accept charity . To develop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them generous pecuniary support , should be freely instituted . Such prizes may be given for success in specific attainments , but the wealth or poverty of the recipient should have no influence on the award . College honors should have the same value as those which excite emulation in after-life , and which come to poor and rich alike . If , then , the wealth which is turning to our colleges , after supplying the requisite buildings , books , and apparatus , can be directed to providing salary funds and prize scholarships , the influence will be instantaneous and serviceable . Responsibility in this matter does not rest with the college authorities alone on the one hand , nor with rich men on the other ; but it depends upon all who talk and write on liberal education ,  --  on the lawyer , the minister , the banker , the physician , the friend , the adviser , whoever he may be , that undertakes to suggest or guide the future benefactions . II . Science , like wealth , is exerting its influence upon the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and special courses are established ; every knowing professor inclines more and more to lock himself within the citadel of his own department , and to look out of the embrasure with suspicion on the inexperience of those who are willing to sally forth into unprotected positions . If the day has gone by , in the larger colleges , for establishing a professorship of natural and political history ( such as still exists in a Scotch institution ) , or for expecting one man to teach all branches of natural science , as was once the way , or for assigning ancient and modern languages to the care of a single teacher , another danger has crept inthat the college professor will be narrow , one-sided in his own development , and one-sided in his influence . For the ordinary instruction of under-graduate students men of broad , generous , v&amp;ried culture are needed ; men who know the value of letters and of nature in a plan of study ; men who understand their own views because they are watching the necessities and the transactions of to-day with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character , intellectual and moral , is more important than Inowledge , and who are determined that all the influences of college life shall be wholesome . Such teachers as these have hitherto constituted the faculties of American colleges ; their names may not have been made renowned by any new discoveries or by the publication of any great treatises , but they have impressed themselves on generations of pupils who have in their turn helped to form the best institutions which maintain the nation . It will be a great misfortune to American education , if , in choosing specialists for collegiate professorships ( as must be done in future ) , the authorities fail to make sure that these specialists are men of general cultivation , of sound morals , and of hearty sympathy with the youth they are to teach . The progress of science has forced upon our colleges eclectic courses of study . No single person should think of studying all the departments of learning which an institution may rightly teach . All the better colleges now admit of some choice in the curriculum , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far " " may be allowed . There is a curious difference of opinion as to what studies are indispensable to a liberal education , and an equally remarkable divergence in respect to the methods by which a choice of studies may be allowed . In ali this divergence it is a fortunate circumstance that the colleges of this country have never been hostile to the modern physical sciences , and have favored instruction in these branches so far as the means at their command would permit . A recent historical writer has called attention to the curious fact that the first rector of Yale College wrote a text-book on Physics . From that time to ours , neither religious sentiment nor preference for the classics has been arrayed against scientific pursuits . On the other hand , the colleges have rarely , if ever , been willing to admit that an education chiefly scientific was as good a an education chiefly classical . The initiation of a seiei*tiflc school at Cambridge , as an outside department of the college , had an extraordinary influence upon subsequent endeavors to foster the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But these associated colleges have rarely been admitted into complete fellowship . They have been regarded as " members on probation , " - too strong to be despised , too young to be encouraged very heartily . They have not the birthright . Not infrequently do we hear the original foundation called the college // proper , as if the new establishment were the college improper . As a rule , the old prestige and the old degree , Artium Baccalaureus , have not been extended to attendants upon the scientific courses . Yet changes , even in this respect , are close at hand , and the new nobility of science will not wait long before it has equal rank with the most ancient gentry . The experience of American colleges has shown that the most available , as well as efficacious studies in a liberal course of training are these : ( a ) Mathematics , leading to ( b ) Physical and Natural Science ; and ( c ) Language , leading to ( d ) Political and Moral Science . It is not easy to see how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these four elements . They are like the food , air , exercise , and rest of physical growth . The difficult point to decide is the relative proportion of each element , or , in other words , the amount of attainment to be exacted in each branch . It is my own belief that all the mathematics which is essential to general education may be secured by a student before he enters a college ; that is to say , that arithmetic , algebra , plane geometry , and trigonometry , and even the elements of analytical geometry , may be readily acquired under competent teachers in high schools and academies . Boys who have no special love of mathematics acquire this knowledge in schools which I can name . Text-books in these branches are matured to a high degree of perfection , and the methods of training are perfectly understood ; but the mathematical teaching must be given by a master who is a master of mathematics . If the teacher has not carried his own studies beyond the elementary subjects , or if he dislikes mathematics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he may be in others . The distaste for mathematics exhibited by many minds is due chiefly to bad instruction at the outset . Beyond what is learned in the high school , a college should offer higher courses of mathematics , pure and applied , and should require these branches to be studied as antecedent to thorough courses in physics , astronomy , and certain other scientific studies . So in respect to Latin and Greek . That knowledge of these su'bjects which is indispensable to a liberal education , may , in many parts of the country , be acquired by a youth before he enters college , or certainly before he leaves the freshman class . The boy well taught for three or four years after reaching his teens ought to // read readily the easier classical authors at sight , and to understand the fundamental principles of grammar . This is secured in other countries , and may be in this . He may still study Latin and Greek after he enters college , but it should be on a different plane ; harder writings may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familar ; comparative grammar and philology may receive attention ; ancient history , politics , archaeology , and art may be studied ; and a genuine love for all that is noble and permanent in the culture of Greece and Rome may thus be promoted . But here , as in mathematics , the difference in intellectual aptitude should be recognized , and if a mind makes no response to these classical themes , different means of culture ought certainly to be provided for it . Three languages besides Latin and Greek are essential to a liberal education in this country - German , French , and English . The elements of French and German , and even more advanced knowledge , may in some cases be acquired by the school-boy ; and fortunate will he be who begins his college course able to read these languages which next to his own are most essential to scientific and literary progress . He may then prosecute their study in higher historical , literary , and philological aspects , or he may devote his time to Italian , Spanish , Dutch , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prolonged and critical study of English . He must learn the history and the spirit of his mother-tongue and become expert in its forms , and idioms . Constant practice in writing should be exacted by the college course , so that being a graduate would imply the possession of a power to speak and to write fitly , clearly , and forcibly . The perplexity of our colleges as to what should be done with scientific studies is partly due to an erroneous estimate of their relation to a liberal education . They are commonly looked upon as valuable for the knowledge they bring , not for the discipline they impart . Consequently , a few lectures on each of several great subjects are commonly given to the more advanced student for his information , so that he may not go into the world ignorant of what has been ascertained in respect to natural phenomena and laws . This is better than nothing , but it is very inadequate , and , indeed , so inadequate as to be poor and unsatisfactory . An educated man does not need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know them , he can procure great // eyclopa3dias full of the most advanced and exact statements . Bnt ali the knowledge of the " Encyclopaedia Britannica " is of no value to the man who can not use it . A liberal education requires an acquaintance with scientific methods , with the modes of inquiry , of observation , of comparison , of eliminating error and of ascertaining truth which are observed by modern investigators . Such an acquaintance may be better secured by prolonged and thorough attention to one great department of science , like chemistry , physics , biology , or geology , than by acquiring a smattering of twenty branches . If every college student would daily for one or two years devote a third of his study time to either of the great subjects we have named , or to others which might be named , he would exercise his faculties in a discipline very different from that afforded by his linguistic and mathematical work . He would not only find his observing powers sharpened ; he would find his judgment improved by its exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterward be prejudiced against the true workers in science nor afraid of the progress of modern learning . Whatever might be his future vocation , ecclesiastical , educational , or editorial , he would speak of science with no covert sneer and with no suppressed apprehension . The more religious his nature , the more reverent would he become . In public affairs which call for a knowledge of science , he would know how to discriminate between the quack and the authority , and he would be quick to perceive in how many departments of government the liberal use of scientific methods is now imperatively demanded . A few words must be given to the group of studies which , for lack of a better name , we may designate by the French nomenclature as the " moral and political sciences . " They have twofold value - their service to the individual and their service to the State . It is by the study of the history of opinion , by the scrutiny of mental phenomena , and by the discussion of ethical principles , that religious and moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are redeemed from barrenness and made fruitful , like sand-plains irrigated by mountain streams , when they are pervaded by the perennial currents which flow from the lofty heights of philosophy and religion . Above all other educational subj*cts in importance stands philosophy , the exercise of reason upon those manifold and perplexing problems of existence which are as old as humanity and as new // as the nineteenth century . For its place in a liberal education , no snbstitnte need apply . What is tine of the moral sciences in reference to individual character , may be said of the historical and political sciences in relation to the State . That nation is in danger of losing its liberties , and of entering upon a period of corruption and decay , which does not keep its eye steadily fixed on the experience of other nations , and does not apply to its own institutions and Laws the lessons of the past . The evils we complain of , the burdens we carry , the dangers we fear , are to be met by the accumulated experience of other generations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are correct ,  --  that American colleges should tenaciously adhere to certain fundamental subjects as the basis of their training , and that each individual scholar should be allowed a considerable freedom of choice as to the combination which he will make for his own curriculum ,  - -  we must next consider a practical difficulty . Human nature , and especially young human nature , is such , that the easiest path is likely to be chosen without a strict regard to the point it leads to . Doubtless , in all the colleges where elective courses are permitted , the inexperienced student , thinking less of preparation for the future , than of enjoyment for the present , selects with unerring instinct the courses which are likely to be most pleasant . To a certain extent it is undoubtedly true that he should be allowed to follow the line of least resistance ; but this principle must be qualified by another , that in education difficulties are to be overcome , not avoided , for discipline requires effort , and strength comes by exercise . The young scholar must not recline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He must have an orderly plan of study and be required to adhere to it . Two methods of limiting his proclivity to ease have been employed with good results . In some institutions , several courses are offered to a student 's choice , but one he must select , and to that he must adhere . Divorce is rarely allowed to release him from the bond which has once been assumed . Elsewhere , every under-graduate is assigned to one of the teachers who acts as his adviser , and who has an influential control over his selection of studies . Some such devices as these are indispensable to the success of eclectic courses . III . The progress of religions freedom , like the progress of wealth and of science , is also exerting its influence upon our // colleges . It is well known that the earliest foundations , both in N'ew England and in Virginia , were ecclesiastical societies , controlled by ministers . The colonists wisely believed in an edncated clergy , and were determined to secure themselves against ignorance in the pnlpit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education , and had no hesitation whatsoever in inculcating the positive doctrines of the dominant theology . The scholars of the first immigration were almost all ministers , and it is safe to say that without their earnest zeal and pious endeavors , the fonnding of the higher institutions of learning would have long been delayed . If now and then a college president was displaced because he dissented from the views of his associates on baptism or on ordination , the institutions never failed to set up for their students a high standard of religions and moral conduct . If they seem to us narrow , they also seem reverent and earnest . Gradually great changes came about . The catechism and the body of divinity disappeared from among their text-books ; laymen were admitted to a participation in the responsibilities of the corporation ; professors and teachers were appointed from widely different religions commnnions ; the number of required religious services was diminished , and the students found it more and more easy to escape the ministrations of the college chapel upon the Lord 's day . The same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of colleges , so that students may not only be free from restraints which are distasteful , but may be provided with such religions services as they or their parents may prefer . Every important Christian denomination has therefore come to have its distinctive college , and many an argument has been framed to prove that sectarian colleges are better than those which seek to promote the union of several religious bodies . It has not been thought sufficient that a college should be pervaded by an enlightened Christianity , nor even that it should be the stronghold of a simple evangelical life and doctrine , nor that it should be orthodox as to the fundamental teachings of the Church ; but sectarian influences must everywhere predominate , among the trustees or in the faculty , or in both the governing bodies . Hence we see all over the land feeble , ill-endowed , and poorly manned institutions , caring a little for sound learning but a great deal more for the defense of denominational tenets. // As a reaction against these innumerable denominational colleges , State universities and private foundations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapid gain within the last quarter of a century . They are usually governed by good men , so that a student in any one of them perceives very little difference , if any , in the ethical and religions influences by which he is surrounded , from those which encompass his friend in a denominational college . What is to be the outcome of all this confusion it is not easy to predict . Whether the churches , acting outside of the colleges , will endeavor to assume and guide the religious instruction of the students , or whether the community is going through a period of indifference in respect to positive religious instruction , or whether there will be a revival of positive and aggressive denominational zeal , is not yet discernible ; but it is easy to see what is desirable in colleges which are maintained upon a nondenominational basis . Never was there a time when it was more important to uphold the essentials of religion , and to encourage the formation of right moral habits , for the temptation to f orget " the things which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold these views ,  --  and they are probably the dominant influences in almost every college ,  --  would agree in the maintenance of religious services upon a simple and catholic basis , to which all should be invited and to which none should be compelled , and . if to this were added positive instruction in Christian morals , and their application to daily life and still more particularly to the dangers and opportunities of educated men ,  --  then theological training and the enforcement of special ecclesiastical usages might be left to institutions which are designed exclusively or chiefly for the training of ministers . Doubtless , churches in the neighborhood of colleges will be more and more called upon , each in its own way , to undertake the religious guidance of such young men as can be brought within their influence ; while college faculties will be held responsible by the public for the influence they exert upon the moral lives of those whose intellectual training they have undertaken to direct . Already , enlightened men in different parts of the country have independently come to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or of any other nonsectarian institution , halls of residence may be founded by religious bodies , and instruction may there be given in positive religious doctrines to those who resort to the // central establishment for secular learning . The Bishop of Michigan , for example , Dr. Harris , having seen the vigor and prospects of the great foundation at Ann Arbor , has wisely directed his zeal to the building up of a collegiate hall , which shall not be in rivalry with the State university , but in cordial though informal cooperation with it , supplementing its instructions by positive religious teachings among those who are admitted to the privileges of the church home . Years ago , a similar project for surrounding the University of California with halls of residence , to be provided by different churches , was very nearly perfected . By some such method , the new unsectarian colleges may be well supplied with positive religious instruction , while the nondenominational character of the foundation remains unimpaired . Certainly , if Bishop Harris succeeds in the plan which he has commended to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Angel , all the country will contemplate with great interest the actual work of so promising a scheme . The idea of the American college , therefore ; the idea of orderly training in fundamental branches of learning , partly for the sake of storing the mind with useful information , and partly for the development of physical , mental , and moral training , seems to stand as firm as ever , strengthened and not weakened by all that may be said of university foundations . The increase of wealth , the progress of science , and the advancement of religious freedom , though temporary disturbing agencies , are likely to be factors of permanent good . DANIEL C.
