OUR HUNDRED DAYS IN EUROPE. * VIII . M* reader was fairly forewarned that this narrative was to be more like a chapter of autobiography than the record of a tourist . In the language of philosophy , it is written from a subjective , not an objective , point of view . It is not exactly a " Sentimental Journey , " though there are warm passages here and there which end with notes of admiration . I remind myself now and then of certain other travellers : of Benjamin of Tudela , going from the hospitalities of one son of Abraham to another ; of John Buncle , finding the loveliest of women under every roof that sheltered him ; sometimes , perhaps , of that tipsy adventurer whose record of his good and bad fortunes at the hands of landlords and landladies is enlivened by an occasional touch of humor , which makes it palatable to coarse literary feeders . But in truth these papers have many of the characteristics of private letters written home to friends . They are written for friends rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew that there were many such whom it would please to know where the writer went , whom he saw and what he saw , and how he was impressed by persons and things . If I were planning to make a tour of // 463 the United Kingdom , and could command the service of all the wise men I count or have counted among my friends , I would go with such a retinue summoned from the ranks of the living and the dead as no prince ever carried with him . I would ask Mr. Lowell to go with me among scholars , where I could be a listener ; Mr. Norton to visit the cathedrals with me ; Professor Gray to be my botanical teacher ; Professor Agassiz to be always ready to answer questions about the geological strata and their fossils ; Dr. Jeifries Wyman to point out the common objects which present themselves to a sharp-eyed observer ; and Mr. Boyd Dawkins to pilot me among the caves and cairns . Then I should want a better pair of eyes and a better pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps a quicker apprehension and a more retentive memory ; in short , a new outfit , bodily and mental . But Nature does not care to mend old shoes ; she prefers a new pair , and a young person to stand in them . What a great book one could make , and how many would fling it down , and take up anything in preference , provided only that it were short enough ; even this slight , record , for want of something shorter ! Not only did I feel sure that many friends would like to read our itinerary , but another motive prompted me to tell the simple story of our travels . I could not receive such kindness , so great evidences of friendly regard , without a strong desire , amounting to a positive necessity , for the expression of my grateful sense of all that had been done for us . Individually , I felt it , of course , as a most pleasing experience . But I believed it to have a more important significance as an illustration of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that many of my countrymen felt the attentions paid to me as if they themselves shared them with me . I have lived through many strata of feeling in America towards England . My parents , full-blooded Americans , were both born subjects of King George III . Both learned in their early years to look upon Britons as the enemies of their country . A good deal of the old hostility lingered through my boyhood , and this was largely intensified by the war of 1812 . After nearly half a century this feeling had in great measure subsided , when the war of secession called forth expressions of sympathy with the slaveholding States which surprised , shocked , and deeply wounded the lovers of liberty and of England in the Northern States . A new generation is outgrowing that alienation . More and more the older and younger nations are getting to be proud and really fond of each other . There is no shorter road to a mother 's heart than to speak pleasantly to her child , and caress it , and call it pretty names . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it is her child , and that is enough . It may be made too much of , but that is not its mother 's fault . If I could believe that every attention paid me was due simply to my being an American , I should feel honored and happy in being one of the humbler media through which the good-will of a great and generous country reached the heart of a far-off people not always in friendly relations with her . I ha ' are named many of the friends who did everything to make our stay in England and Scotland agreeable . The unforeseen shortening of my visit must account for many disappointments to myself , and some , it may be , to others . First in the list of lost opportunities was that of making my bow to the Queen . I had the honor of receiving a card with the invitation to meet her Majesty at a garden-party ; but we were travelling when it was sent , and it arrived too late . I was very sorry not to meet Mr. Ruskin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduction . At the time // when we were hoping to see him it was thought that he was too ill to receive visitors , but he has since written me that he regretted we did not carry out our intention . I lamented my being too late to see once more two gentlemen from whom I should have been sure of a kind welcome , - Lord Houghton and Dean Stanley , both of whom I had met in Boston . Even if I had stayed out the whole time I had intended to remain abroad , I should undoubtedly have failed to see many persons and many places that I must always feel sorry for having missed . But as it is , I will not try to count all that I lost ; let me rather be thankful that I met so many friends whom it was a pleasure to know personally , and saw so much that it is a pleasure to remember . I find that many of the places I most wish to see are those associated with the memory of some individual , generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own . One of the first places I should go to , in a leisurely tour , would be Selborne . Gilbert White was not a poet , neither was he a great systematic naturalist . But he used his eyes on the world about him ; he found occupation and happiness in his daily walks , and won as large a measure of immortality within the confines of his little village as he could have gained in exploring the sources of the Nile . I should make a solemn pilgrimage to the little town of Eyam , in Derbyshire , where the Reverend Mr. Mompesson , the hero of the plague of 1665 , and his wife , its heroine and its victim , lie buried . I should like to follow the traces of Cowper at Olney and of Bunyan at Elstow . I found an intense interest in the Reverend Mr. Alger 's account of his visit to the Vale of Llangollen , where Lady Eleanor Butler and Miss Ponsonby passed their peaceful days in long , uninterrupted friendship . Of course the haunts of Burns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Wordsworth and the group to which he belongs , - these would be so many shrines to which I should make pilgrimages . But there are twenty different Englands , every one of which it would be a delight to visit , and I should hardly know with which of them to begin . The few remarks I have to make on what I saw and heard have nothing beyond the value of first impressions ; but as I have already said , if these are simply given , without pretending to be anything more , they are not worthless . At least they can do little harm , and may sometimes amuse a reader whom they fail to instruct . But we mu*st all beware of hasty conclusions . If a foreigner of limited intelligence were whirled through England on the railways , he would naturally come to the conclusion that the chief product of that country is mustard , and that its most celebrated people are Mr. Keen and Mr. Colman , whose great advertising boards , with yellow letters on a black ground , and black letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face at every station . Of the climate , as I knew it in May and the summer months , I will only say that if I had any illusions about May and June in England , my fireplace would have been ample evidence that I was entirely disenchanted . The Derby day , the 26th of May , was most chilly and uncomfortable ; at the garden-party at Kensington Palace , on the 4th of June , it was cold enough to make hot drinks and warm wraps a comfort , if not a necessity . I was thankful to have passed through these two ordeals without ill consequences . Drizzly , or damp , or cold , cloudy days were the rule rather than the exception , while we were in London . We had some few hot days , especially at Stratford , in the early part of July . In London an umbrella is as often carried as a cane ; in Paris " un hornme *t parapluie " is , or used to be , // supposed to carry that useful article because he does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He may therefore be safely considered a person , and not a personage . The soil of England does not seem to be worn out , to judge by the wonderful verdure and the luxuriance of vegetation . It contains a great museum of geological specimens , and a series of historical strata which are among the most instructive of human records . I do not pretend to much knowledge of geology . The most interesting geological objects in our New England that I can think of are the great boulders and the scratched and smoothed surface of the rocks ; the fossil footprints in the valley of the Connecticut ; the trilobites found at Quincy . But the readers of Hugh Miller remember what a variety of fossils he found in the stratified rocks of his little island , and the museums are full of just such objects . When it comes to underground historical relics , the poverty of New England as compared with the wealth of Old England is vei'y striking . Stratum after stratum carries the explorer through the relics of successive invaders . After passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon a Roman pavement , and below this the weapons and ornaments of a tribe of ancient Britons . One can not strike a spade into the earth , in Great Britain , without a fair chance of some surprise in the form of a Saxon coin , or a Celtic implement , or a Roman fibula . Nobody expects any such pleasing surprise in a New England field . One must be content with an Indian arrowhead or two , now and then a pestle and mortar , or a stone pipe . A top dressing of antiquity is all he can look for . The soil is not humanized enough to be interesting ; whereas in England so much of it has been trodden by human feet , built on in the form of human habitations , nay , has been itself a part of preceding generations of human beings , that it is in a kind of dumb sympathy with those who tread its turf . Perhaps it is not literally true that One half her soil has walked the rest In poets , heroes , martyrs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it that the whole mother island is a campo santo to all who can claim the same blood as that which runs in the veins of her unweaned children . The flora and fauna of a country , as seen from railroad trains and carriages , are not likely to be very accurately or exhaustively studied . I spoke of the trees I noticed between Chester and London somewhat slightingly . But I did not form any hasty opinions from what happened to catch my eye . Afterwards , in the oaks and elms of Windsor Park , in the elms of Cambridge and Oxford and Salisbury , in the lindens of Stratford , in the various noble trees , including the cedar of Lebanon , in which Tennyson very justly felt a pride as their owner , I saw enough to make me glad that I had not uttered any rash generalizations on the strength of my first glance . The most interesting comparison I made was between the New England and the Old England elms . It is not necessary to cross the ocean to do this , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parks , - on Boston Common , for instance . It is wonderful to note how people will lie about big trees . There must be as many as a dozen trees , each of which calls itself the " largest elm in New England . " In my younger days , when II never travelled without a measuring-tape in my pocket , it amused me to see how nieek one of the great swaggering elms would look when it saw the fatal measure begin to unreel itself . It seemed to me that the leaves actually trembled as the inexorable band encircled the trunk in the smallest place it could find , which is the only safe rule . The English elm ( Ulmus campestris ) as we see // it in Boston comes out a little earlier , perhaps , than our own , but the difference is slight . It holds its leaves long after our elms are bare . It grows upward , with abundant dark foliage , while ours spreads , sometimes a hundred and twenty feet , and often droops like a weeping willow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than ours , yet they tell me it is very fragile , and that its limbs are constantly breaking off in high winds , just as happens with our native elms . Ours is not a very longlived tree ; between two and three hundred years is , I think , the longest life that can be hoped for it . Since I have heard of the fragility of the English elm , which is the fatal fault of our own , I have questioned whether it can claim a greater longevity than ours . There is a hint of a typical difference in the American and the Englishman which I have long recognized in the two elms as compared to each other . It may be fanciful , but I have thought that the compactness and robustness about the English elm , which are replaced by the long , tapering limbs and willowy grace and far-spreading reach of our own , might find a certain parallelism in the people , especially the females of the two countries . I saw no horse-chestnut trees equal to those I remember in Salem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the largest and finest I have ever seen . On the other hand , I think I never looked upon a Lombardy poplar equal to one I saw in Cambridge , England . This tree seems to flourish in England much more than with us . I do not remember any remarkable beeches , though there are very famous ones , especially the Burnham beeches . No apple-trees I saw in England compare with one next my own door , and there are many others as fine in the neighborhood . I have spoken of the pleasure I had in seeing by the roadside primroses , cowslips , and daisies . Dandelions , buttercups , hawkweed , looked much as ours do at home . Wild roses also grew at the roadside , - smaller and paler , I thought , than ours . I can not make a chapter like the famous one on Iceland , from my own limited observation : There are no snakes in England . I can say that I found two small caterpillars on my overcoat , in coming from Lord Tennyson 's grounds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps have developed into " purple emperors , " or spread " the tiger moth 's deep damasked wings " before the enraptured eyes of the noble poet . These two caterpillars and a few houseflies are all I saw , heard , or felt , by day or night , of the native fauna of England , except a few birds , - rooks , starlings , a blackbird , and the larks of Salisbury Plain just as they rose , for I lost sight of them almost immediately . I neither heard nor saw the nightingales , to my great regret . They had been singing at Oxford a short time before my visit to that place . The only song I heard was that which I have mentioned , the double note of the cuckoo . England is the paradise of horses . They are bred , fed , trained , groomed , housed , cared for , in a way to remind one of the Houyhnhnms , and strikingly contrasting with the conditions of life among the wretched classes whose existence is hardly more tolerable than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fierce satirist to degrade humanity . The horses that are driven in the hansoms of London are the best I have seen in any public conveyance . I can not say as much of those in the four-wheelers . Broad streets , sometimes , as in Bond Street , with narrow sidewalks ; islands for refuge in the middle of many of them ; deep areas ; lofty houses ; high walls ; plants in the windows ; frequent open spaces ; policemen at near intervals , always polite in my experience , - // 467 such are my recollections of the quarter I most frequented . Are the English taller , stouter , lustier , ruddier , healthier , than our New England people ? If I gave my impression , I should say that they are . Among the wealthier class , tall , athletic-looking men and stately , well-developed women are more common , I am compelled to think , than with us . I met in company at different times five gentlemen , each of whom would be conspicuous in any crowd for his stature and proportions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the persons of well-known Bostonians . To see how it was with other classes , I walked in the Strand one Sunday , and noted carefully the men and women I met . I was surprised to see how many of both sexes were of low stature . I counted in the course of a few minutes ' walk no less than twenty of these little people . I set this expression against the other . Neither is convincing . The anthropologists will settle the question of man in the Old and in the New World before many decades have passed . In walking the fashionable streets of London one can hardly fail to be struck with the well-dressed look of gentlemen of all ages . The special point in which the Londoner excels all other citizens I am conversant with is the hat . I have not forgotten B*ranger 's " Quoique leurs chapeaux soient bien laids * *** moi , j'aime les Anglais ; " but in spite of it I believe in the English hat as the best thing of its ugly kind . As for the Englishman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be pardoned for thinking it was his fetich , a North American Indian for looking at it as taking the place of his own medicine-bag . It is a common thing for the Englishman to say his prayers into it , as he sits down in his pew . Can it be that this imparts a religious character to the article ? However this may be , the true Londoner 's hat is cared for as reveren tially as a High-Church altar . Far off its coming shines . I was always impressed by the fact that even with us a well-bred gentleman in reduced circumstances never forgets to keep his beaver well brushed , and I remember that long ago I spoke of the hat as the ultimum moriens of what we used to call gentility , - the last thing to perish in the decay of a gentleman 's outfit . His hat is as sacred to an Englishman as his beard to a Mussulman . In looking at the churches and the monuments which I saw in London , and elsewhere in England , certain resemblances , comparisons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my consciousness . We have one steeple in Boston which to my eyes seems absolutely perfect ; that of the Central Church , at the corner of Newbury and Berkeley streets . Its resemblance to the spire of Salisbury had always struck me . On mentioning this to the late Mr. Richardson , the very distinguished architect , he said to me that he thought it more nearly like that of the Cathedral of Chartres . One of our best living architects agreed with me as to its similarity to that of Salisbury . It does not copy either exactly , but if it had twice its actual dimensions would compare well with the best of the two , if one is better than the other . Saint - Martin 's - in- the - Fields made me feel as if I were in Boston . Our Arlington Street Church copies it pretty closely , but Mr. Gilman left out the columns . I could not admire the Nelson Column , nor that which lends monumental distinction to the Duke of York . After Trajan 's and that of the Place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historical record , accounting sufficiently for its existence , there is something very unsatisfactory in these nude cylinders . That to the Duke of York might well have the confession of the needy knife grinder as an inscription // on its base . I confess in all honesty that I vastly prefer the monument commemorating the fire to either of them . That has a story to tell and tells it , - with a lie or two added , according to Pope , but it tells it in language and symbol . As for the kind of monument such as I see from my library window standing on the summit of Bunker Hill , and have recently seen for the first time at Washington on a larger scale , I own that I think a built-up obelisk a poor affair as compared with an Egyptian monolith of the same form . It was a triumph of skill to quarry , to shape , to transport , to cover with expressive symbols , to erect , such a stone as that which has been transferred to the Thames Embankment , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its four sides is a page of history , written so as to endure through scores of centuries . A built-up obelisk requires very little more than brute labor . A child can shape its model from a carrot or a parsnip , and set it up in miniature with blocks of loaf sugar . It teaches nothing and the stranger must go to his guide-book to know what it is there for . I was led into many reflections by a sight of the Washington monument . I found that it was almost the same thing at a mile 's distance as the Bunker Hill monument at half a mile 's distance ; and unless the eye had some means of measuring the space between itself and the stone shaft , one was about as good as the other . A mound like that of Marathon or that at Waterloo , a cairn , even a shaft of the most durable form and material , are fit memorials of the place where a great battle was fought . They seem less am propriate as monuments to individuals . I doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of that vast inverted pendulum vibrating in an earthquake , I am glad that I do not live in its shadow . The Washington monument is a hundred feet and more higher than Salisbury steeple , but it does not look to me so high as that , because the mind has nothing to climb by . But the forming taste of the country revels in superlatives , and if we could only have the deepest artesian well in the world sunk by the side of the tallest column in all creation , the admiring , not overeritical patriot would be ham pier than ever was the Athenian when he looked up at the newly erected Parthenon . I made a few miscellaneous observations which may be worth recording . One of these was the fact of the repetition of the types of men and women with which I was familiar at home . Every now and then I met a new acquaintance whom I felt that I had seen before . Presently I identified him with his double on the other side . I had found long ago that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counterparts I had known in America . I began to feel as if Nature turned out a batch of human beings for every locality of any importance , very much as a workman makes a set of chessmen . If I had lived a little longer in London , I am confident that I should have met myself , as I did actually meet so many others who were duplicates of those long known to me . I met Mr. Galton for a few monients , but I had no long conversation with him . If he should ask me to say how many faces I can visually recall , I should have to own that there are very few such . The two pictures which I have already referred to , those of Erasmus and of Dr. Johnson , come up more distinctly before my mind 's eye than almost any faces of the living . My mental retina has , I fear , lost much of its sensitiveness . Long and repeated exposu*re of an object of any kind , in a strong light , is necessary to fix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of meeting many before unseen friends with whom I had been in correspondence . I have spoken of Mr. John Bellows . I should have been glad to meet Mr. William Smith , the Yorkshire antiquary , who has sent me many of his antiquarian and biographical writings and publications . I do not think I saw Mr. David Gilmour , of Paisley , whose " Paisley Folk " and other writings have given me great pleasure . But I did have the satisfaction of meeting Professor Gairdner , of Glasgow , to whose writings my attention was first called by my revered instructor , the late Dr. James Jackson , and with whom I had occasionally corresponded . I ought to have met Dr. Martineau . I should have visited the Reverend Stopford Brooke , who could have told me much that I should have liked to hear of dear friends of mine , of whom he saw a great deal in their hours of trial . The Reverend Mr. Voysey , whose fearless rationalism can hardly give him popularity among the conservative people I saw most of , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often done of sending me his published papers . Now and then some less known correspondent would reveal himself or herself in bodily presence . Let most authors beware of showing themselves to those who have idealized them , and let readers not be too anxious to see m the flesh those whom they have idealized . When I was a boy I read Miss Edgeworth 's " L'Amie Inconnue . " I have learned to appreciate its meaning in later years by abundant experiences , and I have often felt unwilling to substitute my real for my imaginary presence . I will add here that I must have met a considerable number of persons , in the crowd at our reception and elsewhere , whose names I failed to hear , and whom I consequently did not recognize as the authors of books I had read , or of letters I had received . The story of my experience with the lark accounts for a good deal of what seemed like negligence or forgetfulness , and which must be , not pardoned , but sighed over . I visited several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or accompanied by a member . The Athemeum was especially attentive , but I was unable to avail myself of the privileges it laid freely open before me durlug my stay in London . Other clubs I looked in upon were : the Reform Club , where I had the pleasure of dining at a large party given by the very distinguished Dr. Morell Mackenzie ; the Rabelais , of which , as I before related , I have been long a member , and which was one of the first places where I dined by special invitation ; the Saville ; the Savage ; the St. George 's . I saw next to nothing of the proper club-life of London , but it seemed to me that the Athen*um must be a very desirable place of resort to the educated Londoner , and no doubt each of the many institutions of this kind with which London abounds has its special attractions . My obligations to m* brethren of the medical profession are too numerous to be mentioned in detail . Almost the first visit I paid was one to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walshe . After more than half a century 's separation two young friends , now old friends , must not expect to find each other just the same as when they parted . Dr. Walshe thought he should have known me ; my eyes are not so good as his , and I would not answer for them and for my memory . That he should have dedicated his recent original and ingenious work to me , before I had thought of visiting England , was a most gratifying circumstance . I have mentioned the hospitalities extended to me by various distinguished members of the medical profession , but I have not before referred to the readiness with which , on all occasions , when professional advice was needed , it was always given with more // than willingness , rather as if it were a pleasure to give it . I could not have accepted such favors as I received had I not remembered that I , in my time , had given my services freely for the benefit of those of my own calling . If I refer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dr. Wilson Fox , the distinguished and widely known practitioner , who showed us great kindness , has since died , and this passing tribute is due to his memory . I have before spoken of the exceptional favor we owed to Dr. and Mrs. Priestley . It enabled us to leave London feeling that we had tried , at least , to show our grateful sense of all the attentions bestowed upon us ; and if there were any whom we overlooked , among the guests we wished to honor , all such accidental omissions will be pardoned , I feel sure , by those who know how great and bewildering is the pressure of social life in London . I was , no doubt , often more or less confused , in my perceptions , by the large number of persons whom I met in society . I found the dinner - parties , as Mr. Lowell told me I should , very much like the same entertainments among my home acquaintances . I have not the gift of silence , and I am not a bad listener @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - parties where I had said and heard enough to fill out a magazine article . After I wasintroduced to a lady , the conversation frequently began somewhat in this way - " It is a long time since you have been in this country , I believe ? " " It is , a very long time : fifty years and more. ** " You find great changes in London , of course , I suppose ? " " Not so great as you might think . The Tower is where I left it . The Abbey is much as I remember it . Northumberland House with its lion is gone , but Charing Cross is in the same old place . My attention is drawn especially to the things which have not changed , - those which I remember . " That stream was quickly dried up . Conversation soon found other springs . I never knew the talk to get heated or noisy . Religion and politics rarely came up , and never in any controversial way . The bitterest politician I met at table was a quadruped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a desirable morsel offered him in the name of Mr. Gladstone , but snapped up another instantly on being told that it came from Queen Yictoria . I recall many pleasant and some delightful talks at the dinner-table ; one in particular , with the most charming woman in England . I wonder if she remembers how very lovely and agreeable she was ? Possibly she may be able to identify herself . People , - the right kind of people , - meet at a dinner-party as two ships meet and pass each other at sea . They exchange a few signals ; ask each other 's reckoning , where from , where bound ; perhaps one supplies the other with a little food or a few dainties ; then they part , to see each other no more . But one or both may remember the hour passed together all their days , just as I recollect our brief parley with the brig Economist , of Leith , from Sierra Leone , in mid ocean , in the spring of 1833 . I am very far from despising the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a comparison between the tables of England and America , I could not do it without eating my way through the four seasons . I will say that I did not think the bread from the bakers ' shops was so good as our own . It was very generally tough and hard , and even the muffins were not always so tender and delicate as they ought to be . I got impatient one day , and sent out for some biscuits . They brought some very excellent ones , which we much preferred to the tough bread . They proved to be the so-called " sea-foam " biscuit from New York . The potatoes never came // on the table looking like new-fallen snow , as we have them at home . We were surprised to find both mutton and beef overdone , according to our American taste . The French talk about the Briton 's " bifteck saignant , " but we never saw anything cooked so as to be , as we should say , " rare . " The tart is national with the English as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an English table that excellent substitute for both , called the Washington pie , in memory of him whom we honor as first in pies , as well as in war and in the hearts of his countrymen . The truth is that I gave very little thought to the things set before me , in the excitement of constantly changing agreeable companionship . I understand perfectly the feeling of the good liver in Punch , who suggests to the lady next him that their host has one of the best cooks in London , and that it might therefore be well to defer all conversation until they adjourned to the drawing-room . I preferred the conversation , and adjourned , indefinitely , the careful appreciation of the menu . I think if I could devote a year to it , I might be able to make out a graduated scale of articles of food , taking a well-boiled fresh egg as the unit of gastronomic value , but I leave this scientific task to some future observer . The most remarkable piece of European handiwork I remember was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frightful work of man I ever saw or expect to see was another specimen of work in steel , said to have been taken from one of the infernal chambers of the Spanish Inquisition . It was a complex mechanism , which grasped the body and the head of the heretic or other victim , and by means of many ingeniously arranged screws and levers was capable of pressing , stretching , piercing , rending , crushing , all the most sensitive portions of the human body , one at a time or many at once . The famous Virgin , whose embrace drove a hundred knives into the body of the poor wretch she took in her arms , was an angel of mercy compared to this masterpiece of devilish enginery . Ingenuity is much better shown in contrivances for making our daily life more comfortable . I was on the lookout for everything that promised to be a convenience . I carried out two things which seemed to be new to the Londoners : the Star Razor , which I have praised so freely , and still find equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is a very handy implement to keep on the writer 's desk or table . I found a contrivance for protecting the hand in drawing corks , which all who are their own butlers will appreciate , and luminous match-boxes which really shine . brightly in the dark , and that after a year 's usage ; whereas one professing to shine by night , which I bought in Boston , is only visible by borrowed light . I wanted a very fine-grained hone , and inquired for it at a hardware store , where they kept everything in their line of the best quality . I brought away a very pretty but very small stone , for which I paid a large price . The stone was from Arkansas , and I need not have bought in London what would have been easily obtained at a dozen or more stores in Boston . It was a renewal of my experience with the sea-foam biscuit . " Know thyself " and the things about thee , and " Take the good the gods provide thee , " if thou wilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Who is there of English descent among us that does not feel with Cowper , " England , with all thy faults , I love thee still " ? Our recently naturalized fellow-citizens , of a different blood and different religion , must not suppose that we are going to forget our inborn love for the mother to whom we owe our being . Protestant England and Protestant America are // coming nearer and nearer to each other every year . The interchange of the two peoples is more and more frequent , and there are many reasons why it is likely to continue increasing . Hawthorne says in a letter to Longfellow , " Why do n't you come over , being now a man of leisure and with nothing to keep you in America ? If I were in your position , I think I should make my home on this side of the water , - though always with an indefinite and never-to-be-executed intention to go back and die in my native land . America is a good land for young people , but not for those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and refinement can certainly live far more comfortably here - provided he has the means to live at all - than in New England . Be it owned , however , that I sometimes feel a tug at my very heart-strings when I think of my old home and friends . " This was written from Liverpool in 1854 . We must not forget that our fathers were exiles from their dearly loved native land , driven by causes which no longer exist . " Freedom to worship God " is found in England as fully as in America , in our day . In placing the Atlantic between themselves and the Old World civilizations they made an enormous sacrifice . It is true that the wonderful advance of our people in all the arts and accomplishments which make life agreeable has transformed the wilderness into a home where men and women can live comfortably , elegantly , happily , if they are of contented disposition ; and without that they can be happy nowhere . What better provision can be made for a mortal man than such as our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commonwealth Avenue or on Beacon Street ; a countryplace at Framingham or Lenox ; a seaside residence at Nahant , Beverly Farms , Newport , or Bar Harbor ; a pew at Trinity or King 's Chapel ; a tomb at Mount Auburn or Forest Hills ; with the prospect candidate for human existence ? Give him all these advantages , and he will still be longing to cross the water , to get back to that old home of his fathers , so delightful in itself , so infinitely desirable on account of its nearness to Paris , to Geneva , to Rome , to all that is most interesting in Europe . The less wealthy , less cultivated , less fastidious class of Americans are not so much haunted by these longings . But the convenience of living in the Old World is so great , and it is such a trial and such a risk to keep crossing the ocean , that it seems altogether likely that a considerable current of re-migration will gradually develop itself among our people . Some find the climate of the other side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the New England characteristics are gradually superseded by those of other races , other forms of belief , and other associations , the time may come when a New Englander will feel more as if he were among his own people in London than in one of our seaboard cities . The vast majority of our people love their country too well and are too proud of it to be willing to expatriate themselves . But going back to our old home , to find ourselves among the relatives from whom we have separated for a few generations , is not like transferring ourselves to a land where another language is spoken , and where there are no ties of blood and no common religious or political traditions . I , for one , being myself as inveterately rooted an American of the Bostonian variety as ever saw himself mirrored in the Frog Pond , hope that the exchanges of emigrants and re-migrants will be much more evenly balanced by and by than at present . I hope that more Englishmen like James Smithson will help to build up our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that more Americans like George Peabody will call down the blessings of the English people by noble benefactions to the cause of charity . It was with deep feelings of pride and gratitude that I looked upon the bust of Longfellow , holding its place among the monuments of England 's greatest and best children . I see with equal pleasure and pride that one of our own large- , hearted countrymen has honored the memory of two English poets , Milton and Cowper , by the gift of two beautiful stained windows , and with still ampler munificence is erecting a stately fountain in the birthplace of Shakespeare . Such acts as these make us feel more and more the truth of the generous sentiment which closes the ode of Washington Allston , America to England : " We are one ! " I have told our story with the help of my daughter 's diary , and often aided by her recollections . Having enjoyed so much , I am desirous that my countrymen and countrywomen should share my good fortune with me . I hesitated at first about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we received nothing but the most generous hospitality and the most considerate kindness from all we met , I felt sure that I could not offend by mentioning who the friends were that made England a second home to us . If any one of them is disturbed by such reference as I have made to him or to her , I most sincerely apologize for the liberty I have taken . If I were asked what I think of people 's travelling after the commonly accepted natural term of life is completed , I should say that everything depends on constitution and habit . The old soldier says , in speaking of crossing the Beresina , where the men had to work in the freezing stream , constructing the bridges , " Faut du temp*rament pour cela ! " I often thought of this expression , in the damp , chilly weather which not rarely makes English people wish they were in Italy . I escaped unharmed from the windy gusts at Epsom and the nipping chill of the Kensington garden-party ; but if a score of my contemporaries had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a couple of funerals or more within a week . If , however , the super-septuagenarian is used to exposures , if he is an old sportsman or an old officer not retired from active service , he may expect to elude the pneumonia which follows his footsteps whenever he wanders far from his fireside . But to a person of well-advanced years , coming from a counting-room , a library , or a studio , the risk is considerable , unless he is of hardy natural constitution ; any other will do well to remember , " Faut du temp6rament pour cela ! " Suppose there to be a reasonable chance that he will come home allve , what is the use of one 's going to Europe after his senses have lost their acuteness , and his mind no longer retains its full measure of sensibilities and vigor ? I should say that the visit to Europe under those circumstances was much the same thing as the petit verre , - the little glass of Chartreuse , or Maraschino , or Cura*oa , or , if you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long banquet . One has gone through many courses , which repose in the safe recesses of his economy . He has swallowed his coffee , and still there is a little corner left with its craving unappeased . Then comes the drop of liqueur , chasse-caf6 , which is the last thing the stomach has a right to expect . It warms , it comforts , it exhales its benediction on all that has gone before . So the trip to Europe may not do much in the way of instructing the wearied and overloaded intelligence , but it gives it a fillip which makes it feel young again for a little while . Let not the too mature traveller think it will change any of his habits . It will interrupt his routine for a while , and then he will settle down into his former // self , and be just what he was before . I brought home a pair of shoes I had made in London ; they do not fit like those I had before I left , and I rarely wear them . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old ones I left behind me . But am I not glad , for my own sake , that I went ? Certainly I have every reason to be , and I feel that the visit is likely to be a great source of happiness for my remaining days . But there is a higher source of satisfaction . If the kindness shown me strengthens the slen derest link that binds us in affection to that ancestral country which is , and I trust will always be to her descendants , " dear Mother England , " that alone justifies my record of it , and to think it is so is more than reward enough . If this account of our summer experiences is a source of pleasure to many friends , and of pain to no one , as I trust will prove to be the fact , I hope I need never regret giving to the public the pages which are meant more especially for readers who have a personal interest in the writer .
