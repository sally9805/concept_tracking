ARTICLE IV. - THE INFLUENCE OF INFANT BAPTISM ON THE CHILDREN THEMSELVES . MEN of fair intelligence in other respects , men who have had a good deal of observation in the world in other directions , sometimes object to infant baptism on the ground that the service can have no effect on the children one way or the other . The child , they say , is entirely passive , can not know what the rite is , and therefore the sacrament is a useless one and has no claim on them as parents . If there were any weight at all to this objection , it would still have no force as against infant baptism . The duty of offering the child in covenant with God does not rest on the intelligence of the child as to the act . The child may be passive , and still an active duty may devolve on the parent . The child may be ignorant as to receiving baptism , may not know what is going on in the solemn and beautiful service , may for years not be cognizant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and may not attach any meaning to the rite ; and yet infant baptism may be a great and imperative duty . Tn the first place , if God Almighty attaches importance to the covenant with believing parents and their children , if He sees significance enough in it to enjoin the offering of in1*ant children to Himself through some outward observance , we may be assured that the duty is one of foremost importance even if we may not see that it has any effect , one way or the other , on the children themselves . If God , who knows all issues , sees reason for it , that is enough for us . If He , who infallibly traces ends from all means , who sees all secret or patent reasons , who measures all influences in their narrow or their broadest sweep , has set up among religious institutions a covenant which includes parents and their children , it does n ot look well for us to interfere with it or to set up our pervers e objection to it , it does not look well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , it is not a mark of sagacity in us to try to improve on an ordinance which He has established . // The right way and the wise way for us is to fall in with God 's way . Human ignorance is a poor set-off to divine wisdom . No matter whether we can see that it has any effect on the child or not , onr place is in the reverential observance of the service and in dutiful obedience to the requirement . There are many things that we can not account for , nor see the reason of . But every man has intelligence enough to understand that the highest reason lies in the divine direction . In his great argument for the perpetualness of the covenant , the Apostle Paul says : * " Though it be but a man 's covenant , yet when it hath been confirmed , no one maketh it void , or addeth thereto . " If now it be God 's covenant , who shall assume to sit in judgment on it , or to omit from its provisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have the established covenant : we have also its declared permanence . We open the Old Testament.t " I will establish my covenant between me and thee , and thy seed after thee , in their generations , for an everlasting covenant : to be a God unto thee , and to thy seed after thee . " We turn to the New Testament.t " Christ hath been made a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God , that He might confirm the promises given unto the fathers , and that the Gentiles might glorify God for His mercy . " * " A covenant confirmed beforehand by God , the law , which came four hundred and thirty years after , doth not disannul , so as to make the promise of none effect . " " If ye are Christ 's , then are ye Abraham 's seed , heirs according to the promise . " For thousands of years the children of the ancient church had been offered in circumcision , by the direct command of God . Then the same objection might have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no effect on the child one way or the other . But what is man 's objection as against God 's command ? Our duty is to present our children in baptism whether they know anything about it and appreciate it or not . God 's will , in this thing , is supreme wisdom . The duty which He requires is ours submissively to perform . Furthermore , if it were true that the sacrament had no in * Romans xv . 8. * Galatians iii . 15. * Galatians iii . 17 , 29. t Genesis xvii. 7. // fluence on the child one way or the other , there might be influence enough of the most weighty character on the parent so offering the child , to make the service one of the grandest and most impressive in the whole round of Christian observance . The objection is that the child is not affected by it . But the parent is affected by it , and the influence on the family life is powerful and blessed . Unnumbered parents are ready to testify that they owe everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the fact that they acknowledged the covenant which God has made with them and their children , and that they had dedicated their children to God in baptism . It has made them better parents . It has led them to greater watchfulness and faithfulness . It has urged them to fidelity in family duty . Family prayer has been more thoroughly attended to where there was the family covenant . Careful training of the child in the things of the kingdom has been the result of his early baptism . Compare Scotland , England , and New England with portions of the world where the covenant has not been so generally recognized and where infant baptism has not been so commonly practiced , and it will be apparent that an influence has come upon parents from the consecration of their children which has changed the character of these communities from that of others . An aged minister of a church that rejects infant baptism once said in a public address : " I am acquainted with the state of our churches in all this region , and there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the covenant , with its obligations and its seal , holds up the family altar and family instruction and prompts to parental diligence and care . It has a powerful and lasting effect upon parental character . No father or mother can bring son or daughter to the altar to recognize openly the covenant with God and to introduce children to its obligations and its blessings without feeling a peculiar responsibility . They take on themselves pledges of supreme moment , and the children who were loved before are loved thereafter as given to God and to be trained for God . He knows little of the philosophy of the human mind who overlooks or denies the efficacy or the utility of the pledge given by such parents . It is of the nature of those pledges which men require of one another when // great trusts are committed to frail human keeping . Monarchs are crowned under solemn oath . Magistrates are inducted into office by personal pledge . Judges are sworn before they can swear others . On momentous historic occasions , like the Declaration of Independence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covenant is entered into . The world 's great institutions are founded and kept in place by the sacred , inviolate pledge of men before men and before Almighty God . And He who knows our nature , who knows how great principles are to be kept enthroned , has guarded the family and household religion and the perpetuation of His Church , by bonds that have their foundations sunken in par . ental character . It is claimed that the child is not affected one way or the other by baptism , but the parent can not honestly and faithfully fulfill his part in it without being power . fully affected by it , both in his personal character and in his training for immortality of his beloved children . Possibly he may not dare to enter on the duty from personal fear of that very obligation which it would impose on him ! But we are prepared to claim , not only that infant baptism is of binding force , because , in the first place , God Himself attaches importance to the covenant with believing parents and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a most powerJul influence is exerted thereby upon the character and life of parents ; but , also , to claim and maintain , in direct opposition to the objection that the child can not be affected one way or the other by it , that there is a mysterious and potent effect upon the baptized child from the proper observance of the ordinance . That is , we take issue directly with the claim that this sacrament is a useless one so far as the child is concerned ; and we hold that it is a sacrament of utmost importance to the children themselves . We have already shown that infant baptism , if it had no effect upon the child , would be binding , inasmuch as God requires it , and inasmuch as it is a tremendous factor in directing parental responsibility , and that therefore the objection that it has no influence on the child falls to the ground by its own weight . But now we go further and attack the claim itself , that the infant who is baptized is not affected one way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first place , GOD is one of the parties in the covenant which is confirmed by the ordinance of baptism , and Ellis divine presence and blessing secure an effect on the child . We can not see it . We may be dull to comprehend it . We may be too remote from God , so far even alienated from God , that we can not understand it nor believe in it . But we can not see nor understand the greatest and sublimest forces in the universe . We can not see , as our Lord has taught us , the viewless wind , which blows where it listeth , nor can we tell whence it cometh nor whither it goeth . But it sweeps with power over the world beyond our feeble comprehension . It harnesses itself in the torrid heats of equatorial suns and drives its unseen horses across the seas , lashing the waves into angry commotion and sinking strong ships before its ungoverned fury . It plows through the forests and across the prairies , leveling the growths of a hundred years and wasting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but its effects . We can not see the subtle force of gravitation , which holds the constellations in their pictured courses , holds all the worlds on their grand orbits , keeps the oceans in their hollow beds , maintains the structures of great cities and allows all our human work to proceed with assurance of safety and durability . We see nothing , we hear nothing . The forces which God has launched into the universe abide and work all the same . We assume that there is no effect one way or the other on the beautiful child brought in the arms and in the faith of parents for this significant service . We see his bright eyes wandering over the strange objects of the pulpit and the building , we hear his sweet voice of loving confidence in father or mother and of wonder at the unusual surroundings , we see him nestle in the bosom that is always warm and welcoming for him , and we think that is all there is of it for the innocent child . It clouded sight , back of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UNSEEN PARTNER in this everlasting covenant ! God has a part in it . He who made the covenant , He who proposed to be a God to the believer and to His seed after him , He who appointed the outward sign of Baptism as a seal of His appointed covenant , is // always present by His spiritual grace to accept the consecration which is made and to ratify the mutual agreement . It is hard to convince the unbelieving and worldly objector that it can have any effect on the child one way or the other . But any one who really enters into this covenant with God accepts with grateful faith the agency and the love of God in it and rejoices to believe that the precious child given to human affection and training is brought also into a peculiar relation to God and that He will watch over every such child with his divine Fatherhood . Thenceforward the baptized child is a child of God as well as the child of the human household . " Now are your children holy . " They are within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence that it is sometimes overstated . In the baptismal service of the Protestant Episcopal Church , for instance , it is said , " Seeing now , that this child is regenerate and grafted into the body of Christ 's Church , let us give thanks unto Almighty God . " And in the thanks which follow are the words , " We yield thee hearty thanks , most merciful Father , that it hath pleased thee to regenerate this infant with thy Holy Spirit , to receive him for thine own child by adoption , and to incorporate him into thy holy Church . " This doctrine of baptismal regeneration is a perversion of a great truth , an abuse which has cast discredit on the true and scriptural doctrine . It is an absurdity in itself , an unwarranted assuruption which we should not wish to be true . For we should never desire that the great change of regeneration should be effected by such a process ; nor is it possible that a moral revolution , which requires the intelligence and will-force of the agent , should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we give no credence to such absurdity , proved to be absurd by the after-lives of the baptized children , we do hold that God freely gives His grace to the little child so offered to Him , and fulfills , as the Father of that child , His part of the sacred covenant . In the second place , the law of family unity brings it to pass that , in every sincere service of infant baptism , a direct and powerful effect upon the child is secured . He knows little of the moral laws which are controlling of human life , who does // not know that the little child set in the bosom of that parental and family influence which is ordered in obedience and love and faith toward God , is within agencies which powerfully control life and character and is vastly more likely to be really , as he is nominally , a child of God . Before birth the child 's life is one with the physical life of the mother . The close connection in their lives is not sundered by birth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficient in the moral life as are the bodily bonds that before united them in the physical life . lit is ordered in the moral constitution that , as physical traits and resemblances are perpetuated in the organic structure , the moral traits which are the law of parental life shall be reproduced in the mental fabric . God provided infant baptism as a means of grace , not for the parent alone , but for the child as well . He included the infants in His covenant of grace , because through the family life , sanctified by the indwelling of His spirit , His kingdom was not only to be established , but was to gain its surest and widest growth . The parent , giving his child to God , watching over it as not merely his own child , but as a precious treasure , lent , to be restored in greater grace and value , is securing for that child the wonderful mercies of the covenant . Almighty love and power are brought down to the aid and protection of the infant soul . From the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engirding the child . This , says the fond mother , heir of God , . joint-heir with Christ , as she looks upon the fair features of her boy , is with me , the heir of God , the joint-heir with Christ , and in my hands , is to be trained for the coming and glorious kingdom . This pure brow is to wear a crown of gold . These eyes , that kindle in every look of my love , are to behold the King in His beauty . These little hands and feet are to be taught to toil and run in the service of heaven . This soul , mysterious in its strange putting forth of thought and affection and purpose , is to grow to a stature taller than the oldest archangel and to a grasp that shall compass at length all the universe .. And the poor mother finds her feeble faith grow and lay hold firmly of almightiness , for she believes not for herself alone , but for the child also . Day by day the influences of that family life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the // boy ; and when by and by he steps forth for himself upon the theater of human struggle , he is a very different being from what he would have been had he never been consecrated and trained as a child given in baptism to the God of the old covenant . The law of heredity here finds its finest example and confirmation . In their vain conceit , some men claim that there is no effect upon the child from this ordinance one way or the other . They deny , by that objection , the potent facts of human life . Possibly they are not observers of these , and so their ignorance is their boasted wisdom . In the third place , a very powerful effect comes directly upon the baptized child , because in that service are secured for him the sympathy and prayers of all the church . Baptism is a churchly sacrament . It is administered to believers who publiclv confess Christ and to the offspring of those who are in covenant with the church . It is well , that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be in the presence of the assembled church . Their names are enrolled in its records . By reason of their relation to the body special sympathy and prayer will be awakened for them . Whenever the church gathers for communion with its God , these will spontaneously be remembered before Him . The thought o* the enduring covenant and of the blessings which are constantly recognized as flowing from it , will suggest an undying regard for all who are embraced within its terms . So it will come to pass that they will be continually , earnestly and believingly borne before the God of the covenant , who has promised to answer the prayers of His people . Some may have no confidence in Christian sympathy and the efficacy of prayer . But they thereby set themselves against manifold human experience and against the promises of the divine word . If we accept testimony and if we believe the Bible , we know that the little child , who is brought into such relation to the church , to the body of believing and praying souls that special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covenant , is surely within the reach of effects which will greatly modify his life . And the testimony to the truth of this is voluminous and overwhelming . The historian of the ancient // church , in a busy and changing city , in which the writer was baptized , states that " over eighty percentum of its membership were baptized in infancy , confirming the view as correct that God is far more mindful of His covenant than are His people . " Labor in a large church for the revival of religion had proved unavailing . At length the thought of God 's people was concentrated on the baptized children who were unconverted . A cord of tender and responsive sympathy was touched . Parents were reminded of their covenant vows . Children were reminded of their infant consecration . Some who had lived for many years subjects of the covenant , but unconverted still , themselves now parents of children who with themselves were cut off from the promised blessings , were awakened to their responsibility . And all of these , as glowing hearts pleaded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were bowed down in united repentance and faith , and a great awakening was followed by a great ingathering . The secret of the power of many revivals has been the underlying strength of the covenant . The instances are of record where conversions have immediately followed the prayers which have been suggested and quickened by the knowledge that they were offered for baptized children . The objector claims that there is no effect upon the children themselves . The fact is that by this ordinance the most potent of human and divine influences are concentrated upon them . The history of prayer throughout the generations of faith is the irrefragible reply to the objector . In the fourth place , a powerful effect is produced directly upon the child when at length , he comes to know what has been done for him in baptism . The child , the objector says , is passive . But the child does not remain passive . He grows swiftly into knowledge . With keen sense he perceives what is done for other children , what has been done for him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tend erer love of an Almighty Father , breaks upon the growing soul . The parent may have died ; but undying memories live in the soul of the child . The parent may live ; the child catches the look of irrepressible love , hears the tone of pleading entreaty , comes to know that there is one desire which is master of all other de // sires , that he , who was given to the All-Father in the beginning of life may fulfill in himself that which was meant in his infant baptism . He can not resist it His father 's God shall be his God . The love and longing of his mother shall be gratified . " I remembered that I was a baptized child , " many an one may have said in explanation of his resistance of strong temptation , of his continuance in the good habits of childhood , of his choosing the service of Christ for his whole life . There are moral forces which are irresistible . I have looked on at the baptism of an infant child in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the service in an unknown tongue , standing alone in the gathered group , and then has come to me the vision of faces ever photographed on my mind , of the father who loved me in his large way , and of the mother who gave me my first impressions of God , and of the home and the church of my childhood , and then 1 have been led to new consecration . We can not escape these silent , potent , ever-present influences . The child is passive indeed ! Nay : he is a most active agent , and those events which took place in his unconsciousness become at length the motors and factors of his profoundest life and enter into the conditions of his immortality . The objection is of limited scope . It takes no account of time and growth and development . " The child is father of the man . ' The baptised infant of to-day , is the man of thought and decision before we are aware . He takes cognizance of issues that concern him . He ponders the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Out of the dim past rises clearly into his view the relation into which he is brought as a baptised child of the everlasting covenant , and it becomes one of the most powerful influences of his whole life . What then becomes of the objection to infant baptism , that it is a useless rite because it can have no effect one way or the other upon the passive child ? It is an objection without reason . It is an objection refuted by a four-fold answering . It is an objection against which many witnesses are ready with their concurrent testimony . In making it men leave out of sight the divine Partner in the covenant , they leave out of sight the mysterious law of unity that connects the moral forces of the family life , they leave out of sight the vast influ // ence of united prayer which enters into human life from its very beginnings , they leave out of sight the immense legacy that comes to the mind in its after development . Let us lay heed to no such objection . Let us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His day those who forbade that the little children should be brought unto Him and said , " suffer the little children to come unto me , and forbid them not ; for to such belongeth the kingdom of God . " Our Lord welcomes those who bring their children to have His name put on them with their names . He stands within His church , as He stood of old , with his outreaching arms , to take them to himself , and to give them back to be trained for Him , as the princess of Egypt gave back the infant Hebrew to his mother to be reared for the kingdom ! Blessed parents ! who know their privilege and who prize it ! who teach their children that they are thought of and are loved by Christ , that they are indeed Christ 's , and that His wish , as their wish , is that they may prove themselves to be His ! All the Christian churches of the world , with the exception of one denomination , in all the ages and all the nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of infants . From that great company who are early given to God in this symbol of His everlasting covenant are His holy churches augmented . And now the appeal to all those who are the baptized children of the church , to whom the people of God are looking with unwavering hope , by the memory of sainted , and the love of living parents , is , that they make not this venerable and solemn ordinance into which directly enter so many influences for them a vain thing ; rather that they renew for themselves the consecration which those who tenderly loved them in infancy made for them ; and that from this blessed time onward they walk in the world as children who are in covenant with God .
