txt The second of the series of swimming matches between Denis Butler , of this city , and Thomas Reilly , the Boston champion , was fought out to-day on the Delaware at Gloucester , and resulted in another victory for Butler , after one of the most stubborn races ever seen in the Delaware . The course was a straight one of three miles , from Red Bank to a boat moored opposite Thompson 's at Gloucester . Both men were in good condition , aria both were confident of success . Butler won the toss for choice of stations and selected the Jersey side . He swam a steady , 34 stroke to the minute and Reilly a 27 stroke . Both used the side stroke and swam well under water , Reilly swimming the breast stroke now and then to get a brief rest . At the end of the first mile Butler led by about three feet . At the half distance the men were exactly level , and at the two-mile buoy Reilly led by barely a foot . Then came a struggle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost superhuman efforts Butler got a lead and managed to keep it . Butler eventually passed the winning post 20 yards in the front , and he was greeted with round after round of cheers from about 5,000 persons on the shore and an enormous flotilla of small boats which had followed the swimbiers . The time on a slow tide was 54 minutes . After the race Reilly claimed a foul , saying that Butler had , kicked him during the race , but as he had not claimed it at the time the referee awarded the race to Butler . Both men were used up after their terrific struggle , but Reilly soon recovered himself , and he expects to win the last race . The five-mile race will take place on Saturday from the block house , opposite Fort Mifflin , to Haggarty 's Pavilion , and as Reilly is a good long-distance swimmer another fine race is likely to result .
