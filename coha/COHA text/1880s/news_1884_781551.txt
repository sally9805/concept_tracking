txt To those who have rightly understood the sordid and shameless character of JAMES G. BLAINE the publication this morning of a fresh instalment of his correspondence with WARREN FISHER . in which his prostitution of his official position and his gross untruthfulness are presented in a new and startling light , will bring no surprise . To those Republicans who have denounced and repudiated his nomination this new evidence of his unworthiness will afford a not unexpected justification of their course , and its sure effect will be to bring further and important accessions to their numbers . Upon the defenders of Mr. BLAINE these letters will impose the difficult and unpleasant duty of revising and bringing down to date their pleas in vindication . This will be awkward , but it is what we have repeatedly warned them to expect .. They have but imperfectly understood the character or measured the capacities of the Republican candidate if they have fatuously imagined that the original Mulligan letters were the only storehouse in which those who distrust Mr. BLAINE would be able to find facts to support their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of every belief we commend an attentive study of the letters we present this morning . Some degree of familiarity with Mr. BLAINE 'S Little Rock and Fort Smith speculations will be requisite to a full understanding of the import of these letters . To explain the letters one by one and make their entire meaning clear would demand a great deal of space , but we will call attention to some of the more important and significant points . In the batch of letters read by Mr. BLAINE in the House on June 5 , 1876 , there were two written on Oct. 4 , 1869 , to WARREN FISHER .. We now have a third of the same date . Mr. BLAINE was then deep in the bond speculation , procuring for his friends and neighbors subscriptions to Little Rock and Fort Smith securities at rates very much less advantageous than they might have obtained them for by direct application to WARREN FISHER . In this letter he says : " No one will ever know from me that I have disposed of a single dollar in Maine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day " I note what you say about the importance of my keeping all quiet here . " Yet in his personal statement of April 24 , 1876 , in the House , Mr. BLAINE said , " My whole connection with the road has been as open as the day . " It should be noted , in connection with this transaction , that in a letter written to BLAINE on April 16 , 1872 ? a letter in many ways ? most damaging to him ? WARREN FISHER says : " You obtained subscriptions from your friends in Maine for the building of the Little Rock and Fort Smith Railroad . Out of these subscriptions you obtained a large amount both of bonds and money free of cost to you . I have your figures , and know the amount . Owing to your political position you were able to work off all your bonds at a very high price , and the fact is as well known to others as to myself . Would your friends in Maine be satisfied if they knew the facts ? " Col. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine . The reference in the letter of Oct. 5 to another letter " inclosing the Globe " is to the letter of Oct. 4 , already published , in which Mr. BLAINE cited his ruling upon the bill to extend the Little Rock and Fort Smith land grant as a reason why CALDWELL should dispose of a part of his interest to him . In this matter the sensitive Speaker protests that he has endeavored not to be indelicate The letters relating to the establishment of a national bank at Little Rock tell their own story . They show how ready the Speaker of the House was to use the influence given him by his official position in favor of a person to whom he was under great pecuniary obligation . In the letter of Jan. 26 , 1871 , we find Mr. BLAINE talking of a meeting which he was trying to arrange between CALDWELL and THOMAS A. SCOTT , with whom he " feels very sanguine " that he can " do something " ? that is , can make " a very advantageous arrangement for taking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FISHER 'S letter of Nov. 10 , 1871 , to BLAINE , in which he says : " I kn.:5w but little of your obligations to deliver bonds to others ; but taking into account the $100,000 bonds you sold TOM SCOTT and the amount of money you received on Eastern contracts , our relative positions financially in the Little Rock and Fort Smith Railroad bear a wide contrast . " These two letters will show nearly 54,000 , - 000 of people the falsity of Mr. BL PTE 'S statement in the House on April 24 , when he declared , " I never had any transaction of any kind with THOMAS A. SCOTT doncerning bonds of the Little Rock and Fort Smith Road , or the bonds of any other railroad , or any business in any way con , nected with railroads , directly or indirectly , immediately or remotely . " It will be seen by CALDWELL 'S letter of April 25 , 1871 , " to . FISHER , in which he says that " BLAINE is an important man for us to have feel right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroad matters was well assured that the Speaker of the House was not a " deadhead in the enterprise . " FISHER 'S letter of Oct. 24 is a very important one . This is the letter described in BIuLLIGAN 's memorandum as " FISHER to BLAINE urging settlement of N. P. R. account $25,000 , " and of which Mr. BLAINE said " there was no such letter in the package . " Whether or not it was in the package which Mr. BLAINE seized from MULLIGAN , it would have been a disagreeable letter to read to 44,000,000 of people , for in it he is made to appear as begging repayment of a loan of $25,000 at a time when he had sold the collateral for a sum $5,000 greater than the loan , to say nothing about the $6,000 paid him by CALDWELL on the same account , of which payment he speaks in his letter of Oct. 1 , 1871 , to which FISHER 'S letter is a reply . To campaign orators and all other persons who by nature or necessity have been led to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of American manhood , as a plumed and gallant knight and the soul of bravery and honor , we commend a perusal of BLAINE 'S letter to FISHER dated Nov. 8 , 1871 , of FISHER 'S letter to BLAINE dated April 16 , 1872 , and as the crown and culmination of this man 's infamies , his own atrocious and lying statement sent to FISHER , to be returned by him as a letter written on his own motion to shelter the Honorable Speaker of the House against the breath of slander . It will be observed that whenever FISHER grew cold and threatening BLAINE ceased to bluster and took on a cringing tone . " You have had more bonds than you state in your letter , " writes FISHER . on Nov. 4 , and he hints that if they have been disposed of in Washington they must be accounted for . " My dear Mr. FISHER , " replies BLAINE four days later , " let me assure you that if I were suffering in this matter alone I would not bother you but wait in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your friendly disposition toward me , and therefore I do not wish to seem importunate and troublesome ; but if you knew the agonies I have suffered in this matter during the past six months you would pity me I am sure , and make a great effort to relieve me . " This is courage , this is manliness indeed , for a plumed knight whom FISHER 'S letter of April 16 , 1872 , shows to have been a sort of common sharper . " Of all the parties connected with the Little Rock and Fort Smith Railroad no one has been so fortunate as yourself in obtaining money out of it . " " Pray let me know what I am to expect , " whines BLAINE , in italics . The man wanted the earth , though he was dealing with one who had placed him in positions where he had received large sums of money without one dollar of expense to himself , and who then held his unpaid notes . But if anything short of actual horse stealing will convince the ardent Blaine Republicans that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a scoundrel himself and the instigator of scoundrelism in others , we are sure that Mr. BLAINE 'S letter of April 16 , 1872 , to FISHER , with its inclosure , will have that effect . Not relying upon powers of falsification in denial of the rumors affecting his character , he sought to make WARREN FISHER take upon himself a giant 's burden of lies by giving his sanction to the statement that " you BLAINE became a purchaser of about $30,000 of the bonds on precisely the same terms that every other buyer received , paying for them in instalments running over a considerable period , just as others did . " FISHER refused Lto return the letter , for he knew that BLAINE never paid a cent for his bonds . In connection with this attempt to induce FISHER to clear BLAINE 'S reputation at the expense of his own , it will be . well to read the story of the Caldwell cable dispatch , printed in THE TIMES of this morning . Through his old friend ROBINSON , BLAINE sought to get , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the only man save SCOTT who personally knew the facts about the sale to the Union Pacific Company , a dispatch in exculpation of himself . He sought to get , but could not , from FISHER a similar exculpation as to his ownership of Little Rock bonds . The words prepared to put into FISHER 'S mouth were false . What is the inference and analogy about the precisely parallel matter of the Caldwell dispatch ?
