Calvert , George Henry , 1803-1889 : THE NAZARENE. from The Nazarene 1883 Growth is the first , profoundest , law of life : Often a sign and monument of growth Is seemingly the most destructive strife . Should life cease growing , life 's strong pulse Would droop in the dead air , and sloth , Palsying activity , nature convulse With th ' agony of stifled breath , All things collapsing into death . There is no death : collapse Of life man can not think ; Eternity so wraps His brain in light , his thought can never sink Into the dark of nothingness : To be is the sublime First element of thought , its prime Beginning , and unending end and dress . Life lives on motion , motion on progression ; In life there can be no recession . That history repeats itself is false : Likeness there ever is , a sameness never . There are no chains upon the vaults Of time that spirit does not sever ,  --  Spirit , th ' invisible omnipotence , Essential substance , life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch glimpses of th ' underlying Creative Might , and thus help educate Mankind , that man may learn His deeper nature and immortal fate . Within him he hath powers that yearn For betterment , the lever Unrested these of his uplifting , That works even in the fever For conquest or for wealth , a drifting , It seems , upon Time 's stormy sea , But ruled by tides in th ' ocean of Eternity . The tides out of this ocean Bring in deep-minded leaders , To guide Time 's turbulent motion ,  --  Through their deep-mindedness , thought-breeders : These , agitating manhood 's deeps , Quicken the thirsty soul of man With aspiration that upleaps Towards purer life and action 's nobler plan . Such men are few and far between , So great and true they foil the changes Of time , and can be ever seen Raised high above the common line , Illuminated , clear , Lofty as peaks of grandest mountain-ranges , Heaven-ypointing monoliths , that shine Solitary in earth 's purest atmosphere . The two chief ancient States That by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Had run their bounded course . The Greeks , who with judicial sentence Slew Socrates , their highest , best , And were for true repentance With moral core unblest , Had sunk to a Roman tributary ; And Rome , from spiritual helplessness , Incapable to carry Her load of rule , much less Her ponderous sceptre wield With wisdom , had been forced to yield Herself to an Imperial master . And now , still worse to blast her , The master was Tiberius . Nor under the good Antonines , Better than ' neath delirious Caligula , could they uplift their minds Towards genuine liberty . Man 's spiritual deeps had not been stirred : Voices had sounded that were free , But far too feeble to be heard . Pure Paganism had culminated : The man-made Gods of Greece and Rome Had done their best , and men were sated And sad ; without a home For souls immortal and aspiring , No watchful angels quiring . While thickened over haughty Rome the mist Of earthiness and sensual sadness , And in deep Plato 's Athens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Jerusalem called raptured madness Her poet-prophets ' warnings , threats , Was born among her northern hills , Of parents who were not the pets Of Fortune , a man-child , with soul so great , Loving , and true , that he became Uplifter of humanity , High exemplar , without a mate Among his fellow-men , to be Unparalleled , his name Holy , himself an endless treasure , Which men will the more value , love , The nearer they approach his lofty measure ; A paragon , to prove Deep manhood 's vast resource ; An inexhaustible live force , Moving mankind by one life 's beauty ; An inextinguishable light , Illumining the path of duty ; A living , lasting , vivifying Might . But what are words to this man 's deeds ? His words most wise , his life was wiser : A noble life outweighs all creeds : Good doers are above the moralizer . Of body , self , he took no thought , With spiritual power his work so rife ; Out of the deepest soul his doing wrought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creative beam is Love , And universal origin : Without it nothing could begin ; By it , and through it , all things move . Love is the core of being : Thus we can apprehend Why Being is , foreseeing Whither all beings tend . To Jesus ' life this is the key : His being is an incarnation , The highest , of love divine , and he Of human love the consummation : Love is his inspiration , a first source Of his wide wisdom . Sympathy Moved his deep brain with force Creative : this his warm divinity . Before such large transcendent power ,  --  To Faith closely allied ,  --  Hearts opened ,  --  gratefully supplied , As dry fields to an August shower . Manly continuous fellow-feeling Kindled in his great soul a glow That quickened it , unsealing Within him the divine , to flow On thirsting human-kind , A beauty and a strength for aye . Love was the master in his mounting mind ; Therefore is he a regnant power to-day : Disinterested love , man 's foremost might , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong , always for right , Flowed his deep words , unflecked By thought of self . In this new man Upshot highest humanity , Hinting a larger , holier , social plan , Drawn from an innate deity . From quiet Nazareth Went forth this workman 's son To seek his fortune , with a breath So fraught with life , it won The lives of highest men Through all earth 's after ages , Inspiring their best deeds , Feeding their noblest needs , Writing itself on pages Aglow with wisest ken . Behold , with your mind 's eye , This youthful Nazarene , Ideally as high As is the mother-queen Amid her buzzing hive ,  --  Without whose inborn gifts Her subject-bees could never thrive ,  --  And yet so real , he uplifts The lowly , who then feel Within them a new manhood 's heavenly weal . Our sensibilities make of us men ; They nerve the intellect for highest reach ; They lift us from o'erheated sensual pen , Nursing the best that we can learn or teach . And here was one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily upreacher Towards sovereign spiritualized beatitudes , Supreme , divinest Teacher . Only can teach who well hath learned , From a deep consciousness , These spiritual lessons , burned Into his speech by deep soul 's fire : A worldling 's words are less Than nothing ,  --  spoken for hire . When the holy spiritual is made the means Of scheming worldliness , the false Church leans To its fall . Look round and see What pulpits are the thrones of power , and what The seats of faith and meek fidelity . If you would learn how sure this worldly rot Consumes the soul , go to the home , These fifteen hundred years , Of priestly usurpation : go to Rome . The soul of life is truth : Nature doth never lie . The great Judean youth , Who bred a world of tears In his soft , luminous eye , Whose life was love in motion , Was highest truth 's interpreter . His being was devotion Unto the good and true : a blur On the clean mirror of his mind , That glassed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signed . That he in thought and act and speech Was wholly true , thence was his might . This ' t was empowered him to teach , Then , now , forever . Through his elevation In spiritual gifts , he was unweighted , free , An agent in creation , Beneficent , high potency . So many men are very slaves Of obstinate opinions . Peeping from the rude graves They dig for truth ,  --  resurgent ever ,  --  They dream they rule her wide dominions , While self rules their unblest endeavor . On Jesus , self could get no hold : As well might earthen exhalations hope Mandates of the hot Sun to mould : Generic , universal , was the scope Of thought and will in him . The Pharisees Feel his rebuke to-day As keenly as when he unmasked , To their surprised dismay , Th ' hypocrisies wherein they basked In old Jerusalem . Strong as decrees Of Heaven the words that win Our love and reverence , when he spoke Tenderly to repentant sin , Freeing it from unmanly yoke . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keen intellect to plot Against one 's fellows , and abuses A partial ableness To draw from others power and pelf , Unmindful of their weak distress , To feed a sordid or ambitious self . In Jesus ' soul great manhood 's deeps So swelled his forceful being That what to others seemed the rugged steeps Of duty were to him smooth , level ground , Whereon he moved with th ' ease Of th ' eagle , high , far-seeing , That sails above the chasm , Wherein the solitary sound Is lost of avalanches that man sees Loosed from their moorings deep of snow , With that imaginative spasm Which ' t is man 's privilege to know . Among the poor and sick , In body or in soul , Great Jesus spake and wrought With such a natural might And deep beneficence , Probing their feelings to the quick , Making their maimd bodies whole , That many worshiped him as a blest light From Heav'n ( whence all light is ) , and thought He was a God , so sure his sense Of right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outworn , Felt he was foe to their loved feasts Of power , and looked on him with fear and scorn : Aye , fear and scorn and hate , Fear 's ugly , cross , misshapen child , That strives to strangle his high , holy mate , Love , who requites his wrath with mild , Unbaffled , sure persistency . Jesus , the crucified , In mortal anguish cried , " Forgive them , Father , for they know not what they do ; " Sublimest this of what in life can be . The holy , deep , eternal , true , That shone through his great acts and speech , Shines on with brightening beam : ' t will reach At last his crucifiers . For , that strong people , led By Moses , and with wisdom fed By great Isaiah and his fellow-bards , Having in every vein The blood that streamed through lofty Jesus ' brain ( And streams through all of human kind ) , Which the Almighty Spirit wards , Is more and more swayed by the higher mind , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The unselfish feelings , broad and high , That ruled in Jesus ' life and thought , Are with supremest puissance fraught , Because they firmly fit As key-stone of the human arch , and tie Its diverse elements Into one whole of strength and beauty , As are the wonders tied of visual lens For its resplendent duty . That the wide splendor of three years , Through one man 's dedication to Zealous , pure , self-forgetting work For human good , shines ' mid their peers Of all the centuries with glow Illuming the gross murk Of history ,  --  this bright phenomenon Uplifts the mind , and makes The heart to know Love 's boundless might , and on The human spirit breaks , Creative as the solar power Upon th ' awaiting fields athirst , Refreshing souls with shower Of hope and cheer , when at their worst . The lofty Jesus walked Not in the arrogant pride Of power , which time hath ever balked ; He was self-cinctured with a panoply Woven of light , forth-streaming guide , Kindled by love , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and glow , undwindling While the life current moves , To grow eternally . The shafts he threw were shafts of light , Love-winged , to dissipate the night Of sensualism and ignorance . By him no shafts were shot to drench A Niobe in mother 's tears : His motive was to quench All suffering and mortal fears . Unlike Apollo , the bright man-made God , Who plied a jealous , vengeful rod , Our Jesus was a God-made man , Made after the divinest plan . Thence , while the Grecian God is of the past , The Jewish Man is of the present , anchored fast For eighteen centuries in mankind 's soul , His hold strengthened by Time as th ' ages roll Onward with betterment ; and this , because , In harmony with deep , benignant laws , He is our brother , our exalted brother , Exalted by a full humanity , Vivid with human spirit as no other , Ever our fellow-man and guide to be . Higher ! higher ! this is man 's deep device : Were it not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And sport of Chance 's dice . Then there had been No martyred Nazarene . That there has been a man of this rare height , One whose pulsations were quick jets of light , Shows manhood 's lofty reach And godlike gifts of thought and speech ; And that man is no creeping creature Circling in earth-paths dim , But that his regal feature , Crowning the Heavenward brow of him , Is Reason , Love , and Faith , and Aspiration , Cleansing and lifting his large soul Towards an angelic elevation , Binding into a high religious whole His vast and complex powers . The loftiness of Jesus is a sign Of human possibilities . Mount Washington uptowers Above his peers , because there lies Beneath them all invisible mine Of lifting force . Inspiring exemplar He could not be , had we not th ' elements Within us that uplifted him so far Above his neighbor " priests and Pharisees ; " With all their shallow , selfish , low intents , They could but slay one who in the degrees Of human excellence Shamed their debasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Jesus Are ours by fellowship of nature : The spiritual law that in our best moods frees us From sensuality and sordidness , Ruled all his moods , and this so raised his stature That some men , in their morbidness , Look upon Jesus as no true man , A something superhuman , Willing him into unnatural loneness , Which , with men 's innate proneness To imaginative substitutes for fact , Is infinitely easier than To know him as a brother-man , Imitable in his every act . This imaginative deification Of our prime , holy brother By opinion founds for th ' elevation Of priests , who 'd make the Church our mother , And on themselves , as sole interpreters Of man-made deity , confers A petty godship , sacredness Factitious , claiming power to curse or bless . This false , ambitious fiction  --  Men striving with weak , wilful wills To shape an infinite  --  is contradiction Monstrous and impudent , that kills , Rather than fosters , spiritual germs , That innate force divine , that can uplift Our being from the low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gift Supreme . The priests who slew great Jesus , And now would by his sanction ease us Of self-direction ,  --  our first right ,  --  Are of the Devil , not of God , and blight Our being 's moral core . Your crude imaginations Of Deity ,  --  what can they be ? To Jesus ' fresh and pure humanity , Unwholesome , shapeless exhalations . His doings , sayings , could not pour Such streams of highest life Into our human being , Were he not richly rife In human love and human seeing ; Nor would the best that he could do , Or wisest he could speak , Us to his side a moment woo To hearken his deep words and seek His high companionship , Did there not lie within our life-blood 's beat Bars of the music from his lip , Sparks of the purifying heat That warmed him into wisest words and deeds . This earth-life is but a fine fraction , Infinitesimal , of human work ; And these our numerous earthly hopes and greeds Are but a temporary attraction To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Heaven ; Like Jesus , we are sons of man and God : Believe that with our bodies ' neath the sod Our being ends , that ' t is not given To us to rise with Jesus from the dead ,  --  Then were man 's dignity A jest , a mockery , And human life a sensuous prison dread ; Men were like squirrels in their cages , Active in unprogressive motion , Or readers reading ever the same pages , Or sailors on a shoreless ocean , Or like a man of richest worth Who naught may give to the unlearn 'd , As though the pendent earth Only upon its axis turned . Nay , men were as though each were fast Tied to a festering corpse , Or , like great Hector , slain at last , Dragged at the tail of bounding horse . What you can think of steepest contradiction , Or most illogical delusion , Will help to paint man 's fatal dereliction , His life 's black , dismal , deep confusion , If he were but an earth-bound animal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is oped no Heavenly portal ; That were indeed a fall ! Heaven 's Kingdom is within you : the most deep , The weightiest , words that Jesus spake are these . From the divinest human soul they leap , Aflame with life : they are the golden keys , That , on his Heavenly thought smooth turning , Within the daily human heart reveals Celestial lights forever burning . From each man 's inmost soul appeal Is ceaseless made to keep aglow ( In some they ' re seemingly extinct ) These God-implanted lights : Only by them can manhood see to sow And reap , what are together ever linkt , His duties and his rights . Heaven 's Kingdom is a sway Of purity and light ,  --  Light supersolar , ray Than lightning 's flash more bright , Seen but by spiritual eye , Invisible potency , Divine , o'ermastering power : On earth who feels its rule Doth o'er his fellows tower , As master in a school . This inward spiritual throne , Whose aim is Justice and its sceptre Love , Jesus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own . The spiritual Kingdom was his daily theme : He felt its glories and its joys ; He knew that life is dark without its beam , And all life 's gains but fragile toys . Jesus lived many years in few : The flame , shot forth from his deep , true , Upleaping , powerful soul , Had in it such a light That , like the boreal blaze from Arctic pole , That o'er far latitudes illumes the night , It shone o'er darkened ages . His fire of love kindles to-day , In souls of thankful sages , Its beautiful , inextinguishable ray ,  --  Ray that reveals in him Heaven 's Kingdom , and enkindles hope And faith in souls most dim . Better than best of men he taught His fellows , and through life 's and love 's quick force Such potent deeds he wrought , They seem from supernatural source To those of unenlightened scope . After the Crucifixion came His deepest lesson ; when , Disconsolate , with eyelids wet , His loved disciples met , Like children suddenly bereft , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , While they were whispering his dear name , Jesus amid them stood , Apparently of flesh and blood . ( Creative spirit taketh leave Out of material elements A temporary form to weave , Accessible to earthly sense . ) In wonder , love , and awe , They gazed , until he spoke : I live . I am arisen . Those mighty words , that woke Man in his slumbering prison , They spake th ' o'erarching law Of human life ; they are a leap Out of the dark of narrow sleep Into the light of broad , angelic day . Jesus spake for humanity ; Man is immortal , and a spirit , And naught doth he inherit Like the great right , Ever to be . I am with you alway . There spake for angelhood The angel , man glorified ; His love aye alive for human good , Nearer to God , more deified . No superearthly Sun , And Earth had never been : No superearthly beings won For earthlings , they had never seen Or sun or stars , or felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher . Sun , stars , they help our bodies grow and breathe , Angels our souls with unvoiced aidance wreathe . Jesus , leader of men on earth , Through more humanity , more love , Inspiring them to higher worth , In Heaven doth his brothers move . He , they , are ever with us here , Touching our deeper chords , That each make sweeter music in his sphere , And we be not of life the slaves , but lords .
