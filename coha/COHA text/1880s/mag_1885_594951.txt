The mule-car is not a bad conveyance , however . True , the track is rough and the seats are hard , but the little animal clatters along at a lively pace over the plank roadway in the middle of the street , pulling his load with ease , for the ground is so level that the water in the deep ditches seems in doubt which way to run , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covering of green slime .

Handsome mansions , with pillared fronts , alternate with pretty one-story cottages , and a little farther out are the red and green houses of the negroes with their projecting hood-like roofs . There is no crowding of population into tenement houses in New Orleans . The poorest laborer that rolls cotton-bales on the levee can afford a three-room cottage for his family , where there is plenty of light , air , and shade . In hut and mansion life goes on with open doors all the year round , and even in December and January , when fires are kept up , the children play on the thresholds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jogs past . The winter in New Orleans does not seem to be the death of the year , but only a brief sleep filled with dreams of the summer 's luxuriance of leaf and blossom . Most of the trees , such as the live-oaks , the water-oaks , the oranges , and the magnolias , do not shed their foliage , and the roses seem not to know when to leave off blooming . I found the rainy season in January , of which there was so much complaint in newspaper correspondence , not altogether disagreeable . The frequent warm showers , and the spring-like feeling in the air , made the weather seem like an English May . In the street-cars there is less reserve than in such vehicles in Northern cities . Strangers open conversation with you from mere expansiveness and friendliness of feeling . There is a deal of chatting about the city , // the weather , and the fair . Children are noticed and petted , and babies create a general sensation . In every other car smoking is permitted . If ladies get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , they are expected to make the best of the situation and not glare at the men for finishing their cigars . Sometimes there are outspoken protests against this custom . A party of ladies entered a car one day in which a Creole gentleman sat in placid enjoyment of his cigar and his morning paper . The windows were shut and the air was thick . The ladies began to make half-whispered remarks about the " horrid air . " Then something was said about " no gentleman smoking in the presence of ladies where they came from . " Still the smoker was obdurate . He puffed away with increased vigor . He had a right to smoke , and he evidently did not intend to be intimidated . Various sarcastic comments were made with less and less pretense of undertone , until the attention of all the passengers was attracted to the struggle . Finally , one of the women said , " Let 's offer him five cents for his cigar . " " Of course he 'll take it , " said another ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This shot finished the poor Creole . He threw his cigar out of the window , scowled at his tormentors , but was too polite to make any retort . The steamboat route to the Exposition starts from the head of Canal street . It 's very odd , this going up hill to get to the water side of the city , and finding all the open drains flowing from the river instead of toward it . During the sail , which lasts nearly an hour , you pass along the greater part of the river fronON DIXIE S LINE . tage of the city and get a strong impression of the extent and variety of its commercial activity . There are dozens of cotton-steamers , flying English , French , Spanish , Dutch , and Italian flags , steamers from Mexico , Cuba , and South America , fruit-schooners with fragrant cargoes from the lagoons of Yucatan and Honduras , black brigs laden with logwood and mahogany , and all sorts of queer , nondescript sail-craft from bays and bayous bringing fish and oysters , sugar and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a show at the levees as they did years ago , the new railroad running parallel to the Mississippi and Red rivers , or crossing the Atchafalaya and the many navigable bayous that help carry to the gulf the abundant waters of those great streams , having seriously impaired the river trade of late . There is an amusing irregularity in the movements of the Exposition boats . If they have a time-table , they pay no attention to it . The gang-plank is not hauled in as long as a possible passenger is in sight on shore . Two boats will lie for an hour at the wharf , keeping up a terrific din with bells and whistles as if just about to pull out . Each has its runners ashore soliciting nassengers , the rival captains standing by the gangplanks and shouting , " First boat for the city - Start in one minute. - Give her another toot , Jim. - Stand by , there , to cast off that line. - This way , gentlemen - go half an hour before that other boat . " Meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of leaving do not grumble . It 's the custom of the country . Nobody is in a hurry ; nobody cares to be on time . Even the restless , impatient Northerner soon falls in with the ways of the natives , and finds it delightful to enter into the easy-going spirit of this lazy land , " wherein it seemeth always afternoon . " CONDITION OF NEW ORLEANS . THE city of New Orleans was in need of the invigorating influences of the Exposition . Its trade has been at a standstill of late . The Eads jetties at the mouth of the Mississippi and the building of new railroads *-Kz*7 // gave it a fresh impetus a few years ago ; but these new forces seem to have culminated . The place is not decaying , but it is not advancing . I noted but two conspicuous new buildings that have been erected in the business quarter since my last visit , six years ago . The receipts of cotton have not averaged as many bales during the past five years as in the five years preceding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city were in the crop year 1859-60 - 2,139,425 bales . The receipts for 1883-84 were only 1,529,188 bales . Besides , the profit arising from handling the staple is much less than formerly , owing to the establishment of steam-presses at various points in the interior which compress the bales ready for shipment to Europe , so that there is nothing for New Orleans to do with them but transfer them directly to the ocean vessels from the cars and steamboats . The sugar crop of Louisiana was 221,515 hogsheads in  |p883  , and was 449,324 hogsheads as long ago as 1853 . The grain movement to Europe by way of New Orleans is not increasing , notwithstanding the enormous expansion in recent years of the Western wheat crop . The gains achieved for the general business of the city appear to have come from the building of railroads and the consequent bringing of the surrounding country within easy reach of its trade . The important new roads - all built with Northern capital and managed by Northern men - are two ' lines to Texas , connecting with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forming a part of one of the through Northern routes of travel , and a line following the general course of the Mississippi to Memphis . In 1880 the census showed 216,000 people in New Orleans , a gain of only 13,000 in a decade . The present population is probably 225,000 , not including the people brought here by the Exposition . These figures do not , however , convey a correct idea of the importance of the city as a center of commerce , for the reason that it is commerce alone that makes New Orleans , the multitude of manufacturing industries which would be found in a Northern city of any considerable size being almost wholly absent . Besides , New Orleans is great by comparison . In all the South-western and Gulf States , the next largest city had only 43,000 inhabitants in i 88o . That was Nashville , Tennessee . The gap between 216,000 and 43,000 is a wide one . After Nashville came Memphis with 33,500 , Mobile with 29,000 , and Galveston with 22,000 . The prominence of New Orleans is explained by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as large as the other principal cities within the circuit of its trade relations . There is much complaint of the badness of the city government and the lethargy of the business men . At a cafe ' c/ian/ant one night I heard a popular song criticising the mayor , the aldermen , and the merchants , because of dull times , diverted trade , and unemployed labor , and the refrain to each verse was : " Stick a pin in them and see if they 're alive . " The Exposition sprang from the conviction that the future growth of New Orleans depends on securing a larger share of the trade of Latin America . The idea back of it is that the shores of the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea and the islands of the Antilles should exchange their products here for the manufactures of the North . If this idea bears important fruit , it must be through the accession of fresh Northern blood and capital to the business circles of the Crescent City . This is what it is hoped the Exposition will accomplish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open to the southward for commercial activity . New blood is needed , because the old stock becomes lethargic through the enervating climatic influences . Rarely does the successful merchant who comes as a young man from the cooler latitudes leave a son who inherits the father 's energy . One generation is enough to change character . " THE SMOKER WAS OBDURATE . " // The long , hot , moist summers of the Louisiana lowlands are fatal to vigor . A city that lies below the level of the river which washes its wharves and only a few feet above the poisonous swamps surrounding it , and which has six sweltering summer months , must always continue to draw upon the North for new men to carry on its larger business activities . THE WOMAN 'S DEPARTMENT . MRS . JULIA WARD HowE and her zealous assistants have made of this department a pleasing and successful feature of the Exposition , in spite of a grievous want of funds growing out of the miscalculations of the general management , which obliged them to resort to benefit concerts and lectures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State alcoves in one of the galleries of the Government Building look like a series of sumptuous parlors , profusely decorated with pictures and embroideries . It is pleasant to retreat to one of these nooks from the mascnline spaces of the fair , with their aggressive claims upon the attention , and to find one 's self surrounded with only feminine influences . No great intellectual effort or physical exertion is needed to see and appreciate the delicate needlework , the decorated porcelain , or the bright crazy-quilts , or the attempts at painting and sculpture here displayed . In fact , the mind is ratherbenumbed at the view of thepatient labor expended to produce pretty effects , as , for instance , the flowered quilt from Louisiana , made of a mosaic of 100,584 pieces of silk . Another quilt from Minnesota is covered with the autographs of the celebrities of all nations , and is said to be the result of ten years ' effort . The thought of sleeping under the weight of all those congregated great names is appalling . A STEVEDORE. // Woman 's work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibit , by scientific analyses of food adulterations ; and there are also a library of books by women , some botanical collections , and a few patented inventions . Some of the States have not seen fit to join the department in the gallery , preferring to show their women 's exhibits in their State sections on the floor . Among these is Ohio , whose painted pottery and carved wood-work from Cincinnati touch , perhaps , the highest range of feminine achievements in art to be seen at the fair . The impression a critical observer takes away from the Woman 's Department , besides the pleasing one of its soft and pretty decorative effects , is that it is wholly and of necessity inadequate to present a view of the attainments of women in the industries and arts , and their share in carrying forward the world 's civilization . Woman 's work is so entangled with that of man in a thousand lines of effort , that it can not be separated , ticketed with a feminine label , and put on exhibition . To realize what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the census schedules of the occupations they engage in , and the number employed in each . An enormous amount of the labor , skill , and taste employed to carry on the processes of our modern life comes from women 's hands and brains . These handsomely adorned alcoves , each with its State name , which occupy the gallery of the Woman 's Department with their treasures of needle-work , and ornamented pottery , and ambitious little pictures , show woman 's play rather than woman s work . They are very admirable in their way , and I would not in the least disparage them ; but let us not for a moment suppose that they adequately typify woman 's achievements . Nine-tenths of the educational exhibit is in reality woman 's work , and a majority of the fabrics and wares which fill the Main Building have probably received some touch in making or . decoration from her hand . If it were possible to present a picture of what woman does to-day in America , in the multiform lines of human effort , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a century ago , when closely confined to household duties , none of the revolutions of modern times which have set the world forward would appear so significant and so far-reaching . THE MEXICAN EXHIBITS . AMONG foreign nations Mexico has taken the most active interest in the New Orleans World 's Fair . Her government has formed an admirable exhibit , which presents a faithful epitome of her natural resources and her industrial life . The aim has not been to display a few articles of exceptional merit , but to show the whole range of useful products and native manufactures . One is surprised at the number of things the Mexicans make , and make well . Their cotton fabrics are good , and of tasteful patterns ; their woolens are / // well woven ; their leather-work , especially in saddlery , is wonderfully fine ; their pottery is quaintly original ; they prepare a multitude of food products and wines . Many articles show ingenuity and a great deal of patient labor . The little painted clay statuettes made by Indians , and representing phases of Mexican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priest , the country gentleman , the fisherman , etc. ,  --  and the bird-pictures made from the feathers of the birds they represent , show the genius of close imitation , of patient handicraft , and to some extent of original conception , and seem to indicate an aptitude in the people for the higher kinds of manufacturing industry , which could be much developed by training . After spending an hour in the Mexican courts one marvels that a people who can produce all these things should make so small a figure in the sum-total of the world 's civilizing forces . In the Horticultural Hall Mexico makes a remarkable display of the different species of the cactus plant . This odd freak of the vegetable kingdom assumes no end of fantastic shapes . There are cacti like enormous pincushions , as big as barrels ; cacti like giants ' clubs , standing thirty feet high ; cacti with thorns a finger long ; cacti covered with delicate gray hairs ; cacti with beautiful tubular pink blossoms ; cacti with big roses growing among their spikes ; cacti with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulbs , in branching candelabra . This cactus show is alone worth a visit to the Exposition . After seeing it one understands why the Mexican infantry soldiers wear high-topped boots . I have spokenbefore of the Moorish Building erected for the display of Mexican mining products , and of the barracks for the Mexican soldiers and the military band . The band has enlivened the fair through all its stages , furnishing music on every ceremonial occasion with never-failing courtesy and good-nature , and with a cosmopolitan impartiality , playing Dixie or Hail Columbia , Gounod , or Rossini , or Mozart , or Strauss with equal good-will , or singing the songs of love and patriotism of their own country . To these swarthy musicians , sixty of them I think in all , and representing most of the types of Mexico 's much mixed races , the Exposition is greatly indebted . LOUISIANA AGRICULTURE . NEAR the great tower of green sugar-canes which serves as a beacon to guide the visitor through the mazes of the Government Building to the Louisiana section , and beneath the rice-thatched pavilion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louisiana wants more men and women of brains , energy , and capital . Her lands are the most productive and the cheapest of all the Southern States . " Close at hand , on one of the white pillars which show the sources whence the United States draws its supplies of sugar , and the comparative amount furnished by Louisiana , is a statement in black letters that " only one-twentieth of the land in Louisiana available for sugar is now under cultivation . " These two inscriptions provoke inquiry . Here is one of the oldest settled portions of the Union , which could show a flourishing agriculture and a considerable CACTUS FROM MEXICO . // commercial city when such States as Illinois , Iowa , and Wisconsin were peopled only by savages , and such cities as Cincinnati , Chicago , and St. Paul had not even a name , setting up claims for immigration in competition with those of Dakota and Oregon . How does it happen that there are still great areas of rich land untilled in the Mississippi delta ? The first answer to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overflow by levees , and that the present population has all it can do to maintain the old embankments , and can not afford to build new ones to redeem more soil from the swamps . The second is , that the social organism is based on agriculture , and agriculture in all the lowland districts is based on negro labor . As many white people are now living on the labor of the negroes as that labor will support . The small immigration from Europe and the North goes to the towns and engages in trade . There has been very little influx of new blood in the country districts . The negro labor is probably in the aggr*gate as productive as in the days of slavery ; but a smaller share of its results goes to the white land-owners , and a larger share to the blacks themselves . Thus the whites always speak of " the good old days before the war , " and were , no doubt , as a class , in better circumstances then than now , though the aggregate annual wealth-production was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agriculture , cotton , raised in the uplands north of the Red River , shows some gain in its annual yield ; sugar is variable in quantity , depending greatly on the seasons , and requiring large capital for its culture ; rice , which is especially a black man 's crop , has increased steadily , beginning with 20 ,  - -  978 barrels in 1865 , and without a single set-back advancing to 498,138 barrels in 1883 . The time is not far distant when land will be too valuable on this continent for large areas of the warm , bountiful soils of Louisiana to be allowed to remain idle , and when the Mississippi delta , with its interlacing rivers and bayous , will be a semi-tropical Holland , as well diked and as thoroughly utilized as the thrifty , populous country in the Rhine delta . The most interesting phase of Louisiana agriculture is sugar-planting and sugar-making . This whole industry rests on a few lines in the tariff law . Without the duty on sugar and molasses the Louisiana planters could not maintain themselves in competition with those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and where the cane sprouts afresh from the roots every year . The sugar industry in Louisiana is an exotic , but it is too late now to discuss the wisdom of nurturing it by favoring legislation . It is established ; it employs large capital ; it supports a considerable population ; it is one of the pillars of the whole industrial and social fabric in an entire State . To withdraw the legislative shield which protects it would be to bring bankruptcy and misery to many thousands of people . The recent threat of the Spanish treaty produced great alarm in the sugar districts . The planters occupy a peculiarly critical position , their industry and the value of their landed property and machinery depending upon the goodwill of Congress , a large majority of whose members represent constituencies having no interest in the taxation of foreign sugars at the custom-house . In ante-bellum times the sugar-planters were the flower of the slave-holding aristocracy . They owned large estates , lived genA STUDY IN THE HOTEL . I , ; // erously , valued education , and cultivated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hospitable race , and were rudely shaken by the storm of war and the emancipation of the slaves . Many of them were unable to adapt themselves to the new social conditions , and have disappeared in the oblivion of financial and personal ruin . Others hold on to their lands , but are not able to cultivate more than a small part of them . Many of the old , influential families have perished , and their estates have gone into the hands of new men from the North , or of Hebrew moneylenders in New Orleans . There is still enough left , however , of the old planting life behind the levees on the rivers and bayous , where the warm land slopes back to the mournful cypress swamps , and where the pillared porches of old mansions gleam through the foliage of orange-trees , to give picturesqueness and character to the region . THE COLORED DEPARTMENT . IT would be more correct to call it the Somewhat Colored Department . Nowhere CREOLES. // does it appear to represent the achievements of the pure-blooded negro . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue eyes and brown hair . The lady-like person who calls your attention to the embroideries and the handsome artificial flowers in the Louisiana section is an octoroon . The maker of an assortment of tools , forged with the hammer , hangs his photograph beside his work and displays unmistakable Caucasian features . And so it goes throughout the whole display . Even the chief of the department , a distinguished bureau official from Washington and a former United States senator , is three-fourths white . As a display of a few useful and many ornamental objects and some atrocities in art , produced by people having more or less African blood in their veins , this gallery possesses a moderate interest ; but as a presentation of the industrial or educational attainments of the negro race in America , it is of very small value . It is impossible to sayin the case of any article whether the white blood or the black , in the veins of the representative of mixed ancestry who made it , produced the progressive tendency . The absurdity of showing the work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - 2o. race will be manifest if we turn the thing around , and imagine at a fair held in Hayti , where white people are said to be greatly despised , a white department opened and filled with articles made by persons three-fourths black . If this be not a fair comparison , then we must imagine the black blood in the mixed race to have greater potency than the white to develop its own race tendencies , and insist that in an ethnological sense the old barbarous rule of slavery was correct , and that the smallest visible admixture of the African taint makes the man a negro . Of course , the truth is on the opposite side of the proposition : the white blood is the more powerful , and the man who carries a preponderance of it in his veins is not a negro , and must be classed with the white race if any scientific line is to be drawn . There is every reason to believe that the blacks of our Southern States are making steady progress . On a " Historical Chart of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motto : " We must unite ; we must acquire wealth ; we must educate , or we will perish . " The negroes are slowly getting property and education . They inherit from slavery one great blessing - the habit of Al THE PROMENADE . // industry ; and this is their salvation . As to the higher attainments of civilization , whatever they exhibit , except in rare and isolated cases , is plainly traceable either to contact with the white race or to the admixture of white blood . I had almost forgotten to point out one undoubted product of negro genius in the Colored Department . The Rev. John Jasper , of Richmond , Virginia , who preaches that the earth stands still , and the sun revolves around it , and tries to demolish astronomy with Scripture texts , has his autobiography on sale . Beside the books lies his photograph , which is that of a man whose unmixed African ancestry will not be questioned . TYPES AND ODDITIES . THE visitors themselves are as well worth seeing as the show . To sit on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Main Building , or better still beneath the spreading arms of the great live-oaks on the grounds , and observe the passing throng , is to my mind the best part of the sight-seeing at the fair . The first broad division one makes is between Northern and Southern people . The energetic tread , the business-like air , and the evident disposition to do up the exhibition thoroughly and speedily , betrays the man from the North , as well as the cut of his coat , his Derby hat , and the unnecessary overcoat he lugs about on his arm , incredulous as to May weather lasting long in February . The Northern woman is more fashionably dressed than her Southern sister , has a quicker gait , a better complexion , a nervous , eager manner , and an appearance of being in quest of information quite essential to her well-being . The Southern visitors saunter and chat a good deal ; they seem never in a hurry . The women affect black in preference to colors , and are not particular as to the forms of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire South since the war , has nearly driven out the black 1/ " WHAT 'S THE CHEER GOOD FOE IF IT AI N'T TO SET DOWN IN ? " // broadcloth suit which was once the regulation garb for gentlemen , and it is not much worn now except by the older men , but the soft slouch hat holds its own . There are more distinct and recognizable types among the Southern population than in the North . The large-boned Kentuckian or Tennesseean , reared on a limestone soil , differs widely from the inhabitant of the malarial lowlands of Mississippi and Louisiana . The Georgian can be told by speech and look from his neighbor in South Carolina . The Texan is a big breezy fellow , with a long stride and an air of owning half the universe . The Creole Louisianian ( by which term , let it be explained for the hundredth time for the benefit of persistent ignorance , is meant , n otamulatto , but a native white of French or Spanish ancestry ) is short of stature , slight offrame , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , carefully dressed , very polite , and with small interest in the doings of the world outside his own State . The odd characters at the fair are the terror of exhibitors . A Cincinnati furniture-maker discovered a countryman from Arkansas whittling a handsome mahogany cabinet " to see what the wood was like . " The man 's knowledge of furniture was evidently limited to articles which could not be damaged by a reasonable use of the jack-knife . Another exhibitor , who had fitted up a room with the finest specimens of his art , was horrified to find an old lady eating her lunch of fried chicken seated in one of his satin upholstered chairs . " What 's the cheer good for if it ai n't to set down in ? " she placidly remarked , in reply to his earnest request that she would go somewhere else with her victuals . The same exhibitor one day found that some visitor to his alcoves had left a token of his approval on the polished surface of a costly mantel , in the words " This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who sell olive-wood , beads , and other trinkets " from Jerusalem " - all made in Paris - are picturesque additions to the 95 permanent personnel of the fair , though their genuineness , like that of their wares , will not always bear inspection . An amusing scene occurred one day at one of these Oriental bazaars . A tall man , with a rural air , stopped before the stand and appeared to take a lively interest , not in the goods , but in the features of one of the salesmen in scarlet fez and baggy trousers . He surveyed the Oriental in front and in profile , and then , slapping him on the shoulder , exclaimed , " Hello , Jake , when did you come from Indiana ? " The Turk from Indiana acknowledged his old acquaintance and begged that he would not " give him away . " SOUTHERN TiMBER . THE Southern States seek in their State displays , in the Government Building , to impress visitors with the fact that they have great undeveloped resources in their forests , which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ YOU COME FROM INOJANA ? " // the Northern pineries , are inviting to enterprise . In these displays sections of tree-trunks and specimens of boards are everywhere conspicuous . Florida erects a quadrilateral wall of trunks , entire below , split above to show the wood , both plain and varnished , and ending with the pressed leaves , accompanied by a little condensed information as to each specimen . In all there are one hundred and eighty varieties . Forty-two per cent . of all the varieties of forest trees known to exist in the United States are found in Florida . An artistic way of showing timber specimens is seen in the Tennessee section , where , on polished squares of the different kinds of wood found in the State , the leaves and flowers of each are prettily painted , the whole forming a large mosaic screen . Georgia , Florida , Alabama , Mississippi , Louisiana , and Texas have still many thousand square miles of yellow pine timber-lands , barely touched here and there by the lumberman 's operations . The yellow pine is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ship-yards of the North . The sweetgum tree , which grows abundantly in northern Louisiana , Arkansas , and the Yazoo delta of Mississippi , is beginning to come into use for furniture-making , and , now that the Northern black-walnut is so nearly exhausted , is likely to attract attention . Its wood takes a fine polish . There are said to be nine million acres of this timber . The tree grows to the height of ninety feet . In the swamps in the lower Mississippi basin the cypress is everywhere the dominant tree . Its trunk spreads out at the base to get a firm hold on the watersoaked loam , and it rears its branches to a height of over one hundred feet . The wood is very tough and durable , and is said to last forty years in the form of shingles and siding without the protection of paint . It is used for general . building purposes , for boats , and for furniture veneered with mahogany . The white locust , the white holly , the ash , and the cottonwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good deal of black-walnut in Tennessee and Arkansas , but the furniture factories in Cincinnati and Grand Rapids have bought the little that remains uncut . SOUTHERN MANUFACTURES . ONE sees few evidences in the Exposition of the development of manufactures in the Southern States . In some special lines , at least , such development is going forward to a notable extent , but it is very inadequately represented here . The number of cotton-mills has increased from i6i in i88o to 270 in 1884 . There ought to be a collective display of the products of these factories . Most of them are small mills , and make only yarns or coarse cloths ; but the fact that 109 establishments should have been put in operation in four years is a remarkable evidence of progress . The great coal and iron deposits in northern Alabama have brought into existence a growing iron industry at Birmingham , where pig-iron is now made at less cost than at any other place in the United States . The Alabama coal is fast displacing that of Illinois , Ohio , and western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We must not , however , be led by these facts to suppose that there is any such general growth of manufacturing in the South as is taking place in Western States , like Wisconsin , Iowa , and Minnesota . The Southern States make a striking display of raw materials suitable for various forms of industry , and with iron and coal , timber and fibers , extend an eager invitation to all the world to come and make use of these bountiful gifts of nature ; but their people appear to expect somebody else to do for them the work of diversifying their industries . They do little for themselves in this direction , compared to what is done in the West . If the exhibition is a faithful mirror of their achievements , we must conclude that most that we have heard of their recent progress beyond the old lines of raising agricultural staples has been newspaper talk only . Must we not also conclude that the genius of skillful handicraft does not spring from opportunity , but is a rare instinct ? Manufacturing is an inherited tendency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the migration of that stock . A bountiful supply of natural resources does not give birth to this instinct . The New England States are singularly poor in such resources , while Virginia , Tennessee , and other Southern States are notably rich in them . Yet there are single towns in Massachusetts and Connecticut whose annual product of manufactures nearly equals that of all the Southern States . If the South is ever to become the seat of extensive general manufacturing operations , it will be when the West is full of people , and the tide of migration , which now follows lines of latitude , is deflected southward . The old Southern stock , very little changed by the infusion of new blood since the war , has no aptitude for the small economies , the close application , the attention to detail , and the mastery of machinery required for successful manufacturing . BRAZILIAN COFFEE . THE Rio de Janeiro Society of Labor and Commerce displays six hundred and twentyfour // samples of coffee , coxnprising eighty different qualities , each of which has its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rescue Brazilian coffee from the low standing it has in the markets of the world , by proving that " Rio " is merely a trade name for a poor grade , and that all the better grades sold as Java , Ceylon , and Mocha are produced in large quantities in Brazil . It seems that it is the custom of the coffee merchants to sort the beans , calling the small round ones , of which only one grows in a cherry , " Mocha , " and the large well-formed ones " Java " or " Ceylon , " and then to lump the remainder together , mixed perhaps with a still poorer article from Venezuela or Costa Rica , and call it " Rio . " A talk with the members of the Rio de Janeiro Society in charge of this interesting coffee exhibit will show most coffee-drinkers that they are ignorant of the main facts concerning the little berry of which their favorite beverage is made . How few people are connoisseurs of coffee . How few know that , like wine , the berry improves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time between the gathering and the use . We insist that wine should have a proper age , yet we buy the fresh green berries , recently gathered . Most consumers think the green color is an evidence of good quality , while in fact it shows that the bean is not sufficiently cured to be at its best , and that it will give the beverage a raw , crude flavor . The best coffee is of a light yellowish color . As the bean loses in weight with age , it is to the interest of the producer to market it at once . The consumer who is critical as to quality and aroma will lay in one or two years supply , to insure the proper age , and will have the quantity needed for his breakfast-table freshly roasted and ground every morning in his own kitchen . There is as much difference in coffee as in wine , and nothing is more difficult , as every traveler knows , than to get even a tolerably fair cup of this most common of beverages . I doubt if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cup of coffee , yet it is a luxury within the reach of everybody . In New Orleans the survival of French traditions in cooking insures a palatable cafe ' au ictif , but the berry in common use comes from Mecca and lacks delicacy of aroma . The custom is to make the coffee very strong and black by the drip method , and to put in the cup as much hot milk as coffee . This makes a very nutritious drink , and , with a loaf of bread about as big as a man 's fist and some fresh butter , is the Creole breakfast . To eat meat , potatoes , or hot bread in the morning the Creole regards as an American barbarism . INDIAN ENGLISH . IN the New Mexico section are shown a curious batch of compositions written by Indian pupils in the Catholic schools . Some of these specimens of Indian English are very funny . Here are two of them : The Cow and Oxen . I write about the cow and oxen . The cows give to milk and the oxen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milks .

The cows are not have teeth just in the other side and all times chewing grass and oxen also chewing grass .

BELGIUM receives hearty praise on all hands for the generous recognition her Government and her manufacturers have given to the Exposition . Other European nations have treated it with indifference , giving no money to aid it , and no stimulus of special effort , and contenting themselves with turning over those of their people who wished to exhibit goods to their respective consuls at New Orleans . Belgium , though in the midst of efforts for an exhibition of her own , of no small importance , to open in Antwerp in May , has devoted both money and effort to the creditable display , under competent supervision , of her art , her machinery , her textile fabrics , and her general manufactures , in the distant city at the mouth of the Mississippi . In all its departments , whether of railway appliances or paintings , cannon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is attractive and worthy of study . The youngest of European nations , created by diplomacy only a little more than half a century ago , has an eye to business as well as to international courtesy in her prompt attendance at all important world 's fairs . Her various industries compete sharply with those of France , Germany , and England . In a speech opening the Belgian section , the commissioner spoke of the purpose of his country // to develop commerce between Antwerp and New Orleans , and not only to extend her trade with the United States , but to reach out from New Orleans to Mexico and Central America for new markets for her manufactures . The Belgian paintings show the influence of both Munich and Paris . A distinct national schoolhas hardly yet arisen . There are no great pictures shown , but there are many noticeably good ones , and no bad ones , and the display as a whole is very interesting . FRENCH EDUCATION .

This display is in charge of Professor B. Breisson . It covers the whole field of educational effort in France , from the creche for infants and the primary school to the colleges , the medical schools , the schools for manual labor , and the national schools of decorative arts . The American teacher visiting the crowded gallery containing this exhibit will be struck , first , by the way in which the French carry their love of system into their school work ; next , by a certain artistic feeling and indefinable touch of taste in the work of the pupils ; and then , most of all , by the many evidences that instruction is carried outside the text-book , as far as possible , to objects and their relations , teaching theories by things and not by sentences learned by rote . The tendency is strongly in this direction in our own country , but the French carry it farther than we do , seeking in many ways to make the pupil familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the practical sides of life . THE LIBERTY BELL AND THE OLD FLAG . THE old Liberty Bell , which stands in the Main Building upon the car built to transport it and its guard of stalwart policemen from Philadelphia , appears to awaken a sentiment of nationality in the breasts of the Southern visitors to the Exposition . Their patriotic feelings do not always extend to the national flag , however . It is rare to see the Stars and Stripes in New Orleans save on the shipping and the Government buildings . The people are fond of bunting , and to gratify their taste for color they devise many strange banners . Visitors are puzzled to make out the meaning of these combinations of red , purple , green , yellow , and white floating from flagstaffs on stores and hotels . To the frequent question , " What sort of a flag is that ? " the answer is , " Oh , that do n't mean anything in particular . It 's just a fancy flag , " or more often , " That 's the flag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the Bankers ' Building on the Exposition Grounds was decorated , a photographer from Philadelphia , who had been taking a picture of the throng , called out from his platform as the Stars and Stripes were unfurled from the roof of the structure , " Three cheers for our flag ! " There were a few cheers and almost as many hisses . The Exposition will , unquestion IHE LIBERTY BELL . // ably , do much toward stimulating the growth of the national idea in the South . A study of the enormous aggregation of products , arts , and inventions in the Government Building classified by States can not fail to produce an enlarged conception of the greatness of the republic , and a feeling of pride in its magnificent resources . Opposition to the national emblem is only a sentiment in the South , and is fast fading into a tradition . There is not the slightest desire for separation . The Southerner does not want to hurrah for the old flag , simply because be thinks that to do so would be to show unfaithfulness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his kindred fought  --  a memory which to him is sacred . A REMEDY FOR HARD TIMES . THE Centennial Exhibition at Philadelphia was held when the business of the country was deep down in the rut of depression into which it had been settling after the panic of 1873 . The exhibition seemed to be the turning-point . It set people in motion and broke the spell of lethargy . Hard times are a mental disease . At the outset a necessary reaction from the fever of speculation , they become a chronic condition prolonged far beyond the time needed for restoring wholesome conditions to trade . People grasp their money tightly , become overcautious , draw back from the most inviting enterprises , and retrench ex penses beyond reasonable economy . The malady affects even those whose incomes have not in the least suffered . The rich grow penurious without themselves knowing why . Thus the consumption of products of all kinds diminishes and manufactures and trade languish . A great exhibition encourages people to travel , interests their minds by its display of inventions , processes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grooves of inactivity and causes them to loosen their energies and their purse-strings . Perhaps the New Orleans fair is destined to do the same good work in breaking up hard times as was done by the Centennial . It is a pity that its magnitude and attractions did not become earlier known to the country at large . It took about two months to educate the country up to an appreciation of the Philadelphia Exhibition , but afterwards came the pleasant fall weather , most inviting to travel and sight-seeing . Unfortunately , the summer will begin in New Orleans about as soon as a knowledge of the merits of the " World 's Industrial and Cotton Centennial Exposition " is widely diffused . If it were practicable to hold the great show together and reopen it in the coming autumn , its benefits would be much increased , and the wise plan of its projectors of bringing together within its gates for better acquaintance and mutual profit the peoples of all the North American republics and colonies might be more fully realized .
