PUBLISHERS ' NOTE THE text of RIP VAN WINKLE , as played by JOSEPH JEFFERSON , is here for the first time published . The aim has been to supply such illustrations and explanations as will best recall the play to those who have seen it . To this end , Mrs. CORA HAMILTON BELL has , with Mr. Jefferson 's approval , amplified and supplemented the stage directions , and has supplied descriptive prefaces to each act . Many of the illustrations are direct reproductions from photographs of Mr. Jefferson in the character of " Rip . " Those in the text are mostly from drawings by RICHARD CREIFELDS , made directly from scenes in the play . The portrait is from a photograph of Mr. Jefferson recently taken , and is the one best liked by him . Most interesting of all , perhaps , will be the reproductions of paintings by Mr. Jefferson himself of scenes in the Catskill Mountains , and the illustration facing page 120 , wherein the figure is by F. EUGENE SMITH , and the background by Mr. Jefferson . INTRODUCTION @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public for so many years that I feel emboldened to bespeak a little of your favour for his new appearance in another form . This version , now printed for the first time , may be regarded perhaps as a souvenir of a greater number of performances than I can possibly count , and as such I hope may be acceptable . I have endeavoured to select from my Autobiography ( with the kind consent of the Century Company ) such passages relating to the history of the play and my performance of the part as may be of interest to the readers of this volume , and to give the desultory gossip of the Autobiography a rather more historical sequence . I can lay no claim to having invented Rip . The Greeks knew him ; the Germans made a home for him in their Hartz Mountains , calling him Carl , the Shepherd ; and the genius of Washington Irving transplanted him to our own Kaatskills . Yates , Hackett , and Burke had each made him the hero of separate dramas and representations before I tried my hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winkle came to me in the summer of ' 59 . I had arranged to board with my family at a queer old Dutch farm-house in Paradise Valley , at the foot of Pocono Mountain in Pennsylvania . A ridge of hills covered with tall hemlocks surrounds the vale , and numerous trout-streams wind through the meadows and tumble over the rocks . Stray farms are scattered through the valley , and the few old Dutchmen and their families who till the soil were born upon it ; there and only there they have ever lived . The valley harmonised with me and our resources . The scene was wild , the air was fresh , and the board was cheap . What could the light heart and purse of a poor actor ask for more than this ? On one of those long rainy days that always render the country so dull , I had climbed to the loft of the barn , and , lying upon the hay , was reading that delightful book , " The Life and Letters of Washington Irving . " I had got well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when , to my surprise , I came upon a passage which said that he had seen me at Laura Keene 's theatre , as Goldfinch , in Holcroft 's comedy of " The Road to Ruin , " and that I reminded him of my father " in look , gesture , size , and make . " Till then , I was not aware that he had ever seen me . I was comparatively obscure , and to find myself remembered and written of by such a man gave me a thrill of pleasure I can never forget . I put down the book , and lay there thinking how proud I was , and ought to be , at the revelation of this compliment . What an incentive to a youngster like me to go on ! And so I thought to myself , " Washington Irving , the author of ' The Sketch-Book , ' in which is the quaint story of Rip Van Winkle . " Rip Van Winkle ! There was to me magic in the sound of the name as I repeated it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted ? An American story by an American author was surely just the theme suited to an American actor . In ten minutes I had gone to the house and returned to the barn with " The Sketch-Book . " I had not read the story since I was a boy . I was disappointed in it ; not as a story , of course , but the tale was purely a narrative . The theme was interesting , but not dramatic . The silver Hudson stretches out before you as you read ; the quaint red roofs and queer gables of the old Dutch cottages stand out against the the mist upon the mountains ; but all this is descriptive . The character of Rip does not speak ten lines . What could be done dramatically with so simple a sketch ? How could it be turned into an effective play ? Three or four bad dramatisations of the story had already been acted , but without marked success . Yates , of London , had given one in which the hero dies ; one had been acted by my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some of these versions I had remembered when I was a boy , and I should say that Burke 's play and the performance were the best ; but nothing that I remembered gave me the slightest encouragement that I could get a good play out of any of the existing materials . Still , I was so bent upon acting the part that I started for the city ; and in less than a week , by industriously ransacking the theatrical wardrobe establishments for old leather and mildewed cloth , and by personally superintending the making of the wigs , each article of my costume was completed ; and all this too before I had written a line of the play or studied a word of the part . This is working in an opposite direction from all the conventional methods in the study and elaboration of a dramatic character , and certainly not following the course I would advise any one to pursue . I merely mention the out-of-the-way , upside-down manner of going to work as an illustration of the impatience and enthusiasm with which I entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting the dress ready before I studied the part to the vain desire I had of witnessing myself in the glass , decked out and equipped as the hero of the Kaatskills . I got together three old printed versions of the drama and the story itself . The plays were all in two acts . I thought it would be an improvement in the drama to arrange it in three , making the scene with the spectre crew an act by itself . This would separate the poetical from the domestic side of the story . But by far the most important alteration was in the interview with the spirits . In the old versions , they spoke and sang . I remember that the effect of this ghostly dialogue was dreadfully human , so I arranged that no voice but Rip 's should be heard . This was entirely my own invention . I was quite sure that the silence of the crew would give a lonely and desolate character to the scene , and add to its supernatural weirdness . By this means , too , a strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deathlike stillness of the " demons " as they glided about the stage in solemn silence . It required some thought to hit upon just the best questions that could be answered by a nod and shake of the head , and to arrange that at times even Rip should propound a query to himself , and answer it ; but I availed myself of so much of the old material that in a few days after I had begun my work , it was finished . In the seclusion of the barn , I studied and rehearsed the part ; and by the end of the summer , I was prepared to transplant it from the rustic realms of an old farm-house to a cosmopolitan audience , in the city of Washington , where I opened at Carusi 's Hall , under the management of John T. Raymond . I had gone over the play so thoroughly that each situation was fairly engraved on my mind . The rehearsals were therefore not tedious to the actors ; no one was delayed that I might consider how he or she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by repeated experiments so saturated myself with the action of the play that a few days served to perfect the rehearsals . I acted , on these occasions , with all the point and feeling that I could muster . This answered the double purpose of giving me freedom , and observing the effect of what I was doing on the actors . They seemed to be watching me closely , and I could tell by little nods of approval when the points hit . To be brief , the play was acted with a result that was , to me , both satisfactory and disappointing . I was quite sure that the character was what I had been seeking , and I was equally satisfied that the play was not . The action had neither the body nor the strength to carry the hero ; the spiritual quality was there , but the human interest was wanting . This defect was not remedied until five years later , when I met Dion Boucicault , in London . Then , he agreed to rewrite the drama for a consideration agreed upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his labour in this play ; but I did , and do still , with good reason . His version was still cast in three acts . Later , I divided the first act into two , making the end of the dance the end of an act , rather than the end of a scene , and enlarged and strengthened it in various ways suggested by my experience . It will thus be seen that the play is by no means the work of one mind , but both as to its narrative and dramatic form , has been often moulded , and by many hands . In acting the part of Rip , I have always found that what to do was simple enough , but what not to do was the important and difficult point to determine . The earlier scenes of the play being of a natural and domestic character , I had only to draw upon my experience for their effect . But from the moment Rip meets the spirits of Hendrick Hudson and his crew , I felt that the colloquial speech and lazy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elves , in the third act , the play drifts from realism into idealism , and becomes poetical . After this , it is a fairy tale , and the prosaic elements of the character should be eliminated . Rip 's sympathy with nature is always very keen , and he talks to the trees and his dog as if they were human . The fairy element in the play seems to be attached to it as the fairy element in a " Midsummer Night 's Dream . " And because Rip is a fairy , he neither laughs nor eats in the fourth act . For this reason , also , when they wanted me to reform at the end of the play , I said , " No . Should Rip refuse the cup , the drama would become a temperance play ; and I should as soon expect to hear of Cinderella striking for higher wages , or of a speech on Woman 's Rights from Old Mother Hubbard , as to listen to a temperance lecture from Rip Van Winkle . It would take all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose that when Rip wakes up , he would yawn ; but a yawn , being expressive of a night 's sleep , would destroy the harmony of the twenty years ' sleep . If the sleep of twenty years were merely incongruous , there would be room for argument pro and con ; but being an impossibility , the mind accepts it , not because it is an impossibility , but from curiosity to know the psychological result if such an event could happen . And it is this strange and original attitude of the characters that has kept my interest in it alive for so many years . I have never " staged " Rip with the realism in fashion of late years , though I have had various suggestions made to me for elaborating the spectacular and scenic effects of the play , among which were the introduction of several fat old Knickerbockers smoking their long pipes and quarrelling in Dutch ; a large windmill , with sails to work ; dairy-maids , with real cows ; mechanical effects for the sudden and mysterious appearance and disappearance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act , the Continental army with drums and fifes ; a militia training ; and the further introduction of patriotic speeches about American independence . So unreal a theme could not have been interwoven with all this realism without marring the play . For this reason , when a lady once asked me , " Why do n't you have a dog in the play ? " I replied that I disliked realism in art ; and realism alive , with a tail to wag at the wrong time , would be abominable . " But do n't you think that the public would like to see Schneider ? " " The public could not pay him a higher compliment , for it shows how great an interest they take in an animal that has never been exhibited . No , no ; ' hold the mirror up to nature , ' if you like , but do n't hold nature up ,  --  a reflection of the thing , but not the thing itself . How badly would a drunken man give an exhibition of intoxication on the stage ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectly sane ? We must not be natural , but appear to be so . " So , too , I have never felt that the dialect was an important element in the presentation of the character . I do not make it so prominent or so consistent as they would do in a variety show . If I were to do that , I would destroy the larger element . I am a Pennsylvanian myself , and I lived very much among the Pennsylvania Dutch in the mountains , when I was studying the part , and I got the flavour of it ; but I regard it only as an accompaniment . I would like to repeat here a curious incident connected with " Rip Van Winkle , " and I have done . There is in the village of Catskill a Rip Van Winkle Club . This society did me the honour to invite me to act the character in their town . I accepted , and when I arrived was met by the worthy president and other members of the club , among whom was young Nicholas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the original " Old Nick . " Emulating the spirit of evolution , the citizens had turned the skating-rink into a theatre , and a very respectable-looking establishment it made , though in its transition state the mark of rollers did " cling to it still . " I was taking a cup of tea at the table in the hotel , when I was attracted to the coloured waiter , who was giving a graphic and detailed account of this legend of the Kaatskill Mountains to one of the boarders who sat nearly opposite to me . " Yes , sah , " he continued ; " Rip went up into de mountain , slep ' for twenty years , and when he came back hyar , in dis berry town , his own folks didn'y know him . " " Why , " said his listener , " you do n't believe the story 's true ? " " True ? Ob course it is ; why , " pointing at me , " dat 's de man . " The town was filled with farmers and their wives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opening of the new theatre , and also , I think I may say , to see for the first time on the stage the story which Washington Irving had laid almost at their very doors . As I drove to the theatre , the rain came down in torrents , the thunder rolled , and the lightning played around the peaks of the distant mountains under the very shadow of which I was to act the play . It gave me a very strange sensation . When I got to the theatre , I could scarcely get in , the crowd was so great about the door ,  --  countrymen trying to get into the ticket  --  office instead of the proper entrance , and anxious and incredulous old ladies endeavouring to squeeze past the doorkeeper , but refusing to give up their tickets . The rush over , the play began . The audience was intent on the scene as it progressed , and seemed anxious not to lose a word . During the scene in the last act where Rip inquires of the innkeeper , " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the text , and substituted the correct name , " Is this the village of Catskill ? " The crowded house almost held its breath . The name of the village seemed to bring the scene home to every man , woman , and child that was looking at it . From this time on the interest was at its full tension . Surely , I had never seen an audience so struck with the play before . There was a reception held at the club after the play , and the worthy president , in introducing me to the company , was so nervous that he announced me as " Mr. Washington Irving . " JOSEPH JEFFERSON . NEW YORK , October , 1895 . Main text ACT I. SCENE I. The village of Falling Waters , set amid familiar and unmistakable Hudson River scenery , with the shining river itself and the noble heights of the Kaatskills visible in the distance . In the foreground , to the left of the stage , is a country inn bearing the sign of George III . In the wall of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To the right of the stage , an old cottage with a door opening into the interior ; before the cottage stands a bench holding a wash-tub , with washboard , soap , and clothes in the tub . In the centre of the stage , a table and chairs , and on the table a stone pitcher and two tin cups . As the curtain rises , Gretchen is discovered washing , and little Meenie sitting near by on a low stool . The sound of a chorus and laughter comes from the inn . GRETCHEN . Shouting and drinking day and night . Laughter is heard from the inn . Hark how they crow over their cups while their wives are working at home , and their children are starving . Enter Derrick from the inn with a green bag , followed by Nick Vedder . Derrick places his green bag on the table . DERRICK . Not a day , not an hour . If the last two quarters ' rent be not paid by this time to-morrow , out you go ! NICK . Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let us have a glass , and talk the matter over ; good liquor opens the heart . Here , Hendrick ! Hendrick ! Enter Hendrick . HENDRICK . Yes , father . DERRICK . So that is your brat ? NICK . Yes , that is my boy . DERRICK . Then the best I can wish him is that he wo n't take after his father , and become a vagabond and a penniless outcast . NICK . Those are hard words to hear in the presence of my child . HENDRICK . Then why do n't you knock him down , father ? GRETCHEN . I 'll tell you why  --  DERRICK . Gretchen ! GRETCHEN . Wiping her arms and coming to front of tub . It is because your father is in that man 's power . And what 's the use of getting a man down , if you do n't trample on him ? NICK . Oh , that is the way of the world . GRETCHEN . To Hendrick . Go in , boy . I want to speak to your father , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear . Yonder is my little girl ; go and play with her . Hendrick and Meenie exeunt into the cottage . GRETCHEN . Now , Derrick , Vedder is right : you wo n't turn him out of his house yonder . DERRICK . And why not ? Do n't he owe me a year 's rent ? GRETCHEN . And what do you owe him ? Shall I sum up your accounts for you ? Ten years ago , this was a quiet village , and belonged mostly to my husband , Rip Van Winkle , a foolish , idle fellow . That house yonder has since been his ruin . Yes ; bit by bit , he has parted with all he had , to fill the mouths of sots and boon companions , gathered around him in yonder house . And you , Derrick ,  --  you supplied him with the money to waste in riot and drink . Acre by acre , you 've sucked in his land to swell your store . Yonder miserable cabin is the only shelter we have left ; but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have sold it to you , Derrick , long ago , and wasted its price in riot . Vedder , who has been enjoying Derrick 's discomfiture during this speech , is unable to control himself , and at the end of speech bursts into a loud laugh . GRETCHEN . Aye , and you too , Nick Vedder ; you have ruined my husband between you . NICK . Oh , come , Mrs. Van Winkle , you 're too hard . I could n't refuse Rip 's money in the way of business ; I had my rent to pay . GRETCHEN . And shall I tell you why you ca n't pay it ? it is because you have given Rip credit , and he has ended by drinking you out of house and home . Your window-shutter is not wide enough to hold the score against him ; it is full of chalk . Deny it if you can . NICK . I do deny it . There now ! GRETCHEN . Then why do you keep that shutter closed ? I 'll show you why . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pointing at Rip 's score . That 's why . Nick Vedder , you 're a good man in the main , if there is such a thing . Derrick laughs . Aye , and I doubt it Turning on him . But you are the pest of this village ; and the hand of every woman in it ought to help to pull down that drunkard 's nest of yours , stone by stone . NICK . Come , Dame Van Winkle , you 're too hard entire ; now a man must have his odd time , and he 's none the worse for being a jolly dog . GRETCHEN . No , none the worse . He sings a good song ; he tells a good story ,  --  oh , he 's a glorious fellow ! Did you ever see the wife of a jolly dog ? Well , she lives in a kennel . Did you ever see the children of a jolly dog ? They are the street curs , and their home is the gutter . Goes up to wash-tub , and takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and approaching Gretchen timidly . I tell you what it is , Dame Van Winkle , I do n't know what your home may be , but judging from the rows I hear over there , and the damaged appearance of Rip 's face after having escaped your clutches  --  Gretchen looks up angrily ; Nick retreats a few paces hastily  --  I should say that a gutter was a luxurious abode compared with it , and a kennel a peaceful retreat . Exit hurriedly , laughing , into the inn . Gretchen looks up angrily , and throws the cloth she has been wringing after him , then resumes washing . Derrick laughs at Vedder 's exit , walks up to Gretchen , and puts one foot on bench . DERRICK . Is it true , Gretchen ? Are you truly miserable with Rip ? GRETCHEN . Ai n't you pleased to hear it ? Come then and warm your heart at my sorrow . Ten years ago I might have had you , Derrick . But I despised you for your miserly ways , and threw myself away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him between us . I took his estate , and you took his person . Now , I 've improved my half . What have you done with yours ? GRETCHEN . I ca n't say that I 've prospered with it . I 've tried every means to reclaim him , but he is as obstinate and perverse as a Dutch pig . But the worst in him  --  and what I ca n't stand  --  is his good-humour . It drives me frantic when , night after night , he comes home drunk and helplessly good-humoured ! Oh , I ca n't stand that ! DERRICK . Where is he now ? GRETCHEN . We had a tiff yesterday , and he started . He has been out all night . Only wait until he comes back ! The longer he stops out , the worse it will be for him . DERRICK . Gretchen , you 've made a great mistake , but there is time enough to repair it . You are comely still , thrifty , and that hard sort of grain that I most admire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why not start Rip for ever , and share my fortune ? GRETCHEN . Oh , no , Derrick ; you 've got my husband in your clutches , but you ca n't get them around me . If Rip would only mend his ways , he would see how much I love him ; but no woman could love you , Derrick ; for woman is not a domestic animal , glad to serve and fawn upon a man for the food and shelter she can get ; and that is all she would ever get from you , Derrick . Piling the clothes on the washboard , and shouldering it . DERRICK . The time may come when you 'll change your tune . GRETCHEN . Not while Rip lives , bad as he is . Exit into cottage . DERRICK . Then I 'll wait until you 've killed him . Her spirit is not broken yet . But patience , Derrick , patience ; in another month I 'll have my claws on all that remains of Rip 's property ,  --  yonder cottage and grounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Enter Cockles , with papers in his hand , running towards the inn . DERRICK . How now , you imp ? What brings you here so full of a hurry ? Some mischief 's in your head , or your heels would not be so busy . COCKLES . I 've brought a letter for you from my employer . There it is . DERRICK . Examining letter . Why , the seal is broken ! COCKLES . Yes ; I read it as I came along . DERRICK . Now I apprenticed this vagabond to my lawyer , and this is his gratitude . COCKLES . Do n't waste your breath , Nunky , for you 'll want it ; for when you read that , if it do n't take you short in the wind I 'll admire you . DERRICK . Reads . " You must obtain from Rip Van Winkle a proper conveyance of the lands he has sold to you . The papers he has signed are in fact nothing but mortgages on his estate . If you foreclose , you must sell the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it would sell for enough to pay off your loan , and all your improvements would enure to the benefit of Rip Van Winkle . " COCKLES . There , now , see what you 've been doing of !  --  wasting your money and my expectations on another chap 's property . Do you want to leave me a beggar ? DERRICK . Reads . " I enclose a deed for him to sign that will make him safe . " COCKLES . Of course he 'll sign it ; he wo n't wait to be asked  --  he 'll be in such a hurry . DERRICK . All my savings  --  all my money  --  sunk in improving this village ! COCKLES . Yes , instead of physicking Rip , as you thought , you 've been coddling him all the while . DERRICK . All these houses I 've built are on another man 's land . What shall I do ? COCKLES . Pull them down again ; pull them down . DERRICK . Ass !  --  dolt that I have been ! COCKLES . Calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The imp is right . Rip must be made to sign this paper . But how  --  how ? COCKLES . How ? How ? How 's a big word sometimes , ai n't it , Nunky ? DERRICK . Rip would not do it if he knew what he was about . But he ca n't read  --  nor write , for the matter of that . But he can make his cross , and I can cajole him . COCKLES . Look sharp , Nunky . The man that 's looking round for a fool , and picks up Rip Van Winkle , will let him drop again very quick . DERRICK . He is poor : I 'll show him a handful of money . He 's a drunkard : I 'll give him a stomachful of liquor . Go in , boy , and leave me to work this ; and let this be a lesson to you hereafter : beware of the fatal effects of poverty and drink . COCKLES . Yes ,  --  and parting with my money on bad security . Exit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounded by all the dogs and children in the district . They cling around him like flies around a lump of sugar . Rip enters , running and skipping , carrying one small child pickaback , and surrounded by a swarm of others hanging on the skirts of his coat . He is laughing like a child himself , and his merry blue eyes twinkle with delight . He is dressed in an old deerskin coat , a pair of breeches which had once been red , now tattered , patched , and frayed , leather gaiters and shoes equally dilapidated , a shapeless felt hat with a bit of the brim hanging loose ,  --  the whole stained and weatherworn to an almost uniform clay-colour , except for the bright blue of his jean shirt and the scarlet of his long wisp of a necktie . One of the boys carries his gun . RIP . Taking his gun from the boy . There , run along mit you ; run along . DERRICK . The children scamper off . The vagabond looks like the father of the village . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , suddenly calls after them . Hey ! You let my dog Schneider alone there ; you hear that Sock der Jacob der bist eine for donner spits poo  --  yah  --  DERRICK . Why , what 's the matter , Rip ? RIP . Coming down , and shaking hands with Derrick . Oh , how you was , Derrick ? how you was ? DERRICK . You seem in trouble . RIP . Oh , yah ; you know them fellers . Vell , I tole you such a funny thing . Laughing . Just now , as me and Schneider was comin ' along through the village ,  --  Schneider 's my dawg ; I do n't know whether you know him ? Rip always speaks of Schneider at if he were a person , and one in whom his hearer took as profound an interest as he does himself . Well , them fellers went an ' tied a tin kettle mit Schneider 's tail , and how he did run then , mit the kettle hanging about . Well , I did n't hi him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs , an ' spilt me an ' all them children in the mud ;  --  yah , that 's a fact . Rip leans his gun against the cottage DERRICK . Aside . Now 's my time . Aloud . Vedder ! Vedder ! Vedder appears at the door of the inn . Bring us a bottle of liquor . Bring us your best , and be quick . NICK . What 's in the wind now ? The devil 's to pay when Derrick stands treat ! Exit . Re-enters , with bottle and cups in left hand . Hands bottle to Derrick . Rip lounges forward , and perches on the corner of the table . DERRICK . Rising and approaching Rip . Come , Rip , what do you say to a glass ? RIP . Takes a cup , and holds it to be filled . Oh , yah ; now what do I generally say to a glass ? I say it 's a fine thing  --  when there 's plenty in it . ( Ve gates ! Ve gates ! ) Shakes hands with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's in it than I do to the glass . Now you would n't believe it ,  --  that 's the first one I 've had to-day . DERRICK . How so ? RIP . Dryly . Because I could n't get it before , I suppose . DERRICK . Then let me fill him up for you . RIP . No , that is enough for the first one . NICK . Come , Rip , a bumper for the first one . RIP . That is enough for the first one . DERRICK . Come , Rip , let me fill him up for you . RIP . With ludicrous decision and dignity . I believe I know how much to drink . When I says a thing , I mean it . DERRICK . Oh , well  --  Turns aside , and starts to fill his own cup . RIP . All right ; come along . Holding out his glass , and laughing at his own inconsistency . Here 's your good health and your families ' , and may they live long and prosper ! They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips and exclaims " Ah ! " Derrick repeats same , and Rip repeats after Derrick . RIP . To Nick , sadly . Ah , you may well go " Ah ! " and smack your chops over that . You do n't give me such schnapps when I come . Derrick , my score is too big now . Jerking his head towards the shutter , he notices for the first time that it is open . What you go and open that window for ?  --  That 's fine schnapps , Nick . Where you got that ? NICK . That 's high Dutch , Rip ,  --  high Dutch , and ten years in bottle . Why , I had that in the very day of your wedding . We broached the keg under yonder shed . Do n't you recollect ? RIP . Is that the same ? NICK . Yes . RIP . I thought I knowed that licker . You had it ten years ago ? Laughing suddenly I would not have kept it so long . But stop , mein freund ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it ai n't . RIP . It 's the same day I got married ? NICK . Yes . RIP . Well , I know by that . You think I forgot the day I got married ? Oh , no , my friend ; I remember that day long as I live . Serious for a moment . Takes off his hat , and puts it on the table . DERRICK . Ah ! Rip , I remember Gretchen then , ten years ago .  --  Zounds , how I envied you ! RIP . Looking up , surprised . Did you ? Winks at Nick . Then , suddenly remembering . So did I. You did n't know what was comin ' , Derrick . DERRICK . She was a beauty . RIP . What , Gretchen ?  --  Yes , she was . She was a pretty girl . My ! My ! Yah , we was a fine couple altogether . Well , come along . Holding out his cup to Derrick , who fills it from the bottle . NICK . Yes , come along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fill up Rip 's cup . Rip stops him . RIP . Who has been lounging against the table , sits on it , and puts his feet on the chair . Stop ! I come along mitout that , Nick Vedder . Sententiously . Good licker and water is like man and wife . DERRICK AND NICK . How 's that , Rip ? RIP . Laughing . They do n't agree together . I always like my licker single . Well , here 's your good health , and your families ' , and may they live long and prosper ! They all drink . NICK . That 's right , Rip ; drink away , and drown your sorrow . RIP . Drolly . Yes ; but she wo n't drown . My wife is my sorrow , and you cannick drown her . She tried it once , but could n't do it . DERRICK AND NICK . Why , how so ? RIP . Puts down his cup and clasps his knee , still perched on the corner of the table . Did n't you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No . RIP . Puts hat on . That 's the funniest thing of the whole of it . It 's the same day I got married ; she was comin ' across the river there in the ferry-boat to get married mit me  --  DERRICK AND NICK . Yes . RIP . Well , the boat she was comin ' in got upsetted . DERRICK AND NICK . Ah ! RIP . Well , but she was n't in it . DERRICK AND NICK . Oh ! RIP . Explaining quite seriously . No , that 's what I say : if she had been in the boat what got upsetted , maybe she might have got drowned . More and more reflective . I do n't know how it was she got left somehow or other . Women is always behind that way  --  always . DERRICK . But surely , Rip , you would have risked your life to save such a glorious creature as she was . RIP . Incredulously . You mean I would yump in and pull Gretchen out ? DERRICK . Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , you mean then  --  yes , I believe I would then . With simple conviction . But it would be more my duty now than it was then . DERRICK . How so ? RIP . Quite seriously . Why , you see when a feller gets married a good many years mit his wife , he gets very much attached to her NICK . Pompously . Ah , he does indeed . RIP . Winks at Derrick , and points at Nick with his thumb . But if Mrs. Van Winkle was a-drowning in the water now , an ' she says to me , " Rip , come an ' save your wife ! " I would say , " Mrs. Van Winkle , I will yust go home and think about it . " Oh , no , Derrick , if ever Gretchen tumbles in the water , she 's got to swim now , you mind that . DERRICK . She was here just now , anxiously expecting you home . RIP . I know she 's keeping it hot for me . NICK . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the broomstick . Exit Nick into house , laughing . RIP . Confidentially . Derrick , whenever I come back from the mountains , I always stick the game-bag in the window and creep in behind . DERRICK . Seating himself on the table by the side of Rip . Have you anything now ? RIP . Dropping into the chair Derrick has just left . Leaning back , and putting hands behind his head . What for game ? No , not a tail , I believe , not a feather . With humorous indifference . DERRICK . Touching Rip on the shoulder and shaking a bag of money . Rip , suppose you were to hang this bagful of money inside , do n't you think it would soothe her down , eh ? RIP . Sitting up . For me , is that ? DERRICK . Yes . RIP . With a shrewd glance . Ai n't you yokin ' mit me ? DERRICK . No , Rip , I 've prospered with the lands you 've sold me , and I 'll let you have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . RIP . Getting up and walking forward , with decision . No , I 'm afraid I might pay you again some day , Derrick . DERRICK . And so you shall , Rip , pay me when you please . Puts the bag in Rip 's hands , and forces his fingers over it , turns , and goes to table , speaking as he goes . Say , in twenty years ,  --  twenty years from this day . Ah , where shall we be then ? RIP . Quizzically , and half to himself . I do n't know about myself ; but I think I can guess where you 'll be about that time . Takes chair and sits down . DERRICK . Well , Rip , I 'll just step into the inn and draw out a little acknowledgment . RIP . Who has been sitting , leaning forward with his elbows on his knees , softly chinking the bag of money in his hand , looks up suddenly . Knowledgment  --  for what is that ? DERRICK . Yes , for you to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; bring it along . DERRICK . No fear of Gretchen now , eh , Rip ? RIP . Plunged in thought . Oh , no . DERRICK . You feel quite comfortable now , do n't you , Rip ? Exit into inn . RIP . Oh , yah ! Suddenly becoming serious and much mystified at Derrick 's conduct . Well , I do n't know about that , Derrick ! Derrick ! Holding up the bag and chinking it . It do n't chink like good money neither . It rattles like a snake in a hole . Grimly . GRETCHEN . Inside the cottage . Out with that lazy , idle cur ! I wo n't have him here . Out , I say ! RIP . I 'm glad I 'm not in there now . I believe that 's Schneider what she 's lickin ' ; he wo n't have any backbone left in him . Sadly . I would rather she would lick me than the dog ; I 'm more used to it than he is . Gets up , and looks in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Admiring her energy , almost envying it . What a hard-workin ' woman that is ! Well , somebody must do it , I suppose . With the air of a profound moral reflection . She 's comin ' here now ; she 's got some broomstick mit her , too . Rip snatches up his gun and slinks off around the corner of the house . Enter Gretchen with broomstick , followed by Hendrick and Meenie , carrying clothes-basket . GRETCHEN . Come along , children Now , you take the washing down to Dame Van Sloe 's , then call at the butcher 's and tell him that my husband has not got back yet , so I will have to go down myself to the marsh , and drive up the bull we have sold to him . Tell him the beast shall be in his stable in half an hour ; so let him have the money ready to pay me for it . During this Rip has crept in and sat on the bench by the side of the tub behind Gretchen . Ah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Houses , lands , beasts , everything gone ,  --  everything except a drunken beast who nobody would buy or accept as a gift . Rip ! Rip ! wait until I get you home ! Threatening an imaginary Rip with broomstick . With a comical grimace , Rip tiptoes back behind the house . Come , children , to work , to work ! Exit . Re-enter Rip cautiously . RIP . Laughing to himself . She gone to look after the bull . She better not try the broomstick on him ; he wo n't stand it . Drops into the chair with his back to the audience . HENDRICK . Oh , Meenie , there 's your father . RIP . Holds out his arms , and Meenie runs into them . Taking her in his arms , and embracing her with great tenderness . Ah , little gorl , was you glad to see your father come home ? MEENIE . Oh , yes ! RIP . Holding her close . I do n't believe it , was you ? Come here . Getting up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table . Let me look at you ; I do n't see you for such a long time ; come here . I do n't deserve to have a thing like that belong to me . Takes his hat off as if in reverence . You 're too good for a drunken , lazy feller like me , that 's a fact . Bites his underlip , looks up , and brushes away a tear . MEENIE . Kneeling by him . Oh , no , you are a good papa ! RIP . No , I was n't : no good father would go and rob his child ; that 's what I 've done . Why , do n't you know , Meenie , all the houses and lands in the village was mine  --  they would all have been yours when you grew up ? Where they gone now ? I gone drunk ' em up , that 's where they gone . Hendrick , you just take warnin ' by that ; that 's what licker do ; see that ? Holds up the skirt of coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there any more in that cup over there ? Give it to me . Drinks . Rip makes this confession with a childlike simplicity . The tears come , and he brushes them away once or twice . When he asks for the cup , at the end , it seems but the natural conclusion of his speech . HENDRICK . Hands him cup . Do n't cry , Rip ; Meenie does not want your money , for when I 'm a big man I shall work for her , and she shall have all I get . MEENIE . Yes , and I 'll have Hendrick , too . RIP . Greatly amused . You 'll have Hendrick , too . With mock gravity . Well , is this all settled ? HENDRICK . Yes , Meenie and me have made it all up . RIP . I did n't know , I only thought you might speak to me about it ; but if it 's all settled , Meenie , then git married mit him . Laughing silently , and suddenly . You goin ' to marry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you . Marry one another ? The children nod . Rip , with immense seriousness . Well , here 's your good health , and your family , may they live long and prosper . To Hendrick . What you goin ' to do when you get married , and grow up and so ? Leans forward . HENDRICK . I 'm not going to stop here with father ; oh , no , that wo n't do . I 'm going with Uncle Hans in his big ship to the North Pole , to catch whales . RIP . Goin ' to cotch wahales mit the North Pole ? That 's a long while away from here . HENDRICK . Yes , but uncle will give me ten shillings a month , and I will tell him to pay it all to Meenie . RIP . There ! He 's goin ' to pay it all to you ; that 's a good boy , that 's a good boy . MEENIE . Yes , and I 'll give it all to you to keep for us . RIP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would n't do that , my darlin ' ; maybe if you give it to me , you do n't get it back again . Hendrick ! Suddenly earnest . You shall marry Meenie when you grow up , but you must n't drink . HENDRICK . Slapping Rip on the knee . I 'll never touch a drop . RIP . Quite seriously . You wo n't , nor me neither ; shake hands upon it . Now we swore off together . With a change of tone . I said so so many times , and never kept my word once , never . Drinks . HENDRICK . I 've said so once , and I 'll keep mine . DERRICK . Outside . Well , bring it along with you . RIP . Here comes Derrick : he do n't like some children ; run along mit you . Exit children with basket . Enter Derrick from inn with document . DERRICK . There , Rip , is the little acknowledgment . Handing it to him . RIP . Knowledgment . Putting on hat . For what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loaned you the money . RIP . Lounging back in his chair . I do n't want that ; I would lose it if I had it . Fills his cup from the bottle . I do n't want it . Blandly . DERRICK . Do n't you ? But I do . RIP . With simple surprise . For what ? DERRICK . Why , for you to put your cross to . Why , bless me , I 've forgotten my pen and ink . Enter Cockles . But luckily here comes my nephew with it . Aside . And in time to witness the signature . RIP . Say , Derrick , have you been writing all that paper full in the little time you been in the house there ? Turns the paper about curiously . Pours out more schnapps . DERRICK . Yes , every word of it . RIP . Have you ? Well , just read it out loud to me . With an air of great simplicity . DERRICK . Aside . Does he suspect ? Aloud . Why , Rip , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money . RIP . Clasping his hands behind his head with an air of lordly indifference . Yes , I know ; but I got nothing to do now . I 'm a little curious about that , somehow . COCKLES . Aside to Derrick . The fish has taken the ground bait , but he 's curious about the hook . DERRICK . Aside . I dare not read a word of it . COCKLES . Aside . Nunkey 's stuck . DERRICK . Well , Rip , I suppose you do n't want to hear the formalities . RIP . The what ? DERRICK . The preliminaries . RIP . Indolently . I 'll take it all ,  --  Bill , Claws , and Feathers . Leans forward and rests his head on his hand , and looks at the ground . DERRICK . " Know all men by these presents that I , Rip Van Winkle , in consideration of the sum of sixteen pounds received by me from Derrick Von Beekman "  --  Looks around at Cockles ; they wink knowingly at each other . Continues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undertake to pay the same in twenty years from date . Rip looks up ; as he does so , Derrick drops his eyes on document , then looks as if he had just finished reading . There , now are you satisfied ? RIP . Takes the document . In childlike surprise . Well , well , and does it take all that pen and ink to say such a little thing like that ? DERRICK . Why , of course it does . COCKLES . Aside to Derrick . Oh , the fool ! he swallows it whole , hook and all . RIP . Spreading the paper on the table . Where goes my cross , Derrick ? DERRICK . Pointing . There , you see I 've left a nice little white corner for you . RIP . Folds up paper in a leisurely manner , and puts it in game-bag . W-e-l-l , I 'll yust think about it . Looks up at Derrick , innocently . DERRICK . Think about it ? Why , what 's the matter , Rip , is n't the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money all right . Chuckling . Oh ! you mean about signing it . Rising . At a loss , for a moment . Stop , yesterday was Friday , was n't it ? DERRICK . So it was . RIP . With an air of conviction . Well , I never do nothing like that the day after Friday , Derrick . Rip walks away towards his cottage . DERRICK . Aside . The idiot ! what can that signify ? But I must not arouse his suspicions by pressing him . Aloud . You are right , Rip : sign it when you please ; but I say , Rip , now that you 're in funds , wo n't you help your old friend Nick Vedder , who owes me a year 's rent ? RIP . Coming back to the table . Oh , yah , I will wipe off my schore , and stand treat to the whole village . DERRICK . Run , boy , and tell all the neighbours that Rip stands treat . RIP . Leans on back of chair . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dance . COCKLES . A dance ! Runs off . DERRICK . And I 'll order the good cheer for you . Exit . RIP . So do ! so do ! Cogitating dubiously . I do n't understand it . Re-enter Hendrick with the basket over his head , followed by Meenie . Oh , you 've come back ? HENDRICK . Yes , we 've left the clothes . RIP . Meenie , you take in the basket . Exit Meenie with basket into cottage . Hendrick is following . Hendrick , come here . Hendrick kneels between Rip 's knees . So you are going to marry my daughter ? Hendrick nods . So , so . That 's very kind of yer . Abruptly . Why you do n't been to school to-day , you go to school sometimes , do n't you ? HENDRICK . Yes , when father can spare me . RIP . What do you learn mit that school ,  --  pretty much something ? Laughing at his mistake . I mean , everything ? HENDRICK . Yes ; reading , writing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HENDRICK . And writing , and arithmetic . RIP . Puzzled . Writing , and what ? HENDRICK . Arithmetic . RIP . More puzzled . Whatmeticks is that ? HENDRICK . Arithmetic . RIP . With profound astonishment and patting Hendrick 's head . I do n't see how the little mind can stand it all . Can you read ? HENDRICK . Oh , yes ! RIP . With a serious affectation of incredulity . I do n't believe it ; now , I 'm just goin ' to see if you can read . If you ca n't read , I wo n't let you marry my daughter . No , sir . Very drolly . I wo n't have nobody in my family what ca n't read . Taking out the paper that Derrick has given him . Can you read ritmatics like that ? HENDRICK . Yes , that 's writing . RIP . Nonplussed . Oh ! I thought it was reading . HENDRICK . It 's reading and writing , too . RIP . What , both together . Suspiciously looking at the paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before ; go long with it . HENDRICK . Reads . " Know all men by these presents "  --  RIP . Pleased , leaning back in his chair . Yah ! That 's right , what a wonderful thing der readin ' is ; why , you read it pretty nigh as good as Derrick , yes , you do ; go long . HENDRICK . " That I , Rip Van Winkle "  --  RIP . Taking off his hat , and holding it with his hands behind his head . Yah , that 's right ; you read it yust as well as Derrick ; go long . HENDRICK . " In consideration of the sum of sixteen pounds received do hereby sell and convey to Derrick Von Beekman all my estate , houses , lands whatsoever "  --  Hat drops . RIP . Almost fiercely . What are you readin ' , some ritmatics what ai n't down there : Where you got that ? Looking sharply at Hendrick . HENDRICK . Pointing . There . Houses ! Lands , whatsoever . RIP . Looking not at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning over in his mind whether the boy has read it correctly . Then satisfied of the deception Derrick has practised upon him , and struck by the humour of the way in which he has discovered it , he laughs exultantly and looks towards the inn-door through which Derrick disappeared a short time before . Yes , so it is ; go long mit the rest . He leans forward , and puts his ear close to Hendrick , so as not to miss a word . HENDRICK . " Whereof he now holds possession by mortgaged deeds , from time to time executed by me . " RIP . Takes paper , and looks towards the inn fiercely exultant . You read it better than Derrick , my boy , much better . After a moment 's pause recollects himself . Kindly , to Hendrick . That will do ; run along mit you . Exit Hendrick . RIP . Triumphantly . Aha , my friend , Derrick ! I guess you got some snakes in the grass . Now keep sober , Rip ; I do n't touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off now , that 's a fixed fact . Enter Derrick , Vedder , Stein , and villagers . DERRICK . Come , Rip , we 'll have a rouse . RIP . Seriously ; half fiercely still . Here , Nick Vedder , here is the gelt ; wipe off my score , and drink away . I do n't join you ; I swore off . NICK . Why , Rip , you 're king of the feast . RIP . Absently . Still intent on Derrick . Am I dat ? OMNES . Swore off ? What for ? RIP . I do n't touch another drop . JACOB STEIN . Coming down towards Rip with cup . Come , Rip , take a glass . RIP . Turning on him , almost angry . Jacob Stein , you hear what I said ? STEIN . Yes . RIP . Firmly . Well , when I said a thing , I mean it . Leans back in chair with his hands behind his head . STEIN . Oh , very well . Turns away ; Nick comes down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see if they are watching him . He can resist no longer , and takes the cup . RIP . Laughing . Well , I wo n't count this one . Here 's your good health and your families ' , may they all live long and prosper . DERRICK . Here come the fiddlers and the girls . Enter girls . Rip walks over and closes the shutter which has held his score , then returns and seats himself on a low stool , and keeps time to the music as the villagers dance . Finally , the rhythm fires his blood . He jumps to his feet , snatches one of the girls away from her partner , and whirls into the dance . After a round or two , he lets go of her , and pirouettes two or three times by himself . Once more he catches her in his arms , and is in the act of embracing her , when he perceives Gretchen over her shoulder . He drops the girl , who falls on her knees at Gretchen 's feet . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joins half-heartedly . As the curtain descends , Rip is seen pointing at the girl as if seeking , like a modern Adam , to put the blame on her . ACT II . SCENE I. The dimly lighted kitchen of Rip 's cottage . The door and window are at the back . It is night , and through the window a furious storm can be seen raging , with thunder , lightning , and rain . A fire smoulders on the hearth , to the right , and a candle gutters on the table in the centre ; a couple of chairs , a low stool , and a little cupboard , meagrely provided with cups and platters , complete the furniture of the room . Between the door and the window a clothes-horse , with a few garments hanging on it , forms a screen . To the left is a small door leading to the other rooms of the cottage . As the curtain rises , Meenie is seen sitting by the window , and Gretchen enters , takes off cloak , and throws a broomstick on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come yet ? MEENIE . No , mother . GRETCHEN . So much the better for him . Never let him show his face in these doors again  --  never ! MEENIE . Oh , mother , do n't be so hard on him . GRETCHEN . I 'm not hard ; how dare you say so . Meenie approaches her . There , child , that father of yours is enough to spoil the temper of an angel . I went down to the marsh to drive up the bull . I do n't know what Rip has been doing to the beast ; he was howling and tearing about . I barely escaped with my life . A crash outside . What noise is that ? MEENIE . That 's only Schneider , father 's dog . GRETCHEN . Picking up broomstick . Then , I 'll Schneider him . I wo n't have him here . Exit through the door leading to the rest of the cottage . Out , you idle , vagabond cur ; out , I say ! MEENIE . Following her to the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't hurt the poor thing ! Re-enter Gretchen . GRETCHEN . He jumped out of the window before I could catch him . He 's just like his master . Now , what are you crying for ? MEENIE . Because my poor father is out in all this rain . A peal of thunder is heard . Hark , how it thunders ! GRETCHEN . Serve him right  --  do him good . Is the supper ready ? MEENIE . Yes , mother ; it is there by the fireside . Pointing to a soup-bowl by the fire . Shall I lay the table ? GRETCHEN . Yes . Again it thunders . It 's a dreadful night ; I wonder where Rip is ? MEENIE . Bringing the cups and platters from the sideboard , together with a loaf of bread . Shall I lay the table for two , mother , or for three ? GRETCHEN . For two , girl ; he gets no supper here to-night Another peal of thunder . Mercy , how the storm rages ! The fool , to stop out in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must look out the old suit I washed and mended for him last week , and put them by the fire to air . The idiot , to stop out in such a down-pour ! I 'll have him sick on my hands next ; that 's all I want to complete my misery . She fetches clothes from the horse , and hangs them on the back of the chair in front of the fire . He knows what I am suffering now , and that 's what keeps him out . Lightning . Mercy , what a flash that was ! The wretch will be starved with the cold ! Meenie ! MEENIE . Yes , mother . GRETCHEN . You may lay the table for three . There is a knock at the outer door . There he is now ! Enter Hendrick , who shakes the rain from his hat . Where 's Rip ? Is he not at your father 's ? HENDRICK . No ; I thought he was here . GRETCHEN . He 's gone back to the mountain . He 's done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the fire . Shall I run after him , and bring him home ? I know the road ; we 've often climbed it together . GRETCHEN . No ; I drove Rip from his house , and it 's for me to bring him back again . MEENIE . Still arranging the supper-table . But , mother  --  She pauses , with embarrassment . If he hears your voice behind him , he will only run away the faster . GRETCHEN . Well , I ca n't help it ; I ca n't rest under cover , while he is out in the storm . I shall feel better when I 'm outside sharing the storm with him . Sit down , and take your suppers . I 'll take my cloak along with me . Exit . Meenie has seated herself by the window . Hendrick carries stool to the centre of the stage , in front of the table . HENDRICK . Meenie ! Meenie ! MEENIE . Eh ? Hendrick beckons to her . She runs to him . He stops her suddenly , then puts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , while Meenie kneels beside him . HENDRICK . In a very solemn tone . I hope your father ai n't gone to the mountains to-night , Meenie ? MEENIE . In distress . Oh , dear ! he will die of the cold there . HENDRICK . Suddenly . Sh ! Meenie starts . It ai n't for that . Mysteriously . I 've just heard old Clausen , over at father 's , saying , that on this very night , every twenty years , the ghosts  --  MEENIE . Catching his wrist . The what ? HENDRICK . In an awed tone . The ghosts of Hendrick Hudson , and his pirate crew , visit the Kaatskills above here . The two children look around , frightened . MEENIE . Oh , dear ! did he say so ? HENDRICK . Sh ! Again they look around , frightened . Yes ; and the spirits have been seen there smoking , drinking , and playing at tenpins . MEENIE . Oh , how dreadful ! HENDRICK . Sh ! He goes cautiously to the chimney , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , he returns to the stool , speaking as he comes . Yes ; and every time that Hendrick Hudson lights his pipe there 's a flash of lightning . Lightning , and Meenie gives a gasp of fear . And when he rolls the balls along , there is a peal of thunder . Loud rumble of thunder . Meenie screams , and throws herself into Hendrick 's arms . Do n't be frightened , Meenie ; I 'm here . In a frightened tone , but with a manly effort to be courageous . Re-enter Gretchen with her cloak . GRETCHEN . Here , stop that ! The children separate quickly . Hendrick looks up at the ceiling and whistles , with an attempt at unconsciousness , and Meenie assumes an innocent and unconcerned expression . Now , do n't you be filling that child 's head with nonsense , but remain quietly here until I return . Hush , what noise is that ? There is some one outside the window . She steps behind the clothes-horse . Rip appears at the window , which he opens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! MEENIE AND HENDRICK . Trying to make him perceive Gretchen , by a gesture in her direction . Sh ! Rip turns , and looks around outside to see what they mean , then , discovering nothing , drops his hat in at the window , and calls again , cautiously . RIP . Meenie ! MEENIE AND HENDRICK . With the same warning gesture . Sh ! Gretchen shakes her fist at the children , who assume an air of innocence . RIP . What 's the matter ? Meenie , has the wildcat come home ? Rip reaches in after his hat . Gretchen catches him by his hair , and holds his head down . Och , my darlin ' , do n't do that , eh ! HENDRICK AND MEENIE . Who run towards Gretchen . Do n't , mother ! Do n't , mother ! Do n't ! RIP . Imitating their tone . Do n't , mother , do n't ! Do n't you hear the children ? Let go my head , wo n't you ? Getting angry . GRETCHEN . Still holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RIP . Bantering . Hold on to it then , what do I care ? HENDRICK AND MEENIE . Catching Gretchen 's dress . Do n't , mother ! Do n't , mother ! Do n't ! Gretchen lets go of Rip , and turns upon them . They escape , and disappear through the door to the left . RIP . Getting in through the window , and coming forward , apparently drunk , but jolly ; and his resentment for the treatment he has just received is half humourous . For what you do dat , hey ? You must want a bald-headed husband , I reckon ! Gretchen picks up chair , and bangs it down ; Rip imitates her with the stool . She sits down , angrily , and slaps the table . Rip throws down his felt hat with a great show of violence , and it makes no noise , then seats himself on the stool . GRETCHEN . Now , then ! RIP . Now , den ; I do n't like it den , neider . When Rip is drunk , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call a wildcat ? RIP . With a sudden little tipsy laugh , and confused . A wildcat  --  dat 's when I come in at the window ? GRETCHEN . Yes ; that 's when you came in the window . RIP . Rising , and with a tone of finality . Yes ; that 's the time I said it . GRETCHEN . Yes ; and that 's the time I heard it . RIP . With drunken assurance . That 's all right ; I was afraid you would n't hear it . GRETCHEN . Now , who did you mean by that wildcat ? RIP . Confused . Who did I mean ? Now , let me see . GRETCHEN . Yes ; who did you mean ? RIP . How do I know who-oo I mean ? With a sudden inspiration . Maybe , it 's the dog Schneider , I call that . GRETCHEN . Incredulously . The dog Schneider ; that 's not likely . RIP . Argumentatively . Of course it is likely ; he 's my dog . I 'll call him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sits down in the chair on which his clothes are warming , in front of the fire . GRETCHEN . And then , there 's your disgraceful conduct this morning . What have you got to say to that ? RIP . How do I know what I got to say to that , when I do n't know what I do-a , do-a ? Hiccoughs . GRETCHEN . Do n't know what you do-a-oo ! Hugging and kissing the girls , before my face ; you thought I would n't see you . RIP . Boldly . I knowed you would  --  I knowed you would ; because , because  --  Losing the thread of his discourse . Oh-h , don ' you bodder me . He turns , and leans his head against the back of the chair . GRETCHEN . You knew I was there ? RIP . Laughing . I thought I saw you . GRETCHEN . I saw you myself , dancing with the girl . RIP . You saw the girl dancin ' mit me . Gretchen remembers Rip 's clothes , and goes over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards the centre of the stage . Rip mistakes her intention . You want to pull some more hair out of my head ? GRETCHEN . Why , the monster ! He is n't wet a bit ! He 's as dry as if he 'd been aired ! RIP . Of course I 'm dry . Laughing . I 'm always dry  --  always dry . GRETCHEN . Examines game-bag , and pulls out a flask , which she holds under Rip 's nose . Why , what 's here ? Why , it 's a bottle  --  a bottle ! RIP . Leaning against the table . Yes ; it 's a bottle . Laughs . You think I do n't know a bottle when I see it ? GRETCHEN . That 's pretty game for your game-bag , ai n't it ? RIP . Assuming an innocent air . Somebody must have put it there . GRETCHEN . Putting the flask in her pocket . Then , you do n't get it again . RIP . With a show of anger . Now mind if I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it  --  Breaking down . I do n't want it . I have had enough . With a droll air of conviction . GRETCHEN . I 'm glad you know when you 've had enough . RIP . Still leaning against the table . That 's the way mit me . I 'm glad I know when I got enough  --  Laughs . An ' I 'm glad when I 've got enough , too . Give me the bottle ; I want to put it in the game-bag . GRETCHEN . For what ? RIP . Lounging off the table , and coming forward and leaning his arms on Gretchen 's shoulders . So that I ca n't drink it . Here 's the whole business  --  He slides his hand down to Gretchen 's pocket , and tries to find the bottle while he talks to her . Here 's the whole business about it . What is the use of anybody  --  well  --  wash the use of anybody , anyhow  --  well  --  oh  --  Missing the pocket . What you talkin ' ' bout  --  Suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pull the bottle out , with great satisfaction . Now , now I can tell you all ' bout it . GRETCHEN . Discovering his tactics , and pushing him away . Pshaw ! RIP . If you do n't give me the bottle , I just break up everything in the house . GRETCHEN . If you dare ! RIP . If I dare ! Have n't I done it two or three times before ? I just throw everything right out of the window . Rip throws the plates and cups on the floor , and overturns a chair , and seats himself on the table . Gretchen picks them up again . GRETCHEN . Do n't , Rip ; do n't do that ! Now stop , Rip , stop ! Gretchen bangs down a chair by the table , and seats herself . Now , then , perhaps you will be kind enough to tell where you 've been for the last two days . Where have you been ? Do you hear ? RIP . Where I 've been ? Well , it 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another feller . You want to know where I been ? GRETCHEN . Yes ; and I will know . RIP . Good-humouredly . Let me see . Last night I stopped out all night . GRETCHEN . But why ? RIP . Why ? You mean the reason of it ? GRETCHEN . Yes , the reason . RIP . Inconsequently . The reason is why ? Do n't bother me . GRETCHEN . Emphasising each word with a bang on the table . Why  --  did  --  you  --  stop  --  out  --  all  --  night ? RIP . Imitating her tone . Because  --  I  --  want  --  to  --  get  --  up  --  early  --  in  --  the  --  mornin g . Hiccough . Come , do n't get so mad mit a feller . Why , I 've been fillin ' my game-bag mit game . Rip gets down off the table , and Gretchen comes towards him and feels his game-bag . GRETCHEN . Your game-bag is full of game , is n't it ? RIP . Taking her hand and holding it away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold it . Finding his way into Gretchen 's pocket . Now I can tell you all about it . You know last night I stopped out all night  --  GRETCHEN . Yes ; and let me catch you again . He is pulling the bottle out , when Gretchen catches him , and slaps his hand . You paltry thief ! RIP . Oh , you ai n't got no confidence in me . Now what do you think was the first thing I saw in the morning ? Dragging a chair to the front of the stage . GRETCHEN . I do n't know . What ? RIP . Seating himself . A rabbit . GRETCHEN . Pleased . I like a rabbit . I like it in a stew . RIP . Looking at her , amused . I guess you like everything in a stew  --  everything what 's a rabbit I mean . Well , there was a rabbit a-feedin ' mit the grass ,  --  you know they always come out early in der mornin ' and feed mit the grass ? GRETCHEN . Never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get so patient ; you wait till you get the rabbit . Humourously . Well , I crawl up  --  GRETCHEN . Yes , yes ! RIP . Becoming interested in his own powers of invention . An ' his little tail was a-stickin ' up so  --  With a gesture of his forefinger . GRETCHEN . Impatiently . Never mind his tail . Go on . RIP . Remonstrating at her interruption . The more fatter the rabbit , the more whiter is his tail  --  GRETCHEN . Well , well , go on . RIP . Taking aim . Well , I haul up  --  GRETCHEN . Yes , yes ! RIP . And his ears was a-stickin ' up so  --  Making the two ears with his two forefingers . GRETCHEN . Never mind his ears . Go on . RIP . I pull the trigger . GRETCHEN . Eagerly . Bang went the gun , and  --  RIP . Seriously . And the rabbit run away . GRETCHEN . Angrily . And so you shot nothing ? RIP . How will I shot him when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do n't get so mad mit a feller . Now I 'm going to tell you what I did shot ; that 's what I did n't shot . You know that old forty-acre field of ours ? GRETCHEN . Scornfully . Ours ! Ours , did you say ? RIP . Shamefacedly . You know the one I mean well enough . It used to be ours . GRETCHEN . Regretfully . Yes ; it used , indeed ! RIP . It ai n't ours now , is it ? GRETCHEN . Sighing . No , indeed , it is not . RIP . No ? Den I would n't bodder about it . Better let somebody bodder about that field what belongs to it . Well , in that field dere 's a pond ; and what do you think I see in that pond ? GRETCHEN . I do n't know . Ducks ? RIP . Ducks ! More an ' a thousand . GRETCHEN . Walking to where broomstick is . More than a thousand ducks ? RIP . I haul up again  --  GRETCHEN . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And if you miss fire this time  --  She holds it threateningly over Rip 's shoulder . RIP . Looking at it askance out of the corner of his eye , then putting up his hand and pushing it aside . You will scare the ducks mit that . Well , I take better aim this time as I did before . I pull the trigger , and  --  bang ! GRETCHEN . How many down ? RIP . Indifferently . One . GRETCHEN . Indignantly . What ! only one duck out of a thousand ? RIP . Who said one duck ? GRETCHEN . You did . RIP . Getting up , and leaning on the back of the chair . I did n't say anything of the kind . GRETCHEN . You said " one . " RIP . Ah ! One . But I shot more as one duck . GRETCHEN . Did you ? RIP . Crosses over , and sits on the low stool , and laughs silently . I shot our old bull . Gretchen flings down the broomstick , and throws herself into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dumb rage . I did n't kill him . I just sting him , you know . Well , then the bull come right after me ; and I come right away from him . O Gretchen , how you would laugh if you could see that  --  With a vain appeal to her sense of humour . the bull was a-comin ' , and I was a-goin . Well , he chased me across the field . I tried to climb over the fence so fast what I could ,  --  Doubles up with his silent laugh . an ' the bull come up an ' save me the trouble of that . Well , then , I rolled over on the other side . GRETCHEN . With disgust . And then you went fast asleep for the rest of the day . RIP . That 's a fact . That 's a fact . GRETCHEN . Bursting into tears , and burying her head in her arms on the table . O Rip , you 'll break my heart ! You will . RIP . Now she gone crying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't cry . My d-a  --  r-l-i-n ' , do n't cry . GRETCHEN . Angrily . I will cry ! RIP . Cry ' way as much you like . What do I care ? All the better soon as a woman gets cryin ' ; den all the danger 's over . Rip goes to Gretchen , leans over , and puts his arm around her . Gretchen , do n't cry ; my angel , do n't . He succeeds in getting his hand into her pocket , and steals the bottle . Do n't cry , my daarlin ' . Humourously . Gretchen , wo n't you give me a little drop out of that bottle what you took away from me ? He sits on the table , just behind her , and takes a drink from the bottle . GRETCHEN . Here 's a man drunk , and asking for more . RIP . I was n't . I swore off . Coaxingly . You give me a little drop , an ' I wo n't count it . GRETCHEN . Sharply . No ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's your good health , an ' your family , and may they live long and prosper ! Puts bottle in his bag . GRETCHEN . You unfeeling brute . Your wife 's starving . And , Rip , your child 's in rags . RIP . Holding up his coat , and heaving a sigh of resignation . Well , I 'm the same way ; you know dat . GRETCHEN . Sitting up , and looking appealingly at Rip . Oh , Rip , if you would only treat me kindly ! RIP . Putting his arms around her . Well , den , I will . I 'm going to treat you kind . I 'll treat you kind . GRETCHEN . Why , it would add ten years to my life . RIP . Over her shoulder , and after a pause . That 's a great inducement ; it is , my darlin ' . I know I treat you too bad , an ' you deserve to be a widow . GRETCHEN . Getting up , and putting her arms on Rip 's shoulders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RIP . Well , den , I will . I wo n't touch another drop so long what I live . GRETCHEN . Can I trust you ? RIP . You must n't suspect me . GRETCHEN . Embracing him . There , then , I will trust you . She takes the candle , and goes to fetch the children . Here , Hendrick , Meenie . Children , where are you ? Exit through the door on the left . RIP . Seats himself in the chair to the right of the table , and takes out flask . Well , it 's too bad ; but it 's all a woman 's fault any way . When a man gets drinkin ' and that , they ought to let him alone . So soon as they scold him , he goes off like a sky-rocket . Re-enter Gretchen and the children . GRETCHEN . Seeing the flask in Rip 's hand . I thought as much . RIP . Unconscious of her presence . How I did smooth her down ! I must drink her good health . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink . GRETCHEN . Snatching the bottle , and using it to gesticulate with . Oh , you paltry thief ! RIP . Concerned for the schnapps . What you doin ' ? You 'll spill the licker out of the bottle . He puts in the cork . GRETCHEN . Examining the flask . Why , the monster , he 's emptied the bottle ! RIP . That 's a fac ' . That 's a fac ' . GRETCHEN . Throwing down the flask . Then that is the last drop you drink under my roof ! RIP . What ! What ! Meenie approaches her father on tiptoe , and kneels beside him . GRETCHEN . Out , you drunkard ! Out , you sot ! You disgrace to your wife and to your child ! This house is mine . RIP . Dazed , and a little sobered . Yours ! Yours ! GRETCHEN . Raising her voice above the storm , which seems to rage more fiercely outside . Yes , mine , mine ! Had it been yours to sell , it would have gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , I say  --  Pushing open the door . for you have no longer any share in me or mine . A peal of thunder . MEENIE . Running over , and kneeling by Gretchen . Oh , mother , hark at the storm ! GRETCHEN . Pushing her aside . Begone man , ca n't you speak ? Are you struck dumb ? You sleep no more under my roof . RIP . Who has not moved , even his arm remaining outstretched , as it was when Meenie slipped from his side , murmurs in a bewildered , incredulous way . Why , Gretchen , are you goin ' to turn me out like a dog ? Gretchen points to the door . Rip rises and leans against the table with a groan . His conscience speaks . Well , maybe you are right . His voice breaks , and with a despairing gesture . I have got no home . I will go . But mind , Gretchen , after what you say to me to-night , I can never darken your door again  --  never  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Running to Rip . Not into the storm , Rip . Hark , how it thunders ! RIP . Putting his arm round him . Yah , my boy ; but not as bad to me as the storm in my home . I will go . At the door by this time . MEENIE . Catching Rip 's coat . No , father , do n't go ! RIP . Bending over her tenderly , and holding her close to him . My child ! Bless you , my child , bless you ! Meenie faints . Rip gives a sobbing sigh . GRETCHEN . Relenting . No , Rip  --  I  --  RIP . Waving her off . No ; you have drive me from your house . You have opened the door for me to go . You may never open it for me to come back . Leans against the doorpost , overcome by his emotion . His eye rests on Meenie , who lies at his feet . You say I have no share in this house . Points to Meenie in profound despair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from your door . He staggers out into the storm . GRETCHEN . No , Rip ! Husband , come back ! Gretchen faints , and the curtain falls . ACT III . SCENE I. A steep and rocky clove in the Kaatskill Mountains , down which rushes a torrent , swollen by the storm . Overhead , the hemlocks stretch their melancholy boughs . It is night . Rip enters , almost at a run , with his head down , and his coat-collar turned up , beating his way against the storm . With the hunter 's instinct , he protects the priming of his gun with the skirt of his jacket . Having reached a comparatively level spot , he pauses for breath , and turns to see what has become of his dog . RIP . Whistling to the dog . Schneider ! Schneider ! What 's the matter with Schneider ? Something must have scared that dog . There he goes head over heels down the hill . Well , here I am again  --  another night in the mountains ! Heigho ! these old trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hat . How are you , old fellows ? Well , I like the trees , they keep me from the wind and the rain , and they never blow me up ; and when I lay me down on the broad of my back , they seem to bow their heads to me , an ' say : Go to sleep , Rip , go to sleep . Lightning . My , what a flash that was ! Old Hendrick Hudson 's lighting his pipe in the mountains to-night ; now , we 'll hear him roll the big balls along . Thunder . Rip looks back over the path he has come , and whistles again for his dog . Well , I  --  no  --  Schneider ! No ; whatever it is , it 's on two legs . Why , what a funny thing is that a comin ' up the hill ? I thought nobody but me ever come nigh this place . Enter a strange dwarfish figure , clad all in gray like a Dutch seaman of the seventeenth century , in short-skirted doublet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From beneath the latter his long gray beard streams down till it almost touches the ground . He carries a keg on his shoulder . He advances slowly towards Rip , and , by his gesture , begs Rip to set the keg down for him . Rip does so , and the dwarf seats himself upon it . RIP . With good-humoured sarcasm . Sit down , and make yourself comfortable . A long pause and silence . What ? What 's the matter ? Ai n't ye goin ' to speak to a feller ? I do n't want to speak to you , then . Who you think you was , that I want to speak to you , any more than you want to speak to me ; you hear what I say ? Rip pokes the dwarf in the ribs , who turns , and looks up . Rip retreats hastily . Donner an ' Blitzen ! What for a man is das ? I have been walking over these mountains ever since I was a boy , an ' I never saw a queer-looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea-snake , I reckon . The dwarf approaches Rip , and motions Rip to help him up the mountain with the keg . RIP . Well , why do n't you say so , den ? You mean you would like me to help you up with that keg ? The dwarf nods in the affirmative . Well , sir , I do n't do it . The dwarf holds up his hands in supplication . No ; there 's no good you speakin ' like that I never seed you before , did I ? The dwarf shakes his head . Rip , with great decision , walking away , and leaning against a tree . I do n't want to see you again , needer . What have you got in that keg , schnapps ? The dwarf nods . I do n't believe you . The dwarf nods more affirmatively . Is it good schnapps ? The dwarf again insists . Well , I 'll help you . Go ' long pick up my gun , there , and I follow you mit that keg on my shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rip shoulders the keg , a furious blast whirls up the valley , and seems to carry him and his demon companion before it . The rain that follows blots out the landscape . For a few moments , all is darkness . Gradually , the topmost peak of the Kaatskill Mountains becomes visible , far above the storm . Stretching below , the country lies spread out like a map . A feeble and watery moonlight shows us a weird group , gathered upon the peak ,  --  Hendrick Hudson , and his ghostly crew . In the foreground , one of them poises a ball , about to bowl it , while the others lean forward in attitudes of watchful expectancy . Silently he pitches it ; and , after a momentary pause , a long and rumbling peal of thunder reverberates among the valleys below . At this moment , the demon , carrying Rip 's gun , appears over the crest of the peak in the background , and Rip toils after with the keg on his shoulder . Arrived at the summit , he drops the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RIP . Glancing out over the landscape . I say , old gentleman , I never was so high up in the mountains before . Look down into the valley there ; it seems more as a mile . I  --  Turning to speak to his companion , and perceiving another of the crew . You 're another feller ! The second demon nods assent . You 're that other chap 's brother ? The demon again assents . Rip carries the keg a little further , and comes face to face with a third . RIP . You 're another brother ? The third demon nods assent . Rip takes another step , and perceives Hendrick Hudson in the centre , surrounded by many demons . You 're his old gran'father ? Hudson nods . Rip puts down the keg in perplexity , not untinged with alarm . Donner and Blitzen ! here 's the whole family : I 'm a dead man to a certainty . The demons extend their arms to Hudson , as if inquiring what they should do . He points to Rip , they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose they 're speakin ' about me ! Looking at his gun , which the first demon has deposited on the ground , and which lies within his reach . No good shootin ' at ' em ; family 's too big for one gun . Hendrick Hudson advances , and seats himself on the keg facing Rip . The demons slowly surround the two . RIP . Looking about him with growing apprehension . My , my , I do n't like that kind of people at all ! No , sir ! I do n't like any sech kind . I like that old gran'father worse than any of them . With a sheepish attempt to be genial , and appear at his ease . How you was , old gentleman ? I did n't mean to intrude on you , did I ? Hudson shakes his head . What ? No reply . I 'll tell you how it was ; I met one of your gran'children , I do n't know which is the one  --  Glancing around . They 're all so much alike . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the same kind of a one . Any way this one , he axed me to help him up the mountain mit dat keg . Well , he was an old feller , an ' I thought I would help him . Pauses , troubled by their silence . Was I right to help him ? Hudson nods . I say , was I right to help him ? Hudson nods again . If he was here , he would yust tell you the same thing any way , because  --  Suddenly perceiving the demon he had met below . Why , dat 's the one ; ai n't it ? The demon nods . Yes ; dat is the one , dat 's the same kind of a one dat I met . Was I right to come ? Hudson nods approval . I did n't want to come here , anyhow ; no , sir , I did n't want to come to any such kind of a place . After a pause , seeing that no one has anything to say . I guess I better go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is about to return by the way he came ; but the demons raise their hands threateningly , and stop him . He puts his gun down again . I did n't want to come here , anyhow  --  Grumbling to himself , then pulling himself together with an effort , and facing Hudson . Well , old gentleman , if you mean to do me any harm , just speak it right out  --  Then with a little laugh . Oh ! I will die game  --  Glancing round for a means of escape , and half to himself . If I ca n't run away . Hudson extends a cup to Rip , as if inviting him to drink . RIP . Doubtfully . You want me to drink mit you ? Hudson nods . Rip approaches him cautiously , unable to resist the temptation of a drink . Well , I swore off drinkin ' ; but as this is the first time I see you , I wo n't count this one  --  He takes the cup . Hudson holds up another cup . Rip is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mit me ? We drink mit one another ? Hudson nods affirmatively . Rip feels at home under these familiar circumstances , and becomes familiar and colloquial again . What 's the matter mit you , old gentleman , anyhow ? You go and make so Imitating the demon . mit your head every time ; was you deaf ? Hudson shakes his head . Oh , nein . Laughing at his error . If you was deaf , you would n't hear what I was sayin ' . Was you dumb ? Hudson nods yes . So ? You was dumb ? Hudson nods again . Has all of your family the same complaint ? Hudson nods . All the boys dumb , hey ? All the boys dumb . All the demons nod . Then , suddenly , as if struck with an idea . Have you got any girls ? Hudson shakes his head . Do n't you ? Such a big family , and all boys ? Hudson nods . RIP . With profound regret . That 's a pity ; my , that 's a pity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls , what wives they would make  --  Brightening up . Well , old gentleman , here 's your good health , and all your family  --  Turning , and waving to them . may they live long and prosper . Rip drinks . As he does so , all the demons lean forward , watching the effect of the liquor . Rip puts his hand to his head . The empty cup falls to the ground . RIP . In an awed and ecstatic voice . What for licker is that ! As he turns , half reeling , he sees Hudson holding out to him another cup . He snatches it with almost frantic eagerness . RIP . Give me another one ! He empties it at a draught . A long pause follows , during which the effect of the liquor upon Rip becomes apparent ; the light in his eyes fades , his exhilaration dies out , and he loses his grasp on the reality of his surroundings . Finally , he clasps his head with both hands , and cries in a muffled , terrified voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so light , and now , it 's heavy as lead ! He reels , and falls heavily to the ground . A long pause . The demons begin to disappear . Rip becomes dimly conscious of this , and raises himself on his elbow . RIP . Are you goin ' to leave me , boys ? Are you goin ' to leave me all alone ? Do n't leave me ; do n't go away . With a last effort . I will drink your good health , and your family 's  --  He falls back heavily , asleep . CURTAIN . ACT IV . SCENE I. As the curtain rises , the same high peaks of the Kaatskills , and the far-stretching valley below , are disclosed in the gray light of dawn . Rip is still lying on the ground , as in the last act ; but he is no longer the Rip we knew . His hair and beard are long and white , bleached by the storms that have rolled over his bead during the twenty years he has been asleep . As he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that his former picturesque rags have become so dilapidated that it is a matter of marvel how they hold together . They have lost all traces of colour , and have assumed the neutral tints of the moss and lichens that cover the rocks . His voice , when he first speaks , betrays even more distinctly than his appearance the lapse of time . Instead of the full round tones of manhood , he speaks in the high treble of feeble old age . His very hands have grown old and weatherbeaten . RIP . Staring vacantly around . I wonder where I was . On top of the Kaatskill Mountains as sure as a gun ! Wo n't my wife give it to me for stopping out all night ? I must get up and get home with myself . Trying to rise . Oh , I feel very bad ! Vat is the matter with my elbow ? In trying to rub it , the other one gives him such a twinge that he cries out . Oh ! The other elbow is more badder than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' mit the wet grass . He rises with great difficulty . Och ! I never had such rheumatix like that . He feels himself all over , and then stands for a moment pondering , and bewildered by a strange memory . I was n't sleeping all the time , needer . I know I met a queer kind of a man , and we got drinkin ' , and I guess I got pretty drunk . Well , I must pick up my gun , and get home mit myself . After several painful attempts , he succeeds in picking up his gun , which drops all to pieces as be lifts it . Rip looks at it in amazement . My gun must have cotched the rheumatix too . Now that 's too bad . Them fellows have gone and stole my good gun , and leave me this rusty old barrel . Rip begins slowly to climb over the peak towards the path by which he had ascended , his memory seeming to act automatically . When he reaches the highest point , where he can look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , is that the village of Falling Waters that I see ? Why , the place is more than twice the size it was last night . I  --  He sinks down . I do n't know whether I am dreaming , or sleeping , or waking . Then pulling himself together with a great effort , and calling up the image of his wife to act as whip and spur to his waning powers , he says , with humourous conviction , as he gets up painfully again :  --  I go home to my wife . She 'll let me know whether I 'm asleep or awake or not . Almost unable to proceed . I do n't know if I will ever get home , my k-nees are so stiff . My backbone , it 's broke already . As the curtain falls , Rip stands leaning on the barrel of his gun as on a staff , with one hand raised , looking out over the valley . SCENE II . A comfortable-looking room in Derrick 's house . As the curtain rises , Meenie and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-six , and Gretchen is a matronly figure with white hair . They are well dressed , and have every appearance of physical and material prosperity . GRETCHEN . I am sent to you by your father , Meenie . MEENIE . Oh , do n't call him so ; he is not my father ! He is your husband , mother ; but I owe him no love . And his cruel treatment of you  --  GRETCHEN . Hush , child ! Oh , if he heard you , he would make me pay for every disrespectful word you utter . MEENIE . Yes ; he would beat you , starve and degrade you . You are not his wife , mother , but his menial . GRETCHEN . My spirit is broken , Meenie . I can not resent it . Nay , I deserve it ; for as Derrick now treats me , so I treated your poor father when he was alive . MEENIE . You , mother ? You , so gentle ? You , who are weakness and patience itself ? GRETCHEN . Yes ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it was my temper , my cruelty , that drove your father from our home twenty years ago . You were too young then to remember him . MEENIE . No , mother , I recollect my dear father taking me on his knee , and saying to Hendrick that I should be his wife ; and I promised I would . GRETCHEN . Poor Rip ! Poor , good-natured , kind creature that he was ! How gently he bore with me ; and I drove him like a dog from his home . I hunted him into the mountains , where he perished of hunger or cold , or a prey to some wild beast . MEENIE . Do n't cry , mother ! Enter Derrick , now grown old and bent over his cane , and infinitely more disagreeable than before . He , too , has thriven , and is dressed in a handsome full suit of black silk . DERRICK . Snivelling again , eh ? Teaching that girl of yours to be an obstinate hypocrite ? MEENIE . Oh , sir , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you 're spoken to . I 'll have you both to understand that there 's but one master here . Well , mistress , have you told her my wishes ; and is she prepared to obey them ? GRETCHEN . Indeed , sir , I was trying to  --  DERRICK . Beating about the bush , prevaricating , and sneaking , as you usually do . MEENIE . If you have made her your slave , you must expect her to cringe . DERRICK . Approaching her threateningly . What 's that ? GRETCHEN . Meenie ! Meenie ! For Heaven 's sake , do not anger him ! DERRICK . Raising his cane . She had better not . MEENIE . Defiantly . Take care how you raise your hand to me , for I 'll keep a strict account of it . And when Hendrick comes back from sea , he 'll make you smart for it , I promise you . DERRICK . Is the girl mad ? MEENIE . He thrashed your nephew once for being insolent to me . Go and ask him how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me you 'll mind your stops . DERRICK . To Gretchen . Oh , you shall pay for this ! GRETCHEN . No , Derrick , indeed , indeed I have not urged her to this ! O Meenie , do not speak so to him ; for my sake forbear ! MEENIE . For your sake , yes , dear mother . I forgot that he could revenge himself on you . DERRICK . As for your sailor lover , Hendrick Vedder , I 've got news of him at last . His ship , the " Mayflower , " was lost , three years ago , off Cape Horn . MEENIE . No , no . Not lost ? DERRICK . If you doubt it , there 's the " Shipping Gazette , " in on my office table . You can satisfy yourself that your sailor bully has gone to the bottom . GRETCHEN . Oh , sir , do not convey the news to her so cruelly . DERRICK . That 's it . Because I do n't sneak and trick and lie about it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been dead and gone these two years or more . The time of mourning is over . Am I going to be nice about it this time of day ? MEENIE . Then all my hope is gone , gone forever ! DERRICK . So much the better for you . Hendrick 's whole fortune was invested in that ship . So there 's an end of him and your expectations . Now you are free , and a beggar . My nephew has a fancy for you . He will have a share of my business now , and my money when  --  when I die . GRETCHEN . Do not ask her to decide now ! DERRICK . Why not ? If she expects to make a better bargain by holding off , she 's mistaken . GRETCHEN . How can you expect her to think of a husband at this moment ? DERRICK . Do n't I tell you the other one is dead these two years ? GRETCHEN . Leading Meenie away . Come , my child . Leave her to me , sir ; I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do ; for if she do n't consent to accept my offer , she shall pack bag and baggage out of this house . Aye , this very day ! Not a penny , not a stitch of clothes but what she has on her back , shall she have ! Oh , I 've had to deal with obstinate women before now , and I 've taken them down before I 've done with them . You know who I mean ? Do you know who I mean ? Stop . Answer me ! Do you know who I mean ? GRETCHEN . Submissively . Yes , sir . DERRICK . Then why did n't you say so before ? Sulky , I suppose . There , you may be off . Exeunt . SCENE III . The village of Falling Waters , which has grown to be a smart and flourishing town , but whose chief features remain unchanged . To the left , as of yore , is the inn , bearing scarcely any mark of the lapse of time , save that the sign of George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington . To the right , where Rip 's cottage used to stand , nothing remains , however , but the blackened and crumbling ruins of a chimney . A table and chairs stand in front of the Inn porch . Into this familiar scene Rip makes his entrance , but not as before ,  --  in glee , with the children clinging about him . Faint , weak , and weary he stumbles along , followed by a jeering , hooting mob of villagers ; while the children hide from him in fear , behind their elders . His eyes look dazed and uncomprehending , and he catches at the back of a chair as if in need of physical as well as mental support . KATCHEN . As Rip enters . Why , what queer looking creature is this , that all the boys are playing  --  SETH . Why , he looks as though he 'd been dead for fifty years , and dug up again ! RIP . My friends , Kanst du Deutsch sprechen ? FIRST VILLAGER . I say , old fellow , you ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , no place about here , have you ? RIP . Bewildered , but with simplicity . What is that ? I do n't know who that is . SECOND VILLAGER . I say , old man , who 's your barber ? The crowd laughs , and goes off repeating , " Who 's your barber ? " Some of the children remain to stare at Rip ; but when he holds out his hand to them , they , too , run off frightened . RIP . Who 's my barber ; what dey mean by dat ? Noticing his beard . Why , is that on me ? I did n't see that before . My beard and hair is so long and white  --  Gretchen wo n't know me with that , when she gets me home . Looking towards the cottage . Why , the home 's gone away ! Rip becomes more and more puzzled , like a man in a dream who sees unfamiliar things amid familiar surroundings , and can not make out what has happened ; and as in a dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through his bewilderment , exhibiting flashes of his old humour , wit , and native shrewdness . But with all this he never laughs . SETH . I say , old man , had n't you better go home and get shaved ? RIP . Looking about for the voice . What ? SETH . Here , this way . Had n't you better go home and get shaved ? RIP . My wife will shave me when she gets me home . Is this the village of " Falling Waters , " where we was ? SETH . Yes . RIP . Still more puzzled , not knowing his face . Do you live here ? SETH . Well , rather . I was born here . RIP . Reflectively . Then you live here ? SETH . Well , rather ; of course I do . RIP . Feeling that he has hold of something certain . Do you know where I live ? SETH . No ; but I should say you belong to Noah 's Ark . RIP . Putting his hand to his ear . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . RIP . Very much hurt . Why will you say such thing like that ? Then , with a flash of humour , and drawing his beard slowly through his fingers . Well , look like it , do n't I ? Beginning all over again to feel for his clue . My friend , did you never hear of a man in this place whose name was Rip Van Winkle ? SETH . Rip Van Winkle , the laziest , drunken vagabond in the country ? RIP . Somewhat taken aback by this description , but obliged to concur in it . Yah , that is the one ; there is no mistaking him , eh ? SETH . I know all about him . RIP . Hopefully . Do you ? SETH . Yes . RIP . Quite eagerly . Well , if you know all about him ; well , what has become of him ? SETH . What has become of him ? Why , bless your soul , he 's been dead these twenty years ! RIP . Looking at Seth . Then I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead , eh ? SETH . Yes ; and buried . RIP . Humourously . I 'm sorry for that ; for he was a good fellow , so he was . SETH . Aside . There appears to be something queer about this old chap ; I wonder who he is . Rises , and taking chair over to Rip . There , old gentleman , be seated . RIP . Seating himself with great difficulty , aided by Seth . Oh , thank you ; every time I move a new way , I get another pain . My friend , where is the house what you live in ? SETH . Pointing at inn . There . RIP . Did you live there yesterday ? SETH . Well , rather . RIP . No ; it is Nick Vedder what live in that house . Where is Nick Vedder ? SETH . Does he ? Then I wish he 'd pay the rent for it . Why , Nick Vedder has been dead these fifteen years . RIP . Did you know Jacob Stine , what was with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him . He was one of the same sort as Rip and Nick . RIP . Yes , them fellows was all pretty much alike . SETH . Well , he went off the hooks a short time after Rip . RIP . Where has he gone ? SETH . Off the hooks . RIP . What is that , when they go off the hooks ? SETH . Why , he died . RIP . With an air of hopelessness . Is there anybody alive here at all ? Then , with a sudden revulsion of feeling , convinced of the impossibility of what he hears . That man is drunk what talks to me . SETH . Ah , they were a jolly set , I reckon . RIP . Oh , they was . I knowed them all . SETH . Did you ? RIP . Yes , I know Jacob Stine , and Nick Vedder , and Rip Van Winkle , and the whole of them . A new idea strikes him , and he beckons to Seth , whom he asks , very earnestly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did you know Schneider ? SETH . Schneider ! Schneider ! No , I never heard of him . RIP . Simply . He was a dog . I thought you might know him . Well , if dat is so , what has become of my child Meenie , and my wife Gretchen ? Are they gone , too ? Turning to look at the ruins of the house . Yah , even the house is dead . SETH . Poor old chap ! He seems quite cast down at the loss of his friends . I 'll step in and get a drop of something to cheer him up . Exit . RIP . Puzzling it out with himself . I ca n't make it out how it all was ; because if this here is me , what is here now , and Rip Van Winkle is dead , then who am I ? That is what I would like to know . Yesterday , everybody was here ; and now they was all gone . Very forlorn . Re-enter Seth , followed by the villagers . SETH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there 's a drop of something to cheer you up . RIP . Shaking hands with Seth and Katchen . Oh , thank you . I  --  I  --  I swore off ; but this is the first time what I see you . I wo n't count this one . His voice breaks . My friend , you have been very kind to me . Here is your good health , and your family 's , and may they all live long and prosper ! SETH . I say , wife , ai n't he a curiosity fit for a show ? RIP . Aside . That gives me courage to ask these people anodder question . He begins with difficulty . My friend , I do n't know whether you knowed it or not , but there was a child of Rip ,  --  Meenie her name was . SETH . Oh , yes ; that 's all right . RIP . With great emotion , leaning forward . She is not gone ? She is not dead ? No , no ! SETH . No . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meenie is alive . It 's all right now ,  --  all right now . SETH . She 's the prettiest girl in the village . RIP . I know dat . SETH . But if she wastes her time waiting on Hendrick Vedder , she 'll be a middle-aged woman before long . RIP . Incredulously . She 's a little child , only six years old . SETH . Six-and-twenty , you mean . RIP . Thinking they are making fun of him . She 's a little child no bigger than that . Do n't bodder me ; I do n't like that . SETH . Why , she 's as big as her mother . RIP . Very much surprised that Seth knows Gretchen . What , Gretchen ? SETH . Yes , Gretchen . RIP . Is n't Gretchen dead ? SETH . No ; she 's alive . RIP . With mixed emotions . Gretchen is alive , eh ! Gretchen 's alive ! SETH . Yes ; and married again . RIP . Fiercely How would she do such a thing like that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she was a widow , was n't she ? RIP . Oh , yes . I forgot about Rip 's being dead . Well , and then ? SETH . Well , then Derrick made love to her . RIP . Surprised , and almost amused . What for Derrick ? Not Derrick Von Beekman ? SETH . Yes , Derrick Von Beekman . RIP . Still more interested . Well , and then ? SETH . Well , then her affairs went bad ; and at last she married him . RIP . Turning it over in his mind . Has Derrick married Gretchen ? SETH . Yes . RIP . With a flash of his old humour , but still with no laughter . Well , I did n't think he would come to any good ; I never did . So she cotched Derrick , eh ! Poor Derrick ! SETH . Yes . RIP . Well , here 's their good health , and their family 's , and may they all live long and prosper ! Drinks . SETH . Now , old gent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ? RIP . With conviction . Where my home was ? Here 's where it is . SETH . What , here in this village ? Now do you think we 're going to keep all the half-witted strays that choose to come along here ? No ; be off with you . Why , it 's a shame that those you belong to should allow such an old tramp as you to float around here . VILLAGERS . Roughly , and trying to push him along . Yes ; away with him ! RIP . Frightened , and pleading with them . Are you going to drive me away into the hills again ? FIRST VILLAGER . Yes ; away with him ! He 's an old tramp . Enter Hendrick , with stick and bundle , followed by some of the women of the village . VILLAGERS . Away with him ! HENDRICK . Throwing down bundle . Avast there , mates . Where are you towing that old hulk to ? What , you wo n't ? Pushing crowd aside , and going forward . Where are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you ? HENDRICK . I 'm a man , every inch of me ; and if you doubt it , I 'll undertake to remove the suspicions from any two of you in five minutes . Ai n't you ashamed of yourselves ? Do n't you see the poor old creature has but half his wits ? SETH . Well , this is no asylum for worn out idiots . VILLAGERS . Coming forward . No , it ai n't ! HENDRICK . Ai n't it ? OMNES . No , it ai n't . HENDRICK . Then I 'll make it a hospital for broken heads if you stand there much longer . Clear the decks , you lubberly swabs ! Drives them aside . Turns to Rip , who stands bewildered . What is the cause of all this ? RIP . Helplessly . I do n't know ; do you ? HENDRICK . To villagers . Do any of you know him ? FIRST VILLAGER . No ; he appears to be a stranger . HENDRICK . To Rip . You seem bewildered . Can I help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I live . HENDRICK . And do n't you know ? RIP . No , I do n't . HENDRICK . Why , what 's your name ? RIP . Almost childishly . I do n't know ; but I believe I know vat it used to be . My name , it used to be Rip Van Winkle . VILLAGERS . In astonishment . Rip Van Winkle ? HENDRICK . Rip Van Winkle ? Impossible ! RIP . Pathetically feeble , and old . Well , I would n't swear to it myself . I tell you how it was : Last night , I do n't know about the time , I went away up into the mountains , and while I was there I meet a queer kind o ' man , and we got drinkin ' ; and I guess I got pretty drunk . And then I went to sleep ; and when I woke up this morning , I was dead . All laugh . HENDRICK . Poor old fellow ; he 's crazy . Rip Van Winkle has been dead these twenty years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Clutching at a faint hope . You do n't know me ? HENDRICK . No ; nor anybody else here , it seems . The villagers , finding that there is to be no amusement for them , straggle off to their occupations . SETH . As he goes into the inn . Why , wife , he 's as cracked as our old teapot . RIP . With simple pathos . Are we so soon forgot when we are gone ? No one remembers Rip Van Winkle . HENDRICK . Come , cheer up , my old hearty , and you shall share my breakfast . Assists Rip to sit at the table . Rip has fallen into a dream again . To Katchen . Bring us enough for three , and of your best . KATCHEN . That I will . Exit into inn . HENDRICK . So here I am , home again . And yonder 's the very spot where , five years ago , I parted from Meenie . RIP . Roused by the name . What , Meenie Van Winkle ? HENDRICK . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh , yah ; that was Nick Vedder 's son . HENDRICK . Turning to Rip . That 's me . RIP . Resentfully . That was you ! You think I 'm a fool ? He 's a little child , no bigger than that ,  --  the one I mean . HENDRICK . How mad he is ! Enter Katchen from inn with tray , on which is laid a breakfast . She puts it on table , and exits into inn . There , that 's right . Stow your old locker full while I take a cruise around yonder house , where , five years ago , I left the dearest bit of human nature that was ever put together . I 'll be back directly . Who comes here ? It 's surely Derrick and his wife . Egad , I 'm in luck ; for now the old birds are out , Meenie will surely be alone . I 'll take advantage of the coast being clear , and steer into harbour alongside . Exit . Enter Derrick , followed by Gretchen . DERRICK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? GRETCHEN . I can not accept this sacrifice . RIP . Starting from his reverie , and turning to look at her . Why , that is Gretchen 's voice . As he recognises her , and sees how aged she is . My , my ! Is that my wife ? DERRICK . Oh , you ca n't accept ! Wo n't you kindly allow me a word on the subject ? RIP . Aside , humourously . No , indeed , she will not . Now , my friend , you are going to cotch it . GRETCHEN . There is a limit even to my patience . Do n't drive me to it . RIP . Aside , drolly . Take care , my friend , take care . DERRICK . Look you , woman ; Meenie has consented to marry my nephew . She has pledged her word to do so on condition that I settle an annuity on you . GRETCHEN . I wo n't allow my child to break her heart . DERRICK . You wo n't allow ? Dare to raise your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , you shall repent it to the last hour of your life . RIP . Expectantly . Now she 'll knock him down , flat as a flounder . DERRICK . Sneeringly . You wo n't allow ? This is something new . Who are you ; do you think you are dealing with your first husband ? GRETCHEN . Alas , no ; I wish I was . RIP . Lost in wonderment . My , my , if Rip was alive , he never would have believed it ! DERRICK . So you thought to get the upper hand of me , when you married me ; did n't you ? GRETCHEN . I thought to get a home for my little girl  --  shelter , and food ; want drove me to your door , and I married you for a meal 's victuals for my sick child . DERRICK . So you came to me as if I was a poor-house , eh ? Then you ca n't complain of the treatment you received . You sacrificed yourself for Meenie ; and the least she can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In an hour , the deeds will be ready . Now , just you take care that no insolent interference of yours spoils my plans ; do you hear ? GRETCHEN . Yes , sir . DERRICK . Why ca n't you be kind and affectionate to her , as I am to you . There , go and blubber over her ; that 's your way . You are always pretending to be miserable . GRETCHEN . Alas , no , sir ! I am always pretending to be happy . DERRICK . Do n't cry . I wo n't have it ; come now , none of that . If you come home to-day with red eyes , and streaky cheeks , I 'll give you something to cry for ; now you know what 's for supper . Exit . RIP . Still amazed . Well , if I had n't seen it , I never would have believed it ! GRETCHEN . Absorbed in her grief . Oh , wretch that I am , I must consent , or that man will surely thrust her out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become  --  Seeing Rip . Yes , to become a thing of rags and misery , like that poor soul . RIP . She always drived the beggars away ; I suppose I must go . Getting up , and starting to go . GRETCHEN . Taking penny from her pocket . Here , my poor man , take this . It is only a penny ; but take it , and may God bless you , poor wanderer , so old , so helpless . Why do you come to this strange place , so far from home ? RIP . Keeping his face turned away from her . She do n't know me ; she do n't know me ! GRETCHEN . Are you alone in the world ? RIP . Trying to bring himself to look directly at Gretchen . My wife asks me if I 'm alone . GRETCHEN . Come with me . How feeble he is ; there , lean on me . Come to yonder house , and there you shall rest your limbs by the fire . Gretchen takes his arm , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her house , Rip stops , and , with an effort , turns and looks her full in the face , with a penetrating gaze , as if imploring recognition , but there is none ; and , sadly shaking his head , he shrinks into himself , and allows her to lead him tottering off . SCENE IV . The same room in Derrick 's home as in Scene II . Enter Derrick . DERRICK . I do n't know what women were invented for , except to make a man 's life miserable . I can get a useful , hard-working woman to keep my house clean , and order my dinner for me , for half that weak snivelling creature costs me . Enter Cockles . COCKLES . Well , uncle , what news ; will she have me ? DERRICK . Leave it to me ; she must , she shall . COCKLES . If she holds out , what are we to do ? It was all very well , you marrying Rip 's widow , that choked off all inquiry into his affairs ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owns all this property ; if we do n't secure her , we 're not safe . DERRICK . You 've got rid of Hendrick Vedder ; that 's one obstacle removed . COCKLES . I 'm not so sure about that . His ship was wrecked on a lonely coast ; but some of the crew may have , unfortunately , been saved . DERRICK . If he turns up after you 're married , what need you care ? COCKLES . I 'd like nothing better ; I 'd like to see his face when he saw my arm around his sweetheart  --  my wife . But if he turns up before our marriage  --  DERRICK . I must put the screw on somewhere . COCKLES . I 'll tell you , Meenie will do anything for her mother 's sake . Now you are always threatening to turn her out , as she turned out Rip . That 's the tender place . Meenie fears more for her mother , than she cares for herself . DERRICK . Well , what am I to do ? COCKLES . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her , that you are always talking about doing , but never keeping your word . The girl will sell herself to secure her mother 's happiness . DERRICK . And it would be a cheap riddance for me . I was just talking about it to Gretchen this morning . You shall have the girl ; but I hope you are not going to marry her out of any weak feeling of love . You 're not going to let her make a fool of you by and by ? COCKLES . I never cared for her until she was impudent to me , and got that sailor lover of hers to thrash me ; and then I began to feel a hunger for her I never felt before . DERRICK . That 's just the way I felt for Gretchen . COCKLES . ' Tai n't revenge that I feel ; it 's enterprise . I want to overcome a difficulty . DERRICK . Chuckling . And so you shall . Come , we 'll put your scheme in train at once ; and let this be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widow . COCKLES . No , uncle ; I 'll take a leaf out of your book , and let it be a warning to her . Exeunt . SCENE V. A plain sitting-room in Derrick 's house . A table stands in the centre with several chairs around it . There are cups , a jug , and a work-basket on the table . As the curtain rises , Meenie is discovered seated by the table . MEENIE . Why should I repine ? Did my mother hesitate to sacrifice her life to make a home for me ? No ; these tears are ungrateful , selfish . The door at the back opens , and Gretchen enters , leading Rip , who seems very feeble and a little wild . GRETCHEN . Come in and rest awhile . RIP . This your house , your home ? GRETCHEN . Yes . Meenie , Meenie , bring him a chair . RIP . Turning aside so as to shield his face from Meenie . Is that your daughter ? GRETCHEN . That is my daughter . RIP . Looking timidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I thought you was a child . GRETCHEN . Crossing to go into another room , and speaking to Meenie , who starts to follow her . Stay with him until I get some food to fill his wallet . Do n't be frightened , child , he is only a simple , half-witted creature whose misery has touched my heart . Exit . Meenie takes her work-basket , and starts to follow . RIP . Holding out his hand to detain her , and speaking with hardly suppressed excitement . One moment , my dear . Come here , and let me look at you . Pathetically . Are you afraid ? I wo n't hurt you . I only want to look at you ; that is all . Wo n't you come ? Meenie puts down her work-basket ; and Rip is relieved of his great fear that she might leave him . His excitement increases as he goes on in his struggle to make her recognise him . Yes ; I thought you would . Oh , yah , that is Meenie ! But you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eyes ! That is just the same Meenie . You are a woman , Meenie . Do you remember something of your father ? He looks at her eagerly and anxiously , as if on her answer hung his reason and his life . MEENIE . I do . I do . Oh , I wish he was here now ! RIP . Half rising in his chair , in his excitement . Yah ? But he is n't ? No ? No ? MEENIE . No ; he 's dead . I remember him so well . No one ever loved him as I did . RIP . No ; nobody ever loved me like my child . MEENIE . Never shall I forget his dear , good face . Tell me  --  RIP . Eagerly and expectantly . Yah ?  --  MEENIE . Did you know him ? RIP . Confused by her question , and afraid to answer . Well  --  I thought I did . But I  --  When I say that here , in the village , the people all laugh at me . MEENIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RIP . Making a great effort of will , and resolved to put the question of his identity to the test . Do n't go away from me . I want you to look at me now , and tell me if you have ever seen me before . MEENIE . Surprised . No . RIP . Holding out his arms to her . Try , my darlin , ' wo n't you ? MEENIE . Frightened . What do you mean ? Why do you gaze so earnestly and fondly on me ? RIP . Rising from his chair , in trembling excitement , and approaching her . I am afraid to tell you , my dear , because if you say it is not true , it may be it would break my heart But , Meenie , either I dream , or I am mad ; but I am your father . MEENIE . My father ! RIP . Yes ; but hear me , my dear , and then you will know . Trying to be logical and calm , but labouring under great excitement . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that was my home . I had here in this place my wife Gretchen , and my child Meenie  --  little Meenie  --  A long pause , during which he strives to re-assemble his ideas and memories more accurately . and my dog Schneider . That 's all the family what I 've got . Try and remember me , dear , wo n't you ? Pleadingly . I do n't know when it was  --  This night there was a storm ; and my wife drived me from my house ; and I went away  --  I do n't remember any more till I come back here now . And see , I get back now , and my wife is gone , and my home is gone . My home is gone , and my child  --  my child looks in my face , and do n't know who I am ! MEENIE . Rushing into his arms . I do ! Father ! RIP . Sobbing . Ah , my child ! Somebody knows me now ! Somebody knows me now ! MEENIE . But can it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is so , Meenie ! With a pathetic return of his uncertainty . Do n't say it is not , or you will kill me if you do . MEENIE . No . One by one your features come back to my memory . Your voice recalls that of my dear father , too . I can not doubt ; yet it is so strange . RIP . Yah , but it is me , Meenie ; it is me . MEENIE . I am bewildered . Surely mother will know you . RIP . Smiling . No , I do n't believe she 'll know me . MEENIE . She can best prove your identity . I will call her . RIP . No . You call the dog Schneider . He 'll know me better than my wife . They retire to a sofa in the background , where Rip sits with his arm around Meenie . Footnote : 2Kb Enter Derrick , with documents . DERRICK . What old vagabond is this ? Meenie starts to resent insult . RIP . Do n't you say a word . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and let him go . To Gretchen , who has entered , followed by Cockles . Gretchen seats herself in the chair at the right of the table . Come you here , mistress . Here are the papers for the young couple to sign . COCKLES . Aside . And the sooner the better . Hush , uncle . Hendrick is here . DERRICK . Young Vedder ? Then we must look sharp . To Gretchen . Come , fetch that girl of yours to sign this deed . GRETCHEN . Never shall she put her name to that paper with my consent . Never . DERRICK . Dare you oppose me in my own house ? Dare you preach disobedience under my roof ? GRETCHEN . I dare do anything when my child 's life 's at stake . No , a thousand times , no ! You shall not make of her what you have of me . Starvation and death are better than such a life as I lead . DERRICK . Raising cane . Do n't provoke me . GRETCHEN . Kneeling . Beat me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , I deserve it . Rising . But Meenie has given her promise to Hendrick Vedder , and she shall not break her word . COCKLES . Seated at right of table . But Hendrick Vedder is dead . The door is flung open , and Hendrick enters . HENDRICK . That 's a lie ! He 's alive ! GRETCHEN AND MEENIE . Rushing to him . Alive ! HENDRICK . To Meenie . I 've heard all about it . They made you believe that I was dead . To Derrick . Only wait till I get through here . Embracing Meenie . What a pleasure I 've got to come ! To Derrick . And what a thrashing I 've brought back for you two swabs . DERRICK . Angrily . Am I to be bullied under my own roof by a beggarly sailor ? Quit my house , all of you . Seizes Gretchen , and drags her away from the crowd . As for you , woman , this is your work , and I 'll make you pay for it . GRETCHEN . Hendrick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HENDRICK . Stand off ! DERRICK . Raising cane . No ; she is my wife , mine . GRETCHEN . Heaven help me , I am ! Rip has risen from the sofa , and come forward , and leans against the centre of the table , with one hand in his game-bag . He is fully awake now , and has recovered all his old shrewdness . RIP . Stop . I am not so sure about that . If that is so , then what has become of Rip Van Winkle ? COCKLES . He 's dead . RIP . That 's another lie . He 's no more dead than Hendrick Vedder . Derrick Von Beekman , you say this house and land was yours ? DERRICK . Yes . RIP . Where and what is the paper what you wanted Rip Van Winkle to sign when he was drunk , but sober enough not to do it ? Taking an old paper out of game-bag , and turning to Hendrick . Have you forgot how to read ? HENDRICK . No . RIP . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and looks it over . DERRICK . What does this mad old vagabond mean to say ? RIP . I mean , that is my wife , Gretchen Van Winkle . GRETCHEN . Rushing to Rip . Rip ! Rip ! COCKLES . I say , uncle , are you going to stand that ? That old impostor is going it under your nose in fine style . DERRICK . I 'm dumb with rage . To the villagers , who have come crowding in . Out of my house , all of you ! Begone , you old tramp ! HENDRICK . Stay where you are . To Derrick . This house do n't belong to you . Not an acre of land , not a brick in the town is yours . They have never ceased to belong to Rip Van Winkle ; and this document proves it . DERRICK . ' T is false . That paper is a forgery . HENDRICK . Oh , no , it is not ; for I read it to Rip twenty years ago . RIP . Clever boy ! Clever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it then , Derrick . DERRICK . Approaching Hendrick . And do you think I 'm fool enough to give up my property in this way ? HENDRICK . No . You 're fool enough to hang on to it , until we make you refund to Rip every shilling over and above the paltry sum you loaned him upon it . Now , if you are wise , you 'll take a hint . There 's the door . Go ! And never let us see your face again . RIP . Yah ; give him a cold potato , and let him go . Exit Derrick in a great rage . All the villagers laugh at him . Hendrick follows him to the door . COCKLES . Kneeling by Meenie . O Meenie ! Meenie ! HENDRICK . Coming down , and taking him by ear . I 'll Meenie you ! Takes him and pushes him out . All the villagers laugh . Meenie gives Rip a chair . GRETCHEN . Kneeling by the side of Rip . O Rip ! I drove you from your home ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak an unkind word to you , and you shall never see a frown on my face . And Rip  --  RIP . Yah . GRETCHEN . You may stay out all night , if you like . RIP . Leaning back in his chair . No , thank you . I had enough of that . GRETCHEN . And , Rip , you can get tight as often as you please . Taking bottle , and filling the cup from it . RIP . No ; I do n't touch another drop . MEENIE . Kneeling by the other side of Rip . Oh , yes , you will , father . For see , here are all the neighbours come to welcome you home . Gretchen offers Rip the cup . RIP . With all his old kindliness and hospitality . Well , bring in all the children , and the neighbours , and the dogs , and  --  Seeing the cup which Gretchen is offering to him . I swore off , you know . Well , I wo n't count this one ; for this will go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pipe , and tell my strange story to all my friends . Here is my child Meenie , and my wife Gretchen , and my boy Hendrick . I 'll drink all your good health , and I 'll drink your good health , and your families ' , and may they all live long and prosper ! Back matter CURTAIN.
