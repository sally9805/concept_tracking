txt Chicago is likely to run out of beer , for the brewers are on a strike . The strike began at 4 o'clock this morning when the brewers and maltsters in all the breweries of Chicago and vicinity with the exception of two , left their work in obedience to the orders of the union . The ultimatum of the bosses to the brewers was made known on Tuesday and was to the effect that the union would not be recognized but that the men would be treated with as individuals . The union asked no advance in wages or reduction of hours , but a renewal of the agreement of last year . The union decided last night to strike , but in BOMB cases the order was not obeyed , and at a meetfug of the bosses to-day it was asserted that out of 587 union men employed in the city 360 had quit work . The employers say they can rill the places of the strikers . They have helped one another out to-day as muoh as possible , and have advertised for men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philip Best Company or Milwaukee sent 15 men here to-day . According to the strikers , however , 700 men are now out , and only two breweries in the city are doing anything . The fight promises to be bitter , as both sides have grudges to settle , which grew out of the union isen taking a holiday when the Anarchists were hanged , the Milwaukee boycott and lockout some months ago , and other matters . The strike will not stop where it is now . The maltsters , employed in the . malt houses which are run separately froin the breweries and which employ about 250 men , will probably be on strike to-morrow . Some inaltsters are employed in the breweries and are out now , but most of them work iu the malt houses , which are separate in stitutions and sell to the breweries . Whether this step will have any effect in influencing the brewers is doubtful , as the largest maltster , Louis Huck , fought his battle with the union last year and is now employing non-union men .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
