txt A collision occurred late yesterday afternoon on the North Shore division of the Long Island Railroad , resulting in the death of three persons and the serious injury of several others and the arrest of one of the engineers , Thomas Glenn . The trains which came into collision were one from Manhattan Beach , due tit Hunter 's Point at 6:35 P. M. , and another Scheduled to leave the latter place at nearly the same time . Just a short distance from the Vernon-avenue crossing , in Long Island City , there are a number of tracks and switches . Among these is a switch dividing the Manhattan Beach track from the North Shore tracks . The Manhattan Beach track crosses one of the outgoing tracks of the other line , and it was here that the accident took place . As tho North Shore train was nearing the switch the engineer , Ernest Xretzmann , saw the Manhattan Beach train on the track directly in front of him , advancing at a high rate of speed . Irretzmann whistled down brakes . He succeeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beach train , Thomas Glenn , also attempted to stop his cars , but the air brakes were out of Disler and the train went rushing on at full speed . The two engines came into collision ' within four blocks of the ferry . The Manhattan Beach train consisted of seven cars . The first one was a parlor car and behind it were six of the ordinary open cars of the railroad . In these cars there were , according to the statement of Superintendent Barton , of the Long Island Road , about 700 people . The other train consisted of four passenger coaches and a combination car , all well filled . At the time of the collision the Manhattan train was running at the rate of nearly 35 miles per hour . The two engines were jammed together in a mass and were badly wrecked . The front platform of the parlor car on the Manhattan Beach train was lifted up and thrown backward into the car , while the car itself was telescoped at the rear end by the car behind it . Many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hissing of steam in the air-brakes , succeeded in escaping before the crash . Thomas Burnett , of No. 108 East Ilonston-street , bar-keeper of the Turf Club , was a passenger in the parlor car , and was sitting near the rear . When the platform of the following car crashed through he was caught In the wreck and one of his legs was crushed . life was extricated as quickly as possible , but died in a very few minutes . Robert M. Smith , of No. 186 East Eightieth-street , was in the same car . Both of his legs were completely crushed and death ensued immediately . The greatest excitement prevailed and hundreds of people crowded to the scene of the collision . Dr. W. R. Pryor , a son of Gen. Roger A. Pryor , of No. 107 East Thirty-fifth-street , was in the train . He received severe bruises from the accident , but at once set about aiding the injured . Many of them were able to walk to their homes . Two were brought to Bellevue Hospital , in this City . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of No. 1,702 Locust-street , Philadelphia , who bad been visiting friends in this city , where he was staving at the St. James Hotel with his mother , had his legs crushed . The limbs were amputated at Bellevue Hospital , but Morris died at midnight . The other ; John Prato , will probably recover . Coroner Robinson and Judges ravanagh and Delehanty , of Long Island City , were on the Manhattan Beach train returning from the races at Sheepsbead Bay . They were much shaken up , but were not injured . As soon as the Coroner had extricated himself from the wreck he took charge of the dead and busied himself in assisting the injured . There were several theories advanced as to the cause of the accident . The one most generally accepted by the train men about the station at Long Island City was that the air brakes on the Manhattan Beach train were out of order . Superintendent Barton , of the Long Island Railroad , however , in speaking of the accident , said to a Thine reporter : " The danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train goes out . It was displayed to-night as usual The Manhattan Beach train , which is supposed to stop at the switch and wait for the danger signal , came forward without waiting to see that the coast was clear . The result has been that two men are killed and a number have been mangled. 1 . do n't know how many have been hurt , but I know that several hare been injured in the collision . The air-brakes were out of order , and that was the cause of the accident . If the brakes had been all right nobody would have been killed and nobody would have been injured . I understand from the engineer of the Manhattan Beach : train that be discovered the defect in the air brakes this afternoon , and that he knew then that the train could not be stopped at short notice . It was the duty of the engineer to notify the office of this fact , but engineers do not always do their duty . He probably thought he could carry his train through all right . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the terrible accident which has occurred . The Long Island Railroad is willing to pay for all the injury which has happened to anybody on the line . It can do no more , and it could do no less . We only ask in common fairness that the responsibility of this accident snail not be placed upon us. ? E. T. , private detective of the Long Island Railroad at Hunter 's Point , gives the following additional particulars : Both trains were somewhat behind time . The North Shore Railroad train that starts at 6:36 o'clock bad just left the station and was going out of the yard with four cars well filled with passengers . The : Manhattan Beach train left Sheepsheed Bay with seven closed cars and one parlor car , that was next to the engine . When it arrived at Montauk Junction its engineer , Thomas Glenn , did not notice the danger signal or red light which warned him against coming through . The engineer of the North Shore train tried to stop his engine , but the next moment the two trains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top of the other . The parlor car of the Manhattan Beach train was telescoped half througb , and the passengers were caught between the seats and the car that had run into it . Robert Smith , who was in the parlor ear , got his legs entangled in the wreck and crushed . When aid came Smith was found to be so firmly wedged that Dr. Pryor was obliged to amputate both legs to get him out , while supported him . In a little while after he died in Mr. 's arms . Mr. Burnett 's leg was also crushed and had to be amputated . His sufferings were terrible and the Rev. Father , priest of St. Joseph 's Roman Catholic Church of Long Island City , was hastily summoned , and administered to the dying man absolution and the last rites . In a little while Smith , too , died . The drum of the engine of the North Shore train was broken , while the engine of Manhattan Beach train was badly smashed and the tank of the tender was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Manhattan Beach train , jumped off just before the collision and sprained his ankle . At 11:20 o'clock Coroner Robinson arrested him at his residence at M. 35 Greenpointavenue . He said to the Coroner that after he left l3lissville he found that the air-brakes were not working . He whistled down brakes , but the brakemen did not pay any attention . Before reaching the junction he saw the danger signal , and whistled down brakes for the third time . Glenn added that if the cars of his train had been open instead of closed cars there would have been " hell to pay . " Coroner Robinson , of Long Island City , was given notice of the disaster , and the bowies of the dead were taken to the Morgue . A Coroner 's jury was summoned , consisting of Peter Semmler , Augustus Autenreith , George Pierce , G. F. Van Riper . F. S. Snedeker , James R. ** John Theobold , Robert Marshall , and Sylvester Gray . The inquest will be held Friday evening at 8 o'clock ..
