txt Although some of our rail way trains attain a high degree of speed the average rate of speed in this country is lower than it is in England . This is partly due to the inferiority of the roadbed and the sharpness and frequency of curves , but on our best-roads the trains are handicapped by the heavy Pullman cars . On some of the fastest American trains the Pullman car is used exclusively . . It is enormously heavy , and it carries few passengers in comparison with its size and weight . As a rule the Pullman car carries only from 30 to 35 passengers . It occupies about as much space in the train as would be occupied by three English firstclass carriages , having a seating capacity in the aggregate for 72 passengers , while the weight of the three carriages when fully occupied would be not much , if any , greater than that of the loaded Pullman car . If , then , we carry 200 passengers on a train of Pullman cars we compel the engine to drag a load @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same number of passengers . The Pullman car is , of course , much more comfortable than the English carriages , and since it has been introduced into England it has become immensely popular . No one would propose to supersede it here by cars of the English pattern , but there is no doubt that with the latter our trains would attain a higher rate of ' speed than they now attain and at a much smaller cost .
