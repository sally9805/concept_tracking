THE fears that were felt when the doctrine of evolution was first offered to the world were not unnatural nor derogatory to the dignity of earnest minds . When a new and revolutionary doctrine involving the nature , the action , and the destiny of humanity is proposed , there is an intuitive wisdom or instinct of selfpreservation in man that prompts him to turn on it with resentment and denial . Truth is man 's chief heritage ; it is his life , and is to be guarded as his life . If lost , he knows that it can not easily be regained . It is like the golden image of Vishnu that the Hindu was taking to his home from the sacred city : if once laid upon the ground , it could not be taken up again . The keeping of truth is not intrusted merely to our reason , but to our whole nature ; every faculty and sentiment , down even to fear and pride , may properly be used in the defense of it . Reason may at last decide what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consent of the whole man . The period between the exchange of theories is one in which human nature does not appear in its nobler guise , but a profound analysis shows that it is acting with subtle , unconscious wisdom . It is better also in the end that a doctrine which is to become truth should run the gauntlet of general denial and opposition . By far the greater part of what is proposed as true in every department turns out to be false . Theories more in number than the wasted blossoms of the May fall fruitless to the ground . If human nature as a whole did not turn on the conceits and dreams that are offered to it , truth itself would have no chance ; it could not extricate itself from the rubbish of folly that overtolerance hassuffered to accumulate . Truth becomes truth by its own achievement ; it must conquer human nature before it can rule it ,  --  win it before it can be loved of it . This wise spontaneous treatment ofnew theories delays their acceptance even when proved true , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair the final form is to be , it comes unshaped and with entanglements , and often , like some animals , it is born blind . Its first need is criticism , and even criticism based on denial rather than on inquiry ; only it must be criticism , and not blank cdntradiction . The advent of the doctrine of evolution is an illustration of these wise and wholesome processes . When it was first proposed in scientific form - more than a hundred years ago - it was justly tossed aside in scorn , as too crude and naked for presentation in the world of thought . Its revival within the latter half of the century provoked a similar storm of disdain and denial ; but it kept its feet , bore its opposition bravely , and now may be said to have won a position ,  --  but by no means in the same form in which it first appeared . The evolution that is now gaining general acceptance is very different from the evolution propounded twenty years ago . Then it claimed and defined its place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusion of philosophy andreligion . But to-day its place and limits are defined by philosophy , and instead of having the universe as its exclusive domain , it has only a section of it which it holds as the gift , and as still under the supremacy , of philosophy . Having at last become presentable to the world of thought and grown shapely and yielded to limitations , it is winning the suffrage of the world and assuming its place in the hierarchy of truth that ministers to humanity . Definition and distinction will be made farther on , but some theory properly known as evolution may now be considered as established and as ready to enter into the practical thought of the world . It may be said that evolution is not yet proved ; that it will be soon enough to adjust our faith to it when it has ceased to be a hypothesis and become a full-established theory . The line between hypothesis and theory is seldom defined ; it is not a line , but a region . There is much in the doctrine of evolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astronomy . But we have sailed far enough in this voyage of search after the creative method to warrant the belief that we draw nigh to the land of our quest . The sea-weed of the shore drifts by on the tide , the odors of spicy groves float on the wind , the birds come and go as from a near home , the dim outline in the horizon is changing from cloud to solid land . The quest is practically ended , and now that we are so near as to catch the ominous thunder of the surf , it is wiser to look out for harbor and anchorage than run the risk of breakers ; for evolution , like the coast of all knowledge , is lined by destructive rocks , and also by inlets that run within where safe possession may be taken . In accepting evolution , it is well to remember that we make no greater change than has several times been made in all the leading departments of human knowledge . In sociology the despotic idea yielded to the monar See " Immortality and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE CENTURY for May , i885. // the democratic idea . In philosophy the deductive method has yielded to the inductive . In religion the priestly idea is yielding to the ministerial . So in accepting evolution as the general method of creation in place of that which has prevailed , we only repeat the history of the exchange of the Ptolemaic system for the Copernican , and of tho new theories of astronomy and geology that forced us to redate the age of the world and of man 's life upon it . The wrench to faith and the apparent violation of experience are different , but no more violent than were those of the past . The present incompleteness of evolution has its analogy in the Copernican system , which waited long for the additions of Kepler and Newton ; and geology is still an unfinished story . Nor are we justified in withholding our assent to evolution because we can not each one for ourselves verify its proofs . The vast majority of men could not now verify the Copernican system ; it has not even won recognition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sets , " and will so be spoken of while men watch its apparent motion . Evolution is an induction from many sciences ,  - -  chemistry , astronomy , mathematics , geology , botany , biology ,  --  and it is impossible that any but the special student should critically make the induction . But the Copernican system was an induction from mathematics , and even from those higher forms of it that ordinary men never have traced . Its acceptance was , and is still , an act of faith . Belief in evolution should be easier because it is confirmed by several sciences working on independent lines . It is not the biologist alone who proposes evolution , but the astronomer , the chemist , the geologist , the botanist , and the sociologist . I can not examine and test their processes , but I can trust their conclusions . I do not , however , thus make myself the slave of their opinions , for these opinions run off into other fields where I may be as good a judge as they . I may represent a science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authoritative . Hence , in accepting evolution as a probably true history or theory of the method of creation , we do not necessarily yield to all the assumptions and inferences that are often associated with it . It is not above criticism . Like the germ-seeds of which science treats , each one of which threatens to possess the whole earth , and would do so if not checked by other growths , so evolution - shall we say through affinity with its chief theme ? - threatens to take possession of the universe . But its myriad thistledown , blown far and wide by every breeze , meets at last the groves of oak and pine that limit and de 109 fine its spread . All about these various sciences stands the greater science - philosophy - under which they are included , from which they draw their life , and to which they must bow . Evolution is to be feared not in its bare doctrine of development , but in the scope and relations assigned to it . If it be regarded as universal instead of general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all things , it is fatal to morals and religion . If it be regarded as supreme , it gives its own law of necessity to all else . But if it is subordinate to philosophy7 if it is considered as under thought-relations , . if it is held as finite and relative , it carries not danger to morals or religion or faith . It maypossibly modify but it can not overthrow them7 simply because they stand in a larger order . But evolution is not to be accepted in a simply negative way , because it can no longer be resisted . We are under no obligation to accept any truth until it is serviceable . It is possible to conceive of truths that would be of no value to men ,  --  such as the constitution of other orders of beings ; if made known , it might be passed by . But evolution , prZperly regarded , is becoming tributary to society , and seems destined to clarify its knowledge , to enlarge and deepen its convictions , to set it upon true lines of action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the important services it has begun to render is that it is removing a certain empirical thread that has been interwoven with previous theories of creation . The unity of creation has never been seriously denied except by extreme thinkers of the dualistic school . But the principle of unity has not been recognized until of late . The bond or ground of unity was justly found in God , but that conception merely asserted that because God is one there is unity in all created things . This may be faith , but it is not philosophy . May not faith become also philosophy ? Unity exists not only because one God created all things , but because He works by one process , or according to one principle . As knowledge broadens and wider generalizations are made , we find a certain likeness of process in all realms that indicates one law or method ; namely , that of development or evolution . One thing comes from another , assumes a higher and finer form , and presses steadily on towards still finer and higher forms . We find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in humanity , in social institutions , in government , in religions , in the progress of Christianity . Let not this thought disturb us . Do we not see that otherwise the universe could have no unity ? If God worked on one principle in the material realm , on another in the vital , on another in the social , governmental , // and moral realm , there would not be a proper universe . These realms might indeed be regulated and kept from conflict , but they would break up the universe into parts separated by chasms , render knowledge difficult , vain , and disjointed , and create a certain antagonism opposite to the nature of mind . Man would be correlated not to a universe , but to separate systems and orders , and these varied correlations would have no underlying unity . It would be difficult to prove the unity of God as against a harmonious polytheism or sovereign Jove . We might believe in one God , but we could not prove our faith . If matter has one principle in its process , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as many gods ? It has not been easy to keep dualism out of philosophy . But , with one principle or method in all realms , we have a key that turns all the wards of the universe , opens all its doors in the past , and will open all in time to come . Knowledge becomes possible and harmonious ; a path opens everywhere ; the emphasis of the whole universe is thus laid on the unity of God . And when we find not only one method or principle , but the direction of its action , we obtain a prophecy and assurance of the final result of creation that falls in with the highest hopes of Christianity ; for the process tends steadily towards the moral . The Church has hoped and striven for a righteousness that shall fill the earth . It may need only its faith to animate and guide it , but it is not amiss to lay its ear upon the earth , and hear , if it can , the same word . It is not amiss to see men in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using first a club and then a bow , ores and then metals , nomadic and then in villages . It is not unhelpful to the hope of mankind to see despotism yielding to a class , and the class yielding to the people ; personal revenge passing into social punishment of crin4* by law , and justice slowly creeping to higlYer forms ; penalty first as vindictive , then retributive , and now at last reformatory ; first a conception of God as power , then as justice , and finally as love . These evolutionary processes may be woven into the cord by which the Church binds itself to its mighty purpose . It thus secures a broader base for the generalization of its working truths ; for the pyramid will not pierce heaven unless it rests upon the whole earth . No truth is perfect that is cut off from other truths . Evolution not only perfects our conception of the unity of God , but it strengthens the argument from design by which his goodness is proved . This argument may be based on the course of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or on the working of love . Paley 's argument , as Bishop Temple has well shown , stands , with slight modifications , on as strong a basis as ever . But if we can look at the universe both as a whole and in all its processes and in all ages , and find one principle working everywhere , binding together all things , linking one process to another with increasing purpose and steadily pressing towards a full revel4ion of God 's goodness , we find the argument strengthened by as much as we have enlarged the field of its illustration . But if one part of the universe is abruptly shut off from another , if no stronger bond of unity be assigned to it than that of creative energy , and only the near-lying fields of design are used , then the argument is abridged and may even fall short of an absolute conclusion . It is felt by some , especially on the first contact with evolution , that it puts God at a distance and hides him behind the laws and processes of nature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a near God , and may well dispute any theory that puts him at a distance or fences him off by impenetrable walls . The universal and unappeasable cravings of the heart may always be opposed to what seem to be the laws of nature ; for there is a science of the spirit that is as imperative and final in its word as the observed processes of nature . But evolution , properly considered , not only does not put God at a distance , nor obscure his form behind the order of nature , but draws him nearer , and even goes far towards breaking down the walls of mystery that shut him out from human vision . In other words , in evolution we see a revela ( ion of God , while in previous theories of creation we had only an assertion of God . In evolution we have the first cause working by connected processes in an orderly way ; in former theories we had a first cause creating the universe by one omnipotent fiat , ordaining its laws , and then leaving it to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect of nearness , we at once see that evolution brings God nearer than do the other theories . Their hold upon the mind is not at this point , but at another mistaken for it . The religious mind delights in mystery ; it is an unconscious assertion by the highest faculties of our nature that we transcend the knowable - that we belong to , and live and have our destiny in , the infinite . Hence we shrink from theories that seem to undertake to explain God and his working , and repeat with complacence the ancient phrase , " It is impossible ; therefore , I believe . " It gratifies our reverence to abuse our reason . There is in all this a thread of truth , but the fine thread of reverence is not cut nor drawn out of the web of faith by transferring the mystery of creation from a point // of time and space beyond creation and putting it continuously into the processes of creation . Mystery enough there is and always will be , and God 's ways will never become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light of the common day . " Instead , this drawing God down and into the processes of creation as a constant and all pervasive factor , deepens the sense of mystery and awe when we have turned our eyes in that direction . The poet plucks a flower out of the crannied wall , holds it in his hand , and says : " Little flower - but if I could understand What you are , root and all , and all in all , I should know what God and man is . " In these simple lines we have an expression of the true ground of that form of reverence which is bred by mystery . It is not wonder at primal creation that moves the poet , but the creating power lodged and at work in every roadside flower . Goethe puts the same thought into statelier lines : " No ! 53uch a God my worship may not win Who lets the world about His finger spin A thing extern ; my God must rule within , And whom I own for Father , God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature ; And in His kindly arms embraced , the whole Doth live and move by His pervading soul . " Milton built his great epic of creation upon an original creative fiat , but his conception is like his cosmology , traditional and unshaped by poetic insight . The greatest poet in these later centuries , he still lacked the highest of poetic qualities - sympathetic insight into nature . Tennyson in his one line , " Closer is He than breathing , and nearer than hands and feet , " betrays a truer sense of God in creation than is to be found in " Paradise Lost . " It is true that a change in our conception of creation requires a readjustment of our feelings of reverence ; and in the transition there may be danger of losing it altogether . It is always easier to change our beliefs than our feelings , and the mind more readily accommodates itself to necessary changes than do the sensibilities . But , whatever the danger and cost , such changes must be made , and in the end there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lets in more sunshine , and light does the work of darkness , but soon all things are seen more clearly . It can not be said that , as yet , the conception of creation by evolution touches the mind so deeply and reverently as the former conception . We are still occupied by the details and by the wonder of the truth , and have not connected it with its relations , nor learned to think and feel under it . When a meteor falls to earth , men at first take more heed of its shape and composition than of its origin . It will be found that as we live on under the great truth and discern increasingly its wisdom and harmony , the old sense of reverence will come back to us and become a finer , deeper , intenser feeling than it was under the old conception of creation . It will also be a more intelligent and better-proportioned reverence . It may be questioned if the reverence excited by the bare fact of creation has any great value . That God created the universe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but a valuable reverence is to be drawn from the later phases and outcome of creation rather than from its beginning and its earlier stages . The first active law in creation of which we know is that of gravitation , but no moral feeling is awakened by the fact that matter attracts inversely to*the square of distance . The condition of the world as it first took spherical shape could only be regarded with horror , and animal life in the paleozoic ages repels us by its amorphous shapes ; nor is it pleasant to picture our not very remote ancestors . Reverence is not to be stirred by that part of creation which is behind us , but by creation as a whole , and by its end . It is only under a theory of evolutionary creation that we can truly wonder and adore God . Otherwise , how shall we think , how feel , before the Power that created those long orders of beings that simply ravened and devoured one another ? If those orders were created independently , if they are not necessary links @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creation can not be rationally reconciled with any worthy conception of God . But seen as transient forms in an evergrowing process , thrust aside and buried under Devonian strata , and yielding to more shapely and complex orders , and so climbing by an ever-finer transition to some final and perfect end , we not only can tolerate them in thought , but adore the directing Power and delight in his method . But the feeling of reverence only possesses us as we discern the creative process issuing in man as a moral being . Were creation cut short at man as a physical being , there would be nothing in it to command our reverence , as there would be nothing to satisfy our reason . Nor should it disturb us to find that our moral qualities have their first intimations in the brute world ; that we find in the higher animals hints , forecastings of moral faculty and actions ; that as our bodies bear some organic relation to the brutes , so also may our minds . Body is not mind , but they are organi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter is conditional on the former . So man is not a brute , but he is organically related to the brute , and the relation may touch his whole nature . Our feeling on this point should be determined not by the first look , but by its final bearing . If it invalidated our moral faculties , or robbed them of their dignity , or made them less imperative , or separated them in any degree from God , we should be justified in rejecting the theory on the simple ground that these faculties constitute a science in themselves , as commanding and real as physical science . To disown mind before matter is stultification . But there is no such alternative . A relation of the moral faculties to brute qualities may exist without impairing the divineness of conscience and reverence and love . But whatever our feeling , we can not ignore the fact that in the brute world there are intimations or semblances of moral faculties ; nor need we hesitate to say that they are united by the secret cord of the creative energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says that it is brought about by natural forces ; the philosopher may grant it , but adds that it is brought about by an intelligent force working freely and progressively , and therefore possibly by increments . Moral qualities are not found in the brutes , but there are the grounds of them  --  the stufl so to speak , out of which they are constituted , though not the essence that gives them their particular nature . Their presence there is only an indication that the moral is in the mind and purpose of God , even so far back as in the brute world  --  a foregleam of the approaching issue . They show the divine purpose to crowd in the moral as soon and as fast as possible , prophesying it long before it can appear , impatient , as it were , with the dull processes behind , and pressing on with yearning speed towards his moral image . We have spoken altogether too long of the brutes with contempt- as though they had nothing of God in them , and were wholly alien to ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is organically linked with the brooding care of a brute for her young , nor of self-sacrifice that it is so related to a lioness dying for her whelps , nor of fidelity that it is akin to that of a dog dying for his master . They are not identical , but they are related : they spring from one root , but they reach forth to different issues ; they have one motive in common , but in man they have also other motives and other relations . The rudimentary forms of moral qualities in the brute world simply show that the moral element and purpose is present in the entire creative process . For it was not power that brooded over the elements at the beginning , but love ; and the laws of nature are not the cold formulae of mathematics , but are laws of righteousness and truth . In the most absolute sense these laws are holy , and when they begin to work in the higher brutes , they must by their very nature assume a moral aspect or semblance ; it can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms , is so dependent upon the moral , or what is practically moral , that it can not be maintained without it . There could be no gregariousness in the animal world without the action of principles that are essential to morality . It is no impeachment of the dignity or value or imperativeness of a moral faculty , that it has come about by growth and differentiation . Indeed , it may stand all the firmer if its root reaches through all grades of life , and strikes down to the center of the earth . If I can trace my moral qualities throughout the universe , I certainly will not respect them less than if I found them only in some corner of it . We are on false lines of thought when we try to divide creation ; more and more does it appear to be an indivisible thing bound together by some mysterious , internal bond of unity . It does not follow that because a moral faculty is brought to full appearance by a combination of qualities or feelings , it has its origin or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it contains no more than is formed in them . A combination of two things that produces an effect that neither could produce alone , implies more than is to be found in the two things : there is the idea or the Aroportion of the combination upon which the effect depends ; and this must come from some mind that ordained the proportion , and not from the things themselves . An acid and a base when mingled precipitate a salt , but they are not the authors of the salt ; the law of the relation between the acid and the base is the author . The whole process may be set down in mathematical terms , but all the more is it evident that the product originates in the mathematical thought underlying it . The same maybe true of the moral faculties ; they may appear as the results of brute qualities through long growth and differentiation , but they are not on that account to be regarded as the product of brute qualities , but of the law under which they have come about . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though their history may lie in them , they do not become moral except as they cease to be brute qualities . A flower is a flower only by refusing to be a leaf , though it comes about by differentiation from a leaf . So conscience or reverence may have come // about by evolution through brute qualities , but they become themselves only by ceasing to be what they were . They get their real and essential nature from the mind that is behind - in , curn c/ sub  --  the whole process . If the conclusion disturbs us , if we shrink from linking our nobler faculties with preceding orders , it is because we have as yet no proper conception of the close and interior relation of God to all his works ; nor do we stop to see that our attempts to separate ourselves from the previous creation are reflections upon God 's handiwork . Much of the talk upon the theme has a Pharisaic taint . Let us be thankful for existence , however it came about , and let us not deem ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one God . The fact that man may be organically related to the material and brute world does not in itself determine either his nature or his destiny . So long as he is what he is , it does not matter what his history has been , though it may be a matter of consequence how - by what agency - he is differentiated from the brute . But the bare fact of his development from lower nature is not itself a fact that determines anything . It is a hasty and imperfect logic that conjures dark visions out of the relation , and reasons that if man is developed from the brutes he will share their fate . Origin has nothing to do with destiny ; we can measure one as little as the other , and we know too little of either to use them as terms of close argument . I may be bound to physical and brute nature by the cord of origin , but that cord does not bind my destiny . A bird might be tied to the earth by a thread of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it might fly forever into the heavens and away from its source . It is an unreasonable contempt of lower nature that makes us fear it . As we find God in destiny , so we may find him in origin - present at both ends of his own process and in equal power . Indeed , our chances destiny-wise may be all the better because we are thoroughly interwoven with the whole creation . It is possible that we must be organically connected with the previous creation in order to share in the eternal order before us ; that only thus can we be included in the circle of endless existence . If man is a sporadic and unrelated creation , his destiny hangs upon the arbitrary will that so created him , and gets no promise or assurance from the great order of the universe and its Creator . Nor need we be disturbed by the claim of an organic relation between the various orders of existence , lest no place be found for the truths and doctrines of religion . This has been the chief ground of alarm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , this eduction of one phase from another by a natural process , seems to many to shut off the possibility of a revelation , of miracle , of an incarnation , of moral action , of immortality . It seems easier to defend these truths when a creative chasm , so to speak , has been placed between man and the rest of creation ; man is more easily handled as a moral and spiritual being when he is treated as an independent creation . It has been feared that if such a chasm were not insisted on , man as a moral being would fall under the laws of the previous creation , and be swamped in necessity , and swallowed up in the general destruction of the previous orders ; that so unique a fact as the incarnation could have no justification ; that miracle could not be defended in the presence of hitherto universal law ; that moral . action could not be discriminated from the instinctive action of the brutes , whose action in turn could not be discriminated from the chemic and dynamic action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind and spirit . I grant that these fears would be well grounded if certain theories of evolution were to be accepted as settled - such as the theory that matter has within itself the potentiality of all terrestrial life , and goes on in its development alone and by its own energy ; a theory that may stand for the various mechanical and atomic doctrines that deify force and dispense with cause . But this theory is now an outcast in the world of thought , and is branded with rejection by every science that uses thought , for the simple reason that it is a theory that renders thought impossible . These fears would also be well grounded if the theory were established that what is called force or the forces were invariable - never more nor less ; that they worked only by transmutation and within the original limits ; that force itself is an entity . This theory also has no tenable place in philosophy . What is calledforce is the method of the action of a cause , and is not a self-acting entity . Force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say of any inanimate thing that it is a force ; it may transmit force , but only as it has first received it . Force can not be conceived except as proceeding from a will ; nor can it be observed except as acting under a thought-relation - that is , intelligently towards an end by design . Nor is it the invariable and eternal thing it is claimed to be . Matter existed - logically if not otherwise - before force , and must therefore have received its force from some source or reservoir ; and as it works in thought-relations it must have come from an intelligent source that cherishes a design . The // claim that force is invariable because it is so observed is fallacious , simply because observation is limited . In the morning we see the sun go up , and till noon we might say that it will go up forever , but night reverses our observation . It would have been necessary to be present when the foundations of the earth were laid , to be able to say that as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not an addition of a force . Indeed , when the origin of force is considered , we need not think of it as forever exactly so much and no more , but only as the steady pressure of the Eternal hand upon matter , working uniformly indeed because there is an affinity between force and steadiness , and a Divine wisdom in uniformity ; but we are under no compulsion either of reason or of observation to assert that this force is without variation . Force begins - where we know not till we postulate God ; and it ends - how and where it goes we know not . That it is without play , that it may not be rhythmic and so analogous to the divinest of arts , that it is worked by necessity and not by freedom , is an assumption that is contradicted by every conscious act of the human will . A system that works by law or apparent necessity towards will or freedom as an end , must be grounded in freedom . In the early orders of creation , the Divine hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it ran along the grooves of changing matter ; but when a brute , seeing an enemy in one path , chooses another , there is a hint at least of self-generated force . And it is idle to say that the changes wrought by man on the face of the earth are not the products of his creative will . These phantoms of necessity , of materialized virtues , of instinctive morality , need no longer disturb us ; they are vanishing before the growing light of reason . It is not the better way to assail them with indignant denial ; our fierce weapons cleave them through , but they stand , like Miltonic devils , as before . Nor can we exorcise them by the magic of faith ; they thus cease to frighten us , but they are not dispelled . The light only will drive them to their caves , and the light is growing . When evolution is regarded , not as a selfworking engine ,  --  an inexorable and unsupervised system , a mysterious section of creation assumed to be the whole , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods of God 's action , and whose force is the steady play of Eternal will throughout matter , there need be no fear lest man and religion be swallowed up in matter and brute life . In other words , man is not correlated to the process of creation , but to the Creator . Man may bear a certain relation to the process , but his real and absolute relation is to the power over and in the process . We may have come to be what we are through a process of development ; much of it may linger on in us ; some of its laws still play within us : we eat and procreate as do the brutes ; chemical action builds up and takes down our bodies ; analogies of its processes reappear in us : evil to be put away , good to be perfected . But we are cut off from our previous history quite as much as we are bound to it , because , the whole process being one of design and man being its fulfillment , ht* drops away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruit when it is ripe is no longer related to the branch but to its use ; it no longer belongs to the tree but to him who planted the tree , and he will use it as seems to him fit . It may be set down as an axiom that the end of a process can not be iden 4fted with theprocess . Man is the final and perfect fruit of creation and belongs to whatever has the best claim upon him - to morals , if he is found chiefly to belong there . However he came about , out of whatever depths of seeming necessity he has been drawn , he has freedom , consciousness , moral sense , personality . He can obey and disobey , love and hate , do right and wrong . These powers may engender a history that requires all that religion demands - even to a doctrine of the fall , if any care to insist upon it . There is no scientific reason to be ascribed against the theory that when a free agent finds himself crowned with moral sovereignty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it , puts his crown under his brutish feet and not on his godlike brow . His past may follow him as a *temptation , a deceiving serpent ; his future may stand before him as duty upborne by a hope ; he may at first drop back towards his past and not hold himself steady to duty . And as in creation the chemic needed more of God in order to become organic , and as the organic needed more of God than could be found in the chemic in order to become vital and conscious , so man may need God in all his fullness and in the perfection of his manifestation in order to become perfectly man . Hence a revelation ; hence the incarnation . If the whole progressive creation is a progressive revelation of God , when its process culminates and ends in man , it is the very thing we might expect ; namely , that there should be a full and perfect manifestation of God in the form and with the powers needed to lift humanity up to , the level of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man has been drawn out of the processes of matter and brought to the verge of the moral and spiritual world , is that he should be provided with a moral and spiritual environment for feeding and protecting his moral nature . However E VOL UTION AND THE FAITH . // else Christianity may be defined , it is the moral environment of humanity - the bread of its life . Without it the fulfillment and completion of man 's destiny as a spiritual being could not be secured . He may have all spiritual faculty within him , but he lacks environment : the spiritual world must be opened to him , it must infold him ; and this is done in a real way and by an actual process in the Christian facts . If it should appear that these facts and the theory of evolution were incompatible , and the question were raised which must be given up , the answer would be- hold on to the moral and spiritual claim , and let the scientific theory go ; for the simple reason that the moral facts involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical science . The unknowable thing is matter . It is often said that theories of religion can not stand up against ascertained knowledge . Doubtless , for nothing can stand up against the truth . But the real question is , what is ascertained knowledge ? There is a solidity , a certainty in moral truth that can not be claimed for the verdicts of physical science , because moral truth is the direct assertion of personal identity , which is the only thing that we absolutely know ; but matter- who can tell us what it is , or trace our relation to it beyond uniformity of impression ? Morals are absolute ; man knows them because he knows himself and he can know nothing opposed to them ; but physical science is the merest kaleidoscope-turn the tube and you see a new picture . The surest and most universal law in the material world is that of gravitation , but it is unique ; it contradicts other laws , and is so mysterious that it can hardly be included in science . As for all else , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another , and change our definitions accordingly . The world of mind and morals is not only the authoritative world , but it gives the law to science ; the thought of a law of nature goes before the process of the law and determines it . To set physical science and its ascertained knowledge against mental and moral truth is like a shadow turning against the light , or like a flower contradicting the root . It is *nly by mind that we know matter , and to use a product for discrediting its source is absurd . Science is all the while solving physical mysteries , not by bringing them within its present terms , but by enlarging its boundaries . There are still many mysteries that sit in the clouds and laugh at our science with its doctrines of force and environment , and there they are likely to remain till science can infold them within a larger circle . The key to the whole subject is a broader generalization ; think far and wide and high , enlarge your science , and perplexity will vanish . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contains a solution of the questions that put religion in apparent conflict with evolution and its laws . The main fact in evolution is force working uniformly ; but evolution does not explain force ; it receives it from some will , which is its only possible origin . But will is an attribute of personality , and is the basis and a large part of religion . We have , therefore , in religion an original factor which is found in the process of evolution - not as an essential element , but simply as a method of operation . Religion , therefore , is not compassed by the evolutionary process and laws , but is directly related to the eternal will that imparts its force to the process of evolution . In other words , religion is not correlated to a method of force , but to force itself , i. e. , to the eternal will . Religion therefore stands in freedom , for will is free . Nature seems to be under apparent necessity , but only apparent because of the uniformity of its action , behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were under a different sense of time , a woodsman felling a tree would seem to be acting under necessity , so uniform and sustained are his strokes ; he can stop at any moment , but his purpose keeps his action constant for an hour , which might seem an reon to a differently constituted being . But if man is involved in the evolutionary process , where and when and how does the free will come in , with all the facts and duties of religion ? We may not be able to say when and where , but possibly we can tell how , viz. , in the progressive working of God . To produce a will or a person seems to be the end in view of the whole process , and at last it is gained . It is often said that freedom can not come out of necessity , nor altruism out of egoism ; doubtless , if necessity and egoism are absolute , and not phases of a process . The very uniformity of force may be a condition of the result - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The difficulty of getting from one to the other is no greater than in passing from the chemical to the vital . But when the result is reached , the conditions under which it was produced may be relaxed . And so we have man - a free will , himself a force acting in creative ways . If it be asked where he gets his free will , the answer is , from the same source from which matter gets its force - God . He may get it liz rough nature , but he gets it from God working by nature . Hence , when we come to dis // cuss the problems of religion ,  --  duty , conscience , faith , prayer , reverence , love ,  --  we are at full liberty , if we see fit , to turn our back upon that uniformity of nature which is called a law . Man stands before the Eternal One , and not before a method of nature . Nature is all about him , but his real relation is to God . His moral qualities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not originate there . The flower is evolved through the differentiation of leaves , but it does not originate in them , nor can it be compassed in their differentiation . Not only is science unable to explain the why of the differentiation , but it is still less able to give any account of the idea of the flower . It may possibly learn to penetrate the process by which leaves become flowers , but it must go to other schools than its own to get the idea of the flower as a germ of life and fruit and seed . I have endeavored to show that the influence of evolution upon the faith turns upon the form or definition of the theory . If evolution be held as simply a mechanical process ; if force be regarded as an independent thing , or be blankly named as proceeding from an unknowable cause ; if an observed section of the universe in time and space be considered as the whole ; if an acknowledged essential factor be left out of account because it seems to be unknowable ; if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . necessity ; if the laws seen in the earlier periods of creation be regarded as universal and incapable of yielding to other possible laws and forces ; if , in brief , there is not a Power before , under , and in all these natural laws and processes , inclusive of them ,  --  a Power working intelligently towards an end , and therefore progressively , and therefore in ways that seem new and even antagonistic to previous methods ,  --  then evolution is dangerous to the faith . It is , of course , illogical to assert that because such theories are dangerous they are untrue  --  the standing argument of bigotry and ignorance . The path of truth always winds through dangers - abysses below and crumbling cliffs above . We base our protest against these theories on the ground that the logic and the science of the subject are against them . In that court of reason to which men in all ages have repaired for final verdicts  --  a court not of mere sensations , but of the combined faculties and whole nature of man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all the passions of human nature , stern logic , mathematics , and universal knowledge are the judges - no verdict for these theories can be found . It can be secured only in a specific school of philosophy known as positivism - a philosophy that postulates reason and then uses it to discredit it - a philosophy of the senses that plays in a pool within the sand-bar , with no eye for the ocean beyond . I would not speak disrespectfully of this school nqr of their methods , but I deny their claim to a philosophy . They are useful in their way , and their method is a wise check upon other and better schools of thought . They are good sentries about the castle of truth , quick to descry and drive off the prowling theosophies and demiurgisms that swarm in from the limbo of unreason and wild imagination ; wise , instinctive geese that cackle loudly when Rome is endangered ; good beacons that warn against the reefs and shallow waters of half-way thought and imperfect knowledge ; but they are not philosophers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If logically held , it runs into pessimism , where it meets its end , for mankind can not long be induced to think ill of itself . It is enough to say of it here that it is narrow ; it does not cover the facts of its own field ; it ignores factors that are beyond the limits it has imposed upon itself , and denies the reality of phenomena that may be referred to those factors ; it attempts to measure the universe by a rod no longer than the eye can see , and by mathematical laws with total disregard of the thought in these laws . The conflict of the faith is not with the science of evolution , but with the school of thought that claims to be its exponent - a claim , however , that we can with ill grace resist so long as we spend our time in casting theological stones at evolution . It is time to remember that evolution is the exclusive property of no one school of thought ; least of all can it be compassed by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for existence , natural selection , and variation by environment-a process which , if taken by itself has more of chance in it than order , and hence is exclusive of a definite end . Evolution may embrace these methods , but it is not only not defined by them , but they do not contain its secret . The few principles that have guided and determined the thought of all ages in respect to creation , and , we venture to say , will guide and determine it in all ages to come , are these : A cause must be assumed as soon as an effect is observed ; force can not originate itself and must proceed from a self-acting agent ; a law in action , as in gravitation or crystallization , must be preceded by a thought of the law , and hence the priority of mind ; forces working towards an end in a complex and orderly way presuppose a mind and force ordaining the order and the end . These are the granitic foundations underlying evolutionary creation , and they can no more be overlooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refer them to an unknowable cause may possibly be correct if we know only what our five senses tell us ; if " All we have power to see is a straight staff bent in a pool . " But to think in this way is to deliberately build a wall around ourselves and then assert that we know nothing of the outside ; it is to deny cause and effect , by resolutely ignoring cause , and dwelling only on effects under the plea that the senses give us only effects and say nothing of cause . The human mind refuses to think in this way , and it disdains to be regarded as a Cerberus that can be appeased by morsels of empty phrase flung to it under the stress of logical demand . The human mind is patient with truth-seekers , but it will not tolerate a philosophy which asserts that because a straight staff seems bent in a pool , it is actually crooked . Turning from this philosophy in search of one more consonant with reason , we do not expect to reach the mystery of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along which we can travel even though it be forever - an " endless quest , " but still one that we can follow without wronging our rational nature . Under what conception , then , can we best contemplate creation ? What theory best covers the facts ? What do the facts require ? The one impregnable position , the fons et origo of thought upon the subject is this : Forces that work in complex order and with design are sequents of the thought in the order and design . Before the morning stars sang together some master prepared the measure . Before matter began to gravitate inversely as the square of distance , some mathematician fixed the problem . Before homogeneous matter at rest became unstable , some will disturbed its equilibrium . Starting thus with One who is Force and Thought and Order , how can we best connect him with creation and its methods ? Shall we conceive of him as simply thought , and so have a mere idealism - an unreal world ? or as force , and so bring up in necessity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denial of the validity of reason ? or as a mechanician , and so make him external to the world ? or as an arbitrary ordainer , forcing on us the question why he did not ordain better and omit the needless early stages of cruelty ? Or shall we accept the conception of Immanence , and so have a Thought and Will and Order who is continuously in the processes of creation , and is revealing himself in a real way in them - a true manifestation ? Such a conception covers the facts ; under it creation is thinkable . It meets that most imperative of questions - What is the bond or relation between creation and its source ? For we can not escape the conviction that the relation is organic . We may not be able thus to compass the mystery of creation and lift the whole veil from Isis , but we can at least withdraw a corner and discover the golden feet that uphold it . Our highest possible achievement will be to think rationally of the universe - not to explain it . Science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ link all phases and orders of creation into one whole , and explain the links ; it may be able to bring matter and mind , force and feeling , sensation and consciousness , desire and duty , attraction and love , repulsion and hatred , pain and pleasure and conscience , fear and reverence , law and freedom , into some natural relation evolutionary in its character . As all these things are bound up in one human organism , so they may be united in creation as a whole . As man is a microcosm , so the universe may be the analogue of the human cosmos . In this direction we can think at least without violation of reason ,  - -  if forever without reaching a final solution , So be it . But so thinking we escape at least the absurdity of picking up creation at a point given by the senses and propounding the fragment as a theory of the universe . By so thinking we find that we are constantly transcending limits . The simple fact that we reach a limit implies a knowledge beyond it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correlated to the limitless and have knowledge of it . Thus we learn to pronounce easily and with confidence the Infinite Name ; and so naming it , we find it a revelation to us ; under it creation gets meaning . We no longer stand on a headland and view creation as a ship rising out of the horizon and sailing past till it sinks again beneath the sky , port whence and port whither unknown , whether swept by currents or guided from within also unknown . Rather do we tread the deck , mark the hand that holds the helm , hear the word that shapes the voyage , and so journey with it to the harbor . In closing this essay , in which I have attempted merely to show that the Christian Faith is not endangered by evolution , and to separate it from a narrow school of thought with which it is usually associated , it may not be amiss to indicate in a categorical way the lines upon which further study should be pur-sued : I. The respects in which evolution as a necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply to man . i . Instinct yields to conscious intelligence . // 3 . Intelligence takes the place of natural selection . * . The will comes into supremacy , and so there is a complete person ; man , instead of being wholly under force , becomes himself a force . 5 . Man attains full , reflective consciousness . 6 . Conscience takes the place of desire . 7 . The rudimentary and instinctive virtues of the brutes become moral under will and conscience . 8 . Man comes into a consciousness of God . 9 . Man 's history is in freedom . 10 . Man recognizes and realizes the spirit . II . Contrasting phenomena of evolution under necessity , and evolution under freedom . i . Man changes and tends to create his environment ; achieves it largely , and so may improve and prolong it . The brute adapted itself to environment , but had no power over it . 2 . Man progresses under freedom . The brute progressed under laws and environment ; man , under will and moral principles of action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons upon it ; the brute does not , except in a rudimentary and forecasting way . 4 . Man has dominion ; the brute is a subject . * . Man worships , having become conscious of the Infinite One ; the brute does not . 6 . Man is the end of creation , and the final object of it ; the brute is a step in the progress . The end of a process can not be identified with the *i5rocess. 2 2 Afunger.
