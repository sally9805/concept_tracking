txt It may be that Irish politics have still an interest for your readers , though they tell but the same monotonous story of wrong on one side and rapine on the other . There has been a great increase in what , tor want or a better term . is described as " agrarian crime , " and it seems to have taken a new and revolting form  --  that of killing or maiming cattle , and in a recent instance of mutilating and ear-shaving of men . In this , history but repeats itself , as the Irish statutes contain an act , 23 and 24 , George III. , chapter 58 . " An act for the more effectual discovery and prosecution of offenders called ' houghers , ' and for the support and maintenance of soldiers and others houghed , maimed , and disabled by such offenders . " I need scarcely explain that " houghing " is the dividing of the tendon of Achilles , whereby the victim is disabled for life . Extensive seizures of fire-arms and cartridges have been made in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midnight meeting of men in masses , and their undisguised attempts at drill , argues , without any violence to reason , considerable danger ahead . It was hoped that a plentiful harvest would accomplish much , and that the speeches of the Irish Secretary and his denunciation of the House of Peers and of those whom " the accidents of birth " had placed in authority , would , at least , have induced the people to wait for the promised blessings , but they fail to do so . At present the agitators are masters of the situation , and they will not yield or abate their claims until the land question , absenteeism , and reclamation of waste grounds are satisfactorily settled . Aristocratic London is much perplexed by a new scandal . It is said that the legitimacy of the Earl of Dysart is to be disputed . He succeeded his grandfather to the title and to estates of ? 100,000 a year on the 23d of September , 1878 . His father , Lord Huntingtower , was notorious as the boon companion of the wild Marquis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital . The old Earl was miserly and eccentric ; he gave his son but a moderate allowance ; the money lenders supplied all that:was required , taking post-obits for the amount . These becoming worthless on his death , were yet paid in full by the father , to-the extent of at least a quarter of a million . For the last 20 years of his life Earl Dysart did not leave Norfolk-street , Strand . He owned two houses , one on each side of that not very broad ? thoroughfare . When be required change he removed from one to the other , living in almost complete seclusion . From his seventy-fourth to his eighty-fourth year he saw no members of his family . At his death he left ? 1,700,000 , besides a vast rental , bequeathing to his three granddaughters twelve thousand a year each , and a suitable provision for his son 's widow , who was also his niece , a daughter of Sir Joseph Burke , Baronet , of Ghrisk Castle , County Galway . It is now asserted that Lord Huntingtower had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valid , will dispose of the claims of the present Earl , and render his mother no longer a Visconnte3s . The Queen expresses her deop sympathy- , and has declared her intention , should the last marriage be invalid , to create the widow a Countess in her own right , with reversion to her son . This would secure equal rank to that lost , but without the same income to support it . Those who profess to know say the old Earl suspected , if he was not actually informed , of the state of affairs , as ho left their fortunes to his granddaughters by such words of bequest that they still hold , even though their illegitimacy bo proved . The same precautions were . observed in reference to his daughter-in-law ; in any event , their provisions are safe . This is but the last illustration of the calamity of different marriage laws in counties separated by a narrow river . North of the Tweed marriage used to be merely declaratory.outh it required a prescribed ceremonial . Many thus found themselves unconsciously wedded . Men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buckle on their armor , exclaiming , as Cromwell is reported to have said in Ireland : " Surely , this is a property worth fighting for . " I much fear we nave a tendency to do things by extremes . Just now there is a moral reaction , and so-called " professional beauties " are doomed . This will be a pity , for society gains by their presence , and they themselves are the solo sufferers , with , perhaps , a tradesman or two . It can not be pleasant for those whose faces are their fortunes to find themselves so many necessities of fashionable life without proportionate incomes , and yet the names of some , whose birth , breeding , or education constituted no claim , have found their way into gilded saloons , attracted to their side the aristocratic youth of the country , and furnished to shop windows numerous photographs in all attitudes and costumes , but chiefly with their hands clasped and eyes looking distractedly upward . There is about them always a soupcon of scandal . They approach near but do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are presumed to be able to take care of themselves , and who can doubt the wisdom of the law ? Our Home Secretary , some time since , in a virtuous fir , sent a circular to magistrates condemning the imprisonment of juvenile offenders under the- ago of 14 . A case of cunning theft was recently brought before one of the metropolitan Justices , who refused to deal with it , and ordered the offender to be discharged because she was in her thirteenth year . I do not think this order will remain long in force . In the W imbledon trial the marker has been found " not guilty , " and ordered " to return at once to his duties . " The finding of the court has surprised many , and places the witnesses for the prosecution in a very awkward position , for more than one swore that he fired wild , and was yet credited with a mark pre-agreed on . By the acquittal no one in disturbed or discredited except the witnesses . Of late we have made strides in civilization , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Those who speak profanely term them cock and hen houses . For the most part they are admirably managed , the conduct of every one being above reproach . Some young widows and well-endowed spinsters , no longer juvenile , are memhers . I observe they , e fter a time , assume a habit of dropping their eyelids , not always both at the ' same time , but this , no dread , is nervousness , which , reminding one of their unprotected position , is , to use a term of art , " very fetching . " As a rule the success of such clubs is not longs-lived . They appear to get into pecuniary difficulties , and this is a matter of surprise , as many of their members must be most admirable managers , inasmuch as they contrive to live well , dress well , and keep their broughams on professional earnings of about 30s. a week .

Doubtless you have been surprised and shocked to read the account of the attempt to blow up the train on the London and North-western Line , There is reason to believe the sole object was plunder of the dead and injured resulting from any explosion which might hate taken place . The company is one of the best managed as well as most faithfully served in the Kingdom , and there is no reason for attributing the infamous plot to any one who had been or was in their employment . Alarmists declare it to be the work of Nihilists , who were aware that the Grand Duke Constantino , now in England , was traveling along the line .

A clever capture of many " smart gentry " was effected a short time since at the residence of a distinguished peer , whose domestics. , during his absence , gave a ball to their acquaintances .

More than one detective contrived to he present , and found not a few " well known to the Police , " but most presentable young men , friends of the housemaids , on whom , when searched . was discovered wax ? 5 r take impressions , picklock , and other means improving the occasion . The great northern saturnalia is ended . Don caster St. Leger is a thing of the past . Ben Or has been shorn of his Derby honors , which , at the time , many believed had been awarded him in error .
