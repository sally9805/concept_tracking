txt " American citizenship will be the master thought of the campaign of 1884 . " We quote the elegant English of the local Blaine organ . In the Republican platform the master thought is thus phrased . " We believe that everywhere the protection to a citizen of American birth must be secured to citizens of American adoption . " Why , certainly , that 's part of the Revised Statutes . Section 2,000 reads : " All naturalized citizens of the United States , while in foreign countries , are entitled to , and shall receive , from this Government the same protection of persons and property which is accorded to native-born citizens . " A party could ask nothing better than that its opponent should dissent from that text in the American citizen 's bill of rights . So far as we know there is no such issue before the people . We should as soon expect to find in the platform one of the ten commandments or any other of the 5,601 revised statutes as that one . If it be a metaphorical putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders in the hope that somebody will knock it off and kick up a fuss about it and distract attention from the dispute about the candidate 's official honesty , we understand the strategy . But that would be safer for any other man in public life than for Mr. BLAINE . He can only suffer by recalling one of the rashest and most mortifying adventures in his " brilliant " career as Secretary of . State . In 1881 the English Parliament passed " An act for the better protection of persons and property in Ireland . " That act suspended the Habeas Corpus act , at the discretion of the Lord Lieutenant . It was certainly an exceptional and arbitrary measure , repugnant alike to ordinary English and American . laws protecting citizens in their liberty . But it was a law which Parliament had as good a right to pass as , for instance , Congress had to suspend the Habeas Corpus act in 1861 . Doubtless hardships were suffered by unoffending Britons then in the United States . It may also be that some good Americans in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just cause of complaint . Secretary SEWARD explained to Lord LYONS that " in every case subjects of her Majesty residing in the United States and under their protection are treated during the present trouble in the same manner , and with no greater or less rigor , than American citizens , " and the matter droppod . In 1866 Secretary SEWARD also had cause to deal with about the same question as was presented to Mr. BLAINE in 1882 . Mr. SEWARD then instructed Minister ADAMS ? " It . may be expected that some of our Irish-born naturalized citizens Who are now sojourning or traveling in Ireland will be arrested upon complaints in seditious proceedings . It May also be expected that some who will be thus accused . will be innocent , : while others will be guilty . * * * Americans , whether native-born or naturalized , owe submission to the same laws in Grp , ? Britain as British subjects . * * . * . We applied the converse of this principle to British subjects who were sojourning or traveling in the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good enough lawyer and a good enough American for us . He had no factitious record for " brilliancy " to support , and he discussed the question in both aspects  --  as it arose here and as it arose abroad  --  as a protector of Americans and as a punisher of foreigners . Note how differently the subject might be treated by an ambitious man , covetous for the vote of any nationality while posing as an " American " candidate . He might neglect to inquire whether the alleged injury suffered was merely technical , while substantial justice was done to false Americans who abused their citizenship to arouse sedition in a friendly country . And he might demand that exceptions should be made from the equal operation of the laws in behalf of such mischief makers . A curt " mind your own business " might be the reply to such a demand , and such a demagogue might or might not get the votes so adventurously fished for . This supposititious case is an absolutely accurate outline of what Mr. Secretary BLAINE did in the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not an American at all . Another pretended that he did not know why he was arrested , but Minister LOWELL reported that he did know perfectly well that he was guilty of seditious language and incitement to violence , and that he would have been glad to bring on a war between England and the United States . Still another suffering " American " was a British voter , officeholder , taxpayer , and liquor seller , and was arrested on suspicion of an assault with firearms . Such were some of the men whom Mr. Secretary BLAINE demanded should be exempted from the equal operation of a law which it was not even charged bore harder on foreigners in Great Britain than on the British themselves . The result , we have said , was mortifying to Mr. BLAINE . At least it should be so . One sick prisoner was released , but the jail doors were not opened for a single American because of his asserted nationality . About the last response to Minister LOWELL , acting under Secretary BLAINE 'S instructions , was a refusal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case were not discussed . If the matter had been pressed to an extremity our friendly relations with England would have been deservedly and wantonly endangered ; but Mr. FRELINGHITYSEN succeeded Mr. BLAINE , and the " suspects " were released . An ounce of politeness was worth a pound of bluster . Now , we are pained to observe that Mr. BLAINE is in danger of not receiving the votes he bid so boldly for . He went far enough to startle Americans , but not far enough to please the Irish . We present our compliments to Mr. BLAINE , and suggest that his letter of acceptance should include a promise to pick a quarrel with England within a year after his inauguration . Our import trade would suffer , but no protectionist who realizes how destructive a flourishing foreign trade really is would regret that . Our export trade would suffer , too . But this is Mr. BLAINE 'S bid for the Irish vote , not for the farmers ' vote . On the whole , we fear that the master thought , if this be really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
