txt The statement made on the authority of a returned Boston Director , that he and his associates of the Union Pacific Board has agreed upon the terms of a consolidation of that railroad with the Kansas Pacific Railroad , under a single management , was confirmed in this City yesterday by one of the New-York resident Directors , who is also an officer of the Union Pacific Company . The board had been in continuous session for 10 days prior to Thursday last , when the agreement was finally arrived at , and , as may be imagined , this result was not reached without some stubborn *resistance on the part of those members who are not entirely committed to Jay Gould 's policy . The proposition came originally from Mr. , Gould , and the details of what was accomplished , shot- that he succeeded in managing - matters pretty conclusively in his own interest , while at the same time , to quote the remark of the Boston Director , " Sugar-coating the pill " so as to make it more palatable to the other members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scheme are now in the hands of the attorneys of the two companies , who are hard at work putting them into shape , and Thursday of next week has been set as the date for making them public . The general terms of the agreement are , however , as follows : The capital stock of the joint line is to stand in volume the same as at Present , viz. : $36,702,300 Union Pacifie , and $9,689 , - 950 Kansas Pacific , or 840,452,250 in the aggregate . The Union Pacific Company is to issue $9,689.950 of new stock to take up the stock of the Kansas Pacific Company , which is to be delivered at the ruling market rate of the Union Pacific Company 's stock and canceled . It is now quoted at , 104 against 961-2 for Union Pacific . Jay Gould owns abort ; five-sevenths of the entire capital of the Kansas Pacific Company . which he purchased from John D. Perry , Adolphus Meyer . Carlos Greeley , and various Denver Division bondholders at comparatively low rates , and this arrangement will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pacific Company , thus restoring to him , with the aid of the stock owned by his friends , the absolute control of the affairs of the company , which he lost when he was caught so badly short of North-west stock by Keene and his associates , and forced to compromise by disgorging a large block of his Union Pacific holdings , last year . The mortgages now existing on both roads are to remain untouched , ? wall continuing , lien on its particular portion of either road , as at present . No attempt is to be made to consolidate them into a blanket mortgage covering the joint lines . The funded debt of the Union Pacific Company on Jan. 1 , 1879. exclusive of the United States subsidy bonds , was $50,188 , - 000 . The Kansas Pacific Company defaulted on its interest in 1873 and was reorganized in May , 1879 . Under the plan of reorganization , provision was made for the issuance of a new $30,000,000 mortgage at 6 per cent- interest per annum in gold , the bonds to run 40 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the conversion and consolidation of the outstanding funded debt , except that due to the United States , amounting on Dec. 81,1878 , to $22,130,100 , exclusive of the following amounts of overdue interest : or nearly $27,000,000 altogether . To get rid of the $3,000.000 overplus. a plan of scaling was devised . as follows : The Eastern and Middle Division , Denver Extension , and first land grant bonds , and the funded interest certificates were to be exchanged at par . So were the funding mortgage bonds , but in this case no allowance was to be made for the live overdue coupone . The Leavenworth Branch bonds and the unstamped income bonds were to receive but 50 per cent . of their face value without interest , the stamped income bonds 30 per cent. , and the second land grant bonds 50 per cent. , both the latter with interest . The holders of the second land grant and income builds made trouble , but it is claimed that all but $70,000 of the former have been conciliated , by means of a clause in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in either cash or land . The latter are still holding out for par ; but it is claimed that the books of the company were kept in such a way that there are no indications that any income has been earned from those , portions of the road on which the bonds are a lien , and it is hoped in this way to effect the defeat of the bondholders . Of course , the Union Pacific stockholders will now have to assu mu their share of any deficiency that may arise out of the defeat of these hopes . ' The result of the consolidation , on the other hand , is that the Union Pacific Company has now two eastern outlets instead of but one  --  at Omaha  --  as formerly . It may divert freight by way of the Cheyenne branch to Denver , where the Kansas Pacific line connects , and send it thence over that route to Kansas City . The importance of this lies in three facts : Under the United States law incorporating the Union Pacific Company , that line is compelled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point . In other words , it is not allowed to discriminate either in quantity of freight or in rates against any line or lines in favor of any other or others . No such restriction is imposed at Kansas City , where also Mr. Jay Gould 's famous South-western system of roads begins . Here , or close by , are the western termini of the Hannibal and St. Joseph , Missouri Pacific , St. Louis , Kansas City and Northern , and other railroads which are parts of the Gould " Wabash " combination , extending eastward . to and over the New-York Central and its connections to the Atlantic sea-board . It will thus be perceived that at one neat stroke the law is successfully evaded and the entire Pacific coast traffic is given over bodily to the Wabash system on such terms as may be satisfactory to the principal owner of the great transcontinental monopoly , which is also still further extended and cemented by the present arrangement . The " sugar-coating " to " the pill " consisted of promised concessions in rates on the part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it was those that finally induced the majority of the Directors to consent to the proposition . The Chicago and Rack Island , the Chicago . Burlington and Quincy , and particularly the Chicago and North-westGould 's old enemy  --  all of which have termini at Omaha , will be the principal sufferers . Another complication that is looked upon as probable to ensue from the consolidation is the eventual complete monopoly of transcontinental business by Jay Gould . It is believed on the Street that he has recently been an extensive purchaser of Panama Railroad stock . It is also known that the current arrangement between the Union Pacific Railroad Company and the Pacific Mail Steam-ship Company is only a temporary one . From these facts , shrewd observers are of opinion that when the former company deems it advisable to make new terms , these will be less favorable than the present to the latter company .
