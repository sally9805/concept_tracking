WAGNER 'S PARSIFAL . IT is the purpose of this paper to give the impression made by the performance of Parsifal at Baireuth , ia*t summer , in view of certain stricture* upon the motive of the drama , and without any attempt at musical criticism . In order to do this , I shall have to run over the leading features of the play , already given in the newspapers . Criticism enough , and of an unfavorable sort , there has been , though I heard none of it in Baireuth , nor ever any from those who had been present at the wonderful festival . Perhaps that was because I happened to meet only disciples of Wagner . I fancy that the professional critics , who did publish depreciating comments upon the new opera , and upon Wagner 's methods in general , felt more inclined to that course after they had escaped from the powerful immediate impression of the performance , from the atmosphere of Baireuth , and begun to reflect upon the responsibilities of the special critP*s to the world at large , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wagner movement , assumption , presumption , or whatever it is called , than they did while they were surrounded by the influences that Wagner had skillfully brought to bear to effect his purpose on them . I have read two kinds of criticism . One was written by musical adepts , who had not heard the opera , but who condemned it on perusal of the score and the libretto ; declaring the latter to be . sacrilegious , and the author to be a false prophet among musicians and a charlatan among managers . The other critics , who also set themselves against Wagnerism , described the performance in such terms that all Europe was more and more eager to see it , but compounded for their reluctant enjoyment by finding unworthy methods in a success they could not deny . Whatever the triumph was , they said it was not a pure musical triumph , but one due to the creation of special conditions and favoring circum // stances . Fancy Beethoven pushing his music into popular notice by such claptrap means ! It was a great offense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his theatre in the inaccessible Franconian city , - a city with scant accommodations for visitors , and off the regular lines of travel . It was a still greater offense that , after all , he should be able to attract to this remote and provincial place pilgrims and strangers , not only from every country in Europe , but from America , Australia , and India ; and that the theatre should be filled three nights in the week for three months by persons willin to incur the expense of a long , wearisome journey , and to pay thirty marks ( seven dollars and a half ) for a seat , at the end of it . A success of this sort could scarcely be legitimate . It must be due to some managerial legerdemain and to a misdirected enthusiasm . Perhaps if we knew all the circumstances , the building of the theatre at Baireuth would not appear to be a whim of arbitrariness . Years ago , the king of Bavaria desired to erect a theatre in Munich , on the hill over the Iser . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building by the citizens of Munich that he abandoned the purpose , and began the construction of a play-house to suit himself , elsewhere . The new theatre would have been so well adapted to Wagner 's purposes that it may he doubted if Wagner would have set up his standard at Baireuth , if the Munich project had been carried out . Yet it must be owned that the quaint little city , which owes so much of its romantic interest to Frederick 's sister , the Margravine , has advantages in its very remotenesses and primitive conditions . The reason why Wagner 's operas are enjoyed in Munich , and fail to please in Paris , is not that they are better presented in Munich ; nor is the comparative failure in Paris due to the character of the operas , but rather to the atmosphere of Paris and the character of the audiences . Parsifal is scarcely better adapted to the meridian and the operatic traditions of Paris than is the Ober-Ammergau Passion Play . It is Wa*ner 's well-known theory of the opera that it should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one or two or several persons to the audience , with spaces or wastes of musical declamation between ; with an orchestra merely by way of accompaniment , and a background of scenery that would indifferently fit a dozen plays , and a plot incoherent and without any special purpose . Whether Wagner is successful or not in reducing his theories to practice is still in dispute ; but he attempts a production which has purpose and unity , and which excludes everything not consistent with the effects lie aims at . A story is to he told , a lesson is to he taught , an impression is to be produced on the hearer and spectator ; and to this impression the orchestra , the scenery , and the singing are of almost equal importance . Nothing is admitted that does not forward the general purpose , and the unity of the stoi-y is not broken by special appeals to the audience . The effort is made to impress and stimulate the imagination , and to engage the attention in the work as a whole rather than in certain lyrical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audiences sentiments , fervors , aspirations , in particular directions . Why is it charlatanism in him to prepare conditions favorable to his purpose Why is it not legitimate that he should bring his audiences into such a state of mind , before the performance begins , that they are prcdisposed to enjoy the entertainment he offers - We know how much the appreciation of a poem depends upon the surroundings in which we read it or hear it . if Wagner has so contrived it that his audiences , arriving at the quiet and primitive city where he is almost // worshiped , regard themselves as pilgrims at a special festival , and are in a receptive state of mild before they enter the theatre ; if the theatre itself and all the environments heighten this impression ; and if , finally , the performance itself seems to them more like a spiritual drama than an opera , where is the charlatanism , even if it can be proved that the impression is largely due to the accessories of the music ? If it is said that other great composers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can only think that any composer would have liked to command the best conditions for the production of his compositions . It is of course possible that the crowds at Baireuth were victims of a delusion , and of skillful contrivance . I can answer for many of them that they would like to be deluded again in just that way . When we arrived at the station in Baireuth , it was at once apparent that the town was en fete , and that its sole occupation was the Wagner festival . Our train , which had waited at the last junction to bring hundreds of passengers from the east , was an hour late ; it was two o'clock in the afternoon , and the performance was to begin at four . The bustle at the station , the ubiquity of committee-men and town officials , the crowd of vehicles , of all the fashions of the present and the last century , the air of expectation and the excitement were evidence of the entire absorption of the town in the great event . An agricultural fair in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spain , could not more stir a con*munity into feverish and cheerful activity . If the arriving stranger , carpet-bag in hand , had not the freedom of the city , he had all the city to wait on him , answer his inquiries , rind take interest in him as an intelligent and profitable pilgrim . We had secured our tickets by telegraph , and found them ready for us at the banker 's . We bad also applied to the burgorneister for accommodations for the night , and we found that a committee , in permanent session at the station , had already billeted our party at private houses , to which we were promptly dispatched . Everything was so perfectly systematized that the wayfaring man , though a Wagnerite , need not err therein , and our quarters turned out to be exceedingly comfortable , and given at moderate prices . All the private houses of the place appeared to be at the disposal of the committee , and offered without extortion . If the inhabitants were not all devoted to Wagner , they were devoted to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musical works of Richard Wagner were everywhere in sight , and in almost all the shop windows were photographs of Wagner , engravings of Wagner , busts of Wagner , statuettes of Wagner . The other chief objects for sale in the town were photographs of the characters in Parsifal . We liked the old town , at once for its quaintness and single-mindedness , and we admitted that there is only one Baireuth , and Wagner is its prophet . The pilgrim to the shrine of Wagner is treated like a pilgrim . He is expected to be willing to put his devotion to a further test , after reaching the remote town ; for the theatre is set on a hill , half a mile from the city , so that a carriage is needed for the majority of visitors , especially if the weather is rainy , as it was the day of our arrival , and as it was all last summer , four days out of five , in the German land . This hill places the spiritual drama one more remove from the bustle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from ordinary life . The theatre is an ungainly brick building , erected only with reference to the interior accommodations . The great bulk of the stage rises out of it in defiance of all architectural beauty . The auditorium is surrounded by an open corridor , from which there are entrances for every // three rows of seats . Each ticket indicates its entrance , so that the audience assembles and seats itself without confusion , and the house can be perfectly emptied in two minutes , without any danger of a rush or lam . The interior has been so often described that I need not enter into details . There are no proscenium boxes or side seats ; the rows of chairs rise from the stage , spread out like a half-open fan , and at the back of the house are a row of private boxes ; above them is a shallow gallery . Every part of the stage can be perfectly seen from every seat in the house . A low barrier rises before the front row of seats , separating the auditorium from the stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hidden completely from the audience , is the orchestra . The house is almost bare of decoration ; only a cool gray color pervades , which is grateful to the senses . All the splendor is reserved for the stage , which is of immense proportions . At four o'clock the fifteen hundred seats were filled , and a crowd of persons , said to be several hundred , occupied the standing-room in the rear . Most of the audience were standing , and the house was in a buzz of conversation and expectation . Suddenly , at the stroke of a stick behind the scenes , the audience seated itself ; the doors were closed , excluding the light ; the hail and the people were discernible only in an obscure twilight ; a profound silence fell upon the house , indignantly enforced by a hissing " hushzz " directed at a careless whisperer ; and at another signal the prelude began . The stillness was phenomenal , and so continued through the entire performance . I had an impression at the time that the audience was in a temper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the silence by any sound . We sat in the luminous darkness , and the prelude began by the unseen orchestra . From the first note the music was striking ; it portende4 something . It may have been because the players were concealed , but I seemed to hear not instruments , but music . And this music had a supernatural note , an unworldly , not to say a spiritual , suggestion . It rose and fell , more importunate than strident , in pleading , in warning , in entreaty . Whether it was good music or utterly impossible music I can not say . owing to a constitutional and cultivated ignorance of musical composition ; but it affected me now and again like the wind in a vast forest of pines on a summer day . It appealed to the imagination , it excited expectation , it begat an indeflanble longing ; and now and then a minor strain , full of sadness or of passion , suggested a theme , like the opening of a window into another world , - a theme which was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it came to us like a reminiscence of some former life . When the prelude had been prolonged until the audience were brought up to the highest pitch of expectation , the great curtains were drawn aside , and the domain of the Knights of the Holy Grail , a peaceful , sunny land of forest , meadow , lake , and mountain , was disclosed . The composer has made use of one of the earlier legends of the Grail , at the time when the cup was still in possession of the knights appointed to guard it . The cup which had been drained at the Passover feast and had received the holy blood at the cross was still safe ; but the sacred spear , the spear of the cross , which the heavenly messenger had also committed to the knights , had been lost . It was in possession of Klingsor , a recreant kni*ht , who inhabited pagan land , and had by magic transformed a waste desert into wonderful gardens , and created an enchanted castle , inhabited by women of charms infernal , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of the victims was Amfortas , the king // of the knights , who had yielded to the temptations of Kundry , the temptress and the iMiagdalen of the play , a witch , who was in the power of Klingsor , and forced to do his bidding . When Amfortas fell into the wiles of this bewildering beauty , in one of his expeditions into pagan land , he was overpowered in his weakness , lost the sacred spear , and received a grievous wound in the side . Of this wound of sin he now languished . All the medicines of the world could not heal it ; only in one way , by a man without sin , could he be cured . Meantime the spear was lost , and so long as this all-conquering weapon remained in the possession of the enemy , the cup itself was in danger . Klingsor vaunted his purpose to seize it . Kundry , at the opening of the drama , is a sort of impish servant and messenger of the knights , a wild , untrained nature , touched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself from the power of Klingsor , and full of unrest and contradictory passions . The domain of the knights is represented by a charming scene , simulating nature so closely that the leaves are seen to quiver on the forest trees . To the audience , looking at it across an empty space and from a darkened room , it has the delusion of a tableau ; but the figures in it seem the real inhabitants of some remote land of myth . Gurnemanz , an aged knight , is attended by two esquires . They are lamenting the sickness and wound of Amfortas , and the danger to the Grail from the loss of the holy spear . To them enters the wild witch Kundry , fantastically clad in a savage garb , with a snake-skin grdle , having a swarthy complexion , piercing black eyes , and black hair flowing in tangled disorder . She comes from the end of the earth , riding on the devil 's mare , though , for o nec , not on the devil 's errand. 11cr self-appointed mission has been to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her wiles . She brings to Gurnemanz a balsam from far Arabia , though well she knows that no balsam can touch his wound . At this moment Amfortas is borne in on a litter , on the way to his bath in the sacred spring , the only alleviation of his suffering . The crystal flask containing the balsam is given to him , and Kundry is bidden to approach . But the wild maid draws away , tortured by a conscience half awakened , and struggling with the wickedness of her unsubdued , animal nature ; held by the enchantment of Klingsor , and unable even to repent , but impelled by a blind notion of merit in good deeds to render service to the knights ; restless , sleepless , pursued by demons , longing in her fitful despair only to sleep , and to sleep forever , - a lost soul in pitiful helplessness of human succor . This thrilling scene , interpreted by the wailing and sympathetic orchestra , is at its height , when an interruption occurs that strikes all with new horror . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly further , and sinks to the ground , dying , pierced by an arrow . It is the sacred swan . Who has committcd this sacrilcge ? The murderer appears , a strong , rude hunter , clad in skins , his bow in hand . He is proud of his feat . 1-Ic is accustomed , in the wilderness , to shoot whatever flies . This is Parsifal , the man of absolute nature , without sin and without virtue , as ignorant as he is innocent . It is with difficulty that he comprehends what he has done , and he slowly understands the woe and horror of the company . As moral sense begins to dawn in his dark mind , he is seized with violent trembling , and falls half fainting . He breaks his bow and casts it from him . Kundry , at sight of him , is as strongly moved as he . On the return of the train of the king from the bath , Gurnemanz asks Parsifal to accompany him to the holy feast . If thou art pure , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is the Grail ? asks Parsifal . The guide can not // say , but knowledge is not hidden to those who are bid to serve it ; yet to it no earthly road leads , and no one not elected can see it . Gurnemanz lays Parsifal 's arm on his own neck , and , supporting him with one arm , leads him away . The two appear to be walking slowly through the forest to the left , pausing here and there in weariness . In fact , the scenery itself is moving to the right . The country changes its character . The forest becomes wilder and denser . The travelers make their way painfully , up steeps and amid rocks and fallen trees . The way is still more rocky and wild . Dark caverns yawn , and the trees are more fantastically savage . The music , ever graver , and ever recurring to the minor sadness , expresses toil , and the weariness of the way , and the difficulty of seeking . For moments , behind some giant rock or cluster of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear again , the red cloak of the knight glowing amid the dark green . As the travelers move on , the scene still changes . Touches of the artificial are seen . The caverns and passages in the rock have been enlarged and worked by man 's hand . Here is trace of an arch , of cut stone , of a wall buttress . We are passing into the depths of the mountain , by a way in which nature has plainly been assisted . There is a faint sound of chimes ; the orchestra itself is on the impatient point of disclosing the secret ; there is a second in which all is obscure , and then , in a burst of light , stands revealed a mighty hall , vast as a giant cathedral . The aisles stretch away in dim perspective ; the arches are supported on lofty columns of jasper , of verde antique , of alabaster , of all precious marbles ; and above is a noble dome , blue and luminous with golden stars . From the dome streams the light ; from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chiming bells . Beneath the dome stands a long horseshoe curved table , with the ends towards the audience , leaving the centre of the stage free . In the middle of this open background is a high table , like an altar , with steps leading up to it , and behind it is a raised couch , with a canopy . Upon the communion table are set tall silver cups . From the far distance in the aisle the knights , clad in robes of scarlet , enter in slow and stately procession , moving with reverence and dignity , and chanting as they approach the table and take their places ; from the middle height of the hall come th' responsive voices of younger knights ; and then down from the very summit of the dome float boys ' voices . So angels might hail the supper of our Lord , leaning over the gold bars of heaven . Immediately , from the other aisle , enters a procession of equal solemnity and splendor : the bearers of Amfortas on his litter , the servitors of the holy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under its covering , the sacred cup . But for the intense solemnity of the scene , one must note the marvelous skill with which every detail of it , in form and color , has been composed . But it is only afterwards that we vividly recall this . The bearers of the cup are less earthly than Raphael 's angels , from whom they may have been copied . And jt never occurs to you that they are stage angels . The whole scene , so necessarily theatrical in description , does not impress the spectator so ; the art of color and grouping is too perfect , the solemnity is too real . Amfortas is borne to the couch behind the altar . The holy vessel is deposited before him . The servitors attend with baskets of bread and tall silver flagons . At one si ( le , near the entrance of the hall , stands Parsifal , clad in sheep-skin , as rigid as a stone , a mute and awestruck spectator of the scene . Amfortas , stricken with disease and sin , shrinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the voices // from heaven , by the knights , and by the command of his aged father , he feebly rises . The boys uncover the golden shrine , and take out of it the cup of the Grail , an antique crystal cup . As Amfortas bows over it in silent prayer , a gloom spreads through the room ; a ray of light shoots from above upon the cup , which begins to glow with a purple lustre . When Amfortas raises it and holds it high , it burns like a ruby , - it is the Holy Grail . In the dusk the knights are kneeling and worshiping it . When he sets it down the glow fades , the boys replace the cup in the shrine , and the natural light returns to the hall . The goblets are then seen to be filled with wine , and by each is a piece of bread . At intervals in the progress of the supper alternative voices of youths and boys from the heights chant in response to the solemn chorus of the knights , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blessed believing . " During the repast , of which Amfortas has not partaken , he sinks from his momentary exaltation , the wound in his side opens afresh , and he cries out in agony . Hearing the cry , Parsifal clutches his heart , and seems to share his agony , but otherwise he stands motionless . The supper over , Ainfortas and the sacred shrine are borne away . The knights rise ; and as they pass out , and meet , two and two , at the ends of the table , they tenderly embrace , with the kiss of peace and reconciliation , and slowly depart in the order in which they came . To the last Parsifal gazes in wonder ; and when his guide comes to speak to him , he is so dazed that Gurnemanz , losing all patience at his unresponsive stupidity , pushes him out of the door , and spurns him for a fool . The curtains sweep together , and shut us out from the world that had come to seem to us more real than our own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stillness that had been unbroken during the whole performance . There was not a note of applause , not a sound . The impression was too profound for expression . We felt that we had been in the presence of a great spiritual reality . I have spoken of this as the impression of a scene . Of course it is un derstood that this would have been all an empty theatrical spectacle but for the music , which raised us to such heights of imagination and vision . For a moment or two , as I say , the audience sat in silence ; many of them were in tears . Then the doors were opened ; the light streamed in . We all arose , with no bustle and hardly a word spoken , and went out into the pleasant sunshine . It was almost a surprise to find that there was a light of common day . We walked upon the esplanade , and looked off upon the lovely view : upon the old town ; upon the Sophienberg and the Volsbach forests in the Franconian Jura ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the breaking clouds were preparing a golden sunset . We did not care to talk much . The spell was not broken . How long , I asked a lady , do you think we were in there ? An hour , nearly , she thought . We had been in the theatre nearly two hours . It was then six o'clock . On the esplanade are two large and well - appointed restaurants , adjuncts to the theatre , and in a manner necessary* to it . Wagner understands how much the emotional enjoyment and the intellectual appreciation depend upon the physical condition , and he has taken pains to guard his audiences against both hunger and weariness . During the half-hour interval that elapsed between the first and the second act , the guests were perfectly refreshed by a leisurely stroll in the open air , by the charming view , by the relaxation of their intense absorption , by a cup of coffee or a drop of amber and perhaps Wagnerian beer , or by a substantial supper . When the notes of a silver // trumpet summoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mood to enjoy the play again with all the zest of the first hour . The second act is of the earth , earthy , and less novel than the first to operagoers , accustomed to spectacles , ballets , and the stage seductions of the senses . It is the temptation of Parsifal , who has begun his novitiate . The temptation is wholly of the senses and the passions . The scene is the magic castle and the enchanting gardens of the magician Klingsor , - a scene of entrancing but theatrical beauty . The magician is discovered seated in the dungeon keep of his tower , surrounded by the implements of magic . In the background is the mouth of a black pit . Casting something into it , he summons Kundry . A cloud of smoke arises from the pit , growing luminous and warming into rosy color ; and suddenly from the chasm rises a most beautiful female form , enveloped in a gauzy tissue , and flushed with rosy light . It is Kundry , no longer in her aspect of witch , but surpassingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responding to the summons of her master with a cry and look of agony . She is bidden to undertake the temptation of Parsifal , who has been seen from the ramparts approaching the castle . She refuses . Her whole nature abhors the office . But yield she must to the power of the charm . Yield she must , and exercise all her power of fascination and seduction , though she knows that it is only by the resistance of her blandishments that salvation can be hers . She knows that only by meeting and being resisted by a sinless one can her own sin be cured , and yet she is forced to put forth all her efforts to secure her own ruin and his . With a gesture of protest and despair , she vanishes as she came . The tower and the cavern sink away , and in place appear , filling all the vast stage , a tropical garden , and the battlements and terraces of an Arabian castle . Parsifal stands upon the wall , looking down upon the scene in astonishment . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rush in groups of lovely damsels , arranging themselves in haste , as if waked from sleep . Each one in her dress represents some flower . They are awaiting Parsifal , and as he descends they surround him , and envelop him , and distract him with their voluptuous charms . When their blandishments fail ( although the music pleads in all sensuous excitement ) to arouse in the pure youth anything more than perplexity and wonder , the maidens leave him in disgust , and with the appearance of the ravishingly beautiful Kundry the dangerous temptation begins . Gorgeous as is the scene , and opulent as are the female charms of this second act , there is yet something of the cheap and common about it , - tawdry splendors , easily seen to be the stock gorgeousness and the painted temptations of the stage . This seemed to me an ethical mistake in the drama . Such a man as Parsifal should have been approached , to his ruin , with subtler and less gross allurements than these . At least , the guileless nature of Parsifal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being seduced from his knighthood by the appeals of beauty to his pity , to his sympathy , for an innocent and simple maiden , beset by dangers , and coming to him for aid and comfort ; approaching him through his higher qualities , and flattering him into forgetfulness of his mission in the names of virtue and compassionate love . The devil of modern society appears to understand these things better than the traditional devil whom Wagner consulted for this scene . The audience feels from the first that the open solicitations of Kundry must fail , and that Parsifal is in little danger , even when she bends over him and impresses upon his lips a kiss of a duration so long that the spectator is tempted to time it with his watch , like the passage through // a railway tunnel . From this embrace , at any rate , Parsifal starts up in intense terror , clasping his hand to his side , as if he felt the spear-wound of Amfortas . I need not detail the struggle and the passion that follow . Failing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his aroused suspicion , pleads for his love , in that it alone can save her ; his love alone can redeem and pardon her . He resists also this more subtle temptation . " Eternally should I be damned with thee , if for an hour I forgot my holy mission . " In rage at her final failure , when Parsifal spurns her as a detestable wretch , Kundry curses him , and calls for help . The damsels rush in . Klingsor appears upon the battlement , with the holy spear in his hand ; he hurls it at Parsifal ; but the spear remains floating above the latter 's head . Parsifal grasps it with tremulous joy , waves it , and makes with it the sign of the cross . Instantly the enchantment is broken : down tumble towers and castle walls ; the garden vanishes ; the leaves and branches of the trees strew the earth ; the damsels lie on the ground like shriveled flowers ; and Kundry falls insensible , and lies amid the ruins and the waste of the original desert . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a snow mountain . Purity and nature have taken the place of the baleful enchantment . Parsifal turns from the top of the broken wall , over which he disappears , to look upon the ruin as the curtain closes . When the act ended , the audience , still under the spell of the music , which had*ht the end risen out of its soft and siren strains into a burst of triumph and virile exaltation , sat , as before , silent for a moment . Then it rose en masse , and turned to the high box in the rear , where , concealed behind his friends , Wagner sat , and hailed him with a long tempest of applause .. The act had lasted less than an hour . It was followed by an intermission of three quarters of an hour , which gave the audience time for supper , and for the refreshment of a stroll and the soothing effects of the charming view in the fading sunlight . Jn the third and last act we return to the high themes of the first ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , soo*hing the spirit agitated by the period of storm and stress . The conflict is over . We have passed through the regions of tumult and passion ; we have escaped out of the hothouse air of temptation . Penitence is possible , and through suffering jeace is dawning with forgiveness in the torn and troubled heart . The orchestra declares it , and the scene upon which the curtain rises is the sweet and restful domain of the Grail in the spring-time of the year . On the edge of the forest , built against a rock , is a hermitage ; a spring is near it , and beyond stretch flowery meadows . It is the dawn of day , the sky reddening before the coming of the sun , when Gurnemanz , now extremely aged and feeble , emerges from the hut . Attracted by moaning in the thicket , he moves aside the branches , and discovers Kundry , cold and stiff , lying in the hedge of thorns , which is little better than her grave . He drags forth the nearly lifeless form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and temples , calls her back to life with the news that the winter has fled and the spring has come . Slowly the maiden revives , gazes at him in wonder , and then adjusts her dress and hair , and without a word goes like a serving-maid to her work . To Kundry has come a wonderful transformation . The wildness has gone from her mien and from her eyes ; into her face has come the soft , indescribable light of penitence , and a transcendent spiritual beauty . She is no longer the fiery witch , full of disordered passion , contempt , and impish malevolence ; she is no longer the houri of the enchanted garden , with the charms of the si* ren and the bewildering allurements of // January , Venus Aphrodite . Clad in the simple brown garb of the penitent Magdalen , subdued and humble , every movement and gesture and her sad , lovely face proclaim inward purity and longing for forgiveness . When Gurnemanz upbraids her for her silence and thanklessness for her rescue from deathly slumber , she bows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in a broken voice murmurs , " Service , service U ' - her only exclamation in all the act . Kundry comes from the hut , and goes towards the spring with her water-pot . Looking into the wood , she sees some one approaching , and calls Gurnemanz 's attention to the comei* . A knight , in complete black armor , weary and worn , bruised with conflict and dusty with travel , slowly and feebly draws near , with closed helmet and lowered spear . It is Parsifal . Gurnemanz , who does not recognize him , hails him with friendly greeting . Parsifal only shakes his head . To all inquiries he is silent , and he is still speechless when Gurnemanz asks him if he does not know what holy day has dawned ; that it is the hallowed Good-Friday ' morn , when he should doff his armor , and trouble no more the Master who has died for us . After an interval , in which the music of the orchestra pleads as for a lost world , Parsifal rises , thrusts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great shield and sword , unbraces and removes his helmet , and then , kneeling , raises his eyes in silent prayer towards the spear 's head . Gurnemanz beckons to Kundry , who had gone within the hut . Do you not know him ? Kundry assents with a nod . Surely , t is he , - the fool whom I drove in anger from the hall of the knights . In great emotion Gurnemnnz recognizes the holy spear . Kundry turns away her sad and longing face . After his devotions are ended , Parsifal rises , and , gazing calmly around , recognizes Gurnemanz , and knows where he is . The murmur of this forest , falling on his tired senses , gives him hope that he has come to the end of his journey of error and suffering . He has sought the path that would lead him to the wounded Amfortas , to whose healing he believed himself ordained ; but hitherto that path has been denied him , and he has wandered at random , driven by a curse , through countless distresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was not fit to use the holy spear which he bore , undefiled , by his side . The ancient knight assures him that he has come to the Grail 's domain , where the knightly band awaits him , with great need of the blessing he brings . Amfortas is still struggling with the tortures of his wound ; the shrine of the Holy Grail.has long remained shrouded ; the Holy Supper is no longer celebrated ; the strength of the knights is withered , for want of this holy bread ; and summoned no more to holy warfare in far countries , they wander pale , dejected , and lacking a leader ; and Titurel , the old commander , to whom was first committed the cup and the spear , the father of Amfortas , hopeless of ever beholding again the refulgence of the Grail , has just expired . Parsifal hears this with intense anguish , and laments that he has brought all this woe , since some heinous guilt must still cling to him that no atonement or expiation can banish , and that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and miss the path of safety . He is about to fall , when Gurnemanz supports him , and seats him on a grassy knoll . Kundry , in anxious haste , brings a basin of water ; but Gurnemanz waves her off , saying that only the pilgrim 's bath can wash away his stains ; and they turn him about to the edge of the spring . While Gurnemanz takes off his corselet and the rest of his heavy armor , Kundry , kneeling , removes the greaves from his legs , and bathes his feet in the healing spring . The armor removed , Parsifal appears clad in a soft // white tunic , with a cord about the waist , and his long , light hair , in wavy masses , flows back upon his neck . There is no mistaking the likeness , in this meek and noble face and figure . Shall I straight be guided to Amfortas ? asks Parsifal , wearily . Surely , says Gurnemanz , we go at once to the obsequies of the beloved chief . The Grail will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the knight speaks , Parsifal observes , with wonder , Kundry humbly washing his feet , and gazes on her with a tender compassion . Taking water in the hollow of his hand , Gurnemanz sprinkb*s his head . Blessed be thou , pure one . Care and sin are driven from thee ! Kundry , from a golden flask , pours oil upon Parsifal 's feet , and dries them with the long tresses of her black hair , which she has unbound for the purpose . I ? hen Parsifal takes from her the flask , and desires Gurnemanz to anoint his head ; for he is that day to be appointed king . Gurnemanz , pouring the oil , declares him their king , and the rescuer from sin . And thus I fulfill my duty , murmurs Parsifal , as he , unperceived , scoops water from the spring , and , stooping to the kneeling and heart-broken Kundry , sprinkles her head .

The Magdalen , shaken with penitence , and yet weeping for joy , is cast at his feet . The aged knight stands in solemn rapture . The scene is inexpressibly touching . The music is full of pathos and solemn sympathy . How fair the fields and meadows seem to-day ! exclaims Parsifal , gazing with gentle enjoyment upon the landscape . This is Good-Friday 's spell , my lord ! exclaims Gurnemanz . The sad , repentant tears of sinners have besprinkled field and plain with holy dew , and made them glow with beauty . As Gurnemanz discourses of the redemption of mau and nature , the transformed Kundry slowly raises her head , and gazes with moist eyes and beseeching look , out of which all earthly passion has completely gone , up to Parsifal . Thou weepest . See ! the landscape gloweth , he gently says , and , stooping , softly kisses her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , spiritual face of this forgiven sinner the temptress of the gardens ? I know not how this whole scene may appear in the coldness of description , but I believe that there was no one who witnessed it , and heard the strains of melting music which interpreted it , who was not moved to the depths of his better nature , or for a moment thought that the drama passed the limits of propriety . The pealing of distant bells is heard growing louder . Gurnemanz brings a coat of mail and the mantle of the Knights of the Holy Grail , with which PaFsifal is invested . The landscape changes . The wood gradually disappears , as the three march on in silence ; and when they are hidden behind the rocky entrances of the caverns , processions of mourning knights appear in the arched passages . The bells peal ever louder , and soon the great hall is disclosed . From one side the knights bear in the bier of Titurel , and from the other the litter of Amfortas , preceded by the attendants with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and grouping are marvelous ; and to eyes familiar with the sacred paintings of the masters , almost every figure and dress is a reminiscence of some dear association . The angelic loveliness of the bearers of the shrine , however , surpasses any picture , as much as life transcends any counterfeit of it . At the sight of the body of Titurel there is a cry of distress , in which Amfortas // joins ; and the knights press upon the latter , urging him to uncover the shrine and do his office . With a cry of despair he disengages himself , tears open his mantle and discloses the wound , and invokes the knights to bury their swords in his breast , and kill at one stroke the sinner and his pain . At this moment , Parsifal , who has entered , with his attendants , unperceived , starts forward , and , stretching out his spear point , touches the wounded side . Only the weapon that struck can staunch thy wounded side .

Parsifal assumes the king ship , takes his place behind the altar , and commands the cup of the Grail to be uncovered . Taking it in his hand , and raising it on high , the crystal burns again like a ruby ; from the dome a white dove descends , and hovers over him ; Kundry - peace at last , stricken soul - falls dying ; the knights are gazing upward in rapture ; and out of the heights come down soft and hardly audible voices in a chant of benediction . It was nine o'clock when we went out into the still lingering twilight . I , for one , did not feel that I had assisted at an opera , but rather that I had witnessed some sacred drama , perhaps a modern miracle play . There were many things in the performance that separated it by a whole world from the opera , as it is usually understood . The drama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout , and unity in the orchestra , the singing , and the scenery . There were no digressions , no personal excursions of singers , exhibiting themselves and their voices , to destroy the illusion . The orchestra was a part of the story , and not a mere accompaniment . The players never played , the singers never sang , to the audience . There was not a solo , duet , or any concerted piece " for effect . " iNo performer came down to the foot-lights and appealed to the audience , expecting an encore . No applause was given , no encores were asked , no singer turned to the spectators . There was no connection or communication between the stage and the audience . Yet I doubt if singers in any opera ever made a more profound impression , or received more real applause . They were satisfied that they were producing the effect intended . And the composer must have been content when he saw the audience so take his design as to pay his creation the homage of rapt appreciation due to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
