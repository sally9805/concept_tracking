txt The case of J. H. Quinn , who was arrested yesterday morning charged with attempting to burn the Poughkeepsie Hotel , is a singular one . The fire would not have been discovered had it not been for a game of draw poker which was going on in one of the rooms . The accused man is not only well known here as a graduate of the High School , but he claims he has been book-keeper of the Lotos Club , New-York , and be carries letters of recommendation from Whitelaw Reid , President of the club . He seemed to exhibit deep concern as to his surroundings when he entered the court-room this afternoon , accompanied by his counsel , William I. Thorn and Frank J. Akerley . The room was crowded with liSteners . Police Commissioner Allison Butts appeared for the prosecution and Recorder Frank B. LoWn was on the bench . The prisoner is about 28 years old , well dressed , and wears a mass of black hair and heavy mustache . Henry Wiley , the night clerk of the hotel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday morning . He had no baggage . and as the clerk had previously seen him about the city he did not hesitate to give him a room , assigning him to No. 53 on the second floor . Quinn registered as A. P. Burbank , and the clerk did not at that time know his name was Quinn . He did not show any signs of Intoxication , and went to his room as soon as he registered . Fifteen minutes after , two drummers who were in a roofa adjoining Quinn 's , and who were engaged in a game of draw-poker , 10 cents ante , got into a quarrel over the game , and the clerk went up stairs to stop the muss . On his way up he met Quinnuin coming down , and when he saw the clerk he turned back and ran . The clerk started after him , when one of the card players met him and told him there was a fire in Quinn 's room . Witness went tfifere and found the door locked and the key gone . He forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed and under it , which was extinguished by himself and some of the guests who had been alarmed . ' The bed had not been otherwise disturbed . The night or rather the morning of the fire he saw Quinn coming down stairs the second time and heard him say , " There is a fire up stairs : you had better go and put it out , " and then Quinn left the hotel . The slats , mattresses , and side of the bed were burning when the clerk entered the TOM . The second witness was officer Charles Miller , of the night police . He saw Quinn going up Main-street at 1:30 o'clock in the morning , and he appeared to be intoxicated and talking about Pat Kelley . Soon after he met Kelley , who said Quinn had been following him . The officer then followed Quinn to the Morgan House , and did not see him afterward till 3 A. M ? or hereabouts , when he heard the night clerk of thelPoughkeepsie Hotel yell fire , He ran to the hotel and hurried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and " collared " him till he found where the fire was when he dropped him and helped to extinguish the flames . While he had hold of Quinn the latter said : " What is the matter ? " the officer replying , " It is suspicious to find you here after leaving you at the Morgan House . " Quinn made no reply . After the excitement was over the officer went out to look for Quinn again . He went to the Nelson House and described Quinn 's appearance , the clerk saying that a person answering that description had only a short time before been assigned to room No. 17 , by the name of Quinn . The officer ascended to room No. 17 and knocked furiously four or five times , but could get no answer . Re- membering that Quinn . had been intimate with a young man named Larry Murtauh , the officer called that name and khocked again , when the door was opened and Quinn was seen sitting on i the edge of his bed in a bewildered and dazed condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room at the Poughkeepsie Hotel was found on him . He was questioned , but could not make coherent answers , and he was under the influence of liquor . The officer said Quinn was an inveterate cigarette smoker , and added : " He acted like a man who had been on a drunk and got up and had a head on him . " Morris Bach , a drummer in jewelry and neckwear , who resides at No. 169 East Seventy-secondstreet , New-York City , and who does bugness at No. 33 Lispenard-street , was the next witness . It was he who got into a muss over a game of poker in the room next to Quinn 's , the man he got into difficulty with being F. Spiro , in Dan- bury , Conn. , who was here as a witness n some case . He testified that after they got through with their game and their quarrel and Spiro had gone to his room he thought he heard a noise at the keyhole of his door . He went to the door and opened it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been occupied by Quinn , and it was he who ' notified the clerk of the hotel . Dr. John P. Wilson , who examined the partly burned bed , testified he found something . like oil which had run around on the lower part of one of the slats . The slat was so wet with it that the wood was colored with it , and it was soaked in . This closed the testimony for the prosecution , when counsel for the defense asked for an adjournment to prepare . Mr. Thorn , of counsel for prisoner , said : " I do n't want to make a speech . It seems to me you have got here concededly a drunken man , and I suppose we have got to say he was in that room and was the cause of that fire . He was drunk before and confused afterward . I do n't discover any criminal intent . " The court said it would be better satisfied with a full explanation , and set a further hearing down for 2 o'clock tomorrow afternoon ..   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
