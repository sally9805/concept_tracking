txt If the Treasury had waited twenty-four hours longer before issuing its circular of . Wednesday night we doubt whether it would have been issued at all . The much-talked-of stringency in the money market reached its culmination some days ago . On Wednesday it was clearly apparent before the close of business that those who from self-interest or misapprehension had talked most and loudest of impending disaster had about given up the game and were preparing to get along as best they might with the ordinary curative resources of the market . Those who held large stores of money in the expectation of really serious distress and high rates of interest had concluded that the present condition of business was not favorable to their designs ; and they foresaw , moreover , that the weekly purchases of bonds , while insignificant in amount , were really sufficient to keep the Treasury in touch with the business demands of the , country , and in that way to allay and prevent alarm over the financial situation . It was beginning to be discovered . also , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the operators for a " bull " market had taken such pains to represent . The consequence was that money was easily obtainable in Wall-street at 4 and 5 per cent. , and the rigid scrutiny of collaterals which had been practiced for some time was visibly relaxed . The " scare , " in fact , was over . The coming panic was relegated to the distant future , and both iu the ranks of speculation and in the business world men were prepared to go about their affairs without giving much further thought to the terrible surplus in the Treasury . The effect that the circular had in Wallstreet yesterday revealed at once the exaggerations in recent reports as to tight money . It showed that no new supply of actual cash was necessary to grease the wheels of commerce in that of late rather dull thoroughfare . " Confidence " alone was needed , and the offer of the ' Treasury to purchase $14,000,000 of bonds between now and Oct. 8 and to anticipate by four clays the payment of $0,500,000 of interest was sufficient to make everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust , will be permanent . Should the terms of the Treasury circular be accepted up to the full amount the payments for interest and bonds , including premium , within the next two weeks would aggregate something like $25,000,000 . This ought to satisfy the panic preachers , but it will not fully . Already some dissatisfaction is expressed in that quarter because the limit of bond purchases was fixed at the insignificant figure of $14,000,000 instead of being made to include the entire Treasury surplus . And some pessimists find comfort in the fear or hope that the " bear " interests will manage to keep the prices of 4 and 410 per cents . above the figures mentioned in the Treasury circular , so as to prevent any considerable sales to the Government . The market rate of the bonds is likely to be slightly higher than the price offered by the Treasury , but this will not necessarily put a stop to offerings under Wednesday night 's circular . Whether the bonds will be offered in considerable amounts is a matter concerning which prophets disagree widely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be reached .
