AMONG the points relating to the Chinese people which have attracted the attention of students in human history , their long duration and literary institutions have probably taken precedence . To estimate the causes of the first requires much knowledge of the second , and from them one is gradually led on to an examination of the government , religion , and social life of this people in the succeeding epochs of their existence . The inquiry will reveal much that is instructive , and show us that , if they have not equaled many other nations in the arts and adornments of life , they have attained a high position in its comforts , and developed much that is creditable in education , government , and security of life and property . As results must have their proportionate causes , one wishes to know what are the reasons for the remarkable duration of the Chinese people . Why have not their institutions fallen into decrepitude , and this race given place to others during the forty centuries it claims to have existed ? Is it owing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other nations easily reaching it ? Or have the language and literature unified and upheld the people whom they have taught ? Or , lastly , is it a religious belief and the power of a ruling class working together , which has brought about the security and freedom now seen in this thrifty , industrious , and practical people ? Probably all these causes have conduced to this end , and our present object is to outline what seems to have been their mode of operation . It may be remarked , in limine , that we wish to examine this subject in the belief of the personal rule of an Almighty Governor over the nations of the earth-One who not only has made of one blood all nations , and determined the times before appointed , and the bounds of their habitation , but who also prolongs or cuts short their national life according to their moral condition and regard for // justice , truth , and peace . The Bible clearly furnishes the only adequate explanation of God 's government of nations as distinct communities , and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and appreciation of Chinese character and civilization . We hardly need say , too , that the ignorance of its people of that Book , and of the existence and attributes of God , the sanctions of his law , and their own relations to his government here and hereafter , adds a feature of peculiar interest to this inquiry . The position of their country has tended to separate them from other Asiatic races , even from very early times . It compelled them to work out their own institutions without any hints or modifying interference from abroad . They seem , in fact , to have had no neighbors of any importance until about the Christian era , up to which time they occupied chiefly the basin of the Yellow River , or the nine northern provinces as the empire is now divided . Till about B. C. 220 , feudal states covered this region , and their quarrels only ended by their subjection to Tsin Chi Hwangti , or the Emperor First , whose strong hand molded the people as he led them to value security and yield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Emperors XY*n-ti ( B. C. 179-156 ) and Wu-ti ( B. c. 140-86 ) , of the Han dynasty , to consolidate , during their long reigns of twenty-nine and fifty-four years , their schemes of good government . The four northern provinces all lie on the southeastern slope of the vast plateau of Central Asia , the ascent to which is confined to a few passes , leading up five or six thousand feet through mountain defiles to the sterile , bleak plains of Gobi . This great sandy region has always given subsistence to wandering nomads enough to enable traders to cross its grassy wastes . When their numbers increased , they burst their borders in periodical raids , ravaging and weakening those whom they were too few to conquer and too ignorant to govern . The Chinese were too unwarlike to keep these tribes in subjection for long , and never themselves colonized the region , though the attempt to ward off its perpetual menace to their safety , by building the Great Wall to bar out their enemies , proves how they had learned to dread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense for China against armies coming from the basin of the Tarim River than the lofty mountains on its west did to ancient Persia and modern Russia . It was easier and more inviting for the Scythians , Huns , Mongols , and Turks successively to push their arms westward , and China thereby remained intact , even when driven within her own borders . // The western frontiers , between the Kia-yu Pass in Kansuh , at the extreme end of the Great Wall , leading across the country south to the island of ilainan , are too wild and rough to be densely inhabited or easily crossed , so that the Chinese have always been unmolested in that direction . To invade the eastern sides , now so exposed , the ancients had no fleets powerful enough to attack the Middle Kingdom ; and it is only within the present century that armies carried by steam have threatened her seaboard . The Chinese have , therefore , been shut out by their natural defenses from both the assaults and the trade of the dwellers in India , Thibet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materially modified their civilization . The external influences which have molded them have been wholly religious , acting through the persistent labors of Buddhist missionaries from India . These zealous men came and went in a ceaseless stream for ten centuries , joining the caravans entering the northwestern marts , and ships trading at southern ports . In addition to this geographical isolation , the language of the Chinese has tended still more to separate them intellectually from their fellow-men . It is not strange , indeed , that a symbolic form of writing should have arisen among them , for the Egyptians and Mexicans exhibit other forms of ideographic writing , as well as its caprices and the difficulty of extending it . But its long-continued use by the Chinese is hardly less remarkable than the proof it gives of their independence of other people in mental and political relations . Outside nations did not care to study Chinese books through such a medium , and its possessors had , without intending it , shut themselves out of easy interchange of thought . This shows that they could not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Sanskrit or Assyrian , for it is almost certain that , in thm*t case , they would soon have begun to alter their ideographs into syllables and letters , as the Egyptians did ; while the manifest advantages of the phonetic over the symbolic principle would have gradually insured its triumph . In that case , however , the rivalries of feudal states would have resulted , as in Europe , in the formation of different languages , and perhaps prevented the growth of a great Chinese race . In Japan and Corea the struggle between symbols and sounds has long existed , and two written languages , the Chinese and a derived demotic , are now used side by side in each of those kingdoms . This isolation has had its disadvantageous effects on the people // thus cut off from their fellows , but the results now seen could not otherwise have been attained . Their literary tendencies could never have attained the strength of an institution if they had been surrounded by more intelligent nations ; nor would they have filled the land to such a degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or had imbibed the lust of conquest . Either of these conditions would probably have brought their own national life to a premature close . Isolation , however , is merely a negative feature in this question . It does not account for that life , nor furnish the reasons for its uniformity and endurance . These must be sought for in the moral and social teachings of their sages and great rulers , who have been leaders and counselors , and in the character of the political institutions which have grown out of those teachings . A comparison of their national characteristics with those of other ancient and modern people shows four striking contrasts and deductions . The Chinese may be regarded as the only pagan nation which has maintained democratic habits under a purely despotic theory of government . This government has respected the rights of its subjects by placing them under the protection of law , with its sanctions and tribunals ; and making the sovereign amenable in the popular mind for the continuance of his sway to the approval of a higher Power able to punish him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feudal , hereditary , and priestly classes and interests by making the tenure *of officers of government below the throne chiefly depend on their literary attainments . Not a trace of Judaistic , Assyrian , or Persian customs or dogmas appears in Chinese books in such a definite form as to suggest a Western origin . All is the indigenous outcome of native ideas and habits . Underlying these characteristics is one general idea that should here be mentioned , because of its importance and power . This is the worship and obedience due to parents and ancestors  --  a homage given to them in this world , and a reverence to their manes in the next , which are unknown to a similar extent in any other land . Regard for parents has assumed the sanctity of worship in many other countries , indeed , but in no nation has it exerted such a powerful influence , and been kept so long in its original purity . In the " Book of Odes , " whose existence is coeval with Samuel and David , or earlier , are many references @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its royal observance . At some festivals the dead were personated by a younger relative , who was supposed // to be taken possession of by their spirits , and thereby became their visible image . He was placed on high , and the sacrificer , on appearing in the temple , asked him to be seated at his ease , and urged him to eat , thereby to prepare himself to receive the homage given to the dead . When he had done so , he gave the response in their name ; the deified spirits returned to heaven , and their personator came down from his seat . In one ode the response of the ancestors through their personator is thus given : " What said the message from your sires ? Vessels and gifts are clean ; And all your friends , assisting you , Behave with reverent mien . " Most reverently you did your part , And reverent by your side Your son appeared . On you henceforth Shall ceaseless blessings bide . " What shall the ceaseless blessings be ? That in your palace high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in posterity . " - LuGw*'a She King . The teachings of this ancient book intimate that the protecting favor of the departed could be lost by the vile , cruel , or unjust conduct of their descendants-thus connecting ancestral worship and reward with personal character . Another ode sums up this idea in the expression , " The mysterious empyrean is able to strengthen anything ; do not disgrace your imperial ancestors , and it will save your posterity . " Many stories occur in the native literature exemplifying this idea by actual experiences of blessing and cursing , all flowing from the observance or neglect of the required duties . The great sages Confucius and Mencius , with the earlier rulers , King W*n and Duke Chau , and their millions of followers , have all upheld these sentiments , and those teachings and examples are still as powerful as ever . In every household , a shrine , a tablet , an oratory , or a domestic temple , according to the position of the family , contains the simple legend of the two ancestral names written on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is burned before it , daily or on the new and full moons ; and in April the people everywhere gather at the family graves to sweep them , and worship the departed around a festive sacrifice . To the children it has all the pleasant associations of our Christmas or Thanksgiving ; and all the // elder members of the family who can do so come together around the tomb or in the ancestral hall at the annual rite . Parents and children meet and bow before the tablet , and in their simple cheer contract no associations with temples or idols , monasteries or priests , processions , or flags and music . It is the family , and a stranger intermeddleth not with it ; he has his own tablet to look to , and can get no good by worshiping before that bearing the names of another family . As the children grow up , the worship of the ancestors , whom they never saw , is exchanged for that of nearer ones who bore and nurtured , clothed , taught , and cheered them in helpless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rendered more personal , vivid , and endearing . There is nothing revolting or cruel connected with it , but everything is orderly , kind , and simple , calculated to strengthen the family relationship , cement the affection between brothers and sisters , and uphold habits of filial reverence and obedience . Though the strongest motive for this worship arises out of the belief that success in worldly affairs depends on the support given to parental spirits in Hades , who will resent continued neglect by withholding their blessing , yet , in the course of ages , it has influenced Chinese character in promoting industry and cultivating habits of domestic care and thrift , beyond all estimation . It has , moreover , done much to preserve that feature of the government which grows out of the oversight of Heaven as manifested to the people through their Emperor , the Son of Heaven , whom they regard as its vicegerent . The parental authority is also itself honored by that peculiar position of the monarch , and the child grows up with the habit of yielding to its injunctions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the abode of a personal Being who exerts an influence over him that can not be evaded , and is far more to him as an individual than any of the popular gods . Those gods are to be feared and their wrath deprecated , but the " illustrious ones who have completed their probation " represent love , care , and interest to the worshipers if they do not fail in their duties . Another indirect result has been to define and elevate the position of the wife and mother . All the laws which could be framed for the protection of women would lack their force if she were not honored in the household . As there can be only one " illustrious consort " ( hien pi ) named on the tablet , there is of course only one wife ( tsi ) acknowledged in the family . There are concubines ( tsieh ) , whose legal rights are defined and secured , and form an integral // part of the family ; but they are not admitted into the ancestral hall , and their children are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jacob 's household . Polygamous families in China form a small proportion of the whole ; and this acknowledged parity of the mother with the father , in the most sacred position she can be placed , has done much to maintain the purity and right influence of woman amid all the degradations , pollutions , and moral weakness of heathenism . It is one of the most powerful supports of good order . It may even be confidently stated that woman 's legal , social , and domestic position is as high in China as it has ever been outside of Christian culture , and as safe as it can be without the restraints of Christianity . Another benefit to the people , that of early marriages , derives much of its prevalence and obligation from the fear that , if neglected , there may be no heirs left to carry on the worship at the family tomb . The three leading results here noticed , viz. , the prevention of a priestly caste , the confirmation of parental authority in its own sphere , and the elevation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband , do much to explain the perpetuity of Chinese institutions . The fact that filial piety in this system has overpassed the limit set by God in his Word , and that *leceased parents are worshiped as gods by their children , is both true and sad . The knowledge of his law can alone put all parties in their right positions ; but the result now before us in the history of the sons Han may lead us to acknowledge that the blessing of the first commandment with promise has come upon them , and their days have been long in the land which God has given them . There is , however , need of something much stronger and wiser than all these influences and obligations to control and direct a wellconstituted state . We must seek for it in the literary institutions of China , and examine how they have worked to preserve it . Without stopping to discuss the origin and quality of her literature , previous to the Chau dynasty ( B. c. 1122 ) , it may be remarked that at that time some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overthrowing the Shang dynasty , and planting their own family in its stead . Their sway was patriotic and beneficial , and their writings upon the principles of good government became authoritative . Their empire , however , gradually fell into the condition of France after Charlemagne 's death , through the internecine strifes of the feudal kings , when Confucius and Mencius arose in the fifth and fourth centuries . They saw that the people were lapsing into // barbarism , and undertook to teach them political ethics , and fortify their own precepts by the well-known instructions of the ancient kings . They appealed to their recognized excellence as the best exemplars , and a reason for urging a return to those approved standards . These eminent men thus obtained a hearing and support from their countrymen , while the experience of the intervening centuries enabled them to enlarge their range of thought and discuss every function of a state . If it be suggested that God raised up Confucius , Mencius , King Wan , and Duke Chan , and others , as leaders of the Black-haired race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social , political and domestic life , he also raised up similar guides and rulers in Persia , Babylon , Greece , and especially in Israel , whose instructors were purer and better than all . What , then , accounts for the paramount influence of the Chinese classics on that people , and the little regard which was paid to Cyrus , Solomon , Plato , Zeno , and others , by their countrymen of after-ages ? The solution is , if anywhere , to be found in the prevalence of popular education from very early times . This gradually elevated literary above warlike and mercantile pursuits , and prepared the way for the adoption of the system of competitive examinations for eligibility to office , which originated about B. C. 150 by the Han dynasty . The pure teachings in practical morality of the nine classics had by that time come to be regarded as of the highest authority . When Liu Pang obtained the throne of all China ( B. C. 202 ) , the long struggle of forty years had destroyed all the feudal kings and aristocracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Emperor to select the best men from every rank of life . He naturally looked to the literati , whose studies in those political ethics had fitted them somewhat for carrying precept into practice ; and the examinations for office are still restricted to subjects drawn from those books . Strictly speaking , no religious system is therein taught , for their purpose is to inculcate the highest morality and the best government , as founded on human experience . The boy commences his education by learning these maxims ; and by the time he has got his degree , and long before , too , the highest truths and examples he knows of are more deeply impressed on his mind than Biblical truths and examples are on graduates of Yale , Oxford , Heidelberg , or the Sorbonne . The honor and power of official position and the high standing paid to scholarship have proved to be ample stimulus and reward for years of patient study . Not one in a score of graduates ever obtains an office , and not one // in a hundred of competitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the literary class , and share in its influence , dignity , and privileges . Moreover , these books render not only those who get the prizes well acquainted with the true principles on which power should be exercised , but the whole nation-gentry and commonersknow them also . These unemployed literati form a powerful middle class , whose members advise the work-people who have no time to study , and aid their rulers in the management of local affairs . Their intelligence fits them to control most of the property , while few acquire such wealth as gives them the power to oppress . They make the public opinion of the country , now controlling it , then cramping it ; alternately adopting or resisting new influences , and sometimes successfully thwarting the acts of officials , when the rights of the people are in danger of encroachment ; or at other times combining with the authorities to repress anarchy or relieve suffering . This class has no badge of rank , and is open to every man 's highest talent and efforts , but its complete neutralization of hereditary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privileged oligarchy and a landed or feudal aristocracy , proves its vitalizing , democratic influence . It has saved the Chinese people from a second disintegration into numerous kingdoms , by the sheer force of instruction in the political rights and duties taught in the classics and their commentaries . While this system put all on equality , human nature , as we know , has no such equality . At its inception it probably met general support from all classes , because of its fitness for the times , and soon the resistance of myriads of hopeful students against its abrogation and their consequent disappointment in their life-work aided its continuance . As it is now , talent , wealth , learning , influence , paternal rank , and intrigue , each and all have full scope for their greatest efforts in securing the prizes . If these prizes had been held by a tenure as slippery as they are in the American Republic , or obtainable only by canvassing popular votes , the system would surely have failed , for " the game would not have been worth the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character of permanency to the Government , which opposes all disorganizing tendencies , and makes it for the interest of every one in office to strengthen the power which gave it to him . This loyalty was remarkably shown in the recent rebellion , in which , during the eighteen years of that terrible carnage and ruin , not one imperial official voluntarily joined the Taipings , while hundreds died resisting them . // We have no space for extracts from the classics which will adequately show their character . They would prove that Chinese youth , as well as those in Christian lands , are taught a higher standard of conduct than they follow . The former are , however , drilled in the very best moral books the language affords ; and , if the Proverbs of Solomon and the New Testament were studied as thoroughly in our schools as the " Four Books " are in China , our young men would be better fitted to act their part as good and useful citizens . In this way literary pursuits have taken precedence of warlike , and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army for his own aggrandizement . The army of China is contemptible , certainly , if compared with those of Western nations , and its use is rather like a police , whose powers of protection or oppression are exhibited according to the tempers of those who employ them . But in China the army has not been employed , as it was by those great captains , to destroy the institutions on which it rests ; though its weakness and want of discipline often make it a greater evil than good to the people . But , if the army had become strong and efficient , it would certainly have become a terror in the hands of ambitious monarchs , a drain on the resources of the land , and perhaps a menace to other nations , or finally a destroyer of its own . The officials were taught , when young , what to honor in their rulers ; and , now that they hold those stations , they learn that discreet , upright magistrates do receive reward and promotion , and experience has shown them that peace and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the best tests of their own fitness for office . Another observable result of this republican method of getting the best-educated men into office is the absence of any class of slaves or serfs among the population . Slavery exists in a modified form of corporeal mortgage for debt , and thousands remain in this serfdom for life through one reason or another . But the destruction of a feudal baronage involved the extinction of its correlative , a villein class , and the oppression of poor debtors , as was the case in Rome under the consuls . Only freemen are eligible to enter the concours , but the percentage of slaves is too small to influence the total . To this cause , too , may , perhaps , to a large degree , be ascribed the absence of anything like caste , which has had such bad effects in India . Before speaking of the religious condition of the Chinese , the // evil results and defects of their system of education and competitive examination ought to be noticed . It will require years for them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have now begun to enter this upward path . The language itself , which has for centuries aided in preserving their institutions , and strengthening national homogeneity amid so many local varieties of speech , is now rather in the way of their progress ; for it is impossible for a native to write a treatise on grammar about another language in his own language , through which another Chinese can , unaided , learn to read or speak that language . The Chinese people have therefore had no ready means of learning the best thoughts of other minds . Such being the case , the ignorance of their best educated scholars about other races , ages , and lands , has been their misfortune far more than their fault , and they have suffered the evils of their isolation . One has been an utter ignorance of what would have done them lasting good in morals , science , and politics . Neither geography , natural history , mathematics , astronomy , nor history of other lands , now forms part of the curriculum ; and the men trained in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own country . The officials are imbued with conceit , ignorance , and arrogance as to its power , resources , and position in comparison with other nations , and are helpless when met by greater skill and strength . However , these disadvantages , great as they have been and still are , have mostly been a natural result of their secluded position , and are rapidly yielding to the new influences which are acting upon the people and government . Well will it be for both , if these causes do not disintegrate their ancient economies too fast for the recuperation and preservation of whatever is good in them . The last point in the Chinese polity which has had great influence in preserving it is the religious beliefs recognized by the people and rulers . There are three sects ( san kiao ) which are usually called Confucianism , Buddhism , and Taoism , or Rationalism ; the first is a foreign term , and vaguely denotes the belief of the literati generally , including the state religion . These three sects do not interfere with each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Buddhist shrine , or join in a Taoist festival , while he accepts all the tenets of Confucius , and worships him on state occasions ; much as a lawyer in England may attend a Quaker meeting , or the Governor of a State in America may be a Methodist minister . The ancestral worship is never called a kiao , for everybody observes that at home just as much as he obeys his parents ; it is a duty , not a sect. // The state religion of China has had a remarkable history and antiquity ; and , though modified somewhat during successive dynasties , has retained its main features during the past three thousand years . The simplicity and purity of this worship have attracted the notice of many foreigners , who have disagreed on many points as to its nature and origin . Their discussions have brought out many most interesting details respecting it ; and whoever has visited the great Altar and Temple of Heaven at Peking , where the Emperor and his courtiers worship , must have been impressed with its simple grandeur . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is only needful to indicate two main results . The prime idea in this worship is that the Emperor is Tien-tsz , or Son of Heaven , the co*Srdinate with Heaven and Earth , from whom he directly derives his right and power to rule on earth among mankind , the One Man who is their vicegerent and the third of the trinity ( san tsai ) of Heaven , Earth , and Man . With these ideas of his exalted position , he claims the homage of all his fellow-men . He can not properly devolve on any other mortal his functions of their high-priest to offer the oblations on the altars of Heaven and Earth at Peking at the two solstices . He is not , therefore , a despot by mere power , as other rulers are , but is so in the ordinance of nature , and the basis of his authority is divine . He is accountable personally to his two superordinate powers for its record and result . If the people suffer from pestilence or famine he is at fault , and must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disobedient son . One defect in all human governments  --  a sense of responsibility on the part of rulers to the God who ordains the powers that be-has thus been partly met and supplied in China . It has really been a check , too , on their tyranny and extortion ; for the very books which contain this state ritual intimate the amenability of the sovereign to the Powers who appointed him to rule , and hint that the people will rise to vindicate themselves . The officials , too , all springing from the people , and knowing their feelings , hesitate to provoke a wrath which has swept away thousands of their number . The worship of Shangti , or deified Heaven , is confined to the Emperor , for to invade this prerogative would be treasonable , and equivalent to setting up the standard of rebellion . In his capacity of vicegerent , high-priest , and mediator between his subjects and the higher Powers , there are many points of similarity with the assumptions of the Pope at Rome . The effects in China upon the // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the negative effects *ias been to dwarf the state hierarchy to a complete nullity , to prevent the growth of a class which could or did use the power of the monarchy to strengthen its own hold upon the people as their religious advisers , and on the Government as a necessary aid to its efficiency . We have seen that the popular rights which are so plainly taught in the classics have been inculcated and perpetuated by the common school education , and that the ancestral worship could not admit the interference of priest , altar , or sacrifice , outside of the doorposts . Yet it is probable that all combined would have been too weak to resist the seductive introduction of a hierarchy in some form , if it had not been that the Emperor himself would not yield his own unapproachable grandeur to any man . Being everything in his own person , it is too much to expect that he is going to vacate or reduce his prerogative , surrender his right to make or degrade gods of every kind for his subjects to worship , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fellow worshipers , the high ministers of state . The chains of caste woven in India , the fetters of the Inquisition forged in Spain , the silly rites practiced by the augurs in old Rome , or the horrid cruelties and vile worship once seen in Egypt and Syria , all done under the sanction of the state , have all been wanting along the Yellow River , and none of their evils have hampered the rule of law in China . The emperors at various times have shown great devotion to the ceremonies and doctrines of the Buddhists and Taoists , and have built costly temples , and supported more priests than ever Jezebel did , but the teachings of Confucius and Mencius were too well understood among the people to be uprooted or overridden . The complete separation of the state religion from the worship of the common people accounts for the remarkable freedom of belief on religious topics . Mohammedanism and Buddhism , Taoist ceremonies and Lama temples , are all tolerated in a certain way , but none of them have at all interfered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Son of Heaven . They are , as every one knows , all essentially idolatrous , and the coming struggle between these various manifestations of error and the revealed truths and requirements of the Bible has only begun to cast its shadow over the land . The more subtile conflict , too , between the preaching of the Cross and faith alone in its Sacrifice for salvation , and reliance on good works , and priestly interference in every form , has not yet begun at all . // The power of Buddhism in China has been owing chiefly to its ability and offer to supply the lack of certainty in the popular notions respecting a future state , and the nature of the gods who govern man and creation . Confucius uttered no speculations about those unseen things , and ancestral worship confined itself to a belief in the presence of the loved ones , who were ready to accept the homage of their children . That longing of the soul to know something of the life beyond the grave was measurably supplied by the teachings of Sakya-muni and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Confucius , was illustrated and enforced by the earnest , virtuous life of their founder . Though the sect did not receive the imperial sanction till about A. D. 65 , these teachings must have gradually grown familiar during the previous age . The conflict of opinions which erelong arose between the definite practical maxims of the Confucian moralists , and the vague speculations , well-defined good works , and hopeful though unproved promises of future well-being , set forth by the Hindoo missionaries , has continued ever since . It is an instructive chapter in human experience , and affords another illustration of the impossibility of man 's answering Job 's great question , " But how shall man be just with God ? " The early sages opened no outlook into the blank future , offered no hopes of life , love , happiness , or reunion with the friends gone before , and their disciples necessarily fell back into helpless fatalism . Buddhism said , Keep my ten commandments , live a life of celibacy and contemplation , pray , fast , and give alms , and according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rewarded in the serene nirvanct to which all life tends . But the Buddhist priesthood had no system of schools to teach their peculiar tenets , and , as there is only one set of books taught in the common schools , the elevating precepts of the sages brought forth their proper fruit in the tender mind . Poverty , idleness , and vows made by parents in the day of adversity to dedicate a son or a daughter to the life-long service of Buddha , still supply that priesthood with most of its members . The majority are unable to understand their own theological literature , and far more is known about its peculiar tenets in Europe than among the mass of the Chinese . The Confucianist , in his pride of office and learning , may ridicule their mummeries , but in his hour of weakness , pain , and death he turns to them for help , for he has nowhere else to go . Both are ignorant of the life and light revealed in the gospels , and cry out , " Who will show us any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and jejune , as we // judge it after comparing it with the beautiful imagery and art of Greece and Egypt , it brought in nothing that was licentious in its rites , or cruel in its sacrifices . Coming from India , where worship of the gods involved the prostitution of women , the adoration of the lingam , and the sacrifice of human beings , Buddhism was remarkably free from all revolting features . If it had nothing to offer the Chinese higher in morals or more exalted or true in its conception of the universe or its Maker , it did not sanction impurity or murder , or elevate such atrocities above the reach of law by making them sacred to the gods . This last outrage of the Prince of Darkness on the soul of man , so common in Western Asia , has never been known or accepted to any great extent in the Middle Kingdom . The words of Moses ( Leviticus xviii , 25 , 28 ) , asserting that it was because of these abominations among the Canaanites that they were punished , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out her inhabitants , " may be adduced as one reason why God has preserved the Chinese , who have not practiced them . But , while it is true that Buddhism gave them a system of precepts and observances that set before them just laws and high motives for right actions , and proportionate rewards for the good works it enjoined , it could not furnish the highest standards , sanctions , and inducements for holy living . On becoming a part of the people , the Buddhists soon entered into their religious life as acknowledged teachers . They adapted their own tenets to the national mythology , took its gods and gave it theirs , acted as mediators and interpreters between men and gods , the living and the dead , and shaped popular belief on all these mysteries . The wellorganized hierarchy numbered its members by myriads , and yet history records no successful attempt on its part to usurp political power , or place the priest above the laws . This tendency was always checked by the literati , who really had in the classics a higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be driven from their position by imperial orders , nor coaxed by specious arguments to yield their ground . Constant discussions on these points have served to keep alive a spirit of inquiry and rivalry , and preserve both from stagnation . Though Buddhism , in its vagaries and will-worship , gave them nothing better than husks , put hypocrisy in place of devotion , taught its own dogmas instead of truth , and left its devotees with no sense of sin against any law , yet its salutary influence on the national life of China can not be denied . It has had a long trial , as well as // Confucianism , and both have proved their inability to lead man to a knowledge of God , or give peace to his soul . It remains , in this estimate of the molding influences on Chinese character , to refer only to Taoism and Mohammedanism . Lao-tsz ' , the founder of the sect of Rationalists , was a contemporary of Confucius , and one of the most acute and original minds of his nation . The tenets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-five centuries , and have rather acted as complementary to each other than antagonistic ; the first entertaining speculative minds by its intangible subtilties ; the other proving its usefulness by telling mankind what they ought to do . Its followers have furnished thousands of volumes no more useful than the treatises of monkish schoolmen , and are now chiefly regarded as adepts in all occult lore , and ma*terB of sorcery and alchemy . The introduction of Islamism was so gradual that it is not easy to state the date or manner . The trade between China and ports lying on the Arabian Sea early attracted its adherents , and its missionaries came by ships to the seaports , especially to Canton and Hangchow . They likewise formed a large portion of the caravans which went to and fro through Central Asia , and seem to have been received without resistance , if not with favor , until they grew , by natural increase , to be a large and an integral part of the population . Mosques were built , schools taught , pilgrimages made , books printed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any serious hindrance , almost from the first . Yet the tenets of the Prophet have made no real impression on the national life , and the number of his followers forms only a small proportion of the whole . The two great features of the faith , viz. , the existence of one only true God , and the wickedness of idolatry , have not been kept hidden ; but , though promulgated , they have not been accepted outside of the sect , and have not made the least impression on the state religion . The reasons for this are not far to seek . The rigid rule that the Koran must not be translated has kept it out of the reach of the literati , and the faithful could not even appeal to it in support of their belief , for not one in a myriad knew how to read it . The Chinese could not learn Arabic , and there was no sword hanging over them , as was the case in Persia , to force them into the ranks . The simplicity of the state religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declaim against polytheism and idolatry . The prohibition of pork to all true believers was a senseless injunction among a frugal people // which depended largely on swine for meat , and had never felt any the worse , bodily or mentally , for its use ; and the inhibition of wine was needless among so temperate a race as the Chinese . Those who liked to keep Friday or other days as fasts , practice circumcision as a symbol of faith , and worship in a temple without images , could do so if they chose ; but they must obey the laws of the land , . and honor the Emperor , as good subjects . They have done so , and generally speaking have never been molested on account of their faith . Their chief strength lies in the northern part , and the recent struggle in the northwestern provinces , which has cost so many myriads of lives , began almost wholly at the instigation of Turk or Tartar sectaries , and was a simple trial of strength as to who should rule . While cities and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the two hundred thousand Moslems in Peking remained perfectly quiet , and were unmolested by the authorities . In this survey of Chinese institutions it has been shown that the empire has owed much of its security to its isolation and the difficulty of large invading armies reaching it . The early ages of feudalism , which developed the national character by sectional rivalries , was succeeded by a great central government founded on popular consent , which molded these states on democratic principles , and prevented both a landed and hereditary aristocracy that could appropriate large tracts of country and engross both power and labor . The eligibility of men from all classes to office , according to their literary attainments , secured on the whole the most cultivated minds for the leading ones , and prevented the domination of mere soldiers over the liberties and property of their countrymen . On the other band , the struggles of ignorant multitudes , led by designing demagogues to assert their rights by destroying their oppressors , have not resulted in any permanent changes , for such commotions have been riots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in them . The position of the sovereign , as vicegerent of ileaven and Earth , made him alone responsible to them for the good government of the land , and rendered a priesthood needless . The nature of the ancestral worship , of which the state religion is an outgrowth , likewise called for no priestly officers , either to absolve the worshipers or intercede for them , to explain the holy books , or call on the gods , much less punish and destroy those who refused compliance . The throne could not gather a class of supporting nobles around its steps , and thus erect an official order , for the system of // competitive examinations had already opened the avenues of rank and power to all , by teaching the candidates how to maintain the principles . of liberty and equality they had learned from Confucius and Mencius . This absence of an hereditary nobility neutralized the evils and crippled the power of caste and slavery , which would perhaps have grown out of such a form of feudalism . Finally , the great respect paid to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legal safeguards of life and properly , and the possession of a fertile soil , temperate climate , and rich resources-all these taken together appear to satisfactorily account for the permanency and character of Chinese institutions . All that these institutions need , to secure and promote the highest welfare of the people , as they themselves aver , is their faithful execution in every department of government : and no higher evidence of their remarkable wisdom can be adduced than the general order and peace of the land . When one sees the injustice and oppressions in the courts , the feuds and deadly fights among the clans , the prevalence of lying , ignorance , pollution , and other more serious crimes , and the unscrupulous struggle for a living going on in every rank of life , he wonders that universal anarchy does not destroy the whole machine . But the same truthful expounder of human society , which has been already quoted , furnishes us with a partial solution in the declar*ion , " The powers that be are ordained of God . " The Chinese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to as high a degree as it is possible for man to go without the knowledge of his revelation . That , in its great truths , its rewards or punishments , its hopes , and its stimulus to good acts by faith working by love , has yet to be received by them . The course and results of the struggle between the new and the old in the land of Sinim will form a remarkable chapter in the history of man . S. WELLS WILLIAMS .
