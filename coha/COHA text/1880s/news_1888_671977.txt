txt THE SURPLUS AND TARIFF BEFOR IT . The enemies of tariff reform are rejoicing over the discovery that the appropriations of the present session of Congress threaten to come within about $13,000,000 of the estimated revenues of the present fiscal year , and are claiming that this will do away with the necessity of any material reduction in duties . It has long been known that it was the policy of these champions of the present system of excessive taxation to make away with the surplus by extravagant expenditures as a means of keeping up the outrageous taxes which enable highlyprotected. interests to make enormous profits at the expense of the people . That policy was distinctly avowed in the Republican national platform . The Repub. , licans in both houses have directed their energies throughout this long session to increasing appropriations to the utmost , and they always find enough Democrats interested in one or another of the proposed expenditures to help them along . Aside from this deliberate purpose and constant effort to increase expenditures for the purpose of defeating tariff reform , the mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stream of revenue beyond the needs of the Government is a direct encouragement to extravagant appropriations . It is given as an excuse for every proposed increase of the public expenses . There is no absolute cure for this tendency to extravagance except the cutting down of the revenues to a basis of reasonable economy , and the very fact that the appropriations of the session threaten to be so large is a ? strong argument in favor of reducing taxation . These large appropriations , assuming that they are all to be made , present no obstacle whatever to an immediate reduction of duties to the full extent proposed in the Mills bill . The appropriations already passed and those providing for what may be called the fixed charges of the Government , such as interest on the public debt , sinking fund requirements , &c.,; amount to $338,295,324 40 . Those pending at various stages on the way to enactment amount to something near $90,000,000 , making the total of possible appropriations about $428,000,000 , while the estimated revenues of the year are $440,563,000 . But it is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year with a surplus beyond all requirements of $103,000,000 , and the actual revenues are likely to exceed the estimates by nearly $20,000,000 . So even with these extravagant appropriations there will be a surplus to deal with exceeding $120,000. - 000 , while the total reduction of receipts from duties contemplated by the Mills bill is only a little mere than $50,000,000 . Aside from the liberal margin of unnecessary expenditures provided for in consequence ? of the existence of excessive revenues . some of the appropriations of the present session are unusual . The River and . Harbor bill , carrying over $22,000,000 , has been excused by the plea that no appropriation of that character was made at all last year , and . one-half of it should be marked off from the annual charge to that account . The Deficiency bill of last year also failed , and appropriations have to be made for the deficiencies of two years and more . Besides , an unusual appropriation is proposed for fortifications , and an increase of nearly three millions has been made to the Indian bill to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $20,000,000 of the appropriations of the year is to be set down as not belonging to the present year 's expenses , and as much more may fairly be assigned to extravagant allowances that would have no support if the revenues were gauged according to an economical standard . This , with the actual surplus of the present fiscal year , assuming all the proposed appropriations to be made and the revenues not to exceed the estimates , would make more than the amount of reduction provided for in the Mills bill , to say nothing about the surplus already accumulated . This cry about large appropriations and a possibly small surplus for the present year is another attempt of the enemies of tariff reform to get up a scare and a stampede ; it is another of their false pretenses made in the hope of deluding the minds of the people . But what is the significance of this enormous revenue of more than $440,000 , - 000 a year and this effort to expend it ? Where does this money , a hundred million dollars of which the Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not get one cent of money which does not come out of the production of the country . All its revenues are drawn from that which labor applied to the resources of the country produces . They may be paid directly by importers for the privilege of furnishing our people with foreign goods , but the amount is refunded to them in the prices at which these goods are sold , and the consumers pay every cent of it . And what they pay to the Government they can not have for themselves . It deducts so much from the product of their labor for public use and leaves them so much the less for their own use , and so far as the revenues are not needed for legitimate purposes it is an unjust tribute exacted from the people . But worse than this , so far as taxes on imports are made unnecessarily high for the purpose of enabling capitalists in certain favored interests to make exorbitant profits , consumers are forced to contribute from the fruits of their labor to these profits . Under the present tariff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producers to the fostered monopolies as goes to the Government . And yet we are told that the system encourages industries and increases the reward of labor . The people must understand this simple fact , that taxation produces nothing and adds nothing to production . It is always a burden and . an expense . So far as it is made to give the Government what it does not need it is unjust . So far as it is made to contribute to the profits of private capital it is robbery .
