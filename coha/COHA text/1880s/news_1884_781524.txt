txt The dime novel is steadily doing its demoralizing work . The other day seven youthful desperadoes , all of whom were under 12 years of age , were arrested in a small country town through which runs the White River Canal . The prisoners had formed a secret society called the " Robeson Gang , " and ' it was their habit to go on board the canal-boats laid up for the Winter near their village and to break up the decks and planking with hatchets and saws . These " repairs , " as the young criminals called their destructive operations , were executed at night , and the wood thus obtained was made into kindlings and sold by the gang in the daytime . Before the existence of the gang was discovered more than half the fleet of canal-boats had been hopelessly wrecked . When arrested and questioned , the small-boys explained that : they had conceived their system of , canal-boat wrecking after reading in the daily papers ' the exploits of ex-Secretary ROBESON , and that they intended , after providing themselves with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go to New-York ' and secretly repair . such men-of-war as they might find in the navyyard . Scarcely has the news of the arrest of this juvenile " Robeson Gang " been made public than it is announced that Mr. ROBESON contemplates writing his autobiography . There is not an intelligent parent in the land who will not be filled with dread at this announcement . The dime biographies of such eminent persons as the JAMES boys and the FORD boys are written by men who know little of the true history of those popular criminals ; and yet the biographies in question do incalculable harm . If Mr. ROBESON writes his own life , it will have the merit of more or less truthfulness , and hence will be more powerful for evil than any of the dime biographies of noted malefactors now in circulation . It is rumored that the threatened autobiography will be entitled " Robeson , the Wild Repairer : or , The Terror of the Navy , " and will be illustrated with coarse wood-cuts showing the hero in the act of repairing vessels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feats . The book will , of course , achieve a tremendous popularity . Every small-boy will feel that ids library is incomplete unless " Robeson , the Wild Repairer " is concealed in his school desk ; and " Robeson . Gangs " formed by youthful admirers of the " Terror of the Navy " will spring up in every town where there are boats or vessels of any sort to be repaired . It is devoutly to be wished that Mr. ROBESON would reconsider his alleged purpose of becoming a dime author . Rather let him follow the example of certain other eminent Americans and make an engagement to exhibit himself in a dime museum . Without doubt he could command a high salary , and his exhibition would do far less harm to the rising generation than his threatened book would do , for the reason that where one boy would visit the museum to gaze upon ROBESON , the Wild Repairer , a hundred boys would read a dime biography with the same attractive title .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
