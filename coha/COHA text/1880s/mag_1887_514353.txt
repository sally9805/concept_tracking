BY HENRY P. WELLS . EITHER from pictorial representations or from an examination of the prepared specimens abounding in our museums , all are sufficiently familiar with the long legs of this animal , which , together with the short round body , the thick horizontal neck , rendered more disproportioned by its heavy coating of hair , the long wattle which hangs like an oldfashioned purse from underneath the angles of the jaw , the shovel-like antlers , the small sinister eyes , the enormous ears , the apology for a tail , and the prodigiously long and ugly head , finished with a nose resembling a half-inflated foot-ball , make the moose perhaps the most ill-favored of four-footed beasts . Therefore to view it with the eye of the naturalist in an article not technical in its character would be merely a work of supererogation . While its best friends can but admit and deplore the utter absence of grace in its form and motion , they recognize in and claim for it the beauty of utility in a degree so pre-eminent as to sink all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly seven feet at the fore - shoulder , and a weight of fourteen hundred pounds , no one can find fault with the quantity of food it may supply , while an attempt to compare the quality of this with that of any other four-footed creature , except to the disparagement of the latter , will but elicit a smile of mingled pity and contempt from those whose good fortune it has been to encounter and overcome it in its native wilds . If , then , we view it with the hunter 's eye , it must not be forgotten that though all animals , wherever found , bear the general impress stamped upon their species by the hand of Nature , they still retain some individuality of character , as well as adaptability to the surroundings in which they may be placed . Whenever , therefore , the habits or pursuit of any animal are under discussion , it would seem wise to restrict it to some specified locality ; for though the main features will doubtless be everywhere alike , still the details may vary . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canada from Maine is the backbone , and confine ourselves exclusively to that region . Not only does the quantity and quality of the food it affords endear the moose to the hunter , but that ungainly head is stuffed full of brains . Those prodigious ears are ever trimmed , like the wind-sails of an ocean steamer , to catch the lightest breath of the fickle wind , and to apprehend and determine the cause of the faintest sound which may be borne upon it . Though its eyesi*ht is by no means of the keenest , its preposterous nose is acute beyond comparison to detect the least taint in the air , and to give warning that it would be prudent to be elsewhere . Nor are these hints of danger ever unheeded . If the sense of hearing is offended , the animal steals away , even over the most encumbered ground , with a stillness little short of miraculous . Not the rustle of a branch or the cracking of the smallest twig attends its departure . Were it not that the departing track betrays the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin air , and that the hunter had really pursued a fiction of his own imagination . But if the sense of smell gives warning , particularly if the taint is that of man , all precaution is thrown to the winds . Those long , ungainly legs are then instantly galvanized into an awkward shamblin* , trot , and crashing through the forest with a noise like a railroad train off the track , the startled animal fairly devours space with the speed of its flight . And the exhausted hunter who has followed the track hour after hour , perhaps even day after day , with every sense on the alert , shrinking from no personal effort or discomfort that every possible precaution may be taken , recognizes at once the signs that proclaim defeat to his practised eye ; and in such terms as he deems appropriate to the occasion bewails that when hope had almost become fruition he stepped on that fatal twig , or allowed the stock of his rifle to rasp against that bush ; or anathematizes the fickle wind which eddied at so inopportune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hopes . In still hunting , of the nature of which the foregoing will give some intimation , it is essential that the hunter sees the game // before it suspects his presence . The region under consideration consists of one sea of forest-covered mountains , interspersed with valleys , also heavily timbered , which conduct the drainage of the country to the ocean . The annual rainfall is great , and so ponds , lakes , and nvers are numerous . Other openings in the apparently endless forest are , however , rare , and when they occur , usually take the form of alder swamps , where the vegetation is even denser and concealment more perfect than in the forest itself . Therefore , until the November storms HEAD OF BULL MOOSE . // have stripped all deciduous trees of their leaves and cushioned the ground with snow , the progress of the hunter through the woods is necessarily so slow and noisy , and the range of his vision is so limited , that this form of hunting affords little or no hope of success . Presuming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the pressure of absolute necessity , a cow moose or her calves would be unmolested , let us turn our attention to the hulls  --  the only legitimate object of the hunter 's ambition . The velvet is rubbed from its horns , and they are hard and well polished , by the 1st of September ; and since at no season is it in such perfect physical conditi6n , let us then begin our hunt . Unattractive as is the personal appearance of a bull moose , his moral nature and disposition are no less disreputable . Solitary and alone , with his big ears set like the spinnaker of a racing cutter , and his supersensitive nose ever on duty , he dozes away the day in some secluded spot high on a mountain-side . But two thoughts find room within his gigantic head  --  to keep his stomach full and his hide whole ; and to these , especially the latter , every resource of his nature is devoted . He is the embodiment of pure and undiluted selfishness . As daylight wanes he rises and stretches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truant wind whether his precious skin is safe , he wanders slowly and with frequent pauses down the mountain - side , if not embodying it in words , still with the fixed intention of carrying out in practice the precepts of that immoral song , " We wo n't go home till morning " He prefers to adhere to one locality , until his pre-eminent regard for his own personal safety forces him elsewhere . He knows every stream and every patch of water for miles around ; and to one of these , either where the long grass growing from the bottom of the stream waves with the current , or where the yellow water-lily dots the surface of some forest pond , he is bound . The hunter is also well informed as to the local topography ; and judging about where moose would be most likely to spend the day , and knowing what food-bearing stream or pond is most accessible from that direction , he there seeks his game . Should the moon be at or near the full , he cruises the stream in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overhanging bushes , and stopping frequently to listen ; for from the sense of hearing alone does he expect the first intimation that a successful issue is possible . If it is a pond , and a small one , he brings his canoe beside some part of the bank where the wind will be favorable and where concealment is possible , and there waits hour after hour , " hugging the delusive phantom of hope , " the perfect silence unbroken , except by the beating of his own heart when he hears , or fancies he hears , the tread of some heavy animal . Amid the thousand imaginary noises which have assailed his ears so long , was that really the snap of some branch or twig ? Yes , for there comes the sound again , this time clear , sharp , and unmistakable . Deliberately , with frequent pauses of greater or less duration , some animal is approaching with long low strides . Will he take to the water or not ? Alas , no ! He skirts the pond just within the edge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moonlight penetrates not one single inch . Nearer and nearer comes the sound , varied b* intervals of silence when the animal stops to feed , or , as is more probable , to listen . At last it is within forty feet of the ambush . Each leaf fringing the wood shines like silver in the moonlight , but beyond all is Egyptian darkness . In vain does the hunter , with rifle on the full cock , strain every sense to localize the animal . The tension of his nerves is far too great to determine within twenty feet where the sound really comes from ; and unwilling to fire where there is not one chance in a hundred that the shot will be effective , he allows the game to depart as it came , unmolested . Such is the result of this form of hunting at least nine times out of ten ; and as it grows toward dawn the hunter returns to camp , tired and disgusted clear through . Whether this or indeed any other method of moose hunting is contemplated , camp is made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a night comparatively free from wind . Then no fire is built after noon , nor is a blow struck with the axe . The water is approached at a right angle , and far from where the game is likely to appear ; for a fence forty feet high would not more surely bar the way of a moose than the // footsteps of a man tracking the margin of the hunting ground . It has already been intimated that the moose may seek his food where the yellow water-lily is found . It is not , however , the leaves nor the blossoms which are sought , but the roots . These extend in a perfect net-work through the mud in which they grow , attaining a thickness exceeding a man 's arm , and an indefinite length . In color they are a pale greenish or yellowish white , smooth on the exterior , except for a number of eyes like those on a pineapple , somewhat elastic to the touch , and pithy within . There is no disputing about tastes , and consequently we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vegetable . But to the human palate it is dry , insipid , and puckery . To obtain this he will wade out into the water , and souse his head beneath the surface until even his ears are submerged . Then , having wrenched a chunk of greater or less length from its bed , he withdraws his head , and dripping water from each of the numerous angles which characterize his ugly physiognomy , he stands the picture of pure animal enjoyment , chewing away at one end of the root , while the other sticks out of his mouth like a cigar . To catch him in the middle of this performance is the constant burden of the hunter 's prayers . Should the night promise to be still , warm , and dark , the hunter scours the refiector of his jack until it shines like silver , and breathes upon and wipes its glass lens until it is speckless . The lamp within should emit a powerful light ; but the casing must be so constructed that not the faintest glimmer can escape until its aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glass , is dropped . For though a deer will almost always tempt fate by standing stock-still , gaping at a light like a backwoodsman in a city . the moose is no such fool . If he has any curiosity , lie recognizes the great general principle that there is a time for all things , and that the time to study an unusual phenomenon comes only after he has betaken himself to cover . In this , as in most other forms of moose hunting , two form the company-one to do the work , while the other takes in the fun-and , as in many other things in this life , ultimate success depends more on the skill of the former than on that of the latter . After the jack has been lit some twenty minutes , so that the maximum of light possible without smoke is assured , the pair betake themselves to the canoe . Blankets are spread on the bottom of the boat to deaden any motion of the feet . He who is to shoot seats himself in the bow , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arranges the jack . This is best suspended from a frame behind the rifleman ; but it should be so connected with his head that the beam of light will follow its every motion when the jack is open . With the glass uncovered , the rifle is thrown to the shoulder , and the connection of the jack with the head-gear is so adjusted that when the most convenient aim is taken , it will be directly in the centre of illumination . Thus both sights of the rifle are perfectly visible , and the difficulty is no longer to shoot with accuracy , but only to obtain a sufficiently distinct view of the object to be hit . When this is complete , the other takes his place in the stern , folds his blanket over his lap , and grasping his paddle , pushes from the bank . The jack is then closed , and complete darkness and silence follow . As noiseless as the shadow of a cloud , the canoe steals along , and hour aftem* hour its occupants , relying solely on the sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the near neighborhood of the game they seek . It is not so hard on the paddler , since the exercise keeps his blood in circulation and his nerves in some sort of condition . But the man in the bow fares differently . Aches and pains declare themselves in all sorts of places , together with the most insane desire to cough , or sneeze , or blow his nose , or do something else equally inopportune . He strains his ears till they almost crack ; he thinks he hears all kinds of noises , until his confidence in his ability to distinguish the real from the imaginary is almost destroyed . He suffers , but he suffers in silence , and with patient resignation . Should a sound be heard near , but not on or in the stream , the canoe pauses , and minute drags after minute ; perhaps even an hour is passed without sound or motion , until it is certain that it was a false alarm , or that the animal has betaken itself elsewhere . At last , when endurance seems no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow and measured sound-slosh , slosh , slosh ; and then all is still again . The heart of the hunter shrivels within him to the size of a lemon , and flies into his throat , where it keeps up such a thumping that it seems impossible the noise should escape the quick ear of the game . With the utmost caution the rifle is brought to the full cock , and the left hand freed , ready to open the jack at the preconcerted signal , which it is the duty of the paddler to give . Every ache and pain is at once forgotten in the all-absorbing question , Will he remain in the water , or take to the bank , and burying himself in the woods , escape ? For he is still far beyond the range of the jack , and not till it will surely show him up must it be opened . If the motion of the canoe was slow before , it seems doubly so now , and minute after minute , each apparently an hour , drags on , and still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Are his suspicions aroused , and is he retreating ? This and a thousand other thoughts alternately chill the hunter 's heart with fear or fire it with hope . At length , after a seemingly endless delay , comes the signal to open the jack , and the light streams forth . There he stands , midleg-deep in the water , dim , shadowy , and monstrous , his eyes glaring green in the light , with the malevolence of a demon . He will stay but for a second , and only to decide which way to retreat . Raise the rifle slowly , but lose no time . Draw as careful a bead as though shooting at a two-inch bull's-eye , and give it to him right through-not behind-the middle of the fore-shoulder . For a second the smoke obscures the result . Is he down or up ? In either case , dose him again if you can ; but if you can not , close the jack at once . Now is no time to ask your companion , Do you think I hit him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , and listen . Does he burst into and tear through the woods as though he had gone into the kindling-wood business and was laying in a winter 's stock , and do you hear him crashing and smashing until the sound dies away on the distant mountain-side ? It was a clear miss , or at best a graze . But no ; the uproar dies away , and a silence you can almost feel ensues . What sound is that from the neighboring woods ? There he is ! You can hear him breathe , and wheeze at every inspiration . It is well . The shot Was , c* little too far back , but it was pretty well placed , *ll the same . Now withdraw with the stillness of death itself , and not until at least half a mile intervenes whisper , to your companion , " Well , I guess that 's our meat ; what do you think ? " For if from any act of yours he discovers what has hurt him , particularly if you attempt to land , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be in desperate peril , or he will travel till he drops , perhaps miles and miles away , and the foxes and other marauders of the forest alone will profit by his death . Whereas , if you leave him to attribute his distress to a stroke of lightning or a fit of indi-* gestion , or to any cause other than the agency of man , you will find him in the morning , if not lying dead where you last heard him , at all events so enfeebled that you may still-hunt him with the certainty of success . That the hero of the dime novel , whose bullet never deviates from its destination by the thousandth part of a hair's-breadth , always aims behind the fore-shoulder , is not forgotten . Still , notwithstanding the pain inseparable from a difference with an authority so far superior to any the writer has ever met , he can not help thinking this a mistaken practice on the part of that hero . It is no better than a lung shot , seldom instantly , sometimes not even ultimately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be driven through the centre of the fore-shoulder , and somewhere about ten inches above the bottom line of the body . To insure a satisfactory result , a solid ball impelled by plenty of powder is necessary . I have known a moose to be killed ' with a 32-calibre bullet as well as a 38 , both from rim-fire cartridges , and a 44 bullet from a Ballard carbine , driven by only twenty-eight grains of powder , to go clean through the animal , cutting the aorta in its passage . But , notwithstanding , a 50-calibre bullet and ninety-five grains of powder are better adapted for this kind of work . Had I but the courage of my convictions , and were I but assured that I should shoot only at the short distances customary in night hunting , I should use a ten-gauge cylinder-borej shot-gun , and a hardened round ball before six drains of the best powder . A head shot is always a poor shot , for ' the brain lies far back . If the animal is facing the hunter , the nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vital point . Then where the neck joins the body is the surest place , a little into the neck doing no harm . A broadside shot right in the root of the ear is sure death , but it is a small mark where the light is uncertain and not to be recommended . Through the neck , about five or six inches below its upper edge and a little back of the head , will drop a moose as though he was struck by lightning . He will not even give a single kick , but wilt in his tracks like a wet rag . It is more instantaneous in effect than through the middle of the heart itself , and if the hunter is sure he can do it , is the best of all shots . But the preliminaries to moose shooting are not conducive to accurate marksmanship , so perhaps the centre of the fore-shoulder , or the root of the neck , according to the po " OUR MEAT . " // HARPER 'S NEW MONTHLY MAGAZINE . qwq this an art not to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural aptitude . To describe any sound so as to convey a clear idea of its nature to one who has never heard the like is almost impossible . We will , however , endeavor to describe the call , which may be considered the primer part of moose talk , omitting the rest as altogether hopeless . The sound is made in the hunter 's throat , and when it is begun , and when its character is not modified by the horn , it sounds as though a foreigner were groaning out the word " err . " It requires capacious lungs , for the call is long drawn out , passing gradually into a roar and a howl , and dying away again . Though the call is thrice repeated , the inflection must be varied each time , as well as the force . The rest , as far as it is possible in print , will appear incidentally . The individuality of the response of the bull is quite marked . He may answer in words , emitting a single short , sharp sound , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so large an animal ; or he may say nothing . In any event , he will come , as straight as the crow flies , to the spot from whence the call issued . However dark the woods , he never seems to lose his reckoning . If his practised ear detect nothing amiss in the call , he will probably come crashing through the woods without thought of concealment . But if his suspicions are aroused , no sound will indicate his approach until he is within a few feet of the hunter . If he has the folly and ardor of youth , and the call has been all right , he will bounce right out of the woods into the open without a moment 's hesitation ; but if experienced , he always hesitates to leave cover , cruising up and down'within the edge of the forest , circling around the spot from whence the call came , stamping and pawing up the earth , and swinging his huge head from side to side , while he snuffs the air in the futile endeavor to ascertain what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called him to her side . It must be borne in mind that as long as the animal remains within the fringe of the woods the keenest eye can not see him , nor the most acute ear locate him with sufficient accuracy to justify a shot , no matter how much noise he may make . He must be induced to come out into the open , or the result will be abortive . But it is useless to continue this description further . Every approach has something peculiar to itself . It is the office of the artist who bears the horn to judge of the humor of the animal from his conduct , and to decide whether a sigh , a grunt , a groan , a howl , a roar , or any mixture of these sounds , or any other demonstration , or absolute silence , will best serve to seduce him from the shelter of the forest where he is safe , into the open ground where he is not . Rarely is the issue decided at once , while it may be protracted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance again , perhaps for an hour or more , hope and fear alternating in the mean time in the hunter 's mind as regularly and unceasingly as the oscillations of the pendulum of a clock . Since the first gray of the morning we have backed our heavy packs through the trackless forests of Canada , until in the twilight we approach one of the comparatively few spots in that wilderness suitable for , moose calling . A timber-covered mountain slopes down to a hog covered with moss , open except for a few islands of stunted spruce and tamarack trees . The forest forms one and a pond of some size the other margin of this bog . All day we have examined the sky at every opportunity , hoping and praying for a still , clear night-for on no other is there a chance of success  --  and we have it . A cold and hasty supper is eaten ; and taking our blankets , the horn , and the rifle , we cross the pond on an extemporized raft ( or in any other way possible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees on the bog near the water , in the immediate vicinity of which there is no other cover . With special care we look to it that our trail to the stand can not be approached at any point , by anything , without exposing it to view . Night has fallen , though the full-moon lights up every object in the open so that it seems ahnost as bright as day . The caller takes his horn , and applying it to his lips , silently breathes through it a few times to dampen its interior , on the same principle that the rustic flutist pours water through his flute to facilitate the production of the tone . He then inflates his lungs to their fullest capacity two or three times ; and taking in the last cubic inch of air he can find room for , applies the horn to his lips , its mouth pointing // directly , to the ground . A weird , unearthly sound rises on the , still night air , not loud at first , hut gradually gaining strength and rising in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so wild so plaintive , it would almost move a heart of stone . During the call , which may have been protracted some thirty seconds , the mouth of the horn has gradually described a figure something like the number 8 in the air , the highest elevation coinciding with the middle of the crescendo ; and the movement is completed with the mouth of the horn again pointing nearly at the ground . The following illustration will perhaps give a clearer idea of this than any mere verbal description : a indicating the mouth of the caller , and b the mouth of the horn pointing to the ground ; the arrows show the direction of the motion . I first effort in this respect , as it should in* loudness . Another pause , briefer than . before , and again it breaks the oppressive stillness of the night . It starts with every accent of impatience , and as loud as is consistent with an increase of force at the finish . The intensity of the tone is varied , as is the motion of the horn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountain , the call ends in a wild roar delivered with all the power of the caller 's lungs , terminating in silence as abruptly as possible when at the very loudest . Anxiety , impatience , and terror struggle for the mastery in this call . Then , for , three-quarters of an hour by the watch , and three-quarters of a month judged without that useful monitor , not a sound must be made . No greater mistake is possible than to call too frequently . Few , if any , can imitate it throughout with absolute faultlessness ; and if so protracted an effort be submitted to the more than acute criticism of a moose at close quarters , he may , regard it as a warning to be gone rather than an invitation to come . Therefore full three-quarters of an hour is usu f ally allowed as sufficient to enable any nimal that is approaching on the first invitation to make his presence known . Both caller and hunter must attend strictly to their ears and nothing else . No smoking , no conversation , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good night , and , with a good horn and man to use it , the call may be distinguished by the quick ear of a moose at a distance of perhaps two miles or more . His reply , if he make any , is far too feeble to he heard onequarter of that distance . That the caller should hear the approach of the animal at the earliest moment , that he may judge of the temper he is in , and to what form of coaxing he will be most amenable , is of the utmost importance . Often-yes , generally-even when the night is suitable , nothing will be heard . The call is then repeated a second time , followed by a second wait . If this fails , a third trial may be made , but it is advisable , if there is any other suitable place within reach , to change the locality . If none such is known , and the third call is fruitless , the hunter may conclude that either no bull moose is within hearing distance , or if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE HORN IN THE MOOSE CALL . The head of the caller conforms to the movement by bending the neck , and the result is a peculiar quavering inflection , difficult to obtain otherwise , and essential to success . A pause of two or three seconds , and again the cry rings out . It is pitched this time a little higher in the scale , and the greatest volume of sound is nearer the beginning ; the pitch again rising with the intensity of the tone , quavering , and dying away again as before . Into this call all the pathos and longing must be thrown of which the caller is master-at all events it must exceed the b // has a companion , and consequently is " deaf to the voice of the charmer , charm he never so wisely . " But let us assume a case of better fortune . The first thing that strikes the novice is how cold it is growing . It insinuates itself into every crevice in his clothes , findin g defects of the existence of which he never dreamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bones . He has thought he has heard all kinds of things since the call . He looks at his watch , sure that the appointed time has fully elapsed , and finds that its hands indicate only fifteen minutes . What was that ? A sound half between a grunt and a bark , yet so brief in duration that its exact character is difficult to determine . The caller whispers , " He 's coming . " The blood which seemed like ice in the hunter 's veins but a moment before , now burns like fire . Now a crash is heard in the woods , followed by the breaking of twigs . At last the sound ceases at the edge of the woods , perhaps thirty yards distant , and a dead silence follows . Again the animal moves , pausing at every few steps to listen , and gradually working around the edge of the forest nearer and nearer to the ambush . The excitement is now at fever heat ; but when it seems the next step must bring him into the moonlight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halting at frequent intervals as before , and stamping and thrashing his antlers about among the bushes . He is now further off than when lie first came in ; it may be he is leaving altogether ! Now is the time for the caller to show his skill . It is kill or cure now , for a mistake in either moose idiom , grammar , or pronunciation will be fatal . Whispering to the hunter to remain as still as death till he is ready to shoot , and not to fire till he can see the animal plainly , and is sure it will come no nearer , the caller steals out from the trees , and judging how the moose is travelling , and carefully keeping them between him and it , he hastens out about a hundred yards to a convenient shelter . Then raising his horn to his lips , he gives the bull 's challenge . A crash answers the call , and all prudence THE CALL . // routed by jealousy , the moose rushes for his supposed rival . The caller has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there to where he supposes the moose to be will run over the open ground , and near the concealed hunter . As the animal passes , without a thought other than to rout and drive away the supposed intruder , the rifle is discharged , and staggering forward , he falls , shot through the heart . By the end of November the bulls forsake the cows , and move for high land . As the snows of winter deepen , their wanderings become more and more restricted , and they locate on the north or northwest faces of the highest mountains the country affords . This is " yarding. ** A moose yard is not , as is generally supposed , a place where the snow is trodden down as level and hard as a threshing-floor , but simply numbers of tracks wandering hither and thither , often where but a single animal has passed . The bulls yard apart from the cows , sometimes alone , but usually in company . Here they exhibit some little sociability , feeding and lying down within hearing distance of one another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons would be likely to do when gathering berries . When one locality is fed out , they gradually wander off to fresh ground . Crust hunting is based on this characteristic . Were the selfishness of man influenced a little more by regard for the future rather than for the immediate present , this form of hunting might have something to commend it . The cows and young yard by themselves , and their inferior strength and endurance render them a far less dangerous and much more easy capture than the bulls . Consequently the slaughter falls chiefly on those that should never be disturbed at all . Again , as might be expected from such as kill the female or young of any game animal , except where food is actually necessary , frequently no moderation whatever is shown , the number killed depending solely on the ability of the hunter , uninfluenced by his necessities , or any other consideration except the few dollars he may be able to get for a hide . Therefore this form of hunting is usually and properly prohibited by law ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is due the disappearance of this animal from localities where it once abounded . The hunter has located the yard for a month or more ; and when in March a cold clear night promises no thaw on the following day , the time for crust , hunting has come . The snow has then settled by its own weight until it is about five feet deep and quite hard . An actual crust is quite unnecessary ; indeed , in these woods it is of rare occurrence , since the snow is in great measure protected from the direct rays of the sun by the density of the evergreen forest . About an inch of superficial light snow is also desirable , since it cushions the snow-shoes , and thus favors speed and endurance . Before daybreak the hunter clothes himself in two heavy flannel shirts , and thick drawers and trousers , but no coat . He covers his feet with four pairs of the heaviest of yarn stockings , one over the other , and places outside of all a pair of moose or caribou shanks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made by peeling the skin from the hind-legs of the animal , from about six inches above the gambrel joint to a distance below equal to the length of the hunters foot . The smaller end is then sewn up to form the toe ; and thus a moose-hide stocking is formed , of which the gambrel joint is the heel . No boots or shoes are worn while snow-shoeing . At the first gray of dawn he binds on his snow-shoes and slings his pack , in which has been placed a frying-pan , a tea pail , a tin cup , knife , fork , and spoon , flour , pork , tea , salt , and pepper . His inseparable companion , an axe , is fastened on the outside . He may either take a single blanket , or trust to luck to get a fresh moose-hide to sleep on . His pipe , tobacco , and matches are not forgotten , nor a good-sized single-bladed jack-knife , which is the only hunting knife he ever carries . Sheath-knives are considered a mere encumbrance , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly if large , is considered th' badge of a greenhorn . Reaching the yard , he first circles it completely , to find the freshest tracks , and thus locate the animals . This is not as easy as it sounds , since the snow falls back into and almost fills the track as soon as made , so that they all , of whatever age , look pretty much alike . Here , in case of doubt , the touch aids the vision , the old snow being hard , and the fresh // soft , the degree of induration indicating when the surface was broken . By the time he has completed the circuit he has also made up his mind in what part of the yard they are , and goes directly for them , still working on the freshest trail . Long before he is in sight or hearing the moose have discovered his presence , and are off . The hunter continues on till he finds where they have ceased wandering about , and have moved away in a straight line . At the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that , though all take the same general direction , they move in skirmishing order , adhering to their old tracks , and crossing from one trail to another . But soon they strike the snow-shoe track . It bears the unmistakable taint of man , and if they were alarmed before , they are frantic now . Then they " break yard , " as it is called , and falling in one behind the other , start down the mountain in close column , never to face rising ground again as long as they are pressed . They move on a square trot , raising each leg clear of the snow at every stride , those in the rear stepping in the track of their leader , so that it looks pretty much the same whether there are half a dozen animals or but one . The hunter is after them at his best speed , that he may overtake them at the earliest possible moment , and thus prevent them from stopping to rest . He receives his first encouragement when he sees where one or more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . They are beginning to be heated and distressed . Next it is noticed that the holes made by their legs in the snow are more broken , and it is clear they are not raising them with the same vigor as at the outset . Then he sees where the leader has slackened his pace , and another from the rear has crowded by him , thus showing for the moment two trails instead of one . Then the steps shorten , the snow is more scraped at every stride , the marks of eating the snow become more frequent , and the track begins to bear some resemblance to a trench . Before , they followed a straight line through thick and thin ; now , they deviate toward the thicker growths , either hoping to find less snow and better travelling there , or for concealment . Next the hunter notices flakes of froth lying on the snow , and the trail begins to look as though made by a plough . At last specks of blood appear in the froth , and the hunter knows the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see his game for the first time . He comes in sight at last . Before , he has followed close heside the trail ; now , he edges off to the right . The game pause for a moment to study their pursuer , their coats flecked with foam , and their tongues hanging almost a foot out of their mouths , from the fearful exertion they have made . Then , spurred by a new impulse of fear , they are off again as though perfectly fresh . At once the hunter throws his pack upon the snow , and discarding everything which can impede his movements in the slightest degree , except his rifle , pushes them with all the vigor that hope can inspire . But the almost exhausted animals can not hold their spurt more than a quarter of a mile at the outside . Soon the hunter closes with them , again edging off to the right . As he swings toward the right , they edge off to the left , always trying to keep him behind . He watches the course made with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it possible that they may gain their old trail , he drops behind and ranges up on the other side , and thus drives them in the opposite direction . For the pursuer is now almost as tired as the pursued , and should the latter once enter the beaten track , encouraged by the comparatively easy travelling they will find , they will seem so to gain fresh vigor that he can not hold them in sight for an instant . They will then go right back to and through the yard , and off to a new locality , and the hunter may as well give it up for a bad job . This , however , is not likely to occur , unless he loses his reckoning of the direction which the chase has taken . At this stage the effort of the hunter is to get a broadside shot , and after some trials he succeeds in reaching the desired position . But he must not approach too nearnot closer than twenty-five or thirty yards -  --  or he will see the hair along the spine of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward , its ears to lie straight back , and its eyes grow green and glassy . Then , quicker than a flash , it swings on its hind-legs like a pivot , and is at him . Woe betide the hunter if he trusts to speed to escape . Even in that heavy snow the moose , now goaded to absolute madness , // is for the time more than his match . Nothing is to be apprehended from his antlers . But those terrible forefeet can strike with the quickness of a prize-fighter and with the force of a sledge-hammer .

This accomplished , he cnts a forked tree , the butt two or three inches in diameter , and the prongs about four feet long , and trims the butt to an angle on one side .

He now l ) acks the snow hard , spreads the moosehide upon it , lays the fork on the hide , the butt toward the neck , folds the hide over it , places his meat on it , flattening the bottom perfectly smooth , and allows the whole to freeze .
