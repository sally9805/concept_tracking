THE CENTENNIAL anniversary of our national political system has naturally led to much discussion concerning the moral tone of our existing political parties , as compared with those which controlled the government at the time of its foundation . It can not be denied that there are elements of discouragement visible in the political conditions of to-day , which in a way warrant the criticisms of publicists . The greed of office is clearly greater , or , at least , is found in a larger proportion of the population , than it was a century ago . Our political parties appear to be more inspired by the desire for plunder than for principles . The political situation of our cities is legitimately a source of anxiety to many persons who are by no means pessimists . There are always in every community persons who despair of the IRepublic , and who contemn the actions of their own generation and find that all things tend to ruin . It is fit that these questioners of their own age should be heard ; that from time to time those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take account of the state of society and make what answer they can to those of melancholy mind . I propose , therefore , in the following pages to review some part of the evidence which may serve to show how far the political morals of this country have been affected by the first century of our national life . In entering on an inquiry as to the comparative political morals of the two periods a century apart , we should , in the first place , note the fact that it is not safe to trust our conclusions to the evidence which is derived from any particular class of facto . We can not , for instance , prove a general decadence of moral sense in politics by the present excessive greed of office , unless we can make sure that the conditions which led to that desire are substantially the same at the present time as formerly . It may be // that there are peculiar reasons why the greed of office should be far more manifest at present than of old . Any inquiry which seeks to determine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as those we are now considering must take account of the general tone exhibited by the people , and not trust to mere incidents in political behavior . The question before ns concerns the essential trustworthiness of the men in the two periods . We must ascertain how far a century of political training has served to develop the faithfulness of our citizens-that spirit of devotion to the public interests which causes men to put aside or sacrifice their individual greed to ideals of public duty . It is by no means easy to find data which can be made to serve in a satisfactory way to determine the relative condition of political morals in widely-separated periods in the development of a state . Few of the features in public conduct lend themselves to statistical interpretation . One of the points of critical importance which I have been able to seize upon concerns the conduct of our soldiers during the Revolutionary period and in the time of the Civil War . The behavior of citizens under the stress of civil war clearly affords a better clew to their essential motives than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such periods of disturbance men are in a measure detachei*l from their ordinary limitations of conduct . They are , in a way , free to show the nature of their impulses without reference to the principles which guide them in the ordinary well-regulated conditions of society . If a people are by nature brutal , this quality may in peaceful civil conditions be entirely concealed , and yet appear with startling clearness in civil commotion . Thus in the case of the French , in the usual course of that well-regulated country no one would suspect the brutal motive which has never failed to manifest itself in the revolutionary periods . Just as the innate motives of men appear when they are affected by wine , so , when they are drunk with revolutionary excitement , we get an insight into the qualities of their nature which may be altogether hidden at other periods . Taking for our problem the state of the public mind as regards the trust of political affairs , let us compare the behavior of our Revolutionary officers with that of the men engaged in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compelled in the main to limit the discussion to the superior officers engaged on either side // in these great American conflicts , for the reason that we have no means for adequately comparing the conduct of the common soldiers of either period . In the Revolutionary army we readily note the frequent existence of bad faith among the leading officers . The treason of Arnold , the treacherous motives of Charles Lee , the intrigniug humor of Gates and his cabal , the endless selfseeking and half-hearted treachery of many other men , not only cloud the memories of those days , but doubtless did much to degrade the motives and imperil the issue of that contest . It must not be supposed that the men of that time in this country were less trustworthy than those of their day in other lands . They were the fair successors of such soldiers as John Churchill led-men who frequently looked upon public trust as a step to private gain . It was the humor of that time which we find in Arnold and the other self-seekers of our Revolutionary period . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halters about their necks and with the certainty of ruin awaiting them if their cause was lost ; and yet we find a great number of them anything but trustworthy . If the reader would secure a clear sense of the conditions of public trust in this period , he should read the memoirs of General James WIlkinson , which present a picture that stands in sharp and painful contrast to any which can be painted of our newer day . As regards the measure of trustworthiness of the leading soldiers of our country , the records of the Civil War are in singular contrast with those of the Revolution . All the circumstances of our second civil war tended strongly to increase the element of untrustworthiness in the conduct of the leading men . The difficulty between the two sections was of an extremely obscure nature . In other civil wars the matter in debate has concerned the successions of a kingly house , questions of religious faith , innovations of ancient privileges , or other things which directly appeal to the personal interests of the contestants . Our Civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter concerned the interests of the slave-holding class , but the immediate causes of the conflict rest on obscure theories of government , on the ideals of the commonwealth , which never before have to such a measure entered into a civil contest . It is a well-known fact that a large part of the contestants were in a divided state of mind . They acknowledged an allegiance to the Federal Government , against which they had to set the ties of // the several commonwealths in which they dwelt . I know by my personal experience how difficult it was to determine the measure of these diverse allegiances . It is clear that it cost the greater part of those who were by birth Southern a sore trial to determine with which duty they should cast in their lot . So , too , with at least the large part of the border settlements who cast in their lot with the union . In spirit they were with both causes . Their social , and in part their political , training inclined them to serve with the South . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Federal arms . We thus see that the situation was one calculated to make men undecided as to their course of action . In another country aud at another time the result would have been to breed up a host of free-lances , who would have fought first with one side , then with the other , as their changing moods were led to and fro by the varying chances of the long conflict . The surprising part of our Civil War-perhaps the most surprising feature in that marvellous contest-was that from the beginning to the end there is no case in which an officer of any grade is known to have gone over to the enemy . Desertions of private soldiers from one side to the other were relatively rare . There were occasional cases in which men forced into the army on either side took Vhe first chance which offered to range themselves in the army to which their principles attracted them . I have been unable to find a case in which such action was ever taken by any military unii*  --  a company , regiment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defeat , a number of our officers of the Federal Army were accused of half-heartedness or treachery , the sober verdict of history has always been in their favor . It was the most satisfactory feature of our Civil War that in the worst mischances of lost battles and unsuccessful campaigns the men never lost their confidence in the moral integrity of their chiefs . Although in the curious freedom of speech which characterized our armies the men frequently condemned their leaders as fools , they never seemed to question the trustworthiness of their motives . I had an opportunity to mingle more or less with soldiers who had suffered a succession of overwhelming defeats , and to hear their camp-fire talk concerning the conditions which led to the disasters they had been compelled to endure . I have heard many expressions of indignation directed agaiust the stupi4ity of their leaders , but never a sugges // 209 tion that they were traitors . Most commonly , even in the very extremity of disaster , the tone of criticism was characteristically jocose . The men , as is the good American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard of the case of a Confederate soldier just captured through the rash conduct of his regimental commander , who , though weeping at the mischance which had befallen him , managed to help himself to a better frame of mind by a characteristic mol . He remarked that " that ere colonel of ourn was that venturesome , he would walk across hell on a rotten rail for ten cents . " When the Confederate armies were finally broken and scattered , the separate detachments showed an indisposition to disband without the orders of their broken government . A friend of mine , who was personally engaged in the affair , has recounted to me the last stages of one of the cavalry bodies which had become separated from the Confederate authorities and had been summoned by a superior force of the Federal Army to surrender . The men had been for some time without contact with their government , and were one and all debating what it was their duty under the circumstances to do . Their answer to the summons of the Federal force was that they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue of a last battle or agree to disband . For some days these two amiable enemies moved on together , camping at night within sight of each other 's fires , the Federal commander preferring to await the result of the 9 debate rather than to force the end with unnecessary bloodshed . Finally , after much discussion in the manner of a town-meeting , the conclusion was reached that it was right for them to make terms with the Federal force . It is a well-known fact that the Confederate soldiers with singular unanimity obeyed the conditions of their surrender in the manner of good citizens . With rare exceptions they went straightway to their homes and set about the task of rehabilitating their States . The return of these warriors to the allegiance to civil government is one of the best possible evidences of the fitness of our population for the maintenance of political trusts . When we compare the social condition of the South in the years following the close of the War with that of other countries which have been the seat of protracted rebellion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our American population . void . CXLIX. - NQ. 39a. 14 // Although the success of the Federal arms did much , of itself , to return our Northern soldiers to the state of ordinary citizens , the quiet and perfect reassumption of citizenly duty on the part of the million men who composed the Federal Army at the time when out troops were disbanded is also excellent evidence as to the tone of our people . It might have been expected that men for years released from the ordinary motives of the state would be given to marauding , and that they would form a dangerous class in the community . It remains one of the most striking spectacles in modern history that this vast body of people , so long exempt from the ordinary conditions of the state , should have immediately and quietly returned to their ordinary vocations . Although the records of our Civil War afford , on the whole , the most conspicuous instance concerning the effect of our political training on the moral status of our population , less striking , but almost equally convincing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our public life . The instances whence we may draw such illustrations are so numerous that it is difficult to choose from them a few which may be here cited . I venture , however , to call the reader 's attention to the history of our American judiciary . It is a well-known fact that in the greater part of this country , under the influence of democratic traditions , the old English method , by which judges were appointed by the chief executives of the commonwealths , has been replaced by a system in which the judiciary is immediately elected by the people . Although this elective system has , in the opinion of most judicious observers , been unfortunate in that it has led to a lowering of the grade of intelligence and legal training in the occupants of the bench , it seems clear that , save in the case of a few members of the judiciary , the system has led to no degradation in the moral quality of our legal procedure . I have had much personal acquaintance with the elective judges of one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reputation of the judiciary in many other of our States . So far as I have been able to learn , they are men not only unsuspected , but , on the whole , above suspicion . An excellent test as to the quality of these extemporized judges was afforded in the border States during the Civil War and the troubled period of reconstruction following the close of that conflict . Taken from the people , chosen by political parties , // these men were , naturally , in all cases committed to one or the other of the embittered factions . The European observer would have despaired of any even-handed justice from such men in such a period . The fact is clear that the courts of the border States during the period of the Rebellion appear to have been entirely trustworthy . I know that this was the case with the judiciary system of Kentucky during that trying time . Some years ago , after I had written for the " Commonwealth Series " a brief history of that State , it occurred to me that during and immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases in the courts of Kentucky . Although the officers of the law were generally of the opposite political party from my own , it uever crossed my mind that there was a risk of injustice from this circumstance . I made inquiries of many friends as to their own state of mind concerning the judicial system of the commonwealth during the same period , and to my surprise I found that it appeared to have occurred to no one that the courts could have been biassed by political prejudices . We must assuredly respect the trust-bearing capacities of a people when through civil war it did not occur to the citizens that political prejudices would interfere with judicial impartiality . I am sure that in no country in Europe-certainly in no Continental state , and probably not even in England-could we have had such a satisfactory state of the judicial body under similar circumstances of trial . It seems to me that the test of an elective judiciary is at once the surest and most satisfactory trial which has been made as to the trustworthiness of our public morals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foremost members of the bar . They are often rather cheap persons who have acquired popularity by the arts of demagogues , and yet when elected to such places of trust they seem almost invariably to rise to the sense of duty which the position demands . I do not wish to be understood as defending the system of an elective judiciary . I believe that this method of choosing judges is one of the greatest blunders of our political system . I can not , however , refrain from expressing my admiration for the way in which these men have put aside partisanship upon their elevation to the bench . I feel , moreover , that we are entitled to set the evidence which is afforded by the conduct of these men against many unsupported assertions concerning our political degradation . // In estimating the trust-bearing capacities of our people , we have to take account of that form of social trust which has developed through the vast extension of corporate business in this country . Some critics of our society are disposed to dwell on the occasional failures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to judge from these cases as to the fidelity of our people . It is difficult to make any comparison between the trustworthiness in business of our commercial men in times and conditions a far apart as the Revolutionary period and the present day . The most important , if not the most conspicuous , change in the state of our social affairs , consists in the very wide extension of the corporate system in the management of business enterprises . At the time of the Revolution corporations were rare , and only a very small share of the commercial transactions were effected by such societies . At the present time by far the larger part of the trade in this country is accomplished in the corporate way . Nearly the whole of the transportation of the country is in the hands of commercial companies , and doubtless the larger part of the manufacturing is conducted in a similar manner . The result has been the creation of a vast body of officials who are administering public trusts . Corporations owe their existence in the main to two motives in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arising from their ventures ; in the second place , the corporate system diminishes the interruption which arises from the death of individual proprietors . These advantages , together with those arising from the amassing of capital in large bodies and the financial strength which is thereby obtained , have led in all civilized countries , within this century , to a vast increase in this business system . It is recognized that the gravest defect arising from the corporate system comes from the fact that the care-takers , particularly those who have money in their keeping , are usually subject to less rigid inspection and are held to a less strict account than the clerks and cashiers of private business concerns . It is not in human nature that the treasurer of a great mill or railway should feel the same sense of duty toward his trust as he would if he were doing business for a private owner . The sympathetic bond which serves to maintain the man 's allegiance to the individual master does not exist in the corporate relation ; it is , therefore , not fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more treasurers of corporations in this country there should occasionally be found a man who betrays his trust . The surprise is , rather , that from this great army of trust-bearers the desertions are so extremely rare . In comparing the trustworthiness of our public men of the present time and of a century ago , we must bear in mind the fact that in the present day breaches of trust on the part of persons in distinguished positions are much more generally brought to public attention than they were of old . The ancient principle embodied in the phrase that the king can do no wrong was of old extended in a certain measure to all officials of distinguished position . A conspicuous instance of this fact-one which should go far to qualify our criticism on the statesmen of to-day-has recently been forced upon my attention . In looking over the history of Harvard College , I came upon the little-known and very curious records concerning the relation of the college to its sometime treasurer , John Hancock . This patriot was , in the time when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ College . His office placed in his hands the whole of the funds of the institution . The record seems to show that Hancock for a time appropriated to his own use the money of the college which was intrusted to his keeping . In any collegiate institution in New England at the present day such a malfeasance would lead to the immediate prosecution of the offender , who would be compelled to make restitution , or suffer for his conduct . No such fate awaited Hancock . In place of prosecution , the corporation , doubtless knowing what was best for the interests they had in , hand , pleaded with him with piteous insistence for nearly twenty years , during which he paid little or no attention to their communications . He went about his affairs , occupying many distinguished offices , holding for a term the place of Governor of the Commonwealth , and finally , in a somewhat contemptuous way , after the college had been for two decades in distress for the money he had withheld from its treasury , he settled his accounts . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common among the men of the Revolutionary period ; but it seems to me that this case shows plainly how easy it was for the men of that time who held distinguished positions to escape from the swift and destructive criticism which now overtakes the trustbreaker in any social position whatsoever . // There can be no doubt that there are very serious evils in our political system which were unknown to our Revolutionary forefathers . Some of these evils-as , for instance , the flagrant abuse of public office for partisan purposes-are the shame of our time . The conditions which have operated to fix this evil in our administrative work do not seem to me , however , to be due to any diminution in the measure of fidelity to trust among our people . On the contrary , it appears to me that a fair survey of our political life serves to indicate that the trust-maintaining power of our people has gained in the first century of our development . This gain has been made despite the vast increase of the inhuman relations which have arisen in business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to me also that the element of trustworthiness in the work of the soldier , as well as of the citizen , shows no loss . I think that an examination of the facts would indicate a similar gain in the more purely political parts of our public life , and that in the field of legislation , as well as in the executive work of the country , no debasement has taken place in the first century of our experience with republican institutions .
