FRANCIS PARKMAN . By Geo*re Willis Cooke . THE career of Francis Parkman is a remarkable illustration of devotion to a single literary aim throughout life . He conceived the project of writing on the French and Indian wars at the age of seventeen , and he is now employed , at the age of sixty-six , on the last of ten volumes devoted to the struggle between the English and French in North America . He has scarcely turned aside from this one subject from the time it was conceived , his other labors being mainly subsidiary to this , or undertaken for purposes of recreation and health . He has not only thoroughly mastered his subject , but he has left little or nothing for others to accomplish in the same field . It was virgin soil when he began upon it ; his studies have been at first hand , and they have been most thorough . With Mr. Howells , it may be said that " whatever may be added to his labors , they will remain undisturbed as thorough , beautiful , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England ancestry . On the maternal side he is descended from John Cotton , that literary minister and student of the first Puritan age . On the paternal side his family has for several generations been one of prominence and influence . His great-grandfather , Ebenezer Parkman , was born in Boston in i 703 , graduated at Harvard in 1721 , and was settled as the first minister of Westborough , in 1724 , where he remained until his death , in 1782 , a period of no less than fifty-eight years . He published one or two sermons , and a historical sketch of the town . His personal influence was very great in his own parish and throughout the country . He was for many years the most influential man in that part of the state , in religious and all other interests connected with the welfare of the Commonwealth . He was a correspondent of Edmund Quincy and other leading men of the time ; and he was greatly interested in the arts and in letters . One of his sons , Samuel Parkman , settled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading men of the city , in business enterprise , wealth , and personal character . Francis Parkman , a son of Samuel , was born in * 788 , graduated at Harvard in 1807 , and became the minister of the New North Church in Boston , in 1813 . This church no longer has an existence , owing to the entire change in the character of the // north end of Boston , and its abandonment as a fashionable part of the city . Francis Parkman studied theology with Dr. Channing and at the University of Edinburgh , was made a doctor of divinity by Harvard in 1834 , was a successful pastor and preacher , published about a dozen sermons , and was a frequent contributor to the Nor/h American Review and the *i7/zris/ian Examiner . His only published volume , an Offering of Sympathy , was very popular both in this country and in Europe . He stood high in the Unitarian denomination , with which he was all his life connected . He founded the professorship of pulpit eloquence and pastoral care at Harvard , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of his library to the University . His active life came to a close in 1852 . A brother of his , George Parkman , studied medicine at the University of Aberdeen , after graduating at Harvard , was a professor in the medical school connected with the latter University , gave the land oil which the building now occupied by the medical school was erected , wrote two or three works on insanity , and was murdered by his colleague , Professor John W. Webster , in 1849 . The historian is a son of Francis Parkman , D.D. , and was born in Boston , Sept. i6 , 1823 . His subsequent career was in a considerable degree determined by the fact that he was sent , when eight years . Francis Parkman. // of age , to live with his maternal grandfather , whose residence was in that part of Medford which borders on the Middlesex Fells . Here was his home until he was twelve ; and during these four years he attended the boys ' school of John Angier , a somewhat famous master of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in which little thorough work was done . It was a boarding-school , but a few day scholars were admitted ; and the liberty he had in his grandfather 's house permitted Francis to spend much of his time in the Fells , hunting woodchucks and such other game as that region contained . Although the Middlesex Fells begin within less than a dozen miles of Boston , they contain much rough and rocky country , not cleared or inhabited , overgrown with a thick forest , and several miles in extent . No large game has been found in this neighborhood for two centuries , yet it was wild enough to give the boy Francis a taste for adventure , and to develop in him a passionate love for hunting and outdoor sport . He spent much of his time in the woods , quite as much as he gave to the school ; and he has never outgrown the tastes then acquired . He next entered what has been since known as the Chauncy Hall school , and fitted for college . During this time he read much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and aspirations . He especially enjoyed reading about the Indians , and the adventures connected with the early settlement of our country ; and his literary tendencies began to turn in that direction . In 1840 he entered Harvard College , and it was the next year , when only seventeen , while yet a freshman , that he conceived the project of writing a historical work on the old French and Indian wars or the Seven Years ' War . While in college Parkman spent every vacation in the woods , boating and hunting , his first trip being made at the end of his freshman year . He was , in fact , a pioneer in that kind of recreation which has since become very popular among college men . One vacation , when he was eighteen , was spent on the Magalloway River in Northern Maine , above the Rangeley lakes . This was a wild and uninhabited region at the time he visited it , and had few attractions for the pleasure-seeker . His love for the woods had grown , however , since he had lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and the wild life of those who lived in them , in order . that he Mr. Parkmans Residence at Jamaica Plain . // might write more intelligently of the Indians and their French allies . He accordingly persuaded a college friend to join him on this expedition , and a native guide was found at the entrance to the Woods . At the end of the first day his friend was quite satisfied with the woods and was anxious to return , saying that he had no relish for Pottawatamie tastes , and that an escape from the ways of civilization was not at all desirable . Parkman replied that a wider diffusion of Pottawatamie tastes was the grand desideratum of a bookish life ; that if all Harvard were emptied once a year into the backwoods , it would be well for their bodies and their immortal souls ; that to retreat from any enterprise once begun was a disgrace which no lapse of time could wipe off ; that if he wished to secede , he was free to do so , since coercion would by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignominy of such a procedure , he would have to take the back track alone . This argument convinced for the moment the doubting student , but he continued to the end of the trip to express his discontent with a kind of life for which he had no liking . The party built a raft of logs , tied together with grape vines , crossed Connecticut Lake , pushed on for forty-five miles through the wilderness , crossed two mountains , and came at last to the source of Magalloway River . They made a canoe of the bark of a spruce-tree , fastened over a rude frame with fibrous slivers of an ashtree and spruce roots , and pitched with spruce gum . This canoe went well on their voyage down the river , until the rapids were reached , when a sharp rock cut a long hole in the bottom , and it soon capsized . A raft was then built , which the rapids tore in pieces . A heavy rain had now set in . The voyagers camped on the river bank , felled a white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from it , which looked , when completed , like " a magnificent horsetrough . " When they thought they had reached the settlements the canoe was abandoned ; but they lost their way , spent the night in a lumberman 's shanty , and the next morning reached a log-cabin and civilization . They had been in the heavy rain for three days , had been without food for twenty-four hours , and had had a good taste of the outdoor life which Parkman coveted . In November , 1864 , he published in Harper 's 1lagazi ; e an account of this trip , which is written in a very humorous and interesting vein . He described the guide , Lewis Gookins , a genuine backwoods Yankee , in these words : " Gookins did not lack brains ; and but for obstinacy , // coarseness , self-sufficiency , arrogance , an unwavering eye for the main chance , and a few other trivial drawbacks , he might have been a good felloxv . " Another vacation was spent with a college friend on Lake George , where two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that neighborhood and in fishing and hunting . During the year 1843 a fall in the college gymnasium compelled a suspension of Parkman 's studies . He went to Europe , touched at Gibraltar and Malta , spent some time in Sicily , then journeyed through Italy to Rome , where he lodged for some days in the monastery of the Passionist Fathers . In the spring he went to Switzerland , thence to England by the way of Paris , and returned home in time to graduate with his class , in 1844 . The next two years were spent in the study of the law . But Parkman Thandoned the legal profession even before he entered it . His taste for historic studies and his love of the woods were too strong to hold him to so monotonous a profession in his mind , and he had decided to make a beginning with the story of the conspiracy of Pontiac . In order to fit himself for this task he visited all the scenes of that border struggle , in Michigan , Indiana , and Ohio , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was not satisfied with this kind of information , however . He desired a personal and intimate knowledge of the Indian character and habits . To this end he set out in the spring of 1846 , in company with his kinsman , Quincy Adams Shaw , for a trip to the far West . The great region beyond the Missouri was then just being opened to settlement , and what has since become the states of Kansas , Nebraska , and Colorado was an almost unbroken wilderness . He passed through Colorado and near the site of the city of Denver , travelling for hundreds of miles without seeing a single human being save a small band of roving Indians . The movement towards Oregon and California had just begun . Trains of emigrants were on the move , Mormons were pressing forward for Utah , and the wild West was soon to become a populous country . Parkman went to the neigh- as that of the law , for which in any case borhood of the Black Hills , spent several he could have had little genuine liking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time his plan of writing of the the many Indian tribes then roaming French and Indian wars had shaped itself through the wilderness . He joined them On the Shore of Jamaica Pond , in Mr. Parkman'O Groundo. // in the hunt , went with them on the warpath , lived in their tents , partook of their fare , and became as one of them , until he thoroughly understood their ways and their ideas . He saw the Indians of that region while they retained many of their native characteristics , so that as nearly as possible they were like the more eastern tribes of which he wished to write . Parkman thus gained the knowledge of the Indians which he thought necessary to the accomplishment of his chosen task ; but the strain of the wild life wa too great for him , and his health was nearly ruined . The rough fare , which was poorly prepared and sometimes insufficient , the long rides which had to be made , the fatigue of the hunt and the wearisome toil of camp-life , especially the tension of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against treachery or sudden attacks from war parties , were too severe for the student . He was ill for several weeks , and for many days thought he would not be able to reach civilization again . He had to be helped to mount his horse , and was in danger of falling off from excessive weakness . The prairie reeled about him whenever he attempted to walk . It was only by will power that he carried himself through this experience . The nervous tension and the bodily strain were very great . His health was permanently ruined ; for he has never recovered from the effects of that trying experience . On his return to Boston in the autumn Mr. Parkman began to write out an account of his trip , which he was obliged to accomplish with the aid of an amanuensis . His nervous prostration had affected his eyes , and he was obliged to dictate his narrative . Perhaps in this way the story of his journey gained in flow and beauty of language , in freshness and picturesqueness of expression , and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most fascinating of his books , and reads almost like a romance from first to last . It is an admirable introduction to his later works ; and it should be read before them for the sake of the acquaintance it gives with the Indian character . In 1847 this account of his trip was published in the Knickerbocker Magazine , from which it was soon after published in book form , under the title of The Cabjornia and Ore6 o ; i Trail : Sketches of Prairie and Rocki ' - Moun/ain LJe . The word " California " was afterwards omitted from the title , the several routes having become more exactly defined in later years . Having completed the account of his western experiences , Mr. Parkman took up again his work on the conspiracy of Pontiac , from which he had turned aside in order to be the better prepared for the writing of it . One great difficulty stood in the A Corner of Mr. Parkman 's Study . // way , the condition of his health , and especially his eyesight , which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mountains . In the preface to his book he gave an account of the difficulties with which he had to contend from this cause : " For about three years the light of day was insupportable , and every attempt at reading or writing completely debarred . Under t*O4*. 3 these circumstances , the task of sifting the materials and composing the work was begun and finished . The papers were repeatedly read aloud by an amanuensis , copious notes and extracts were made , and the narrative written down from my dictation . This process , though extremely slow and laborious , was not without its advantages ; and I am well convinced the authorities have been more minutely examined , more scrupulously collated , and more thoroughly digested , than they would have been under ordinary circumstances . " In his preface he also mentions the labor it cost him to secure the information on which his history was based . " The most troublesome part of the task , " he says , was the collection of the necessary documents . These consisted of letters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offices in Europe and America . When brought together , they amounted to about three thousand four hundred manuscript pages . Contemporary newspapers , magazines , and pamphlets have also been examined , and careful search made for every book which , directly or indirectly , might throw light upon the subject . I have visited the sites of all the principal events recorded in the narrative , and gathered such local traditions as seemed worthy of confidence . " Tue Conspiracy of Pontiac , and the Indian War after the Conquest of Canada appeared in the year 1851 . For the first time it told the story of an important era in American history with fidelity to local scenery and circumstance , and with the truthfulness to fact which history demands . After the completion of this work Mr. Parkman found it necessary to devote himself to the recovery of his health . One who met him from time to time at this Chestnut Street Boston . // period remembers seeing him frequently walking on Boston Common with the aid of a cane , his figure attenuated and unsteady , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but animated by a serene and indomitable courage . He had to forego even looking at a newspaper , not only on account of his weak eyes , but on account of a painful sensation in his head like that of wearing an iron crown . Up to this time his home had been in Boston , but in 1854 he bought a house in West Roxbury , on the banks of Jamaica Pond , where he took up his residence . Jamaica Pond is located about one mile west of Jamaica Plain station on the Boston and Providence Railroad , and near the border of Brookline . It is a small sheet of water , something over a quarter of a mile in length , pleasantly situated in the midst of woods and surrounding houses . Mr. Parkman 's house is on the southwestern bank , situated many feet above the pond , the grounds sloping gradually to the water 's edge . The several acres of land he bought about the house were soon devoted to flowers and plants . Mr. Parkman gave himself up to outdoor life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this r*ew pursuit a mere pastime or a means only of regaining his health , but he mastered its every detail and soon became an expert . As a result he became known as one of the leading horticulturists of the state .. He was for two years elected the president of the Massachusetts Horticultural Society , and for a short period held the professorship of horticulture in the Bussey Institution , which is the agricultural and horticultural department of Harvard University , and which is located near his own residence . For ten or twelve years Mr. Parkman has devoted himself to the cultivation and hybridization of lilies , and has originated a pew and brilliant variety of that flower , which has been named after him the Ziliurn Pci rkmanni . A few years since he sold the entire stock of it to an English gardener , who has been propagating it , and who will very soon put it upon the market . It has attracted much attention in England , for its great size and its brilliancy of coloring . Mr. Parkman has originated other flowers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much attention , like Mr. Bancroft , to rose culture , so much so that in i866 a publisher asked him to prepare a book on that subject , which resulted in his Book of Roses , published in that year . It is an exposition of the best methods of cultivation , based on his own experience ; and it also gives faithful descriptions of the best varieties of roses . The Old Werjtworth House , Portsmouth . // qwq feudal power in Canada . He also proposed to trace the history of the colony to its downfall before the conquering arms of the English , led by Wolfe . The severe intellectual toil required in the preparation of the first volume of this series , f/ie Floneers of France zn I/ic A7ero World , seems to have again affected Mr. Parkman 's health ; and when the book was given to the public , in 1865 , he told in the preface the story of the difficulties under which it had been written . " During the past eighteen years , " he there wrote , " the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caution in In the Old Wentworth House . regard to mental application , reducing it qwq therein contained ; and then such as were available were transcribed verba/im . This work required patience , judgment , literary and historic discrimination , a gift for delving into forgotten sources of information , a faculty for bringing the salient facts into full light , and for relating them to each other with philosophic insight . It was not merely necessary to tell an interesting story , which could be easily done with such materials as he had to use ; but it was important that a meaning should be found in these glowing events , which should relate them to the great historic movements of the time . It must be borne in mind that the whole field of Mr. Parkman 's investigations had been but little explored when he began his researches . A few volumes of documents had been published by the state of New York , and some other labors of the same kind had been here and there undertaken ; but for the most part no one had preceded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his thoroughness removed every obstacle . He left no document , no letter or journal , unread which could give new light on any part of his subject . The work he accomplished has been fully described by Dr. George E. Ellis , who is himself a historian of ability , who has spent much time in similar investigations , and who is therefore thoroughly c6mpetent to judge of the importance and the character of the work accomplished . " The documentary materials says Dr. Ellis which alone could furnish Mr. Parkman with full and authentic information for his whole series of volumes , were known to be abundant and rich , while it was reasonable to expect that patient and thorough research would bring to light many valuable additions to what was gathered in archives or easily accessible in print . Still the labor and cost involved in investigations , in securing original papers , charts , maps , etc. , and in obtaining copies of manuscripts , tracts , and rare journals , with the necessity of comparing discordant narratives , of distinguishing the elements of fact and fiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a heavy exertion on the patience , the purse , and the keen mental vigor of the author . Suffering and enfeebled as he has been through his whole literary career by maladies which intensified his impulses to exertion and mental application , while they limited the hours he could wisely give to reading and writing , he has had to depend largely upon the helping pen or voice of others . He has made repeated visits to France for the examination of the manuscript collections of the French government , in the national archives , the national library , and the archives of the Marine and the Colonies , with other public and many private places of deposit for valuable documents , and has sought out in the interior of the realm and its ancient seaports every trace and relic of those of whom he has made record in his pages . The journals , official relations , and private letters of the Jesuit Fathers , of the military and civil functionaries in Canada , and the correspondence of governors , intendants , and ecclesiastical dignitaries with the king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The reading and digesting and verification of the bewildering mass of information found in large parcels or in fragments in these papers was a task requiring patience , skill , and an acute discrimination . Other sources of information there are in Canadian repositories , civil and ecclesiastical , French , English , and Dutch documents , which have been copied from foreign archives at the expense of the governments of New York and Massachusetts , existing still in manuscript or printed with more or less careful editing , which have been faithfully and discreetly used by Mr. Parkman for subsidiary information and illustration . Each page of his finished composition , while the elaboration of its matter has in no wise impaired the vigor or grace of his style , attests the skilful condensation and digestion of material gathered from various sources. ** Mr. Parkman has not of course delved through these vast collections unaided . He has freely employed the skill and industry of others , and he has for years had several copyists at work for him in the various archives and other depositories of documents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as notes ; and thirty-five volumes of these he has given to the Massachusetts Historical Society . In this collection are to be found eight volumes of papers from the Archives of Marine and Colonies of France relating to Canada from 1670 to i 700 ; twelve from the same archives relating to events from 1748 tO 1763 ; one from the French National Archives , from 1759 tO 1766 ; one of letters from Canadian officers , from 1755 tO 1763 ; one of Montcalm 's letters to his mother and wife ; four from the Public Record Office of London , from 1750 to 1760 ; and one from . the British Museum relating to events from 1751 to 1761 . These volumes constitute about one-half of the collections he has made in preparation for the writing of his historical volumes . This work of collecting materials has now been completed ; but it has involved many years of incessant toil . No less than twenty-six volumes of notes and documents were used in the writing of the work on Montcalm and Wolfe , any one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the printed volumes . To condense this mass of information into the glowing narrative of that work involved much labor and a wise historic judgment . The series of volumes entitled France and England in North America . A Series of Historical Narratives , which was begun as far back as 1858 , and probably several years earlier , has now been completed , with the exception of one volume . The order of the volumes , and their dates of publication , are as follows - i . Pioneers of France in the New World ; i86*. 2 . The Jesuits in North America in the Seventeenth Century , 1867. 3 . La Salle and the Discovery of the Great West , 1869. 4 . The Old RSgime in Canada , 1874. 5 . Count Frontenac and New France under Louis XIV , 1877. 6 . ( Nearly completed. ) 7 .

Pontiac are a fitting sequel , for they continue the same history through the attempt of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very properly included under the same general title , so intimately are they connected with the other works . The French rule had been given up , but French influence continued , and did not cease to have an actuality until after Pontiac had passed away . The ten volumes , in fact , form a continuous narrative of the relations of France to North America , from the time of the earliest settlements down to the outbreak of the Revolutionary struggle . These works by Mr. Parkman must be read in a larger light than that of the attempt and failure of France to colonize the new world . They describe a struggle for territorial supremacy between the two leading nations of Europe , the one the representative of feudalism in its methods , and the other the representative of constitutional government . No more interesting struggle has ever gone on in the history . of the world , nor one more fraught with consequences of moment to the advancement of mankind . With all its brilliant social and intellectual life , France , in the 1 All of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Co. , Boston ; and are issued in a uniform set of ten volumes . seventeenth century , in its political methods , had not yet freed itself from the spirit of feudalism . The feudal system was established in Canada by Louis XIV. , in so far as it was then possible to retain it ; and it was retained in America to an extent that was then impossible in France . Canada was not held for actual settlement , but as a means of territorial power , and for the sake of the fur trade . Those whG would have become actual settlers , the Protestants , were rigidly forbidden an entrance to the colony . Local government was in no instance established ; and the king thoroughly carried out his policy of personal power . The successful suppression of the liberal tendencies of the nation by a despotic king , aided by other European powers and the influence of the Catholic Church , enabled Louis to carry out in America the political* methods he would have been glad to have employed in France , had the spirit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completion of his purpose . On the other hand , the English colonies were settled by private enterprise , and by the most liberal-minded people then to be found in Europe . Local government was established in all these colonies , sometimes in opposition to the wishes of the English government , and sometimes with its consent ; but the people practically managed their own affairs , even when the most refractory governor was set over them . Whatever was most progressive and liberal in methods of government at that day was adopted by the English , so that local self-government , representative government , and government by constitutional methods , were practically adopted in all the colonies settled by the English , or which came under their rule . It came about , then , that the European struggle between the methods of feudalism and autocratic authority , on the one side , and those of constitutional government , on the other , was reproduced in America , and under circumstances more favorable to its being fought out on its own merits than was possible where the conditions . were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and utterly failed . She failed almost wholly because of the methods which Louis adopted , and because the only part of her people who could have won success for her were forbidden the // opportunity . It was a question whether the new world should be possessed for autocratic power , or whether it should be  |p6ssessed  for freedom . It was also a guestion whether France or England should succeed in introducing its language , its literature , its politics and its religion into North America . As France then was , it could not have been other than a calamity to mankind had she succeeded ; for the success of England prepared the way for the greatest experiment yet made in government by constitution and by representation , combined with local self-government . Almost immediately after the conclusion of the struggle between the two powers , by the success of Wolfe at Quebec , began another struggle , between the colonies and the English government . The one undoubtedly prepared for the other and made it possible , through the military training it gave to the colonists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and because it gave them confidence in themselves and their cause . In the logic of events the Revolution in America was an almost necessary issue of the conquest of Canada by England . It is in the light of this large view of history that Mr. Parkman has written his volumes on the struggle between France and England in North America . In the preface to his Mon/calm and Wolfe he has pointed out the full significance of the struggle and the greatness of the results . At the first the issue was not at all certain ; it was the fatuity of Louis XV. , and the degree in which he gave himself up to what was narrow and feudal in government , that cost France her American possessions . This larger meaning of the history which he has recorded , Mr. Parkman clearly indicates in one or two brief paragraphs . " The most momentous and far-reaching question ever brought to issue on this continent was : Shall France remain here , or shall she not ? If , by diplomacy or war , she had preserved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her American possessions , then a barrier would have been set to the spread of the English-speaking races ; there would have been no Revolutionary War ; and for a long time , at least , no independence . It was not a question of scanty populations strung along the banks of the St. Lawrence ; it was - or under a government of any worth it would have been - a question of the armies and generals of France . America owes much to the imbecility of Louis XV . and the ambitious vanity and personal dislikes of his mistress . The Seven Years ' War made England what she is . It crippled the commerce of her rival , ruined France in two continents , and blighted her as a colonial power . It gave England the control of the seas and the mastery of North America and India , made her the first of commercial nations , and prepared that vast colonial system that has planted new Englands in every quarter of the globe . And while it made England what she is , it supplied to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if not of their national existence . " Many pages of Mr. Parkman 's histories are taken up with the quarrels of Canadian governors , the intrigues of Jesuit priests and petty Indian wars ; but when the history of the French in North America is viewed in the broad way suggested in the words just quoted , we see how important these small matters are to the understanding of the larger problem . However petty the events described , no dull pages are to be found in Mr. Parkman 's books , nor pages that have no meaning with reference to the larger bearings of his subject . Each book prepares for those which succeed it , and helps to a full appreciation of the final struggle . The minuteness of detail is possible because the seventeenth century was an age of memoirs and much writing of every kind ; but we can not regret this when it enables us to penetrate so completely into a form of life that has passed away forever , but which has left many traces of itself behind . In the Pioneers of France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the French to establish colonies in North America , especially those of the Huguenots in Florida and those of Champlain and his associates at Quebec , Acadia , and elsewhere . This volume has been the most popular of the whole series , partly because of the romantic character of the events described , and the interest attaching to the daring adventures it records . In 1885 it was revised , some new documentary evidence was incorporated , and the results of a visit to Florida were made use of in a more exact description of localities . The second volume , that on the Jesuits in North America in the Seventeenth Century , has been nearly as popular as the first ; and while it does not describe men or events of so great an interest to the lover of adventure , it has a yet greater historic value for the student . It was a most heroic effort these men made when // they invaded the American forests to convert the Indians ; and the story of their exploits is of thrilling interest . Mr. Parkman does full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly to light their superstition and credulity . The intrepid efforts of La Salle , Joliet , Marquette , and Hennepin , in exploring the Mississippi , the Great Lakes , and the vast region lying about them , form the subject of the third volume . Nowhere else has this story of splendid curiosity concerning unknown regions , and of daring achievement in their exploration , been told with such sympathy and fidelity as in this volume . Whatever the infatuation and the follies of the French rule in North America , it was redeemed by the acts of these men , and the religious devotion to duty of the Jesuits . In La Salle Mr. Parkman has described one of the truest knights of the modern world , a man with his face set to know the unknown and to accomplish good work for mankind . In 1879 this volume received a thorough revision , a large quantity of new documents about La Salle having come to light in France . These included many letters written by La Salle and also a narrative by his companion , Joutel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the series , gives the history of Canada from 1653 to i68o , a period during which the colony was gradually taking shape . Its special interest , however , consists in the vivid description it gives of Canadian life during the seventeenth century . It describes the introduction of feudal methods into the political and social life of the colony , how the government was managed , the establishment of religion , the morals and manners , how trade and industry prospered or failed to prosper , and the methods adopted to foster temperance , education , and marriage . A unique life this volume describes , throwing much light on the history of France and doing much to explain the subsequent history of Canada . The fifth volume has to do with Count Frontenac , the most interesting character connected with Canadian history , the man who did most to build up the colony , and who left the mark of his genius stamped on its whole life for many years to come . It was in his time that the Iroquois were brought to recognize the French power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English colonies were held in check , and that the French pushed into the region of the Ohio and Illinois with their forts and settlements . Had Frontenac been able to carry out his plans to the full , and had he been succeeded by men as wise and brave as himself ; it is probable the French power in North America would not have passed away . The sixth volume , not yet published , will be devoted to the history of the first half of the eighteenth century , the least interesting and the most difficult to describe with unity of purpose of the whole period covered by the French rule in America . Mr. Parkman has thought of c*alling this . volume The Rivals , because during the period which it treats the rivalry between France and England was going on , and the causes were being gradually developed which led to the supremacy of England . The seventh and eighth volumes in this series are devoted to the final struggle , and to the victory gained by Wolfe at Quebec , . by which the French rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The conflict for Acadia , the expedition of Braddock , the rule of Montcalm , the struggle around the borders of the colony of New York , the march of Wolfe on Quebec , and the peace which followed , are all graphically described in these volumes . The preceding volumes have fully prepared for these final events , and they have helped to make apparent their great importance with reference to the future history of the English colonies and the great republic which succeeded them . What immediately succeeded , before the English authority was fully establiThed , is told in The C*onspiracy of Pontiac . That greatest intellectual and military genius the Indian races have ever produced sought to turn back the growing English power ; and the history of his effort is written with a thrilling interest throughout .. These volumes have already obtained a place alongside those of Bancroft , Prescott , , and Motley , as among the worthiest products of American historical writing . The thoroughness of the research devoted to their preparation , the importance of the events described , and the skill and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a. permanent place among the great historic works of a century which has been par-* ticularly given to the investigation of the past . Mr. Parkman 's literary style is well // adapted to his subject , for no tame or merely fine style could have done justice to the people and the events he has had to describe . He is fond of adventure , by nature he is a lover of the woods and wild sport , an enthusiast by temperament , nervous and energetic in every fibre of his being , and thoroughly capable of appreciating such men as Champlain , La Salle , Frontenac , Pontiac , and the life which they represent . His style is that which is natural to such a man , - thrilling , dramatic , picturesque , and at times even fervid . It is a natural style , well fitting the man and his character , and it is admirably adapted to the kind of story he had to tell . It is graphic , impassioned , eloquent , and sometimes impetuous as a mountain stream ; no style could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Parkman 's style , he is thoroughly accurate throughout his books . He has a true love of Nature , and of all outdoor scenes and occurrences ; and these he describes with the faithful eye of one who loves them . He has a genuine love of the woods and mountains and lakes , and his pictures of scenery are as faithful as they are beautiful . He has described with the minutest fidelity the scenes of the leading events in his histories ; and as these 4escriptions have been written from actual observation , they have the char*icteristics of life itself . He is a true observer of the natural world , and his descriptive powers are of a high order . It may be said of Mr. Parkman , that he is an artist in history , concealing his art by simplicity and fidelity , but using it with great skill to entertain , impress , and convince his reader . Mr. Parkman has been an occasional contributor to the magazines , but mostly on subjects connected with his special historical studies . To the Christian Examiner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen each in the North American Review and the Atlantic Monthly . The two or three articles he has published on general subjects show him capable of very strong and effective writing . Especially of this character are his paper on " The Failure of Universal Suffrage , " in the North American Rez'iew for 1878 , and the essay on " Some of the Reasons against Woman Suffrage , " which appeared in a pamphlet in 1883 . Whatever one may think of the theories of these essays , he can not but recognize the force with which they are set forth , the incisive clearness with which his positions are taken , and the impression he makes by the vigor and originality of his statements . His attitude in these essays is that of a man of culture who is not satisfied with the democratic tendencies he sees at work about him . When he considers universal suffrage , he is made distrustful by " an ignorant proletariat and a half-taught plutocracy " ; and when he investigates woman 's suffrage , he is under the influence of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essays , however , contain the best statement which can be made against the manifest destiny of mankind to adopt suffrage for all classes that can be benefited by its possession . Mr. Parkman has seen much of men and the world , and he has studied them with an intelligent purpose . He has been in Europe seven times , and learned much concerning its life and its institutions . He has not been , as one might suppose , mainly a student of books , for his tastes are not literary in any special degree . He is by nature a man of affairs and a man of the world , not a recluse or a student by the bent of genius , but a lover of society , its tastes and tendencies . He has mingled much in society , and is capable of playing well his part in every form it takes . He is at home in the wigwam and in the drawing-room ; and he adapts himself as readily , and with as much ease , to the one place as the other . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Botolph Club , one of the most popular clubs of Boston . He has also been for thirteen years a fellow of the corporation of Harvard University , and for about six years an overseer of the same institution . In person Mr. Parkman is somewhat above middle height , spare of body , nervous and sinewy in structure , and with the iron will that can meet danger and endure fatigue . He wears n* beard , and his thin , thoughtful face is pleasant and attractive . In manners he is engaging , puts himself quickly into sympathetic relations with others , and easily adapts himself to every situation . He has been well described as having " a tough , sinewy physique , a resistant , calm , cheerful temper , and an indomitable perseverance and ambition . " // Mr. Parkman has continued since 1854 to spend his summers at Jamaica Pond . In recent years he has not been so devoted to horticulture as . formerly , but he keeps up his garden and his hot-houses with the culture of his flowers . He spends much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his grounds . His house has been fitted up for summer occupancy , and is pleasant within and without . His study has in one corner a safe for his manuscripts , in another a plain bookcase for the few books he needs , while in the centre is a plain table which he uses for a writing-desk . On the walls are a pair of buck 's horns , an old-fashioned powder-flask , and other mementos of his days of sojourning with the Indians . About his house , within his own grounds , and in the neighboring woods , are pleasant walks , a few rods to the rear of the house are boats on the pond , while in the barn a horse awaits his use . He walks with a cane , and has a slight limp ; but this does not prevent his continued enjoyment of the country . His sister has for many years been his home companion ; and it is at her house , at *o Chestnut Street , Boston , that he has his winter home . Here he occupies as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a front room , plainly furnished and adapted to work rather than to luxury or ease . His library is about him here ; and at a small table in front of the open grate he does his writing . He does not love mere ornament or the conditions of studious indulgence . His tastes and his habits are all those of a man who loves the woods and the hunter 's lodge . Simplicity and truthfulness are the cardinal virtues in his life , and in all the appointments of his home and his work . In the city , as in the country , he is much in the open air ; and he may be seen frequently wandering about the Common or taking his way along the streets . His two daughters are now married , and one of them occupies the Governor Wentworth house at Portsmouth . His son-in-law some years since purchased this historic mansion ; and here Mr. Parkman now spends some part of every summer . This old house dates back to 1750 as the year of its erection ; and within it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scenes through which it has passed . The muskets of the Governor 's guard , ten in number , now hang in the hall of the house and adorn its walls . To Mr. Parkman this house , which forms the chief antiquity of the region , with its many legendary and historic associations , must suggest many a scene out of that past with which he is so familiar . When Mr. Parkman completes his final volume on France and England in Nor/h America , he will have spent nearly fifty years on that subject . It has been a labor of love ; and because he loved it he has held to it with steady devotion . When it is brought to an end he has several other literary projects which he hopes to take up , but none of them are of an extended nature . If he accomplishes no other task , this will be enough to deserve the lasting gratitude of his countrymen . To this work , as Mr. Curtis has suggested , we must go for a true account of the American Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge of " that strange colony of priests , lawyers , and soldiers , " as Mr. Howells calls it , which had Quebec for its capital . In his Conspiracy of Pontiac , says Mr. John Fiske , we have " one of the most brilliant and fascinating books that has ever been written since the days of Herodotus . " Such tribute may properly be paid to Mr. Parkman 's work as a whole . His books deserve all the high praise they have received , for their accuracy , their industry , their breadth , and their brilliancy. - uIjNI*Ik
