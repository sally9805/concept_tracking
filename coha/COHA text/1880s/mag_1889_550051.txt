THE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS OF NASHVILLE . By David G. Ray . LOVERS of Nashville are fond of calling that city the " Athens of the South . " If by that term it is to be understood that Nashville is the chief centre of education in the South , then the term is not inappropriate . Whether it be so or not may best be learned from a brief study of its educatiohal history . The history of schools in Nashville is co-existent with the history of the town . The first settlement was made on the bluff now occupied by Nashville in 1779 . In 1783 the Legislature of North Carolina established the County of Davidson , and two years later , through the untiring efforts of General Robertson and Colonel William Polk , who were the representatives of Davidson County in the Legislature , that august body chartered Davidson Academy , to be established at Nashville for the education of boys . This was the first exhibition of that intelligent public spirit that has made the name of Nashville a synonym throughout the South and Southwest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every act of the frontiersman a venture , and when crops were planted and harvested under the protection of a blockhouse and rifles , we find the handful of hardy white men demanding from the mother State this power to plant the school . When the State of Tennessee was ten years old , another important step in the educational life of the frontier settlement was taken . Among the first settlers were the Ellistons , and one of these - Colonel John Elliston - conceived the idea of a high school for girls . In accordance with this idea , he and a few associates secured from the State a charter for the Nashville Academy . This was probably the first school - it was certainly one of the first schools - for the education of girls , ever chartered in the United States . The first charter for such a school in Massachusetts was granted in i8i8 , and in New York in 1819 . TheNashville Academy was closed by the misfortunes of the Civil War ; but not until it had sent forth hundreds of welleducated women to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Almost immediately after the war a Protestant school and a Catholic school for girls were founded , - Ward 's Seminary and St. Cecilia Academy , - which have steadily grown in size and in usefulness , and have been succeeded by other large and flourishing schools for girls . A clear idea of the educational history and the present educational work of Nashville can not , perhaps , be better given than by a brief outline of the development of three representative institutions . By far the most interesting of these , from a historical // point of view , is the University of Nashville and Peabody Normal College . The history of this school extends over a period of one hundred and four years , from the chartering of Davidson Academy . When the Legislature of North Carolina chartered the Academy , Rev. Thomas B. Craighead , Hugh Williamson , Daniel Smith , William Polk , Anthony Bledsoe , Lardner Clark , Ephraim McLean , Robert Hays , and James Robertson were named as trustees . Seven of these men have lineal descendants still living in the city . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Craighead was a graduate of Princeton College . He was a man of strong mould , and he left the impress of his culture and his character upon the sturdy people of the little colony on the Cumberland . He left his name also , - a grandson bearing his own name , and a graduate of the institution , being a member from Davidson County of the present State Senate . By the act incorporating Davidson Academy there were granted to it two hundred and forty acres of land adjoining the town of Nashville on the south , and lying on the river . But the school was first opened in Mr. Craighead 's " Meeting house , " in the town of Haysboro , six miles east of Nashville , the rate of tuition having been previously fixed by the trustees at " four pounds per annum , to be paid in hard money or other money of that value . " Another of the interesting entries in the original records tells that in October , 1791 , " Mr. Andrew Jackson " was elected to the board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had removed to what is now Maury County ; and it may be said that " Mr. Andrew Jackson " remained on the board of trustees almost to the day of his death . As early as March 4 , 1794 , we find the foundations of the present extensive library being laid , by the appointment of a committee " to collect debts and purchase books for the use of the Academy . " Just when the school was removed to Nashville I do not learn ; but in 1802 a building committee was appointed and authorized to erect a brick building " forty-five feet wide by forty feet long , " at an expense not to exceed $10,890 . The house was built and the school duly opened in it . In i8o6 , by an act of the Legislature , its name was changed to Cumberland College . This was in accordance with the act of Congress granting to Tennessee 200,000 acres of land , one-fourth of which was to be used for the establishment of a college in " West Tennessee , " or west @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the early history of the college that attracted much attention was the expulsion , in 1813 , of two students for refusing to take the prescribed course of study . One of these young men was Cave Johnson , who was afterwards in the United States Senate , and Postmaster-General under President Polk . Three years after the elevation of the academy into a college , the trustees called Dr. James Priestly of New Jersey to its presidency . He was learned , earnest , and capable , but he became greatly discouraged because of the lack of funds , finally resigning , and the college was closed for several years . The State had made a great show of liberality in at once bestowing upon the new college 50,000 acres of the land granted by the National Government ; but through stupidity or something worse , the Tennessee Legislature managed Vanderbilt University , Main Building . // to thwart the noble aims of Thomas Jefferson , the author of the scheme of granting lands for colleges . Through many years , down almost to the present time , the trustees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into available funds , but they were successful to but a limited extent . A year before his death , in 1821 , Dr. Priestly was persuaded to again place himself at the head of the college , and affairs wore a brighter aspect . His death , however , caused the college to be closed again ; and for some years the building was used for a grammar school by Professor Hume . The trustees of the college , however , among whom were such men as Governor William Carroll , John Bell , Felix Grundy , Ephraim H. Foster , and Andrew Jackson , were determined to make the college worthy of the State and of the South . To that end they elected to its presidency Dr. Philip Lindsley of New Jersey . Dr. Lindsley was a young man , but a ripe scholar , full of noble ambition and devoted to the profession of teaching . He had graduated with honors from Princeton , and , young as he was , occupied at that time the position of vice-president of that institution . He believed that Nashville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the educational centre of the great Southwest . He believed that a rival of Princeton could be built up , and that is what he proposed , with the tinstees , to do . These plans he fully developed in an address before the graduating class of 1826 . " As a step in advance , " says Judge Edwin H. Ewing , " upon the petition of the trustees , The University of Nashville ' was created upon the foundation of Cumberland College , by an act of the General Assembly of Tennessee , dated 2 7tli November , 1826 . All the rights , privileges , and property of the college were transferred to the new creation ; and thenceforward , until October , : r8*o , the institution kept its course with varied fortunes , when , to the great regret of the legal guardians of the University , Dr. Lindsley resigned . " It is but just to say here that no man has exerted an influence so potent for good to the educational interests of Tennessee and the great Southwest , as Dr. Philip Lindsley . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ever made his mark , deep and tneffaceable , upon a place and people , Dr. Lindsley made it at Nashville . " His son , John Berrien Lindsley , D.D. , succeeded him as chancellor , in 1855 . After Dr. Lindsley 's resignation in 1850 , the University had a varied , but on the whole a successful , career . First , the literary department was closed for lack of funds ; then the medical department was organized and established in the old college buildings . The trustees , in the mean time , had sold some of the real estate belonging to the University and bought a beautiful plat of ground , consisting of sixteen acres , beyond the city limits , on the south . Here the erection of buildings was promptly begun , and in 1854 they were ready for occupancy . The main building was supported on the right and in the rear by two other solid stone structures , - the Chapel and Lindsley Hall , the latter for domitories . These buildings remain as then , and a handsome brick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chancellor , and a stone house at the main entrance for the janitor . Within a year of its opening in its new home , we find the University stranded again for want of funds . The public schools of Nashville had opened in the mean time , and some of its friends claimed that the University patronage was largely curtailed by their popularity . For the session of 185 5-6 it opened with flattering prospects as a military school , under the joint management of Bushinod Johnson and Alexander P. Stewart . During their management Vanderbilt University . Entrance to the Grounds // there was an average of about six hundred students . When the storm of civil war swept over the country the school was broken up - chancellor , superintendent , officers , teachers , and students enlisting in the Confederate army . Only the old German janitor , Deubler , remained to care for the buildings , the extensive library , and the valuable scientific appliances . But despite the care of Mr. Deubler , the Federal army used the buildings for barracks and hospital . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the institution , although an excellent military school was conducted by Generals B. Kirby Smith and A. P. Stexvart . Those ten years , however , were fraught with events of deepest interest to education in Nashville . In political history those years are known as the " reconstruction period . " That term would certainly be applicable to that period of the history of education in Nashville . It was in those ten years that so many of the institutions that have contributed to Nashville 's fame were born . The " Old Academy , " as the Nashville Academy is fondly called even to this day , never opened its doors after their closing in the early years of the war ; but peace had scarcely smiled on the city when another institution sprang up to take its place . This has become famous throughout the South as Ward 's Seminary . It was founded by Rev. W. B. Ward in September , i86* , and is to-day said to be the largest school for girls in the South . St. Cecilia 's Academy had been opened in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had merely come into existence before the war , and first began its active life in the early years of peace . To-day it stands , in its fine buildings and successful management , a monument to the ability of its trustees . The ink had scarcely dried after the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation , when a school for colored children was opened by Rev. Dr. D. W. Phillips , in a basement on McLemore Street , near the passenger station of the Nashville , Chattanooga , and St. Louis Railway . Day and night did this noble philanthropist labor through years of discouragement , till he finally saw his labors crowned with success , in the purchase of extensive grounds near Vanderbilt University , the erection of cornRev . R. K. Hsrgrove , D.D. , President of vanderbilt University . modious buildings , and the partial endowment of Roger Williams University . Dr. Phillips is still connected with the school , and is proudly happy in the contemplation of the splendid work that is being carried on there under the presidency of Dr. A. Owen . Towards the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken in the preparation of the colored man for citizenship . Through the instrumentality of the Freedman 's Aid Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church , Central Tennessee College was founded in the southern part of the city . While two other prominent colored schools preceded it , this was really a pioneer in some features of school // work . While never claiming to be a university , it comprises all the departments of a university , including Theology , Law , Medicine , as well as Dentistry and Manual Training . It was the first and is , I believe , the only college having separately organized schools of medicine , surgery , and dentistry exclusively for colored students . The faculties of these schools are composed largely of the most prominent physicians and dentists in the city , one of the most unassurning of them all being the president , Dr. J. Braden . Fisk University is , without doubt , the most widely known school for colored people in the world . It may be doubted whether any school in the South , white or colored , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the civilized world , indeed , have the Jubilee Singers not been heard ofi , if not heard ? And who , that knows of the remarkable pilgrimages of that remarkable company of ex-slaves , but knows that they sang for love of Fisk University ? I can not better introduce the history of this monument of devotion , energy , and philanthropy than by a quotation from an article in Tue Freeman , of Indianapolis , edited by Edward E. Cooper , a colored man - " Immediately following the Proclamation of Emancipation the Northern people felt that among the great and immediate wants of the freedmen were education and religious culture , which , as . they were not able to give themselves , had to be supplied them . To this end the American Missionary Association caused a school to be opened in this city on Jan. 9 , i866 , in Government buildings , west of the Chattanooga Depot , known at the time as the Railroad Hospital . It is a strange , but a true coincidence , that the building that had sheltered the Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had . fought . " The school thus opened was named in honor of Gen. Clinton B. Fisk , then chief of the Freedman 's Bureau . Mr. John Ogden , who was connected with the Western Freedman 's Aid Commission , was put in charge of the school and did a valuable work during the first years of its life . But the man who has , from its inception to this day , contributed more to its success than any other man is Rev. Erastus M. Cravath . Being a chaplain in the Federal army , he became well acquainted with the peculiar needs of the colored people , as well as the peculiar obstacles to be overcome in meeting them . He* together with Mr. Ogden and Rev. E. P. Smith , advanced 6ooo with which to purchase a site for the school , the Government giving the old hospital buildings . In August , T867 , " Fisk University " was . chartered , having worked before without charter under the name of " Fisk School** and in the following November the first normal class was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school was remarkable . The American Missionary Association had given its sanction to the organization of a school , but it had not the means for the establishment of a university . The trustees of the Peabody fund donated $8oo a year for normal training , and the Freedman 's Bureau donated $7000 ; but this was only a modicum of the sum necessary to the success of the great work . The old houses given by the Government were fast going to decay , and the trustees had no money to build new ones . " The thing seems out of the question , but it must be done , " was the summing up of the situation given by a friend of the institution . Thus the matter stood in the early part of 1871 . Talent and sentiment , directed by excellent business management , came to the rescue . Prof. George L. White , teacher of music in the school , conceived the idea of giving Rev. Erastus M. Eravath President of Fisk University . // to the Northern people an object-lesson in negro education , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began the training of a company of singers , with whom he proposed to make a tour of the North ; and in the following October , i868 , the party started for Cincinnati , where they first appeared on the stage . The troupe was composed of Miss Shepard , pianist , and eleven singers , most of whom had been slaves . The story of how they sang their way through almost every Northern and Eastern city does not need repeating . In their several tours , which embraced not only the North and East of the United States , but much of Europe , the sum of $ioo , ooo was realized for the cause for which these children of misfortune labored . As soon as the success of the enterprise was assured , the trustees bought twenty-five acres of land , and ground for the new building was broken Jan. i , 1873 . The land , which included the site of Fort Gillem , was beautifully located in the northwestern suburbs of the city ; and in the most beautiful spot in these grounds the corner-stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ October . The school work went on in the old i ) uildings until January , 1876 , when Jubilee Hall was ready for occupancy , and the faithful Jubilee Singers took part in its dedication . Livingston lVlissionary Hall is almost as handsome a building as Jubilee Hall , and has been occupied since 1882 . It was built chiefly from a $6o , ooo gift from Mrs. Valeria G. Stone of Massachusetts , although much was added by friends in Europe . On the same square with Livingston Hall is located the Gymnasium , a handsome brick structure begun in 1887 . In the basement of this building is temporarily located the Manual Training department . The Model and Intermediate schools each have as yet only frame buildings , but it is hoped that , in the not distant future , they too will occupy homes that shall be monuments to the liberality of noble friends . In July , i888 , the corner-stone of the Episcopal Theological Hail was laid , and the handsome three-story brick building is rapidly nearing completion . This is the work of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the colored people . The aim is to give young colored men the literary advantages of Fisk University , and at the same time have them trained by Episcopal theological teachers in the Hall . I have thus given the bare history of Fisk University . But the most valuable part of its history can not be written by a pen like mine . The patient , earnest , hopeful work of the president and teachers , and the results of that work , make up the real history of Fisk University , and that can not be told in words . It is written in the character and work of the men and women who go out from the institution . In every state in the Union , and in almost every county in the South , these men and women are to be found . The first class was graduated in 1875 , and consisted of four from the collegiate and three from the normal department . Of these , one is president of a college in Mississippi ; one is principal of a public school in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ School for the Blind ; another is a successful physician in Austin , Texas . The school is unde the control of a Jubilee Hail , Fisk University . // board of trustees of whom Gen. Clinton B. Fisk is president , and Rev. E. E. Stickel is treasurer . The work of instruction is done by Rev. E. M. Cravath , D.D. , president , with a faculty of twenty-seven teachers . While these institutions for the education of girls and for the education of colored people were being established , the proper education of the white youth of the South W. H. Payne , LL.D. , PRESIDENT OF THE PEABODY NORMAL COLLEDE. was being much talked about , especially by Nashville people , and most especially in Methodist circles . The leaders of Methodism in the South realized the importance to that church and to the country of the establishment of a great school in the South . The publishing interests of the church were located at Nashville , and everything pointed to Nashville as the proper place for the establishment of such a school , if such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee of prominent Methodist ministers and business men was appointed as early as i868 or 1870 , to devise plans . It was agreed to raise half a million dollars by private subscription . While this was being done , Bishop McTyeire of Nashville paid a visit to the family of Cornelius Vanderbilt in New York - Mrs. Vanderbilt being a relative of the Bishop . As a result of this visit Mr. Vanderbilt gave to the Methodist Episcopal Church , South , for the establishment of a university , $500,000 . This was by far the largest donation ever made by a single individual to a school in the South . Under the terms of the gift , the university was to be located at Nashville and be under the presidency of Bishop McTyeire , who should receive a salary of $3000 and have a residence on the grounds during life . " This donation , " says the secretary , in a statement furnished me , " was subsequently increased until the entire donation amounted to $i , ooo , ooo . Since that time the special donation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1879 , has added to the campus Wesley Hall , a commodious structure for the use of the Theological Department , the Gymnasium and its outfit , the Science Hall , and a complete equipment of approved apparatus for instruction in engineering . In July , 1883 , Mr. W. H. Vanderbilt added $roo , ooo to the permanent endowment of the University . In his will he bequeathed to it $200 , ooo , and this sum has been added to the endowment . In January , r888 , Mr. Cornelius Vanderbilt , grandson of the founder , made a donation of $30,000 for the erection of a Hall of Mechanical Engineering and for additions to the University Library . The amount of the permanent endowment 15 $900,000 , and the amount invested in grounds , buildings , furniture , apparatus , etc. , is over $fioo , ooo . " The University has seven departments , - Academic , Biblical , Law , Medical , Dental , Pharmaceutical , and Engineering , - each department having its own building , save that the Academic department and the department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Science Hall and Wesley Hall , both imposing structures , stand at the right of the main building . In the rear , and on another part of the grounds , stand the Observatory and the Gymnasium - both thoroughly furnished for their work . The Hall of Mechanical Engineering has just been completed . The department of Medicine occupies the grounds and buildings of the University of Nashville , as explained elsewhere . The handsomest public building in the city is that for the Law and Dental // departments , on Cherry Street , in the heart of the city . It is of red brick with brownstone front , five stories high , and supplied with every convenience . In addition to all these buildings there are nine professors houses , nine other houses for attaches of the University , and seven domitories , all grouped about the western part of the grounds . To prevent the thought that the grounds have a crowded appearance , it is well to say here that the campus comprises seventy-two acres of rolling forest land , as beautiful as can be found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and these houses and lands do not make a university , even with the addition of the six hundred and more students in attendance last year . The brains and the culture that direct these give Vanderbilt its power . The seventy professors and instructors are presided over by Chancellor L. C. Garland , AM. , LL.D. , and the entire organization is directed by a Board of Trust , consisting of twenty-nine Methodist ministers and laymen chosen from every section of the church . Of this Board all the bishops are members , and Bishop R. K. Hargrove , was recently chosen to fill the place of honor made vacant by the death of Bishop McTyeire . Vanderbilt University is the greatest educational institution of the most powerful church in the South and Southwest . The last , and history may say the most important , step taken during the decade for the development of the educational interests of Nashville was the organization of what is now the Peabody Normal College , in 1875 . Dr. Barnas Sears , then agent of the Peabody Education Fund , saw that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - men and women educated with a view to making teaching the serious work of their lives . To this end normal instruction must be given them . That was a field of education almost new to the Southern people . There were schools for lawyers , and schools for doctors , and schools for preachers , and schools for book-keepers and accountants , - all these in abundance . Teachers had been either " born " or " just happened . " The wise and prudent Dr. Sears saw that the most far-reaching and valuable work that could be done with the great philanthropist 's money was in the line of educating teachers . Because of Nashville 's geographical and climatic advantages , and still more because of her already high standing in the educational world , Dr. Sears believed this to be the place for the establishment of a great normal college , such as the bequest of George Peabody provided for . Prominent educators in l'ennessee had been laboring to induce the State to establish a college for the free The Peabody Normal College , Main Building . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was known as the " State debt question " so involved the finances of the State that there was little probability of success in a scheme that would require a large annual expenditure of the State 's money . Just at this time , in 1873 or 1874 , Dr. Sears came upon the scene with a plan to help provide the State with a normal school . According to the terms of the agreement finally made , the State was to appropriate $io , ooo per annum , the trustees of the University of Nashville were to furnish the buildings and grounds and maintain them in good condition , with needed improvements , and the Peabody Board was to supply the running expenses . These aggregate about $30,000 annually , covering one hundred and fourteen scholarships of $200 each . At Dr. Sears 's suggestion , the Peabody Board elected Dr. Eben S. Stearns , of Massachusetts , president of the Normal College , which , through courtesy , was called the State Normal College ; and the University Board elected him chancellor of the University of Nashville , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prior to the middle of 1875 , hut the school was not opened until the i 5th of December , and then with but thirteen students . Dr. Stearns was not the man to be discouraged , and through his indomitable will and perseverance the school grew steadily until his death , in 1887 . At the request of the State Board , Professor Penfield of the faculty took the direction of the school until the appointment of Dr. Stearns s successor . Dr. J. L. M. Currey had meantime succeeded Dr. Sears on the Peabody Board ; and by him the presidency was offered to Prof. W. H. Payne of the University of Michigan . " A great work is opened before you in the South , " he said to Professor Payne , " and it is your duty to go . " The purpose of the Peabody Board to unite the Southern educational fund and devote it to Trimble School . The Fogg and Hume Schools . // the establishment of a great central normal university in Nashville was emphasized , and the XVestern teacher consented to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ably filled by his predecessor . Dr. Payne , who is known to the teaching profession througho*ut the country by his pedagogical writings , has already proven the wisdom of Dr. Currey 's choice . His life has been spent in the schoolroom , the last eight years having been devoted to the teaching of teachers in the University of Michigan* . His advent instantly gave new life to the school , and the work and the growth of the school have gone strongly forward . The school opened in 1875 x*th thirteen students , but closed the year with sixty-six . The year 1887-8 enrolled one hundred and seventy-seven ; and the year 1888-9 two hundred and eighty . For the work of the coming year three members have been added to the faculty , which now numbers fifteen men and women . As to the aims of the College , Chancellor Payne has these brief words to say - " It is not the purpose of the Peabody Board to duplicate any existing normal school , but to found an institution for the professional education of teachers , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is proposed to educate a body of young men and women who , by virtue of their literary attainments and professional knowledge , shall be capable of doing th' highest quality of work as superintendents , principals , assistants in high schools and colleges , institute instructors , etc . For this purpose at least three things are necessary : ( i ) A literary training of the collegiate or university type ; ( 2 ) a thorough knowiledge of the history , philosophy , and art of education ; and ( * ) a large endowment of the professional spirit , or that temper of mind which will make educational work one 's vocation or profession . In other words , the aim of the school is to train men and women who will become eminent in educational work , as other professional schools have made men eminent in law , medicine , and theology . That the Peabody Board will endow such a school as this , there is no doubt ; and that the present Peabody Normal College will be this school , I have but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests and conditions which is by no means without difficulty . By its geographical position , its climate , and its pre-eminence as a city of schools , Nashville would seem to be the predestined seat of this great normal university . A second factor of prime importance in this determination is the friendly and liberal spirit of the State of Tennessee towards the Peabody Normal College . That the question of local support and sympathy will very largely affect the final decision , there is not the least doubt . When the intent of the Peabody Board has been realized , the institution which it endows will overshadow any other in its effect on civil and social progress ; and the state in which it is located will enjoy its advantages in a pre-eminent degree . Another circumstance favorable to the location of this great school in Nashville , is the hospitable and zealous spirit of the University of Nashville . This institution , justly proud of its brilliant prestige and honorable history , proffered its commodious buildings and beautiful grounds to the Agent of the Peabody Board when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and from that day forward has expended all its resources on the school to which it had opened its doors . Such an institution as the one here outlined carmot prosper without a hearty ' and permanent alliance with the university spirit . The professional teacher of the type contemplated by this school must first of all have scholarly attainments and be possessed of the scholarly spirit . For the higher and nobler purposes of the educating art , the fatal limitation of the teacher educated in the current normal school is his lack of scholarship and the instincts and aspirations of the scholar . It is a mo* fortunate circumstance that the Peabody Normal College has inherited university traditions and privileges , and it will be a more fortunate day when its pupils can be inspired by university training and culture . A dozen teachers of this catholic model will do more to influence public education than a hundred who have had only the training of a normal school . ' So much for the Peabody Normal College ; for such the action of the Peabody Board and the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the University of Nashville . The Normal College really forms the collegiate department of the old University , of which there are two other departments . Morltgomery Bell Academy was founded in 1867 , and made the preparatory department . The fund for its support is derived from a bequest of Montgomery Bell , the pioneer iron-maker of Tennessee ; and its graduates are admitted to the normal and university courses without examination . The Medical Department was organized in i8*o , and was in a prosperous condition from the first . In 1875 , however , it was correlated with the Vanderbilt University , and is now known as the Medical Department of Vanderbilt University and the University of Nashville . The citizens of Nashville are proud of every one of these institutions ; but if the stranger in Nashville &amp;ould introduce a subject that will at once command attention and call forth expression from every citizen present , be has but to speak of the public schools . In these all are interested ; and of them all are proud and prompt to speak . I have said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first chartered academy for girls in the United // States ; the most richly endowed university and the largest college for women in the South . These facts are not mentioned here in an idly boastful way , but as evidence that the claim to a superior educational atmosphere is well founded . In this line comes the additional claim that one of the first , if not the first , system of city schools in the South was organized in Nashville . In 1851 , when the town of South Nashville established a system of graded schools supported by a direct tax of the people , exactly as the town schools of New England are supported , it excited much comment throughout the South . No town in Tennessee had tried it . These first schools had for principal and superintendent , Col. J. G. Fellows . Within less than three years from the opening of South Nashville Institute in x8* i , the city of Nashville proper had organized a similar system of schools on a larger scale , which organization has been perpetuated . The town of South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city of Nashville ; and the building which was occupied by the first graded school in Tennessee continued in its unpretentious career as a school-house , known of late years as " Trimble School . " Only last year was it pulled down to make room for the prettiest and most perfectly appointed school building in the city . It has been the policy of the city government for the past few years to build a modern school every two years , the last always being the best . The system now has fourteen schools , five of which are for colored children and presided over by colored teachers . Two of the smallest of these buildings for colored children are rented , but will soon be replaced by houses fully in line with the other improvements . The value of school property is now $283,000 . The entire system is under control of a Board of Education , consisting of nine members and a superintendent . Godfrey M. Fogg is the present president of the Board , and Z. H. Brown is the superintendent . The school population of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was 15,911 the enrolment was 7723 ; and the average daily attendance , 6139 . The number of teachers was 147 , at an average salary of $582 . The influence of these schools upon the educational thought and the development of school work throughout the State can not be calculated . It may properly be added here that every county in Tennessee is a part of a State system of schools ; and no less than eighteen towns and cities have an organized system of graded schools .
