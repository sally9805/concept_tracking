Here 's every member of my company fancying that he was cut out for a tragedian and turning up his nose at burnt-cork , as though disposed to quarrel with the steps by which he had ascended . If this goes on , I shall have to take to the sock and buskin in self-defence , I suppose . Enter Forrest , l . Mr. B. Mr. Brown Now , sir , what 's all this ridiculous masquerading about . For .

Mr. Forrest Here 's passion : " Liar and villain ! May dy perjured t'roat Blister and crinkle wid de foul deceit , And imps unnumbered from sulphureous depths Goad and torment you till de firm ground yawns , And amid belching flames you falls and dies ! " ( Makes a rush for Mr. Brown , who dodges him . He falls panting into a chair . Mr. B. Mr. Brown I pity the poor wight that may be doomed to play you seconds .

If nothing else fetches him , such an imprecation as that ought to . For .

Gub us an engagement , bossy ? Mr. B. Mr. Brown Put it in the shape of a burlesque and I 'll think of it ; but as I very much fear that the only effect of such acting as that would be to play the audiences out , as well as the manager , for the present the old resource must serve our turn , and " eccentricity " still our refuge be !
