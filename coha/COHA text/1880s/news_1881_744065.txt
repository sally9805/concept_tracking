txt A daring but probably unsuccessful attempt was made last night by a gang of seven burglars to open the safe of the First National Bank at St. Clair . The combination knob on the safe was knocked off with a sledge-hammer. and holes were drilled through the lock and charged with powder , which was exploded , with what effect remains yet to be known , as the door has not yet been opened . Before commencing work on the safe the burglars assaulted Night-Policeman Hansor , thinking he had the keys to the street door . After knocking him down and choking him until he was nearly lifeless , they handcuffed and gagged him and carried him to a secluded part of the city , where they endeavored , by threatening to kill him , to make him produce the keys . Finding that he did not have them , they carried him to the bank , into which one of the gang effected an entrance by climbing up to a veranda in the rear of the building and breaking open a window , through which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his companions . Upon getting into the bank some of the gang went to work upon the safe , while others tied the policeman upon a chair in the Directors ' room . They remained in the bank fully two hours , and Hansor heard the explosions of the powder in the safe lock . They left most of their tools in the hank . Hansor succeeded in releasing himself in a few minutes after their departure and gave an alarm , but the gang had disappeared , two going to Canada in a small boat . The five others remained on this side . All wore masks , and their work proves them to be experienced cracksmen . No names were mentioned among them , but each had a number by which he was designated .
