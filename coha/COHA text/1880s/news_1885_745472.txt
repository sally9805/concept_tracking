txt The Hon. Henry B. Brown , Judge of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan . had an extra judicial experience last night , which he probably would n't care to have repeated right away . About 2 o'clock this morning he was awakened by a masked burglar standing at the foot of his bed . As soon as he realized that there was a stranger in the room he said : " What do you ; want there ? " The burglar , who had by this time covered the Judge and his wife with a huge revolver , coolly answered , " Lie perfectly still and everything will be all right . " As discretion seemed the better part of valor , Judge Brown was silent , but his wife screamed at the top of her voice . The burglar . who was remarkably cool , then said he would n't hurt anybody , but wanted what money there was in the house . Be was told there was none , but at once replied that that excuse was " too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed with his revolver , the robber took up the Judge 's trousers , which were lying on a lounge at the foot of the bed . Shaking them , some keys rattled , which the burglar took for money . The Judge assured him there was none , but the burglar was not satisfied , and fished around in the pockets until ho extracted about $2 in silver change . Then he came alongside the bed and coolly extracted the gold studs from the Judge 's shirt . Seeing Mrs. Brown 's gold watch hanging at the head of the bed he appropriated it . Then he made the Judge raise his pillow in order that he might see what was under it and found there a gold watch . " Do n't take my watch , " said the Judge . " What makes you like that so much ? What 'll you give me for it ? " was the cool rejoinder . Then the watch disappeared in the villain 's capacious pocket . The burglar next spied a bureau at the side of the bed .

Seeing that the fellow was determined to open the bureau Judge Brown leaned out of bed and opened one drawer to show him there was nothing inside . While doing the same to the second drawer with his right hand he cleverly slipped in his left hand and secured the coveted revolver . Although the weapon has not been used for 10 years the Judge at once tired at the burglar , who was so greatly taken back that he seemed to lose all control of his own actions and gave up further thought of plunder . He made immediately for the door , in the meantime tiring toward the bed , but he was so badly rattled by the turn atfairs had taken that his bullet did no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glar with another . He then sprang out of bed and followed him out of the room . While the fellow was going down the winding stairs several shots were tired at him by the Judge and were returned with somewhat better aim . One struck the balusters and glanced off into the wall . It must have struck quite close to where the Judge was standing at the time . By this time the noise of the firing and Judge Brown 's shouts for the police aroused the neighbors , who were soon on the snot . The room was found full of smoke from the repeated firing , and smelling decidedly warlike . It was ascertained that the thief had opened a back door and lighted the gas in the lower hall to facilitate his escape in Just such an emergency as befell him , and by this means he safely made his exit . evidently not having been hit by any of the balls sent after him from the Judge 's pistol .

His coolness under the trying circumstances , however , was admirable , and his escape trom harm from the repeated shots of the burglar is cause for general congratulation in all circles in this city where Judge Brown is held in great esteem .
