txt There is no question which presents itself to the student of our institutions more forcibly than this : How can the generally acknowledged laxity in the execution of the laws be remedied ? For the limited purposes , the attainment of which is intrusted to , the Government in most of our communities , the laws that are made are fairly adequate . Offenses of every grade are reasonably well defined , and the penalties for guilt are sufficiently severe . The process of trial , though far from perfect , is on the whole good enough to secure justice when justice is sought with energy . The great difficulty lies in the carelessness and indifference shown in the application of the laws . Take , for instance , the protection of the harbor and the shores of the harbor of New York . The laws which prohibit the dumping a garbage into the water , except at certain times and within certain limits , so arranged that the refuse can be carried to sea by the outgoing tide , are very explicit and comprehensive . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid material in the Bay . Yet year after year both these offenses have been committed times without number , while the cases in which they have been punished are very rare . With reference to the 4umplug of garbage , the outrage has been the greater , because it has been invariably permitted or committed by the authorities of the City of New-York or those employed by them . To a less extent , this has also been true of the dumping of solid refuse . On the face of it this state of things seems incredible The interests involved are certainly sufficiently great to justify attention . The preservation of the harbor is of the utmost importance to the commerce of the City , and is even necessary to its prosperity . Millions have been spent and are being spent to improve it . It is almost inconceivable that the harbor should at the same moment be injured by the acts of the public authorities themselves . In the same way the scattering of garbage upon an incoming tide affects the interests , the comfort , and even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has gone on without any efficient interference for years . A few days ago , however , the proprietors of the pleasure resorts on Coney Island took this latter matter into their own hands . They employed a small steamer to patrol the waters adjacent to the island ; they secured the services of a few policemen to execute arrests , and they promptly brought to book the first boat-master found violating the law . If they proceed as vigorously as they have begun there is no doubt that they will accomplish what has hitherto seemed the impossible achievement of making the employes of the City observe the laws under which they are acting . This example is very instructive . What was the secret of the difference between the vigilance , activity , and directness with which these private citizens carried out their purpose and the confusion , indifference , and hopeless , procrastination which . characterized the course of those to whom the law had intrusted the same purpose ? It was very simple , and consisted in the fact that with the former their work was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a matter of official obligation . The explanation is not flattering to the character of those whom we choose for public duties , but it is unquestionable , and . it is very significant . The principle which is illustrated by this incident is capable of extensive application . Our laws would be far more generally and thoroughly enforced if their enforcement was , as far as possible , left to those who are to profit directly by it , and as little as may be to those who make it an affair of routine duty . Whatever may be its other advantage , the **25;55;TOOLONG form of government , as it is practiced among us , is not capable of any considerable degree of executive energy . Officers who are elected by universal suffrage feel a very vague sense of responsibility . If they happen to be men of high principle and native force of character , they will faithfully employ all the powers delegated to them . But there is little in the method of choosing them which makes it easy to secure men of this stamp . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our officers , there is next to nothing in their relation to the public to impel them to an adequate discharge of their duties . If they do well , they gain only an indifferent reputation , which may or may not serve to advance their re-election ' . If they slip through their term with no special evidence of their fitness for office , it will depend rather on their shrewdness as politicians than on anything else whether they will be retained , promoted , or dismissed . There is , at best , ' almost no direct connection between merit in office and success in politics . Under these circumstances , feebleness in executive work is inevitable , and should be recognized as inevitable , and every means should be used to remedy it . Of such means , enlisting the interests of individuals is the most direct , constant , and available . This is especially true as to the execution of the laws intended to secure the safety of life and property . Just , as the Coney Island hotel owners promptly found a method to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so other persons exposed to loss or danger should be called in to promote the enforcement of the laws ' intended to protect them . In such instances as those of the disasters on the Sound and at Hell Gate , if persons injured in property or by loss of relatives were allowed a liberal award of damages . against owners , unless these could show affirmatively that they had complied with all the requirements of the law , we may be sure that the law would be far better observed . Nor would . there be any injustice in such . a procedure . In these cases it is generally impossible for casual passengers to prove the violation of regulations , while it is perfectly possible for owners and officers to prove the observance of regulations if they have been observed . The - whole system which ' leaves elected officers to execute laws from a sense of their official obligation , and makes individual interests almost wholly dependent on the strength of this obligation , has broken down in practice . It is high time that it should be modified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
