Mrs. Ulyeses S. Grunt : DEAR MADAM : So many misrepresentations have appeared in regard to the loan made by me to Gen. Grant , and reflecting unjustly upon him and myself , that it seems proper to briefly recite the facts . On Sunday , the 4th of May last , Gen. Grant called at my residence and asked me to lend him $150,000 for one day . I gave him my check without question , not because the transaction wits business like , but simply because the request came from Gen. Grant . The misfortunes which overwhelmed him in the next 2t hours aroused the sympathy and regret of the whole country . You and he sent me within a few days of the time the deeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my acceptance , on the ground that this was the only debt of honor which the General had personally incurred , and these deeds were returned . During my absence in Europe the General delivered to my attorney mortgages upon all his own real estate , household effects , and the swords , medals , and works of art which were the memorials of his victories and the presents from Governments all over the world . These securities were , in his judgment , worth the $150,000 . At his solicitation the necessary steps were taken by judgment , &c.,; to reduce these properties to possession , and the articles mentioned have been this day bought in by me and the amounts bid applied in the reduction of the debt . Now that I am it liberty to treat these things as my tam , the disposition of the whole matter Most in accord with my feelings is this : I present to you as your separate estate the debt and judgment I hold against Gen. Grant , also the mortgages upon his real estate , and all the household furniture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swords , commissions , medals , gifts from the United States , States , cities , and foreign Governments , and all articles of historical value and interest , shall at the General 's death , or if you desire it sooner , be presented to the Government at Washington , where they will remain as perpetual memorials of his fame and of the history of his time . I inclose herewith assignments to you of the mortgages and judgments , a bill of sale of the personal property , and a deed of trust in which : he articles of historical interest are enumerated . A copy of this trust deed will , with your approval , be forwarded to the President of the United States for deposit in the proper departMeat . Trusting that this action will meet with your Acceptance and approval , and with kindest rejards to your husband , I am , yours respectfully , ' W. IL VANDERBILT . NEW-YORK CITY , Jan. 10,1S85 . DEAR Sin : Mrs. Grant wishes me to answer lour letter of this evening to say that while she appreciates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to secure my lebt of $150,000 , she can not accept it in whole . She accepts with pleasure the trust which applies to articles enumerated in your letter to go to ; he Government of the United States at my death , or sooner , at her option . In this matter you have anticipated the disposition which I had Contemplated making of the articles . They will be delivered to the Government as soon as arrangements can be made for their reception . Papers relating to all other property will be Nturned , with the request that you have it sold and the proceeds applied to the liquidation of the debt which I so justly owe you .

I have only to Add that I regard your giving me your check for the amount without inquiry as an act of marked and unusual friendship . The loan was lo me personally . I got the money , as I belewd , to carry the Marine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank was solvent , but owing to unusual calls needed assistance until it could call in its loans . I was assured by Ferdinand Ward that the firm of Grant &; Ward had over $600,000 to their credit at that time in the Marine Bank . besides $1,300,000 of unpledged Securities in their own vaults .
