ARTICLE . IV. - DANGER OF SILVER COINAGE . THE history of the Latin Union is strong evidence in favor of the practicability of a bi-metallic currency . It fully justilies the belief that no harm can result from an effort to establish such a currency , provided that all the leading nations enter into a close compact with each other for that purpose . But the real lesson for us is that for this country to continue to coin silver , and to make it a full legal tender , while the mints of other nations are closed to it , is fraught with the gravest perils : becanse such a course could result only in our ultimately becoming a silver nation . IMiany of the politicians of this country contend that there is no such danger before us , and that all the predictions that have been made have been the assertions of false prophets whose opinions are not worthy of consideration . That there have been direful predictions which have not been realized , we must admit . But the failure of these predictions does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the peril does not still exist , or that it does not become more certain with each succeeding year . It merely shows that those who saw the peril failed to measure accurately the causes operating to bring the evil upon us . The more thoughtful of those who warned the country of the danger of the course we are pursuing , have not believed that the evil effects of that course would be at once felt , but that the danger was more or less remote , though not the less real because not at once apparent . They well know that it must take several years , and possibly many years , for the coinage of silver to reach such an amount as would drive gold out of circulation , and thus overthrow the old basis of values , and create in its stead a new basis of valuation , in which the dollar would have less value , and therefore a diminished purchasing power ; - in other words , when all commodities would command a higher price , measured by the money iu circulation . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currency of a great country can not be changed // in a day , nor in a year , but that it must take many years to effect a radical change in the metallic money of a great country . It is this fact that has misled so many and brought them to believe that there is no danger because it does not at once make itself felt . It would seem that any man of ordinary understanding ought to know that when the currency of a country amounts to many hundreds of millions of dollars , it must take many years to effect a change in the use of one metal for that of the other . A change may be more rapidly brought about by the issue of paper money . In a change from the use of gold to the general use of silver , it may take a great many years , if the amount coined is limited ; still the change may be brought about in a very few years . It is a question of machinery , as to the rapidity with which the silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change from a metallic currency to a paper currency may be brought about in a very short time by the issue of government legal-tender paper , and gold and silver both be driven entirely out of circulation . In a change from gold to silver , the process is necessarily less rapid , as the work of getting the metal , and coining it , takes much more time ; and if the amount coined each year should be limited to a small proportion of the circulation , the time required would be prolonged . With paper money , it is merely a question of printing presses , and the number of hours each day they are run . The advocates of silver are not content with limited coinage , though it will in time bring us to a silver standard . They demand free coinage , which would precipitate the evil , and with little delay reduce the currency to the silver valuation . They do not seem to care that they carry confusion into the finances and business of the country . Many of them know that such would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that to most people the currency question is a sealed book , and that the most erroneous views are the popular ones , and that by playing upon the ignorance , prejudice , and credulity of others they may hold offices for which they have not the first qualification . To these men it is a game of politics , in which the best interests of the country are but pawns in their hands , to be sacrificed whenever their political necessities seem to require it . // There is nothing in human experience more fully demonstrated , than that when a country creates a new currency of less value than that in use , if it is issued in sufficient amounts , the older and more valuable money will in time disappear from circulation , and the poorer money will take its place . Where men fall into error in regard to this rule-Gresham 's Law as it is called-is that they do not give it time to work out its fulfillment . They seem to think that if a thing does not happen in a day , a month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They forget that the world was not made in a day ; and that natural laws , though always in force , do not always work with great rapidity , but on the contrary it takes time for them to reduce cause into effect . The poorer money never drives out the more valuable money at once . lit does not do so at all until there has been enough of the poor money issued to inflate the currency so as to cause a rise of prices . Then the superior money is less seen in circulation , and it begins to leave the country . The outflow will be in proportion to the amount of the inferior money issued , and if the inferior money is issued in such amounts as to fill the channels of circulation , the good money will not be needed for ordinary business transactions , and there fore it will entirely disapppear from circulation . A subsidiary&gt;oinage , though much below full value , will remain at its nominal value so long as the amount coined does not greatly exceed that needed for small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it will become depreciated , and will pass at its face value only in sums for which it is a legaltender . If the entire currency should be of that character , and coinage be free , or even if the coinage be limited-provided this limitation does not restrict the coinage to such an extent as to prevent the amount put into circulation from becoming the greater part of the currency-it will become depreciated . If coinage is free , or the limitation is so broad as to amount practically to free coinage , coin will sink to the value of the metal of which it is made . And after this coin has become the sole currency of the country , if the coinage be limited , the consequent depreciation will be measured by the excess of the amount coined and put in circulation . The // latter remark is confined to the circulation of the coins in the country where issued , but does not refer to their value if sent to another country . Outside the boundaries of the issuing country , the coin would have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In other words , under free coinage the purchasing power of the money would be that of the value of the metal only . A dollar having seventy cents worth of silver in it , though called a dollar , would buy only seventy cents worth of commodities . Or to put it in another way , commodities which have heretofore sold for seventy cents , would now sell for a dollar of the current money ; - an advance in price of upwards of forty per cent . A man working for ten dollars a week in money of full value , we will say , can buy the following named articles , all needed for the comfort of his family : 10 lbs . sugar , 2 lbs . butter , 50 lbs . flour , 1 calico gown , 2 pair shoes , 2 caps for boys , 1 doz. eggs , 3 lbs . lard , 2 lbs . rice , and sundries 90 cents , which consumes his week 's wages . With a depreciated currency , such as has been mentioned , the same articles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the prices of commodities advance under a depreciated currency , the percentage of profits increases . It would not be out of the way to assume that the same quantity of commodities which had cost ten dollars , would , under a depreciated currency , such as we are considering , cost from fifteen to sixteen dollars . As wages are the last to advance , it is probable that his family would be deprived of many of the comforts which they had been accustomed to , even if they did not suffer from the want of the ordinary articles of food and clothing . All persons working for wages , or living on a salary , or on a fixed income of any kind , whether such income is the result of their labor , or interest on investments , would suffer from the depreciation of the money they receive . It is often asked how this depreciation of money comes about , and how it is that the good money disappears , leaving only the poor money in circulation . The result of our observation has been that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will therefore endeavor to explain the method by showing how inferior money always drives out superior money , by the operation of what is called " Gresham 's Law . " // Money is generally spoken of as though it had a personality , and was possessed of an aggressive power of its own , rather than as an instrument in the hands of men , from whom it must receive whatever of power and influence it exerts . Of itself it can do nothing . Locked up in a strong box and kept there , it is as valueless for all the uses to which money can be put , as though it had never been made . Placed in the vaults of banks ready for use , it can not exert any influence unless the conditions of trade are such as to call it out , and keep it in circulation . When the currency is in excess of the ordinary requirements of trade , such excess does not in any way affect prices , when the business of the country is in a normal condition . Nor does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be , in the least affect prices when the energies of a people have been paralyzed by a commercial crisis , followed by a period of industrial depression . Then , whatever the amount of money-it matters not how redundant the currency-prices will not advance , and any amount of currency will not serve to revive the drooping spirits or to encourage the hopes of a desponding people so as to give renewed activity to business , and to induce people to enter into new enterprises . On the contrary , prices will continue to fall , and the surplus money will flow into the banks , there to remain until prices have reached their true level , and until a change has taken place in the minds of the people . Not till hope , instead of despair , dwells in the human breast , will the idle money find steady employment , and thus be able to exert its proper influence . From the autumn of 1873 to the middle of the year 1878 , this country had a redundant currency , accompanied with falling prices , throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much demoralization of thought on monetary questions . There were some notable instances of men who had stood well in the world of monetary science , losing their grasp upon the principles of currency , and avowing their belief that the volume of currency had no direct bearing upon the price of commodities . Some remarks made by Mr. Gladstone , in regard to not issuing small notes , in order that there might be a large amount of coin in the hands of the people , // from which the reserves could be replenished in case of a drain of specie from the country , seem to indicate that he had fallen into the same error , or that he was not as well posted in monetary science as he is in many other great questions . Notwithstanding these notable instances of apostacy , the currency principle still remained a great power in the affairs of men . During that period it was dormant because the conditions were opposed to its active operation . It was inactive , as were in a great measure the energies of the people during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people brought about by a commercial crisis , that the redundant currency did not arrest the fall of prices . That was a period of settling up ; of finding out how we stood , of sifting and weeding out the weak and unsound , and as events finally demonstrated , a time of recuperation and accumulation also . There had been-through the operation of an inflated and depreciated paper currency  --  a long financial debauch , by which the financial system had been undermined , and greatly weakened , and which finally ended in a collapse . Our nerves were unstrung , and fear paralyzed our energies . We were holding our forces in reserve , waiting till times should mend , and industry and enterprise should again be rewarded with a fair compensation . In the meantime , goods accumulated in the store-houses , money flowed into the banks , to remain there until such time as renewed activity should create a need for it . Men waited and suffered , because they either knew , or felt , that there could not be any great improvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put on a better basis , and prices had found their true level , and that it was through prices finding their true level that the money of the country was to be restored to a sound and honest basis . In other words , until resumption of specie payments had come about . All waited for the great and blessed event . The 1st day of January , 1879 , had been set as the time when the government and the banks should resume . Everybody waited for that day , and many waited in fear and trembling , while others were impatient for the day to arrive , being assured that with that day would open up a new era of prosperity and happiness for the people of this country . The energy and industry of // the people were held in check , thus depriving money of those natural conditions of business activity , and speculation , which were necessary to put into operation the principles of currency by calling into use the idle money . To avoid confusion and to make the subject plain to everyone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle . " It is the doctrine that a currency issued in excess of the needs of a country to effect its internal exchanges at ruling prices , leads to a rise of prices of commodities , and that a contraction of the currency of the country below what is needed to effect the internal exchanges at current prices , brings about a fall of prices . It is through the operation of this principle that we arrive at this so-called Gresham 's Law , that inferior money drives superior money out of circulation . It matters not whether such inflation is caused by the issue of a government legal-tender paper , or by irredeemable bank notes , or by coining money of lighter weight , or coining it of an inferior metal , the result is the same . A metal that has been in general use for money , and has been discarded by a number of the leading nations as a leading money metal , becomes an inferior metal for monetary purposes . An excessive issue of any such money will cause a rise of prices , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Were it not so , as IRicardo says , " not a bank uote could ever have been permanently kept in circulation , nor would the discovery of the mines of America have added one guinea to the circulation of England . The additional gold would have found a circulation adequate and in which no more could be admitted . " This statement needs one qualification : it should be said that after the increased needs for circulation caused by the natural growth of business had been met , no more could be admitted . Surely this must be so , for if there were no money except gold and silver , and the bank note be introduced , it could not be kept in circulation unless its issue was followed by a rise in prices great enough to make the additional currency needed to effect the internal exchanges of the country . If the notes were paid out , they would immediately return to the banks in the form of deposits and payments to the banks . An increase in the production of the precious metals in excess of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole mass of gold and silver , whether coined or not . If either gold or silver be discarded by the majority of the nations that have used them , the one discarded becomes an inferior metal , and will inflate the currency of the nations that keep their mints open to it , and in time that will be the sole money of those nations . Any thing that becomes a substitute for the precious metals , and economizes their use , tends to produce the same results as would follow an increased production of them . If there were no banks in the country , and all business transactions were made with cash , the amount of money needed would be very great . But if there should be a bank started in every considerable place , the use of the check would greatly diminish the need for money , and the country would then have a much larger amount of currency than would be needed with which to effect the internal exchanges . The surplus money would find its way into the banks thereby enlarging their deposits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one doubt that the use of the check to such an extent would greatly economize the use of money , and thereby render the amount of currency in circulation much greater than would be needed ? That such would be the case no one would question . The country would have a large amount of money which it could not use unless there should be a great increase of business , or else a great rise of prices . There would be a rise of prices , but it would not be great enough to give full employment to all the money . The money being gold and silver , and used by the rest of the world ( especially gold ) , prices could not advance greatly beyond those in other countries , before gold would begin to flow out of the country , and to continue in its outward course , until the country had parted with the surplus and unnecessary part of the currency , leaving to the country just what is needed to effect the exchanges of the country with prices not greatly higher than elsewhere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries for something for which it has more use . The transaction is consummated through a rise of prices , which gives the gold greater value in other lands to which it goes , because it will inevitably find its way to that place where it will // buy the most . To question this is to deny the most fundamental principle of monetary science , and of values , whether of money , or any other commodity . Any thing that takes the place of another , and thereby diminishes the demand for it , must necessarily depreciate it . This is not the less true , because in times of inflation , gold seems to increase in value as it disappears from circulation . Gold does not under these circumstances increase in value , even in the locality where it commands a premium ; but , on the contrary , falls in value to the extent that prices rise to cause it to flow elsewhere . It is true that gold and all money in that country have fallen in value , and the rise of prices of commodities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold or other kinds , has become depreciated , and the rise of prices is but the expression of this fact , in such a way that people can see , and feel , the effects of inflation , brought about by the economy in the use of money , or by an excessive issue of paper , or by coining an inferior metal . The surplus money must be removed by gold going to other countries , before prices will return to their true level . Such release of gold in one country will add to the circulation of other countries , and therefore to some extent lower its value all over the world . For a while gold will buy as much in the country where its use has been diminished ; but in the course of time the rise on prices will affect the purchasing power of it , and gold become depreciated . Then if the amount displaced should be so great as to largely increase the amount of circulation of other countries , it would become of less value in those countries . lit would serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the increased demand for goods brought about by orders from the country from which gold flows , and thus , through this increased demand , cause a rise of prices in those countries , which in turn would act upon the people in such a way as to lead to an increased demand for all commodities , resulting in a general rise of prices . It will therefore be seen that inflation in one country , means inflation , to some extent , in every other country , therefore a general depreciation of money . It is not always to be expected that inflation in one country , will produce a marked expansion of the currencies of other // countries . The great mass over which it is distributed necessarily prevents serious disturbance , but the effect will be to somewhat increase the circulation of other commercial nations , and to somewhat advance prices . If the amount is great , it must increase trade , and give greater activity to business , and so to speculation , and in the course of time , to a rise of prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the practical demonetization of gold , by the introduction of an inferior currency by one country , is far-reaching in its effects ; that it affects the currencies of other countries , and tends to lower the value of all money , and that the country which causes the inflation retains the poor money . That the inferior money always ultimately drives the superior money out of circulation will need no demonstration to many , but there are also very many who do not comprehend it . For many there must be line upon line , precept upon precept , before they will be convinced that there is any such thing as poor money so long as it has the stamp of the government upon it . We have already said that the good money does not at once disappear upon the introduction of money of less value ; that it requires time to drive it out ; and that , under some circumstances , it may take many years . Gold will continue in circulation until the inferior money has been issued in such amounts as to add greatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that already in use , would be greatly in excess of what is needed to effect the internal exchanges . Then after the currency has become redundant , it will require activity in business to render the currency principle operative . We have also said that a redundant currency does not act on prices in periods of commercial depressions . That it is powerless of itself to inaugurate speculation , or even ordinary activity in business , the period to which we have referred abundantly testifies . For the currencey to have any influence on prices , there must be the necessary conditions . Those conditions are business activity and speculation . Speculation is the natural outcome of seasons of prosperity . When activity pervades every department of human industry , and men become sanguine and venturesome , then old enterprises are pushed to the utmost , and // new ones spring into existence . There is a rnsh and whirl in business , and goods can not be prodnced fast enough to satisfy the demand for them . There is work for every man ; and factories run into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no longer dull times , with everybody waiting for others to do something . Hope has again been born into the world , and men put forth all their energies , each striving to get his full share of the gain to be had from this gladsome condition of things . At this point the currency principle again begins to be operative . Now it is that money is powerful and seems instinct with life . It becomes a mighty instrument in the hands of bold and enterprising men . It stands behind them holding up their arms , and sustaining them , as they reach out , as though to possess the earth . Each new operation pushes up prices , thus creating the need for more money with which to effect the exchanges of the country-for the higher the prices of commodities , the greater the need for money . The heretofore surplus of money now finds ample field for its influence . As each advance of prices creates a need for more money , the new supply in turn holds the advance , and makes another possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expansion of the currency ; and the increase of currency leads to another rise of prices , to be followed by still another expansion of the currency ;  --  the rise of prices making the expansion necessary , if prices are to be maintained , and the expansion of the currency making another rise of prices possible and altogether probable , and in the case of an irredeemable paper currency , to be followed by an almost illimitable expansion of the currency . Long before this condition of things has been reached , prices are so high that gold will buy much more elsewhere , and it leaves the country , which hereafter must depend upon its irredeeinable paper for currency . The process which we have mentioned continues until the excess of currency is taken up and continued in circulation . And as there is a limit to which such currency can be issued , and as the country is shut out from the world 's supply , it can not draw money from other countries to meet its needs , there comes a stringency in the money market , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steals from // the capital engaged in holding up prices . A struggle of greater or less duration ensues , and in the meantime high interest , and other expenses , diminish the capital engaged in every kind of enterprise , while the money market can not give further relief , because the high price of commodities has already taken up all of the loanable funds . The banks not only can not make further advances , but they must curtail their discounts . The deposits are drawn down , thus , depriving the banks of the means of continuing their accommodations , and compelling them to call in loans already made . In the meantime , the demand for accommodation increases and becomes urgent , while the stringency of the money market becomes unbearable . One concern after another topples and falls , and the country again enters upon a commercial crisis , to be followed by a period of revulsion and prostration , which in turn leaves the country once more with a redundant currency , and at the same time with falling prices . The numerous failures greatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causes lower prices , a great amount of currency is released , which flowing into the banks makes an easy money market , and there is again seen a redundant currency , and low prices , for a considerable length of time . Under no kind of money can we hope to escape business troubles , and occasionally a commercial crisis . Under irredeemable-paper , constantly increasing in amount , the disaster when it comes is overwhelming , and bankruptcy general . Under a metallic currency of full value a crisis is not so severe , and failures are of less magnitude . Under an irredeemable paper currency , there is no limit to the advance of prices , so long as the currency is worth anything at all . Under a gold currency , prices can not advance so as to involve the country in general bankruptcy . When prices have advanced so that gold will buy more elsewhere , making allowance for cost of trans- , portation and other ordinary expenses , the exchanges will be against the country , and gold will be sent abroad to rectify the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices , and in many cases a commercial crisis is avoided , and only a temporary depression follows , which soon passes away , and business goes on as usual . The outflow of gold is notice to // every one that there has been overtrading , and at the same time , it operates to restrain further speculation , and the conntry retnrns to a natural and sound condition of things , without having passed through a prolonged period of business depression . An irredeemable paper currency does not furnish such a barometer , nor does it restrain speculation , so long as the currency continues to increase from additional issues . But when , from any cause , no more can be issued , and the circulation reaches a point where it is rigid , and there is no further possible expansion , business presses against this bar of limitation , is met as by a wall of iron against which it can not prevail , and the result is a great commercial crisis . The crisis is much greater than it would be if gold was in circulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could draw from other lands an addition to its own currency . Even if from the depression gold should flow into the country , it could not be n'sed for currency , but must keep its place as a commodity and take capital to carry it , until it arrives in such quantities as to become too heavy to be carried . Then gold and paper approach each other in value and if a portion of the paper be withdrawn gold goes into circulation , and specie payment takes place . Sometimes the growth of business is such that the gold is needed without a contraction of the paper , and in such cases the gold operates to expand the currency . The movements of commerce and trade are not steadily in one direction . A cycle is made up of a number of smaller cycles of less range , and of greater or less duration . There are many causes which operate against a continuous course of 4rade . Bad crops and political disturbances are the greatest of these causes . After a prolonged period of dull times , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The demand for commodities is strong and steady , and profits are fair if not liberal . Then follows a period of less activity and smaller profits , though in the meantime the country is gaining in wealth . Such reactions are desirable inasmuch as they are the healthy methods of correcting a tendency to overtrading and speculation , and extend the time before another commercial crisis . The smaller cycles are but parts of the great cycle , and , taken together , form one of the great periods of // commercial operations . Before a great cycle is completed , there is a general expansion of credits and as a natural consequence higher prices , which condition of things prevails until the natural increase of business from the growth and development of the country , together with the advance of prices , calls into use all of the currency , and gives full employment to the circulation , until there seemingly is an insufficient supply of currency . If business is to continue at the current range of prices , there must be more money . If no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices take a lower range . If the currency is of irredeemable paper , more will be issued , and speculation will take a wider range , and prices advance to a still higher figure , only to come to the same condition that has just been mentioned . If the currency is of gold , exchanges will call for gold for exportation , and prices will gradually fall to their true level , and there will be renewed activity in business . It will be found that the high prices have called into use all of the money , and at the same time there has been a rise in the rate of interest . Bankers are no longer dictated to by the borrowers , as to the rate of interest which they shall receive . The banker is now an autocrat , whose yes or no means something every time the words are uttered . Prices are above their true level ; that is , commodities sell for more in that country than in other countries , after making allowance for cost of transportation and other necessary charges , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will not buy as much in the country where prices have thus risen . Merchants seeing that they can import at a profit , place their orders with foreign houses for large amounts of merchandise . In the very nature of the case , these orders increase both in number and amounts , thereby greatly enlarging the amount of imports which must be paid for . On the other hand , the high prices at home diminish the exports , and the country finds itself with a greatly decreased demand for its own productions . Then again , the increased importations operate to diminish still further the demand for home goods , and to throw still greater numbers out of employment . When this point has been reached , we find Gresham 's Law in full operation , and we soon realize that some of our money will leave us , and that some has already gone , and // that more will follow . And it is the best nioney*that goes , and the poorer money that remains . Finally the outflow of gold reaches such magnitude as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause a great stringency in the money market , and a collapse follows , and the cycle is completed by a period of business depression , and falling prices , which generally lasts until prices reach their tine level , and even go below the true basis of values . Then gold begins to come into the country again , and after a while business revives , and the country enters upon another cycle . The usual course is , first , business activity with rising prices , a general and profound confidence in a magnificent future , with still higher prices , followed by a general enlargement of business of all kinds , then a moderate reaction in some of the leading manufactures , such as iron and cotton , to be followed by renewed activity and expansion . This process continues , and there is an absorption of circnlating capital into fixed forms , such as railroads , enlargements of factories , and building of new ones . New houses spring up almost everywhere . New companies are formed , and when there is an irredeemable paper currency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the hundreds . One can put his money into almost anything from an iron mine to a milk route . There is a general expansion of credits in all forms ; large and increasing importations to meet the demands of luxurious living are added to the already heavy imports as the result of high prices , which in time acts on the manufacturer by absorbing his market , thus compelling him to curtail his production because his market is filled with foreign goods . Then follows an enforced unproductiveness of capital , and an enforced idleness of labor , or else the manufacturer continues to produce goods for which he can not find a market ; in this way locking up not only his own capital , but compelling him to use his credit to the utmost , by borrowing of others the capital necessary to continue the struggle . When this condition of things has been reached , there generally is an adverse condition of the foreign exchanges , accompanied by a drain of specie , and if the financial machinery of the country be not sound and strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period of business depression , and falling prices , which continues until the drain of the specie is checked , and probably // until specie begins to flow into the country again . It is not to be expected that prices will stop falling when they have reached a point where specie will buy as much here as in other countries . Under such circumstances prices are usually somewhat below a specie basis , and it is not till they have so fallen that the turning point is reached , and specie begins to return , and in time prices arrive at their true level . It might seem that when prices have fallen so that gold will buy as much in one country as in another , that the movements of it would cease , and each country hold what it had ; but such is not the case . The movements of commerce are far-reaching , and can not be arrested at once . They continue to produce results long after the figures begin to appear on the wrong side of the ledger . Fortunate is the man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A country can not do so . When a country is a debtor one , that is , when it owes money abroad in the form of bonded debts , bonds and shares in railroads , etc. , and when its people spend large amounts in foreign travel , an outflow of specie may occur even when its exports of merchandise greatly exceed its imports . This might be so also , while it was increasing its indebtedness abroad . And the buying back of a portion of its own securities might proceed so far as to cause a very serious outflow of gold , and thus greatly add to such complications as already exists . It will be seen that a period of business activity and speculation generally results in some adv*iince of prices , and to an adverse condition of the exchanges , followed by an exportation of gold , which soon corrects the evil , unless there is an inferior currency issued ; and that a period of business depression forces prices below a specie level , and in consequence , specie flows into the country even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason of an inferior currency it can not be used for that purpose . It is for the time being of no consequence what the currency of the country may be , specie will continue to flow in , and in all probability to such an extent , that the inferior money will have the same purchasing power as specie . Then if a portion of the inferior money is withdr*wn from circulation , the superior money ( gold ) will go into the channels of circulation , and the currency be restored to a sound and honest condition . // The almost complete cessation of the ontflow of gold in 1878 , was in accordance with the doctrine that trade runs in cycles . There had been a long period of business depression , and a great decline of prices . Specie payments could not have taken place at all , had there not been a great fall of prices . If resnmption meant anything , it meant lower prices . A fall was the necessary precnrsor of resumption , otherwise it could not have taken place . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay for the bonds which the government sold , to get ready for January 1 , 1879 . A great fall of prices was necessary to arrest the outflow of gold , so that we might retain a portion of the production of our mines . It was from this source , together with the stock in the country , that we received the gold necessary for resumption . The great fall of prices , resulting in the reversal of our trade with other countries , brought us only $5,163,094 of gold in excess of that which went abroad . Previously to 1878 , the fall of prices had not been great enough to prevent the exportation of a part of the production of our own mines . With the rise of prices which followed the suspension of specie payments the excess of imports of merchandise greatly increased . The excess of imports during the years 1863 to 1873 , inclusive , were in round numbers $1,086,000,000 . The net export of specie for the same years was $673,000,000 . It is not difficult to trace the connection between the suspension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. tion of merchandise , and the great amount of specie exported . The suspension led to a great rise of prices , which in its turn , led to enormous importations , * and a great drain of the precious metals , which culminated in the commercial crisis of 1873 , at which time commenced a period of falling prices , that was to run through several years , and which was not to end until prices reached their true level . With the decline of prices , the excess of imports diminished , and finally disappeared altogether . As prices fell the exports began to exceed the im ports . The excess of exports were in 1876 , - - $ 79,643,481 1877 , - - - 151,152,094 1878 , - - 257,814,234 1879 , - - - 264,661,666 YOL. xv . 29 // The excess of exports over imports for the years as above , was $753,341,475 , and notwithstandiflg this great amount , there was no importation of specie , but on the contrary we exported about $60,000,000 of specie , in excess of that imported . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is interesting , and showing that with the decline of prices the excess of exports of specie diminished , and finally ceased . The net export of the metals were in 1872 , - - - $66,133,845 1873 , - - - 63,127,637 1874 , - - - 38,175,497 1875 , - - - 71,231,425 1876 , - 40,567,621 1877 , - 15,387,928 1878 , - - - 3,918,811 In 1876 , we did not export more than about one-half of the gold and silver produced by our mines , and in 1877 about one-fifth , and in 1878 , we retained nearly the whole amount produced . Prices had now reached about their natural level , and consequently the excess of exports of merchandise was great , and the demand for gold for exportation ceased . Paper and gold were approaching each other in purchasing power , and the country could resume specie payments if it took advantage of this condition of things . Fortunately the country did take advantage of the opportunity , and resumed specie payments , and the country has enjoyed a period of moderate prices , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1873 to 1878 , inclusive , were $123,400,456 . The production of the mines amounted to $240,991,674 , leaving to the country out of its own production , $117,591,218 , as an additional accumulation with which to resume specie payments . The excess of exports of merchandise from 1876 to 1882 , inclusive , amounted to $1,206,570,788 , and the net imports of gold were $179,748 ,  - -  592 , while the production of our mines amounted to $162,106 , . 218 , thus adding under specie payments $341,854,810 to the gold of the country , a large part of which went into the circulation . Had resumption not come about , no part of this great amount of gold could have gone into the circulation and re-* mained there . // We are a debtor nation , owing a large amount abroad for interest , and spending much in foreign travel we also pay quite an amount for freight on foreign vessels . We do not know just how much these items amount to each year , but for the purpose of illustration , we will assume that the interest on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and profits on foreign capital invested in this country , amount to $75,000,000 Paid in foreign travel , - - - - 75,000,000 Paid for foreign freight , - - - 15,000,000 Sundries , - - - - 10,000,000 $175,000,000 Amount of gold brought into the country by immigrants and by capitalists for investment , $40,000,000 ; leaving $135,000 ,  - -  000 in the nature of an annual fixed charge against the country , which must be paid , whether we buy anything abroad or not . We start each year with a very large amount maturing against us , though we do not buy anything of other nations . This great amount must be paid for , either in merchandise or gold , unless foreigners buy largely of our securities , and thus increase the amount of our indebtedness abroad , and so add to the annual fixed charges against the country . The exports of merchandise must greatly exceed the imports , or there will be a great amount of gold exported . Under any circumstances the exports should exceed the imports for a term of years . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasonably conclude that we are increasing our indebtedness abroad , or that there must be a large exportation of gold ; and if the amount of gold exported exceeds the production of our mines , it must draw from the currency of the country thereby contracting it . The excess of exports over imports , for the years 1876 to 1882 , averaged upwards of $170,000,000 a year . The excess of imports over exports , for seven months of this year , are $49,186,391 ; and the net export of gold , for the same months , is $41,901,220 . These figures are significant as showing the change that has taken place in a few years . From an annual excess of exports of mere than 170,000,000 , trade has from some cause or other changed , so that our imports , for seven months only , exceed our exports by upwards of $49,000,000. // The excess of imports of gold , for the seven years , averaged upward of $25,000,000 per annum . The excess of exports of gold , for the seven months of this year , amounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been this great change in our trade with other lands ? He would be bold , indeed , who should assert that the coinage of silver has had nothing to do with it . Whatever may be the cause , it matters not ; the fact remains , that a great change has taken place in our commercial relations with other nations ; and as a result of these changes gold is leaving the country in large amounts . That there may be a change in our foreign trade , which will to some extent diminish the outflow of gold , is to be expected ; but if we continue to coin silver , and add to the circulation $30,000,000 a year , we should not be surprised if gold continued to seek those countries which value it the most . If we coin silver in large amounts , and thus fill the channels of circulation with an inferior currency-for inferior it is , so long as other nations refuse to use it , except as a subsidiary coinage-gold will again leave us , and it is for us to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a people . We now can have the best money in the world , or we cangive it up , and try to be satisfied with money much inferior . We alone can decide the question . We can say whether gold shall leave us in large amounts , or whether it shall disappear entirely from circulation . It depends upon the amount of silver we coin . We may limit coinage at a point where it will not seriously affect gold . Then again , we may coin silver to such an extent as to deprive ourselves of all our gold , not only that which is already coined , but the entire production of our mines also . Free coinage of silver would bring it about in a very short time . Thus far the danger in continuing to coin silver has not been apparent to the casual observer , because it has not reached a point where it is dominant in the circulation , and where " Gresham 's law** has become an active principle in the currency . There have been two influences at work to modify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operating in favor of silver , it would in all probability have become , ere this , a more serious question . Surely , the nnwisdom of it would have become more apparent to every // one . The growth and development of the country undoubtedly carried with it the need of more currency , or at least made it necessary that it should not be diminished . Then again , the surrender of a large amount of national bank notes created a great gap in the currency . Both of these new demands for currency have been met by silver certificates , without greatly increasing the amount of the currency ; and as a natural consequence of these two demands acting at the same time , the silver thus far coined has not excessively increased the volume of the currency , therefore , it has not resulted in an inflation of the currency to such an extent as to make very active the principle of currency , and so the danger of silver coinage has been hidden from view . The gap in the currency , caused by the surrender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought about by the silver men in Congress , so as to make possible the coinage of silver in such a way that the danger might not be felt , and therefore not generally seen . The antagonism to the national banks in Congress had this end in view , and only this end , that coinage of silver might be carried to such an extent as to commit the country to the continued coinage of it . The issue of silver certificates was intended to disguise the evil , by removing the heavy silver coin from circulation , and so keeping it from public view , that people might not see the inconvenience of it , and might not realize the amount coined . The surrender of the remaining bank notes , and the payment of the legal-tender notes , would still further extend the amount to which silver might be coined without inflating the currency , though in case this course should be persued , part , and*that too large a part of the currency , would be infcrior money . There would be two kinds of metallic money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which would pass anywhere in the wide world at its face value , the other a light-weight coin , worth about two thirds of its nominal value , and which would have no circulation outside the boundaries of this country ; but would here circulate as money , because  --  and only because  --  the sum total of both does not exceed the amount of money needed to transact the business of the country , on the existing basis of values for commodities . Yet we should find that while the two moneys appeared to // circulate side by side , it would be the silver that was the most seen . In fact , such is already the case . Silver being of less value than gold , people will part with it first , and retain the gold as long as possible . Gold will be kept in the reserves , arid private drawers , and will not in any event be paid out , except in the absence of silver . While by retiring all of the paper money in the country , the field for silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its coinage delayed for many years , we should still have the danger before us , and we should still be steadily traveling the road to silver mono-metalism . After having filled the vacuum created by retiring the greenbacks , and the bank notes , there would be no new use for silver , except such increased need as there might be for more currency , by reason of the growth of business of the country . This might admit of the continued coinage of silver in small amounts each year , without destroying the present basis of values . But a large monthly coinage , or free coinage of silver , would be an addition to the currency riot needed ; it would therefore cause inflation , and depreciate the currency , and bring about a rise of prices , which would result in the exchanges being against the country , making necessary the exportation of gold . If the coinage of silver should be continued until it filled the channels of circulation , the currency would be inflated , and prices would advance until gold had entirely disappeared from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currency of the country , and wonld take its place as merchandise , and be bought and sold in the market the same as any commodity . A gold dollar would command a premium proportionate to the difference in the nominal value of the silver coins , the current money , and their real value as determined by the worth of the metal in the coins . And in case of speculation in gold , the premium might become much greater , thus adding to the cost of foreign exchange , which would tell still more against the country . We now have a currency in which gold is an important part and which we may retain if we decide to do so . But we can easily get rid of it . It is for us to say whether we will remain in the group of great nations , mutually helpful to each other , or whether we shall isolate ourselves or place ourselves in the // group of inferior nations . All we have to do to place our selves at a great disadvantage with other nations is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which shall drive gold out of circulation . What have we to gain by such a course ? It is as easy for us to have a gold currency as it is to have silver-why , then , prefer the latter ? Yet if we coin silver in such amounts as to supply the need for currency we shall lose our gold and become a silver nation . The law under which gold and silver were coined in 1794 and 1795 fixed the proportions between gold and silver at 15 of silver to one of gold . Under that law gold was undervalued and disappeared from circulation . In 1834 , the law was changed so that thereafter the ratio should be 16 to 1 . Tinder this law silver was underrated . " Silver went out of circulation and became the better metal to export , while for the same reason gold became the better remittance this way . The only silver which could circulate here was that which was worn or clipped until it was not worth more than silver rated at in our coinage. ** At the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inferior metal for monetary purposes . To continue to coin it in large quantities can not be a wise measure ; and all history shows that to coin to such an extent as to supply the need for currency must result in the standard of the country being lowered to that of silver .
