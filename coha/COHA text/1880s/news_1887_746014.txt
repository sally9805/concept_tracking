txt The Bacon investigating committee has .. done very good - work in Brooklyn , and has won , as it deserved , the hearty respect of the people of that badly governed city . It would do well , however , to insist upon respect from the men who are summoned before it . There is no good reason why it should allow its Chairman or any of its members to be insulted by persons over whom they have under the law entire control . Yesterday a man , named ANTnorrr BARRETT , a lawyer by profession and attorney , agent , and go-between for the little gang of Brooklyn politicians that captured the Citizens ' Electric Light Company , demanded to be put upon the stand in order to try to clear his " people " from the very damaging inferences forced . by the testimony of Mr. HonAcn E. DEArriva . He proved a truculent , vapory , rambling witness , and when he was lecturing Mr. PARSONS , the chief counsel for the committee , on his mode of examination , the Chairman . checked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Whereupon BARRETT called out , " You had better be careful how you address yourself to me , Mr. Chairman ! " Later he used vile epithets toward one of the members of the committee , which appear to have been called out by a remark in an undertone from the member . In the latter ease the committeeman was in fault if the remark was of an improper character , and in any case communications to witnesses should be made openly and formally . But the conduct of - the witness toward the Chairman was intolerable , and he should have been promptly put under arrest , and if he failed to purge himself should have been presented to the Assembly . The committee has acted throughout with the greatest fairness . Its Chairman has been patient and courteous to the point of.weakness , while at the same - time the inquiry has been searching and fearless . The transaction in which the man BA.ERETT was . engaged . was a very shabby one . His " people " obtained a controlling share of a company ( whose profits they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then forced the original owners to sell to them . They made a good deal of money in a very mean way , and . BAnRxres blatherskite . behavior on the stand was only an attempt to bully the committee , the counsel , and the public into overlooking the facts . The committee has a great deal to contend with . While its inquiry is regarded with approval and gratitude by all good citizens of Brooklyn who have followed it at all closely , it is : regarded with fear and . detestation by a good many men in both parties who are in danger of exposure from it . These men are actively or tacitly united to defeat the purpose of the committee and . to bring all connected . with it into discredit . Under these circumstances the committee should not hesitate - to use its powers to enforce decency and order in its presence with energy and promptness . It owes that much to itself and to the Legislature and the people whom it represents .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
