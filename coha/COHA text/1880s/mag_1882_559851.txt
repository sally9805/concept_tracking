As far as its literary merits are concerned the " United States Official Register " is not worth much of a review ; but from its solid mass of information it is possible to cull a few very instructive facts . In it are recorded the salaries of the servants of the public , and as a man 's pay is justly regarded as a measure of the esteem in which his kind of service is held , the instruction which the simple republican citizen derives from the Blue Book will not be entirely unmingled with disappointment . Of all of the grand divisions of the public service , that complex gathering of bureaux , the Department of the Interior , is most intimately connected with our people . As its name implies , it is the guardian of the nation 's domestic interests . Through it the inventor secures the reward of his genius , the miner a title to his claim , and the settler a patent for his homestead . It cares for the Indian , and pensions the soldier . It watches over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it notes the country 's advance in its thousand grooves of industry and discovery . One would suppose that , in order to find and keep men worthy of the important trusts of this department , salaries more liberal than common would be paid to a full corps of officers . The Interior Department has one assistant secretary , at three thousand five hundred dollars a year ; the State Department , which is the representative of the ceremonial , as the Interior represents the industrial interests of the country , is served by three assistant secretaries , one at four thousand five hundred dollars a year , and two at three thousand five hundred dollars each . In this connection it should be remembered that the Interior Department is in the full blast of active operations , and that the Department of State , in common with the War and Navy departments , may be said to be on waiting orders , awaiting some possible complications with the outside world , and // woe betide the energetic secretary who shall disturb its repose or depart from its established programme of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceive the unimportance of the duties of our ministers plenipotentiary to the countries of South America . In times of quietude they are but little more than pensioners , whose pensions are unnecessarily embittered by an exile to an unhealthy latitude ; in times of trouble , and in the unexpected emergency of a demand for diplomatic talent , they are speedily superseded by the special agent in diplomacy , a person who will always be found necessary and amply sufficient to attend to our foreign affairs . The least of these ministers receives a salary of ten thousand dollars a year . Our delegates to the monetary commission at Paris were statesmen appointed for a brief period to study , discuss , and regulate so important a subject as the world 's finance ; they were allowed five thousand dollars a year . The members of the tariff commission , upon whose report the commercial condition of the country is so largely dependent , and whose duties are worthy of the closest attention of the most able economists and business men of the nation , are paid ten dollars a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man is requested to leave his private affairs and do a particularly difficult piece of work for the Government at a merely nominal salary , that he should consider the honor of the appointment . Granted that work is honorable , and that therefore the tariff commissioner is more to be respected than the foreign minister ; but why should not the useless official take his pay in honor as well as the useful one ? It is hardly to be disputed that the soldier did more hard work and hard fighting during the late war than the sailor , and yet , in matters of promotion , retirement , etc. , the navy is treated more liberally than the army . Indeed , Congress has not yet finished awarding prize money to the navy for property destroyed at that time . A like equivalent to the army would make millionaires of some of our private soldiers . Much has been said about the iniquity of the Indian agent , and much injustice has been done to a class of men of whom only a very small percentage have been found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor is his responsibility a light one . In the community of barbarians to which he is sent he is president , judge , law-giver , banker , commissary , teacher , friend , and a hundred things more . He should be brave , honest1 // just , and wise ; diplomatist and philanthropist in one . From Penn down to Meeker his has been a post of exile , danger , and discomfort - and his reward is , what ? Contumely and an average salary of less than fifteen hundred dollars a year . Meanwhile , the average salary of our secretaries of legation is npward of twenty-one hundred dollars a year . The Indian agent , who stands between the settler and the savage , and who is a legation in himself , is given rank below the expert in epistolary etiquette , Whose main business it is to observe a proper distinction between Honorable and iRight Honorable , His Grace and His Highness . For the single item of rear-admirals on the retired list , the country pays more than twice as much as for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the administration of our affairs . There are forty-three rear-admirals on the retired list of the navy , receiving salaries of forty-five hundred dollars a year . In return for this handsome pension they do nothing , which is even less than the duties of the rear-admiral in what is politely termed active service . The head of the Indian Bureau , the Commissioner of Indian Affairs , is paid only thirty-five hundred dollars a year , which is the salary of each of the ninety commanders in the navy . It is evident that an honest and capable business man , with the necessary executive power , can not afford to lose himself in an Indian camp and deny himself and family the blessings of civilization for ftfteen hundred dollars a year . He may make the sacrifice from motives of philanthropy and a desire to benefit the Indian ; he may be an ethnologist , who wishes to study the habits of savage tribes ; he may be a lover of nature , tired of the trammels of society ; he m*iy be an artist , a hunter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is of secondary consequence ; but it is not safe for the Government to rely upon these rare classes of men in its care for the national wards . Governments , as well as individuals , can not learn too soon that any persistent and systematic attempt to secure services for less than they are worth , will result in final loss , either to the public purse or the public reputation . No one knows better than our members of Congress that we have a large floating population of unscrupulous place-hunters , who see in every public office a " soft 5nap , ** who consider it an exploit to " beat " the Government , and who are indifferent to the salary attached to an office if the " pickings " are only good . To such men an Indian agency // means sudden wealth ,  --  to be followed perhaps by an outbreak and massacre . To manage its vast landed and mining property the Government has a real estate agent , known as the Commissioner of the Land Office . Under his direction many millions of acres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Railroad grants , ranches , homesteads , mining claims , swamp , timber , and desert lands , all come under his jurisdiction . His salary is four thousand dollars a year , a fair remuneration for a dealer in corner lots or western town sites . Heads of divisions in his office , men grown gray in the service , who have faithfully and judiciously handled the interests of the people to the extent of millions and millions of dollars , and who are so overworked that they scarcely have time to read the daily paper , with its standing joke about the idleness and easy times of the Government clerk , receive eighteen hundred dollars a year . As one of the objects of this writing is the comparative compensation of public servants , it may be observed in this connection that a " messenger , acting assistant door-keeper** of the Senate gets the same pay of eighteen hundred dollars a year ; the acting assistant door-keeper gets two thousand five hundred and ninety-two dollars ; and , to carry the comparison still further , a captain in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per annum , the same as the politician 's friend who opens and shuts the doors of the legislative chambers . " I had rather be a door-keeper in the house of my God , than to dwell in the tents of ungodliness . " Nations , like individuals , have their peculiar traits of character . One does not have to go abroad to learn that the United States owe their principal fame to the industrial enterprise and inventive genius within their borders . Whatever we may be in war , diplomacy , and commerce , we are pre*3minent in those arts of peace which bring comfort to the home and leisure to the weary . The foreign idea of a Yankee is a working-man , who harnesses the forces of nature to do his labor for him ; or an idle man , who whittles a stick and develops a machine ; or a thoughtful man , who trains the lightning to run his errands . Our collection of machinery was the world 's wonder at the Philadelphia Exposition , and the Patent Office at Washington is a permanent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obliged to treat the Patent Office more liberally than the Land Office , else its // officials , after a few years of the valuable experience obtained there , would go over to the enemy and become patent attorneys , and plead the inventor 's case . Even now it is common talk in Washington that the chair at the head of that bureau is principally desirable , not for its salary of four thousand five hundred dollars , but on account of the education in patent law that it affords its occupant , and because it confers the privilege of writing " Ex-Commissioner of Patents " upon his business cards when he resigns , and , so to speak , leaves the garrison to join the beleaguering force . In a city where examinations for entrance into the public service are too often a blind to cover the appointment of the predestined successful competitor ; the standard for success being established low enough to include the favored one , the examinations for admission to the Patent Office corps are believed to be an exception to the rule . As far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair and impartial , and the best man wins ; and since the politician is not usually proficient in mechanics , chemistry , physics , and the kindred branches in which the official must be at home , this bureau is especially free from the canker of political influence . If we search our public service from Maine to California , we do not find an opportunity equally good for the young man of merit and industrious habits , and the special education necessary to secure the appointment . It is , in fact , the only chance afforded the graduates of our numerous technical schools to devote their talents to the country 's service and receive a fair compensation for the same . As the Patent Office is especially a reflex of the genius of our republic , so is its administration arranged upon the republican basis of a fair field and no favor . The pay of the lowest grade of patent examiners , into which the novice enters , is one thousand four hundred dollars a year . From this , by successive promotions , he may at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand four hundred dollars a year , or , if he have great success , one of three examinersin-chief , at three thousand dollars . The commissionership , at four thousand five hundred a year , should hardly be included in his aspirations , as that office is generally given as political reward . While very little is popularly known concerning the pay of public servants , it is generally the thoughtless verdict of the taxpayer that , however small such compensation may be , it is prob von . cxxxv. - No. 309. 13 4 13 / // ably much more than is earned . Let us see . There is one branch of the service with whose pay the people are familiar . This is the army , the salaries of whose officers are , according to common voice , quite insufficient . So well is this fact known that in our romances , with military lovers  --  and their name is legion - one of the most serious obstacles which the novelist has to overcome , in common with cruel guardians , false friends , perfidious rivals , lost wills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hero . " He is awful nice , " drawls the languid society belle , " but then he is so ineligible . " Indeed , we have it from so good an authority as the General of the Army himself , that a second lieutenant should never , on account of his scanty means of subsistence , indulge in the divine right of marriage , a right which is open to the poorest laborer and the smallest farmer . Now , a second lieutenant in the army , at his appointment , receives a salary of one thousand four hundred dollars a year , to be subsequently increased at least every five years ; he also gets his house-rent , liberal mileage for travel , medical attendance and full pay in time of illness , and other incidental benefits ; and in his old age , or in case of permanent inability , he will receive three-quarters pay on the retired list . The third assistant examiner in the Patent Office , filling the very best position open to any young man who , depending on his ability and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it is called outside of Washington , is paid , as heretofore said , one thousand four hundred dollars a year , without perquisites ; and this sum seems like riches to the beginners in the other departments , working as they do , for from four hundred and eighty dollars to nine hundred dollars a year . The difference between the two classes of officials just compared is that all men graduated from West Point become second lieutenants , while the twenty-four third assistant examiners are chosen , a few each year , by competitive examination from the hundreds of other institutions of learning in the land . If it is decreed that the second lieutenant is too poor to marry , what will be the solitary fate of the assistant examiner , and to what a long life of celibacy must the aid in the Coast Survey look forward , as , in his cheerless home in the garret , he burns the midnight oil in adding stores of knowledge to the university education which has already cost him years of study // and thousands of dollars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as the especial patron of*edncation , pays him the sum of from thirty-five to seventy dollars a month ? An objection to the proposed reform in the civil service is that , according to the plan , admission shall be only through the lowest grade , and the pay of this grade will be so small that young men with consciousness of any innate power will be deterred from entering . It is hardly wise for a person with native good sense and a liberal education-and , in spite of what the spoilsmen say , such men are really needed  --  to serve a long apprenticeship as a " copyist , " or an " acting sub-assistant** on Government work , when the wide world , with its rich variety of promises , lies before him , like an oyster , to be opened . In order to take the last census it was necessary to organize a corps of more than thirty thousand faithful and intelligent men . This force , considerably larger than the army of the United States , took the field on the first of June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders , they visited every family in the land , traveling every road and trail within its limits , and numbered and described all of the people , of whatever class or condition , inventoried their wealth down to the smallest detail , and noted the activity , change , and development in our civilization during the last decade . The organizer and commander of this army , the Superintendent of the Census , receives , for working days , nights , and Sundays through the brief two or three years that the Census Bureau is allowed to exist , the sum of five thousand dollars a year . The humblest Congressman , serving his country as a claim agent , pension agent , and office-hunter for his constituents , gets the same reward from an indiscriminating people . A number of the census force were selected from the very first rank of our educated men , being chosen for their familiarity with certain special subjects , upon whose history and statistics they have reported . The maximum pay allowed them was six dollars a day . This is very good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a government pretending to be a patron of learning should offer to its most learned citizens ; a clerk to a Congressional committee which never meets gets six dollars a day . But , little as was the reward of these special agents , it seemed like munificence to the lower grades of the Census officers , many of whom will remember their term of service in that bureau // as business men remember a time of financial panic , or the Egyptians looked back to the years of famine . In the architect 's office of the Treasury Department there is one civil engineer who is paid ten dollars a day . At the various navy yards upon our coasts there are ten of this profession . These are selected by competitive examination , and receive salaries ranging from two thousand four hundred to three thousand five hundred dollars a year and allowances , according to length of service . In the War Department there are between two and three hundred civil engineers , engaged upon internal improvements , geographical surveys , etc . Among them are to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others who have learned their profession in the no less efficient school of long practice . In order to make the position of a few of them more desirable , a resolution was introduced into the Senate , March 19 , 1867 , authorizing the employment , for the improvement of western and north-western rivers , of several civil engineers , not to exceed five in number , at a compensation not to exceed three thousand dollars per annum . The distinction of appointment under this act carries with it a monopoly of the title of " United States Civil Engineer , " a salary which , low as it is , is greatly above the average pay of other civil engineers in government employ , and that feeling of security which comes from a tenure of office which , at least , approaches permanency . The passage of this measure was opposed by Mr. Sherman in the following words : " This resoliltion provides for giving these persons the pay of a colonel of engineers . What is that ? That is a way of fixing compensation that I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguished speaker thought that a colonel of engineers is a man who , one of a thousand , is in command of a regiment of civil engineers . At any rate he was mistaken , for the pay of a colonel in the army ranges from three thousand five hundred dollars to four thousand five hundred dollars a year , with abundant allowances . Even if his words were true , where would be the impropriety of giving a man , at the head of a profession which is generally understood to be lucrative , the salary of a middle grade of the poorly paid army ? That men at the head of the engineering profession have served their country under the provisions of this law , is proved by the name of W. Milnor Roberts , who , certainly from no mercenary motives , acted in this capacity for a time . The members of his profession // do not need to be told who Milnor Roberts was , but some of the general public , who hear less of their scientific meu than of their statesmen , may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most effectively convey the information by saying that , after a long life of honorable work in his own country , where , among other important trusts , he was chief engineer of the IN orthern Pacific Railroad , he was called to the Brazilian service-improvement of rivers and harbors-at a salary of twenty thousand dollars a year . For similar work , our Government , overruling Mr. Sherman 's objection , paid him three thousand dollars a year . There is a wide difference between Congressional economy and political economy . A young officer of the army , engaged upon the improvements of the Hudson River , once made a report , in which the following words are found : " I have tried the plan of taking young graduates from the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute at Troy , and am well satisfied with the results . These yonng men are anxious to gain practical knowledge , and are willing to work hard for their pay , and their work is accurate and thorough . " Thus writes the graduate of West Point , who received a salary while studying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large sum of money . The services of the latter individual are undoubtedly as useful and necessary to the country as those of the former . Then why  --  the people of the United States will naturally inquire-why in the name of Heaven and a republican form of government , should one of these public servants ask , expect , or even permit a fellow-servant , whose " work is accurate and thorough , " to " work hard for low pay , " which probably means enough for his board ? If such a system of labor and reward shall ever be necessary in this country , it should be announced in tones of regret and not of gratification . Far better would it sound to say that the engineer worked hard , accurately , and thoroughly , for good pay , and that the Government had thus canceled a just debt . It may be a shame to our public service that so many of our officials get more than they earn , but a still greater shame is ours when any one earns more than he gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dims the public honor . In happy contrast to the report just quoted from , the writer could mention instances of other engineer officers who , in mak // ing engagements with civil engineers , have upheld the dignity of the Government by asking " What is he worth * " instead of the mercenary question , " What can we get him f*Y is ready to take advantage of another 's misfortune and profit by his loss . The United States Senate is the finest body of men in the world . The House of Representatives is - well , in consequence of the last statement , it must be confessed that it is not the finest body in the worid . From the House to the Senate is an acknowledged promotion and an advancement most eagerly prized . The latter is the cream of the former , a large proportion of its number having served their legislative apprenticeship in the House , before being called up higher as a reward for faithful work . No increase of salary , however , accompanies this promotion , and unless the House is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senate receives too little . It would not be hard to demonstrate that men of their caliber , turning their talents in other directions , could average a salary of twice five thousand dollars a year , but such a demonstration would not be worth the while ; the question of their remuneration is their business , not ours . In some instances Congress is more liberal to its friends than to itself . While five thousand dollars a year is the salary of both senator ani representative , the Secretary of the Senate gets six thousand and ninety-six dollars , and the Clerk of the House is paid five thousand one hundred dollars a year . Even the reporters of Congressional debates get five thousand dollars a year , the same as the debaters themselves . Salaries in Washington appear to be affected by local influences , and it is significant that those officials who have the most intimate relations with Congress-namely , the numerous retainers at the Capitol- are rewarded most liberally , thus exposing our legislators to the soft impeachment of taking good care of their friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal rights and eternal justice . To illustrate , let us take the position of messenger , that being an office common to all departments , and one for which the same order of talents is everywhere needed . In the Senate , which is in session only a portion of the year , th * messenger gets fourteen hundred and forty dollars per annum ; at the White House , the residence of the President , he is less fortunate , receiving twelve hundred dollars a year ; in the executive departments , from seven // hundred and twenty to eight hundred and forty dollars ; and so on down to the Censns Office , the home of hard work , where he is paid from two hundred and forty to eight hundred dollars a year . As it has not yet been discovered that the messenger at the Capitol is any more intelligent , active , civil , or neat than his humble brother of the Coast Survey or the Census Office , the thought naturally arises that an equalization of salaries would not be out of order . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the national capital , Washington is really a city of low salaries , as will be shown by a comparison of the pay of officers in and out of that town . Thus , the Assistant Treasurer of the United States at New York receives eight thousand dollars a year ; the Treasurer of the United States at Washington gets six thousand dollars a year . The Collector of Customs at New York is paid twelve thousand dollars a year ; his superior officer , the Secretary of the Treasury at Washington , receives eight thousand dollars a year . The Postmaster of New York city gets eight thousand dollars a year ; the Postmaster-General at Washington has no more ; and so on . The above instances furnish a fair idea of the general salaries paid for intelligent service and business capacity in New York and Washington , or in private and public life . It may be gratifying to some people to learn that those whom they are pleased to term leeches upon the public purse do not grow so fat in that city of corruption as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government pap is not , after all , the most nourishing of food . When we were boys at school , we were told that the good alone are great , but a reference to the Blue Book has shown us that they do not by any means get the best salaries . We were also informed that industry , integrity , and probity were the keys that opened the door to success ; neither is that statement verified in the volume before us . Another maxim from our juvenile copy-books is , that virtue is its own reward , and that is the only promise of our youth which seems to be fullilled in the Government service . True , perfection in the public service is not to be hoped for in this imperfect world . As long as human nature remains what it is , fathers will continue to overrate the value of their sons and nephews , and we shall have nepotism ; and the grand dames of our republican court will feel a tender regard for their proteg*s , // and there will be favoritism . Other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be chosen over the homely and taciturn , and the official with a distinguished patronymic and fashionable wife will distance the bachelor without pedigree . Even under the inflexible rules which govern , or are supposed to govern , advancement in the army and navy , a man 's promotion does not depend so much upon his own excellence as upon the death or retirement of some distant superior officer ; and thus the main-spring of his ambition is broken . Granted all this , and still our Government service should occupy a plane very far above its present condition ; and it is public sentiment , without which presidential proclamations and Congressional laws are dead letters , that is destined to work the needed reform . Some of these days public sentiment will decide that the man of influence , who quarters a worthless relation or constituent upon the Government , deliberately puts his hand into the national treasury and steals the exact amount of that official 's salary . The spoilsmen claim that one man can perform the duties of a federal office as well as another . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not do his work as well as the other , and to realize that this difference is worthy of notice . Our students in school and college , and our workers on railway and farm , are now graded , promoted , and rewarded according to their industry and ability , and independently of their political beliefs or family ties ; some day , please God and the people , the same system will be introduced into the Government service . Then it will be , indeed , an honor to have one 's name in the Blue Book ; the possessors of the finest talents and the highest ambitions will seek to be enrolled there ; the capable applicant for office , unsupported except by his testimonials of merit , will not receive less consideration than the incapable office-seeker , with a State delegation at his heels ; the useless will not then take rank over the useful ; the etiquette of the State Department will not be considered of greater importance than the sciences and industries of the Interior ; in times of peace the arts of peace will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disabled civil servant wil get at least a tithe of the pension now given to the hale and hearty retired rearadmiral ; and then we shall be in fact , as well as in name , a republlc .
