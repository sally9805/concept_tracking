txt The object of Mr. Hoax 's amendment to the Blair bill for education was , as we said when the bill passed the Senate , very praiseworthy ; but it seems that the amendment was not skillfully adjusted to its end . The amendment provides that no money shall be paid under the act to any State which shall not have provided alsystem of free schools for all its children " without distinction of race or color . " What the mover of the amendment no doubt meant was to insure that the negroes should get their numerical share of the fund , and that the blacks should ' have equal privileges under it with the whites . This is perfectly just , but equal privileges are one thing and identical privileges another . Now , it appears that there is in the school laws of Maryland a " distinction of race or color " in raising the school fund , which would bar that State from the . enjoyment of any part of the grant , although the distinction is in favor of , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same object as that of the amendment , the school laws providing that a fixed proportion of the general fund shall go to colored schools , and in addition that all taxes paid by colored persons shall be devoted to the colored schools . This is much wiser than the Hoar amendment , since it is not to be supposed that Mr. HoAR 's object was to compel what they call in the South " social equality " by legislative ' bounties for the enforcement of the same . There are many communities in the South in which white parents will keep their children away from school altogether rather than send them to mixed schools . It can not be said that the white children will be " served right " in being excluded from education on this ground , because the visitation ' of the sins of the fathers upon their children is exactly the calamity which it is the object of the whole lain to avert . The amendment should be so amended , in the passage of the bill through the House , as to secure its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to defeat .
