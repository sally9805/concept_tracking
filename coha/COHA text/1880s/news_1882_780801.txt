txt A prize-fight took place this morning about 10 miles south of this fatty . The principals were Owen McManus , of Syracuse , N.Y .. and John Files , of New-York City . The former was almost wholly unknown , and the latter was known only as a clover light sparrer in " benefit " exhibitions . A match of $900 a side , with hard gloves , according to the new rules of the English prize ring , had been made by the sporting men who stood around the ring . " Ed " Domey and " Jack " Norton served as seoonds for Files , and " Dick " English and " Abe " Williams for McManus . The men appeared very unequal when in fighting garb . McManus was lean and gaunt , but around his shoulders were knots of whip-end muscles that accounted for his weight of 155 pounds . On the other hand , Files looked slim and soft and weighed only 140 pounds . In height the men were even at 5 feet 9 inches , although McManus had the advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantages , however , did not prevent the assembled " sports " from offering such odds as $100 to $40 on Files without finding takers . For the first round McManus placed himself on the defensive , and Flies danced around him , feinting occasionally for two minutes before a blow was struck . Files at last led with his left and got in a light blow on MeManus'e neck , which was neatly and rather more powerfully countered on Files 's face , Light blows were exchanged , when MeManus. taking one on the cheek , returned it with a stinging loft-bander on Files 's cheek and a terrific right-hander square in the mouth that sent the receiver to the grass . Files looked up in astonishment , and did not recover from his bewilderment . Time-3 minutes , In the second round McManus came up looking vicious . but still " feeling him , " according to the Instructions of his seconds . Ile might have gone in and finished the bout then and there , for Files was already very uncertain on his legs and looked as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a much more respectful distance , but got an opening and sent in a right-hander on MeManus 's ribs , which sounded like a. note from a bass drum , " Give it to him that way , " " That 's a beauty , " went up in chorus from the aides of the rind , and seemed to wake McManus up . Ile rushed in , unmindful of a rain of left-handers from his antagonist , and finally got in left and right on the jaw , again sending Files to grass , a clearer knock-down than the first . Time ? 1 minute . In the third round Files came up very tired , but game , and rushed at his man in the hope of closing . McManus had been elven permission to " go In and finish him , " and met him half-way with a visitation of the left and right on the jaw and neck that unsettled Files 's plans altogether . lie rallied , however , struck a powerless blow at MoManus 's body , and got away from the return by dodging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hand , in which position McManus delivered two vicious upper cuts . Files regained his feet , and made another rush to close , but was again clean knocked down . His seconds were rushing to pick him up , when some one cried " Foi.fi , " and Dorney took it up and claimed the fight . Two referees had been appointed after the fashion of the Sullivan-Ryan mill , and a wrangle ensued in which pistols were drawn and the ring was broken down . One referee insisted that it was a foul , and ordered the stakeholder to give the stakes over to Flies . The other as strenuously insisted that there was no foul , and McManus was entitled to the money by toeing the scratch according to order . There the matter was left . Both the men were bundled off to their carriages , and the fight was transferred to the bar-rooms . There is no manner of doubt that McManus is the better man and could have won in two or three rounds . lie was absolutely without a scratch , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not show any bruises , but all his craving for nghting had been satisfied by the three knock-downs . Such as it was , the fight lasted seven minutes . It is understood that George Brown , the stakeholder. has declared McManus the winner and awarded the stakes to him .
