THE popular superstition concerning Wall street is that the great stock speculators control speculation . They are supposed to make and unmake prices at their pleasure . When they determine the market shall rise , it rises . When they determine it shall go down , it goes down ; and in the hands of these financial giants the outside public is helpless . Possibly ninety-nine men out of a hundred who think of the matter at all cherish this theory of the movements of speculation . To be true , it would require that the half-dozen men recognized as great operators should hold in their hands all the elements that go to make up speculation . They should be able to give or withhold from us bountiful harvests ; to blast the grain-fields of Europe when we have a large surplus to sell ; to give us mild or severe winters , floods or drought ; to call up the devouring swarms of grasshoppers in the West , as Moses called the plague of locusts upon Egypt ; to increase or diminish the stream of immigration pouring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or wither as they may will it . These are the elements that enter into speculation . It is these which make and unmake prices . None know this better than the great operators . They know how narrow are the limits of their power over the great movements of the speculative tides recorded in the figures on the stock tape ; and the millions they have rolled up have been acquired by the success with which they have timed their schemes to their ebb and flow . It is an axiom of speculation that you can not bull stocks and corn at the same time . What enhances the price of corn diminishes the value of stocks . Good crops make high prices ; poor crops make low ones . While wheat and corn are rising in price , the prices of stocks tend downward . In the grasshopper years , when wheat was two dollars per bushel , stocks of cer // tam railroads , now quoted at one hundred and twelve and one hundred and thirty dollars , were selling at twelve and forty-five dollars . From this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such transcendent importance in Wall street . It begins to be discussed with the plowing of the ground . The information then sought is the acreage returns , and how they compare with those of the year before . Large immigration last year means an increase in the acreage this year by the occupancy of previously waste ground . The weather report is anxiously scanned as the plant grows . A special weather report from the Signal Office is daily distributed in Wall street . First comes the great crop of winter wheat , harvested from the middle of June into the Ilrst part of July ; then the spring-sown wheat , coming in August and September , and yet later , the harvesting of the corn crop ; while , in the South-west , the cotton crop is picked from summer till fall , the picking moving northward with the season . The progress of the crops in Europe has been meantime watched with scarcely less interest , for there we must market our surplus . Short crops abroad and bountiful ones at home give the farmers a ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying them , the stockholders fat dividends ; and fat dividends make high prices in the Stock Exchange . " It is no time to buy stocks when iron is failing , ** is the saying of one of the greatest stock operators this country ever saw ; and there is another one to the same effect : " You may safely buy stocks when the price of iron is rising . " The iron market is the sure barometer of the industrial situation . It embraces the whole field of industry in this age . The degree of activity in real estate and the building trade may be approximated by the fluctuations in the price of nails . While the basis of our wealth is what grows out of the ground , the present state of trade is indicated by the demand for iron . If it be falling off , adverse causes are at work which will surely make themselves felt on the stock market . If the demand be growing , industry is receiving a new impetus , enterprise is awake , new railroads are planning , old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are making money , and stocks will rise with the widened demand for investment securities . To keep thoroughly informed of the agricultural and industrial condition of the country , the few great operators who do most to give direction to the currents of speculation maintain an army of correspondents . They are // keen and close students always . Nowhere is timely information of more value than in Wall street . Nowhere else may so high a price be obtained for it . Time is an all-important element in scientific stock speculation ; therefore the great operator has to be always on the watch . He may see clearly that in , say , three or fomr months there will be a turn in the tide then flowing ; but , in the meantime , the adverse current may carry his schemes to wreck . Time is everything ; for there is no knowing what the day may bring forth . The operator who is working the market to sell stocks , which requires a rising one for success , has to remember that the chapter of accidents is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tides of speculation ebb and flow according to the industrial conditions of the country , great schemes of stock speculation are always adjusted to them as nearly as the operator who is carrying them through can do it . This applies equally to the man who is a stock operator pure and simple , and to the other who is not only a stock operator but a creator of stocks also  --  a security manufacturer , as he might be called . He is not different from the merchant or manufacturer , who gets goods at the lowest price possible and sells them at the best he can obtain . Both the stock operator and the merchant may miscalculate the public demand or the public liking , or they may get belated , and find that they have laid up a stock of goods which can not be sold profitably . As the stock operator sells for a fall as well as buys for a rise , he is exposed to error there . Looking over the general situation , he may judge that the market must decline . He goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has miscalculated the strength of the forces at work upon it , and prices rise in spite of his most strenuous efforts to depress them . He must then reconsider the situation , and determine what he shall do in view of his own resources and the strength of the forces against him . Great operators vividly realize the unpleasantness of being either " long " or " short " of the market when the public temper is against them . None ever gets where he has to struggle against the current uuless by accident or miscalculation . With vast and comprehensive schemes to carry through , extending over long periods in their operation , and involving miliions of money , there is nothing to do but to struggle against the adverse tide as best he may . Whatever his schemes may be , he knows that the // most he can do is but to retard or accelerate the general movement . To the constant efforts of operators to do this , as their various interests dictate , is mainly due those minor fluctuations of prices in the Stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ocean currents , and make or mar the fortunes of the swarms of small-fry speculators . Of the mass of persons - not professionals - who speculate in Wall street , about ninety per cent . buy stocks for a rise , and only the other ten per cent . both buy and sell-in technical language , go long and short . The public at large knows nothing of selling for a fall . It is , therefore , always on the bull side of the market when in the market at all ; and , as a consequence , this is the popular side . The prophet who proclaims his belief that prices are too high and must fall finds he is prophesying unwelcome things . When prices are falling , the public begins to desert Wall street , which has no more interest for people who only speculate the other way . They buy when prices are rising , and buy most freely at the top-when the great operators , who have bought their stocks months before at low prices , sell out . By accumulating large lines of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the auction-room in making quotations , prices are carried up ; but if the public refuse to come in and assist by their purchases the movement is a failure , which means more or less heavy losses to the men engaged in it . They discover that they have been lifting prices by buying stocks which no one will take off their hands . Wall street was lately treated to a most conspicuous example of this . The greatest wealth and most acute talent of the country were enlisted in an effort to raise prices . They were raised by sheer force of money , the brokers of the chief operators offering to buy and buying all that was offered of certain leading stocks , each day at a higher price than on the day preceding . But it was a frightfully costly experiment to the men who did it . They had miscalculated the temper of the public . People would not buy , however much prices were advanced . The load became too heavy for the shoulders even of the financial giants . They suddenly stopped buying , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their purchases fell with a ruinous crash . The temper of the public had been growing colder and more distrustful since July , and that now famous " pegging** movement was ineffectual to change it . This was a case where some of the greatest stock // operators of the age were completely mistaken in their reading of the speculative situation and the state of the public mind . The course of prices on the Stock Exchange was downward from the fall of 1873 to 1877 , owing to the great panic and a succession of poor crops . From 1878 to July of last year they moved upward , under the influence of three years of bountiful harvests here and poor ones abroad , each crop being larger than the preceding one and giving a correspondingly increasing force to the influences making for speculation . In the end came a wild inflation of prices . Good securities were carried up to figures far above their real value ; worthless stocks found buyers by the score ; floods of new securities came upon the market and were eagerly snapped up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stock Exchange rose to thirty-two thousand dollars bid ; and Wall street seemed intoxicated with prosperity . Nothing was listened to but the phenomenal growth of the country . To assert that prices were extravagantly high was stigmatized as want of patriotism . " Have you no confidence in your country I , ' was the customary reply . " The people are mad * exclaimed one great operator , amazed at the extravagant prices at which buyers were eagerly contesting with each other for stocks . In the midst of this wild rage for sudden wealth , the nation was shocked to its center by the assassination of the President . Sad as was the event , it injured no material interest of the country ; but it effected a complete change in the temper of the people . A vague feeling of distrust and insecurity began to spread . Wall street , as usual , was the first to feel the change . Whether it be from confidence to distrust , or from depression to hope , a change in the public temper is felt earliest there , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which no one would believe or listen to before were now heard in silent acquiescence . People saw , as if it were a revelation , that the length and severity of the previous winter had inflicted enormous damage on the railroads ; that the spring floods which accompanied the melting of the vast areas of snow had been even more destructive ; that a drought was then scorching up great sections of country which had previously escaped damage . In addition , the great trunk lines of railroad were engaged in a ruinous war of freight rates . Speculation began to lose strength . The first blow fell upon the bond market . While stocks still continued active , new issues of bonds could find no // purchasers . The crop of new railroad schemes growing up like mushrooms had a sudden cheek , for no one would subscribe for the bonds to build them . Railroad companies which were doing a thriving business on extensions discovered that the bonds to pay for them remained unsold in the hands of their bankers ; and the managers of some new enterprises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the market , have not dared to put them there yet . The bond m*ket , in fact , completely " played out , " which brought in its train the downfall of numerous flourishing rail . road concerns , which had been paying dividends and making a fictitious show of prosperity on the sales of continuous issues of these securities . From that time to this prices of stocks have been on the downward course , and the speculative and investing public have so completely withdrawn from the market that , for months past , the large commission houses , which depend upon this class of custom , have scarcely paid running expenses . Nevertheless , the decline has been stubbornly resisted , and because of this resistance , and the many efforts made to arrest it , the shrinkage of prices has been spread over a much longer time than would otherwise have been the case . The assassination of President Garfield came at a time when the greatest stock operator of this or , perhaps , any other day , was loaded up with an enormous line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a market as Guitean 's bullet shattered would have enabled him to sell out his holdings . The street and the public would have had every share he chose to sell . From various causes he had been unable to market his holdings at the time he had calculated upon doing so , and the assassination changed the whole complexion of things . lie was left to struggle with the adverse currents of a falliug market , and the history of Wall-street speculation since that event *has been , speaking broadly , the history of the efforts of a great operator of vast means , indefatigable energy , infinite resource , and unequaled talent in his line to profitably market a great load of stock , which the public has shown increasing disin cination to take off his hands . Twice in this period he has been driven close to the wali . On one occasion he was saved only because the men who were pressing him became frightened at the near prospect of his downfall , which they saw must precipitate a panic in which all would suffer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man of his genius to extricate // himself . For a time he seemed to have turned the tables on his opponents , and some of them he did punish badly ; but it was hopeless . Neither immense wealth nor the highest talent could create a buli market when the public , demoralized and disheartened by losses , refused to support it ; and another and worse tumble of prices followed the well-known " pegging " campaign . If a rational consideration of the tides of speculation shows how much they are due to the public at large , and how much less to the efforts of the half-dozen men recognized as the great operators , the assertion will scarcely be challenged that the indiscriminate denunciation of the ups and downs of prices as being the effect of " Wall-street tricks * both unreasonable and untrue . When times are prosperous people flock to the stock market , bent on buying everything offered ; they do buy ; they buy with their eyes persistently shut to every evidence of the badness of the bargain they are making ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what they had refused to see before . Then begins the general selling under which the market steadily declines ; and when the fall has been long and severe , which it is sure to be if the previous inflation of prices has been correspondingly excessive , then comes the moralizing and preaching about " Wall-street tricks * and the wicked ways of the speculators . This being said , it remains to point out certain trickery practice in the buying and selling of securities of which the public has a just right to complain . Its correct title is corporate fraud . Beside this , the little tricks peculiar to the Stock Exchange , which generally take the form of catching those who have " sold short , " are not worth serious consideration , for they affect only a limited number , and mainly the regular professionals . But the frauds of directors of corporations are aimed at the investing public , and bring heavy loss and injury to hundreds and thousands . Their effects are most manifest on the Stock Exchange - simply because that is the common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flagrant breaches of trust are indiscriminately denounced as " Wall-street tricks . " They are frauds plauned and executed in the companies ' offices , and would be done if Wall street did not exist and securities were marketed the same as potatoes . These frauds are simply the giving of fictitious values to securities by misrepresentation of facts and suppression of truth , and the destruction of good // properties for the profit of those who have obtained control of them . Stock-watering has an evil sound in the public ear , and justly so by reason of its as*ociations . But stock-watering per se is not a fraud . It is nothing more , when legitimately done , than realizing the enhanced value of a property . It is just as proper a proceeding as that of a merchant who marks up the price of the stock of goods he has on hand . Nevertheless , it has an evil odor clinging to it , for the operation presents such temptations to fraud on the part of those in control of the property , that it is rare for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes it is a series of frauds from first to last , enriching the few men who planned and executed it , inflicting severe losses on hundreds of innocent investors , while the property itself is irretrievably injured . All this will be called a Wall-street trick , or stock-jobbery ; but in fact it is simply corporate dishonesty . Let us take one glaring example . Suppose that there exists a large corporation , having a heavy capital , and performing highly important functions in relation to the public . Its board of directors is composed of the leading men of the financial world , and a large proportion of the stock of the corporation is held as a permanent investment . Another company is started as a rival to the former . It can pay no dividends , and is not likely to , for its promoters repaid themselves double their original outlay through the medium of a construction company , and they propose to make more by selling out . But this concern can and does injure the dividend-paying company , though not much . In course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretly , and arrange what , in a term borrowed from the gambling-table , is called a " deal . " The dividend-paying company is to absorb the other , and to double its own stock . An elaborate programme is laid out , extending over many months . As the first step in it , holders of the dividend-paying stock must be induced to sell out- " shaken out ' the street calls it . The corporate dishonesty begins at this point . The board of directors meet , and in their official capacity they issue a quarterly statement of the company*s affairs , which is a carefully concocted falsehood from beginning to end . In it they represent that business has fallen off to the most serious extent ; that the revenues have so greatly shrunk that it would be highly impolitic to declare the usual quarterly dividend ; that a reduced dividend // must be declared , which , it is true , will require most of the surplus in the company 's treasury to pay , but by careful economy they hope it may be fully earned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been prepared for by the industrious propagation of rumors that the affairs of the company are in a truly deplorable condition . The board votes the reduced dividend ; the men who are in the secret have previously sold their stock , and they set to work to break down the market by short sales . The price begins to sink rapidly ; innocent investors are frightened at what they see and hear ; they make haste to sell , and the price goes on sinking with every lot offered . At last it reaches a level where the conspirators decide it is time to buy . They have covered their short contracts , and make their profit that way ; and under their buying the price rises as rapidly as it went down , which catches the swarm of Wall-street stock operators who had been selling the stock short , and were not in the secret . When the men who are conducting the deal get all the stock they want , official announcement is made that the rival companies have agreed to combine , and the stock of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the conspirators desire to sell their enormous holdings of the watered stock . They therefore meet again in their official capacity as directors , and issue another official quarterly statement , in which everything said in the last is unsaid . The revenues are declared to have increased in a most unexpected way , great economies have been effected , and the profits of the quarter are large enough to allow a dividend to be declared at the full rate on the whole doubled capital stock , while the outlook for the future is such as to give assurance that it will be continued and possibly increased . This official statement is just as much a falsehood as the last was . Here was one of the most scandalous examples of stock-jobbing which ever disgraced the financial history of the country ; but stock-jobbing in this case was only another name for corporate rascality . It was fraud against which the investor had no possible chance to protect himself , for it was by the official action of the legal custodians of his property that he was frightened into throwing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been the victim of a plot which these directors had concocted against him for theirown enrichment . The only feature of the operation which could properly be called a Wall-street trick was the incidental catching of the " shorts " in the stock , when the rapid rise in its // price took place under the buying of the schemers . The short sellers were badly bitten , but , being all professionals , they took the well-known risks of selling that way when they did it . Stock-watering , however , is not the form of corporate fraud which in these days most threatens the investor . Indeed , taken altogether , more investors have been enriched by stock-watering than have been injured by the fraudulent practices which have so often accompanied the operation . The case cited above was quite exceptional in its rascality . The greatest danger to the investor of to-day comes from bonds and leases . Where corporate dishonesty takes the form of bond issues and fraudulent leases , the investor is fleeced without mercy . There is nothing but loss for him The profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the property is injured to the extent of the profit they make . There are stocks on the Exchange which are freely bought now at prices not a great deal below what they were selling for a year ago in the flush times ; there are others for which it is difficult to find purchasers at one-half or one-third the prices they were selling at then . Corporate fraud is solely responsible for these ruinous drops . A fictitious value was given to the securities by the payment of unearned dividends . The money was obtained from the sale of bonds . This continued until the bond market went to pieces , the public refusing to buy more . Thereupon the treasuries of these corporations were soon emptied , one after the other stopped paying dividends , the discovery was made that their bonded and floating debts had been enormously increased , and by the time the facts were all out their stocks had sunk like lead . In one of these cases the price fell a clean twelve per cent . in one day ; and this came after it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch bottom then . The general public , seeing only the sudden and violent collapse , and ignorant of its cause , denounces it as a stock-jobbing trick . The trick consists in the knowledge that certain men obtain of the rotten condition of the corporation . They turn it to account by selling the stock short , and exposing this rottenness . Holders rush in to sell their investments , and the price sinks until it reaches a level corresponding to the real value of the property . In the special instance referred to , it came out , when the facts could no longer be concealed , that the managers had been personally buying up worthless roads , more or less remotely connected with the main // line , and selling them to the company of which they were the directors at high prices . Payment had been made in new issues of bonds , and when these could no longer be sold , money was borrowed upon them to pay dividends and keep up a delusive appearance of prosperity . This went on until a debt had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside sold out their stock , and one of them organized the movement which broke down its price in the market , and exposed the real condition of the corporation . Here , as in the other case , stock-jobbing was another name for corporate fraud . In another case , the same system of rascality was pursued . Quarterly dividends were paid for a year , not one of which was earned ; nor , indeed , was the road earning the interest on its bonds . The managers of the property declared that it never was so prosperous ; they published what purported to be correct returns of the earnings of the road compared with the previous year , showing an immense increase ; and meantime they were selling their stock here and in Europe at high prices , talking grandly about " sustaining American credit , " and violently denouncing the few who had sufficient penetration to see the deception practiced , and to declare it . At the end of the year the stock had fallen about one-half from its highest price , the fall being accompanied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price of the other stock mentioned . The managers had sold their holdings long before , and they knew too well what the real value of the stock was to attempt to protect it against the attacks of other operators who knew as much as they . Indeed , they made their profit by going short themselves . These two cases are fair types of the most common forms of fraud now practiced . They are in great favor , because difficult of detection until it is too late for the average investor to protect himself . So long as the buying mood is on the public , a perpetual stream of new bonds can be poured out , and find a ready sale . It is one of the great modern discoveries in the world of speculation that " the public likes bonds . " We owe this discovery to the genius of the leading stock operator of this century . He made it early in his career . The public likes bonds , and will buy anything called by that name when stock can find no purchasers . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to corporate fraud for ten or twelve years past . Stockwatering pure and simple is less in favor than it used to be , // and perhaps in the instance before mentioned it would not have been employed had not the peculiar circumstances of the case made an issue of bonds inexpedient . There is always a great outcry raised about stock-watering ; some States have enacted statutes against it , and it is much easier , and much more politic , to issue bonds . Bonds , therefore , are in this day the favorite vehicle of corporate fraud . As long as a company can find a ready sale for its issues it can go along swimmingly , paying dividends it does not earn , and showing a surplus in its treasury . Companies make large profits by building extensions and purchasing branch roads . It may cost only fifteen thousand dollars per mile to build the road , or to purchase it ; but bonds are issued at the rate of twenty thousand or twentyfive thousand dollars per mile , and perhaps sell at a premium . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pockets of individuals . Hence , also , the large profits made by construction companies . They build the road and issue stock and bonds for double its cost . If the times are favorable , the issue will be greater ; and , in one instance , a construction company which built and acquired a road costing in the aggregate only seventeen millions , issued securities of mortgage bonds , income bonds , and stock aggregating , in nominal value , eightytwo millions . By the sale of these they more than doubled every dollar of their original expenditure . This , it must be confessed , was a prize of unusual magnitude , and was made possible by the managers being lucky enough to bring their stuff on the market when the public rage for buying was at its height last year . A new company starting , the managers of which desire to deal generously with the public , or feel uncertain about getting money , will issue bonds to cover the cost of constructing the road , and give the issue of stock as a bonus to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk their money in a new enterprise have a right to the profits of the future , if there be any . But one of the most extraordinary things ever done in Wall street was the cali made by one large corporation for subscriptions to a new issue of ten millions of stock , the proceeds to be used for building an important line of road to run in connection with the main line , and to make other improvements . Six months or so after it had obtained the money , the company issued a prospectus for the organization of a separate company , with more millions of capital , to build this very line . // The original ten millions had gone , it is to be presumed , in the other improvements . This was another scheme whose success was possible only in the rushing and thoughtless times of last year ; and , indeed , the company , coming into the market rather late with its new scheme , experienced such difficulty in getting subscribers that it had to pledge its own credit to the new enterprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking sharply after the bonded indebtedness of a company , the investor who desires to know what he is buying should examine what lease and rental obligations a company is under . Leases , as a means of corporate fraud , grow out of the same willingness of the public to buy bonds . The directors of a corporation will buy up , at a nominal price , the stock of a connecting road which , perhaps , barely earns its fixed charges . They then lease it to their own road , upon terms which will carry the stock they have purchased up to par or over . Sometimes this is done by guaranteeing dividends upon the stock ; sometimes the stock of the leased road is converted into stock of the parent road ; sometimes it is converted into its bonds . In either case , the parent road is burdened with an additional charge , and the directors pocket the profits . But there is a further use for leases . Suppose that the lease is made on terms guaranteeing dividends , or merely guaranteeing interest on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a convenient cover in the future for raising money by new stock or bond issues under the name of another company . It might appear that this trick would be too shallow to deceive anybody . But it is not ; and the fact that it is constantly practiced shows that it serves its purpose . There are certain companies whose reports , when they make them , show a bonded debt of the lightest proportions , and this showing is often greatly lauded as proving their stability . The explanation is that they own half a dozen roads by perpetual leases , and the debt is piled up in their names . Examining the figures , therefore , we find that , while the debt of the parent road appears at some comparatively trifling figure , the item of interest and rentals charge is enormous . Leases , in truth , are a highly dangerous temptation to fraud on the part of directors . In States where the laws are stringent on the subject , they present opportunities for private profit at the expense of the trusteed property too frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , the monstrous doctrine has been // affirmed by the courts , at least by implication , that the directors of a corporation have the right to make and unmake permanent leases of the property they temporarily control , without the consent , or against the protest , of the owners of the property , z. e. , the stockholders . This is offering a premium on fraud ; and to say that the courts will declare invalid a lease where fraud can be proved , is giving a stone when bread is asked . Evidence of fraud , as the law requires it in such cases as this , is extraordinarily difficult to obtain ; and if the scheme has been decently well planned and executed , it is well-ugh impossible . In the latest case where this unlimited right of directors was affirmed by the courts , a great public scandal was involved , in which judges , State officers , and directors were implicated ; but it was impossible for the contesting stockholders to get hold of legal evidence of fraud . The fault was primarily with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the property of which they are temporary trustees . They should be compelled to go to the stockholders for special authorization to do many things which they can now do of their own motion . Law , however , is a poor remedy for corporate abuses . It may correct some , but there are many more just as bad which it can not , and which only a healthier public opinion can . So long as flagrant abuses of public trusts are dismissed with a halfjocular , half-contemptuous remark about stock gambling , and the men guilty of them are not a wit the worse socially for their misdeeds , they will continue to make money , or try to , by what is nothing but robbery of the investing public . To extract a few thousands from the pockets of other stock operators only a little less sharp than themselves , by some maneuver which is truly a Wall-street trick ,  --  that is , a trick made possible by the rules governing dealings in the Stock Exchange ,  --  is a trifle not worthy of consideration . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . * for example , which are the extreme form of these tricks , have nearly always proved disastrous in their result to the men who have successfully carried them through . The great " North-west corner " entailed heavy losses on its contriver ; the " corner** executed last year left the whole common stock of the company , nine milions in amount , a dead burden on the hands of the men who planned it . They can not market it , unless some neighboring railroad company takes it off their hands in bulk to secure control of the road . The millions // are made by taking them from the pockets of the general public . It is the public on one side and the great operator on the other . The public is an ass . That is , it is an ass sometimes . When it is in the humor to be fooled , the men are there to fool it to the top of its bent . It wants to buy , and it will swallow anything they offer , and believe any story about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preposterous . Woe to the man who rises then to warn the people of their madness ! They will tear up the stones in the street to cast at him . The only consolation he has is the reflection that in a little while they will be cursing the men who deluded them into buying securities at twice their value , or securities rotten and valueless altogether .
