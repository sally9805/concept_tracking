ENGLAND *** Produced by David Widger ENGLAND By Charles Dudley Warner England has played a part in modern history altogether out of proportion to its size . The whole of Great Britain , including Ireland , has only eleven thousand more square miles than Italy ; and England and Wales alone are not half so large as Italy . England alone is about the size of North Carolina . It is , as Franklin , in 1763 , wrote to Mary Stevenson in London , " that petty island which , compared to America , is but a stepping-stone in a brook , scarce enough of it above water to keep one 's shoes dry . " A considerable portion of it is under water , or water-soaked a good part of the year , and I suppose it has more acres for breeding frogs than any other northern land , except Holland . Old Harrison says that the North Britons when overcome by hunger used to creep into the marshes till the water was up to their chins and there remain a long time , " onlie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which otherwise would have wrought and beene readie to oppresse them for hunger and want of sustinance . " It lies so far north  --  the latitude of Labrador  --  that the winters are long and the climate inhospitable . It would be severely cold if the Gulf Stream did not make it always damp and curtain it with clouds . In some parts the soil is heavy with water , in others it is only a thin stratum above the chalk ; in fact , agricultural production could scarcely be said to exist there until fortunes made in India and in other foreign adventure enabled the owners of the land to pile it knee-deep with fertilizers from Peru and elsewhere . Thanks to accumulated wealth and the Gulf Stream , its turf is green and soft ; figs , which will not mature with us north of the capes of Virginia , ripen in sheltered nooks in Oxford , and the large and unfrequent strawberry sometimes appears upon the dinner-table in such profusion that the guests can indulge in one apiece . Yet this small , originally infertile island has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most vital influence on the globe . Cast your eye over the world upon her possessions , insular and continental , into any one of which , almost , England might be dropped , with slight disturbance , as you would transfer a hanging garden . For any parallel to her power and possessions you must go back to ancient Rome . Egypt under Thotmes and Seti overran the then known world and took tribute of it ; but it was a temporary wave of conquest and not an assimilation . Rome sent her laws and her roads to the end of the earth , and made an empire of it ; but it was an empire of barbarians largely , of dynasties rather than of peoples . The dynasties fought , the dynasties submitted , and the dynasties paid the tribute . The modern " people " did not exist . One battle decided the fate of half the world  --  it might be lost or won for a woman 's eyes ; the flight of a chieftain might settle the fate of a province ; a campaign might determine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compact , disciplined , law-ordered nation , and that had its seat on the Tiber . Under what different circumstances did England win her position ! Before she came to the front , Venice controlled , and almost monopolized , the trade of the Orient . When she entered upon her career Spain was almost omnipotent in Europe , and was in possession of more than half the Western world ; and besides Spain , England had , wherever she went , to contend for a foothold with Portugal , skilled in trade and adventure ; and with Holland , rich , and powerful on the sea . That is to say , she met everywhere civilizations old and technically her superior . Of the ruling powers , she was the least in arts and arms . If you will take time to fill out this picture , you will have some conception of the marvelous achievements of England , say since the abdication of the Emperor Charles V. This little island is today the centre of the wealth , of the solid civilization , of the world . I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighter social graces that make life agreeable ; but I will say of the moral forces that make progress possible and worth while . Of this island the centre is London ; of London the heart is " the City , " and in the City you can put your finger on one spot where the pulse of the world is distinctly felt to beat . The Moslem regards the Kaaba at Mecca as the centre of the universe ; but that is only a theological phrase . The centre of the world is the Bank of England in Leadenhall Street . There is not an occurrence , not a conquest or a defeat , a revolution , a panic , a famine , an abundance , not a change in value of money or material , no depression or stoppage in trade , no recovery , no political , and scarcely any great religious movement  --  say the civil deposition of the Pope or the Wahhabee revival in Arabia and India  --  that does not report itself instantly at this sensitive spot . Other capitals feel a local influence ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the door of the Bank or the Stock Exchange near by , and you hear the roar of the world . But this is not all , nor the most striking thing , nor the greatest contrast to the empires of Rome and of Spain . The civilization that has gone forth from England is a self-sustaining one , vital to grow where it is planted , in vast communities , in an order that does not depend , as that of the Roman world did , upon edicts and legions from the capital . And it must be remembered that if the land empire of England is not so vast as that of Rome , England has for two centuries been mistress of the seas , with all the consequences of that opportunity  --  consequences to trade beyond computation . And we must add to all this that an intellectual and moral power has been put forth from England clear round the globe , and felt beyond the limits of the English tongue . How is it that England has attained this supremacy  --  a supremacy in vain disputed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threatened by an equipped and disciplined Germany , by an unformed Colossus  --  a Slav and Tartar conglomerate ; and perhaps by one of her own children , the United States ? I will mention some of the things that have determined England 's extraordinary career ; and they will help us to consider her prospects . I name : I. The Race . It is a mixed race , but with certain dominant qualities , which we call , loosely , Teutonic ; certainly the most aggressive , tough , and vigorous people the world has seen . It does not shrink from any climate , from any exposure , from any geographic condition ; yet its choice of migration and of residence has mainly been on the grass belt of the globe , where soil and moisture produce good turf , where a changing and unequal climate , with extremes of heat and cold , calls out the physical resources , stimulates invention , and requires an aggressive and defensive attitude of mind and body . The early history of this people is marked by two things : ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , order , and self-dependence , nuclei of power , capable of indefinite expansion , leading directly to a free and a strong government , the breeders of civil liberty . ( 2 ) Individualism in religion , Protestantism in the widest sense : I mean by this , cultivation of the individual conscience as against authority . This trait was as marked in this sturdy people in Catholic England as it is in Protestant England . It is in the blood . England never did submit to Rome , not even as France did , though the Gallic Church held out well . Take the struggle of Henry II . and the hierarchy . Read the fight with prerogative all along . The English Church never could submit . It is a shallow reading of history to attribute the final break with Rome to the unbridled passion of Henry VIII. ; that was an occasion only : if it had not been that , it would have been something else . Here we have the two necessary traits in the character of a great people : the love and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allied to these is another trait  --  truthfulness . To speak the truth in word and action , to the verge of bluntness and offense  --  and with more relish sometimes because it is individually obnoxious and unlovely  --  is an English trait , clearly to be traced in the character of this people , notwithstanding the equivocations of Elizabethan diplomacy , the proverbial lying of English shopkeepers , and the fraudulent adulteration of English manufactures . Not to lie is perhaps as much a matter of insular pride as of morals ; to lie is unbecoming an Englishman . When Captain Burnaby was on his way to Khiva he would tolerate no Oriental exaggeration of his army rank , although a higher title would have smoothed his way and added to his consideration . An English official who was a captive at Bokhara ( or Khiva ) was offered his life by the Khan if he would abjure the Christian faith and say he was a Moslem ; but he preferred death rather than the advantage of a temporary equivocation . I do not suppose that he was a specially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to religious principle , but for the moment Christianity stood for England and English honor and civilization . I can believe that a rough English sailor , who had not used a sacred name , except in vain , since he said his prayer at his mother 's knee , accepted death under like circumstances rather than say he was not a Christian . The next determining cause in England 's career is : II . The insular position . Poor as the island was , this was the opportunity . See what came of it : ( 1 ) Maritime opportunity . The irregular coastlines , the bays and harbors , the near islands and mainlands invited to the sea . The nation became , per force , sailors  --  as the ancient Greeks were and the modern Greeks are : adventurers , discoverers  --  hardy , ambitious , seeking food from the sea and wealth from every side . ( 2 ) Their position protected them . What they got they could keep ; wealth could accumulate . Invasion was difficult and practically impossible to their neighbors . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the continent , commanding the most important of the navigable seas . The wealth of Holland was on the one hand , the wealth of France on the other . They held the keys . ( 3 ) The insular position and their free institutions invited refugees from all the Continent , artisans and skilled laborers of all kinds . Hence , the beginning of their great industries , which made England rich in proportion as her authority and chance of trade expanded over distant islands and continents . But this would not have been possible without the third advantage which I shall mention , and that is : III . Coal . England 's power and wealth rested upon her coal-beds . In this bounty nature was more liberal to the tight little island than to any other spot in Western Europe , and England took early advantage of it . To be sure , her coal-field is small compared with that of the United States  --  an area of only 11,900 square miles to our 192,000 . But Germany has only 1,770 ; Belgium , 510 ; France , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leads Europe in this respect , and has now 30,000 square miles of coal-beds . But see the use England makes of this material : in 1877 , she took out of the ground 134,179,968 tons . The United States the same year took out 50,000,000 tons ; Germany , 48,000,000 ; France , 16,000,000 ; Belgium , 14,000,000 . This tells the story of the heavy industries . We have considered as elements of national greatness the race itself , the favorable position , and the material to work with . I need not enlarge upon the might and the possessions of England , nor the general beneficence of her occupation wherever she has established fort , factory , or colony . With her flag go much injustice , domineering , and cruelty ; but , on the whole , the best elements of civilization . The intellectual domination of England has been as striking as the physical . It is stamped upon all her colonies ; it has by no means disappeared in the United States . For more than fifty years after our independence we imported our intellectual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in certain forms  --  and largely our ethical guidance from England . We read English books , or imitations of the English way of looking at things ; we even accepted the English caricatures of our own life as genuine  --  notably in the case of the so-called typical Yankee . It is only recently that our writers have begun to describe our own life as it is , and that readers begin to feel that our society may be as interesting in print as that English society which they have been all their lives accustomed to read about . The reading-books of children in schools were filled with English essays , stories , English views of life ; it was the English heroines over whose woes the girls wept ; it was of the English heroes that the boys declaimed . I do not know how much the imagination has to do in shaping the national character , but for half a century English writers , by poems and novels , controlled the imagination of this country . The principal reading then , as now  --  and perhaps more then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this England supplied . We took in with it , it will be noticed , not only the romance and gilding of chivalry and legitimacy , such as Scott gives us , but constant instruction in a society of ranks and degrees , orders of nobility and commonalty , a fixed social status , a well-ordered , and often attractive , permanent social inequality , a state of life and relations based upon lingering feudal conditions and prejudices . The background of all English fiction is monarchical ; however liberal it may be , it must be projected upon the existing order of things . We have not been examining these foreign social conditions with that simple curiosity which leads us to look into the social life of Russia as it is depicted in Russian novels ; we have , on the contrary , absorbed them generation after generation as part of our intellectual development , so that the novels and the other English literature must have had a vast influence in molding our mental character , in shaping our thinking upon the political as well as the social constitution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , almost the only , to this English influence was the newspaper , which has always kept alive and diffused a distinctly American spirit  --  not always lovely or modest , but national . The establishment of periodicals which could afford to pay for fiction written about our society and from the American point of view has had a great effect on our literary emancipation . The wise men whom we elect to make our laws  --  and who represent us intellectually and morally a good deal better than we sometimes like to admit  --  have always gone upon the theory , with regard to the reading for the American people , that the chief requisite of it was cheapness , with no regard to its character so far as it is a shaper of notions about government and social life . What educating influence English fiction was having upon American life they have not inquired , so long as it was furnished cheap , and its authors were cheated out of any copyright on it . At the North , thanks to a free press and periodicals , to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accompanying industries and commerce , we have been developing an immense intellectual activity , a portion of which has found expression in fiction , in poetry , in essays , that are instinct with American life and aspiration ; so that now for over thirty years , in the field of literature , we have had a vigorous offset to the English intellectual domination of which I spoke . How far this has in the past molded American thought and sentiment , in what degree it should be held responsible for the infidelity in regard to our " American experiment , " I will not undertake to say . The South furnishes a very interesting illustration in this connection . When the civil war broke down the barriers of intellectual non-intercourse behind which the South had ensconced itself , it was found to be in a colonial condition . Its libraries were English libraries , mostly composed of old English literature . Its literary growth stopped with the reign of George III . Its latest news was the Spectator and the Tatler . The social order it covered was that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Shelley or the radicalism of a manufacturing age . Its chivalry was an imitation of the antiquated age of lords and ladies , and tournaments , and buckram courtesies , when men were as touchy to fight , at the lift of an eyelid or the drop of the glove , as Brian de Bois-Guilbert , and as ready for a drinking-bout as Christopher North . The intellectual stir of the North , with its disorganizing radicalism , was rigorously excluded , and with it all the new life pouring out of its presses . The South was tied to a republic , but it was not republican , either in its politics or its social order . It was , in its mental constitution , in its prejudices , in its tastes , exactly what you would expect a people to be , excluded from the circulation of free ideas by its system of slavery , and fed on the English literature of a century ago . I dare say that a majority of its reading public , at any time , would have preferred a monarchical system and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have said that English domination usually carries the best elements of civilization . Yet it must be owned that England has pursued her magnificent career in a policy often insolent and brutal , and generally selfish . Scarcely any considerations have stood in the way of her trade and profit . I will not dwell upon her opium culture in India , which is a proximate cause of famine in district after district , nor upon her forcing the drug upon China  --  a policy disgraceful to a Christian queen and people . We have only just got rid of slavery , sustained so long by Biblical and official sanction , and may not yet set up as critics . But I will refer to a case with which all are familiar  --  England 's treatment of her American colonies . In 1760 and onward , when Franklin , the agent of the colonies of Pennsylvania and Massachusetts , was cooling his heels in lords ' waiting-rooms in London , America was treated exactly as Ireland was  --  that is , discriminated against in every way ; not allowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except under the most vexatious restrictions ; and the effort was continued to make her a mere agricultural producer and a dependent . All that England cared for us was that we should be a market for her manufactures . This same selfishness has been the keynote of her policy down to the present day , except as the force of circumstances has modified it . Steadily pursued , it has contributed largely to make England the monetary and industrial master of the world . With this outline I pass to her present condition and outlook . The dictatorial and selfish policy has been forced to give way somewhat in regard to the colonies . The spirit of the age and the strength of the colonies forbid its exercise ; they can not be held by the old policy . Australia boldly adopts a protective tariff , and her parliament is only nominally controlled by the crown . Canada exacts duties on English goods , and England can not help herself . Even with these concessions , can England keep her great colonies ? They are still loyal in word . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw their intellectual supplies from England . On the prospect of a war with Russia they nearly all offered volunteers . But everybody knows that allegiance is on the condition of local autonomy . If united Canada asks to go , she will go . So with Australia . It may be safely predicted that England will never fight again to hold the sovereignty of her new-world possessions against their present occupants . And , in the judgment of many good observers , a dissolution of the empire , so far as the Western colonies are concerned , is inevitable , unless Great Britain , adopting the plan urged by Franklin , becomes an imperial federation , with parliaments distinct and independent , the crown the only bond of union  --  the crown , and not the English parliament , being the titular and actual sovereign . Sovereign power over America in the parliament Franklin never would admit . His idea was that all the inhabitants of the empire must be citizens , not some of them subjects ruled by the home citizens . The two great political parties of England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Reform Bill of 1832 . The Tories had been long in power . They had made many changes and popular concessions , but they resisted parliamentary reform . The great Whig lords , who had tried to govern England without the people and in opposition to the crown in the days of George III. , had learned to seek popular support . The Reform Bill , which was ultimately forced through by popular pressure and threat of civil war , abolished the rotten boroughs , gave representation to the large manufacturing towns and increased representation to the counties , and the suffrage to all men who had ' paid ten pounds a year rent in boroughs , or in the counties owned land worth ten pounds a year or paid fifty pounds rent . The immediate result of this was to put power into the hands of the middle classes and to give the lower classes high hopes , so that , in 1839 , the Chartist movement began , one demand of which was universal suffrage . The old party names of Whig and Tory had been dropped and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Liberals . Both parties had , however , learned that there was no rest for any ruling party except a popular basis , and the Conservative party had the good sense to strengthen itself in 1867 by carrying through Mr. Disraeli 's bill , which gave the franchise in boroughs to all householders paying rates , and in counties to all occupiers of property rated at fifteen pounds a year . This broadening of the suffrage places the power irrevocably in the hands of the people , against whose judgment neither crown nor ministry can venture on any important step . In general terms it may be said that of these two great parties the Conservative wishes to preserve existing institutions , and latterly has leaned to the prerogatives of the crown , and the Liberal is inclined to progress and reform , and to respond to changes demanded by the people . Both parties , however , like parties elsewhere , propose and oppose measures and movements , and accept or reject policies , simply to get office or keep office . The Conservative party of late years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has been better able to define its lines and preserve a compact organization . The Liberals , with a multitude of reformatory projects , have , of course , a less homogeneous organization , and for some years have been without well-defined issues . The Conservative aristocracy seemed to form a secure alliance with the farmers and the great agricultural interests , and at the same time to have a strong hold upon the lower classes . In what his opponents called his " policy of adventure , " Lord Beaconsfield had the support of the lower populace . The Liberal party is an incongruous host . On one wing are the Whig lords and great landowners , who can not be expected to take kindly to a land reform that would reform them out of territorial power ; and on the other wing are the Radicals , who would abolish the present land system and the crown itself , and institute the rule of a democracy . Between these two is the great body of the middle class , a considerable portion of the educated and university trained , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we may say , generally the Nonconformists . There are some curious analogies in these two parties to our own parties before the war . It is , perhaps , not fanciful to suppose that the Conservative lords resemble our own aristocratic leaders of democracy , who contrived to keep near the people and had affiliations that secured them the vote of the least educated portion of the voters ; while the great Liberal lords are not unlike our old aristocratic Whigs , of the cotton order , who have either little sympathy with the people or little faculty of showing it . It is a curious fact that during our civil war respect for authority gained us as much sympathy from the Conservatives , as love for freedom ( hampered by the greed of trade and rivalry in manufactures ) gained us from the Liberals . To return to the question of empire . The bulk of the Conservative party would hold the colonies if possible , and pursue an imperial policy ; while certainly a large portion of the Liberals  --  not all , by any means  --  would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school , hope to hold England 's place by free-trade and active competition . The imperial policy may be said to have two branches , in regard to which parties will not sharply divide : one is the relations to be held towards the Western colonies , and the other in the policy to be pursued in the East in reference to India and to the development of the Indian empire , and also the policy of aggression and subjection in South Africa . An imperial policy does not necessarily imply such vagaries as the forcible detention of the forcibly annexed Boer republic . But everybody sees that the time is near when England must say definitely as to the imperial policy generally whether it will pursue it or abandon it . And it may be remarked in passing that the Gladstone government , thus far , though pursuing this policy more moderately than the Beaconsfield government , shows no intention of abandoning it . Almost everybody admits that if it is abandoned England must sink to the position of a third-rate power like Holland . For what does abandonment mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of moral example , in Continental affairs : to relinquish her advantages in the Mediterranean ; to let Turkey be absorbed by Russia ; to become so weak in India as to risk rebellion of all the provinces , and probable attack from Russia and her Central Asian allies . But this is not all . Lost control in Asia is lost trade ; this is evident in every foot of control Russia has gained in the Caucasus , about the Caspian Sea , in Persia . There Russian manufactures supplant the English ; and so in another quarter : in order to enjoy the vast opening trade of Africa , England must be on hand with an exhibition of power . We might show by a hundred examples that the imperial idea in England does not rest on pride alone , on national glory altogether , though that is a large element in it , but on trade instincts . " Trade follows the flag " is a well-known motto ; and that means that the lines of commerce follow the limits of empire . Take India as an illustration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last forty years the total revenue from India , set down up to 1880 as L 1,517,000,000 , has been L 53,000,000 less than the expenditure . It varies with the years , and occasionally the balance is favorable , as in 1879 , when the expenditure was L 63,400,000 and the revenue was L 64,400,000 . But to offset this average deficit the very profitable trade of India , which is mostly in British hands , swells the national wealth ; and this trade would not be so largely in British hands if the flag were away . But this is not the only value of India . Grasp on India is part of the vast Oriental network of English trade and commerce , the carrying trade , the supply of cotton and iron goods . This largely depends upon English prestige in the Orient , and to lose India is to lose the grip . On practically the same string with India are Egypt , Central Africa , and the Euphrates valley . A vast empire of trade opens out . To sink the imperial policy is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and America competing on the other , England can not afford to lose her military lines , her control of the sea , her prestige . Again , India offers to the young and the adventurous a career , military , civil , or commercial . This is of great weight  --  great social weight . One of the chief wants of England today is careers and professions for her sons . The population of the United Kingdom in 1876 was estimated at near thirty-four millions ; in the last few decades the decennial increase had been considerably over two millions ; at that rate the population in 1900 would be near forty millions . How can they live in their narrow limits ? They must emigrate , go for good , or seek employment and means of wealth in some such vast field as India . Take away India now , and you cut off the career of hundreds of thousands of young Englishmen , and the hope of tens of thousands of households . There is another aspect of the case which it would be unfair to ignore . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have no doubt that Mr. Thomas Hughes spoke for a very respectable portion of Christian England , in 1861 , when he wrote Mr. James Russell Lowell , in a prefatory note to " Tom Brown at Oxford , " these words : " The great tasks of the world are only laid on the strongest shoulders . We , who have India to guide and train , who have for our task the educating of her wretched people into free men , who feel that the work can not be shifted from ourselves , and must be done as God would have it done , at the peril of England 's own life , can and do feel for you . " It is safe , we think , to say that if the British Empire is to be dissolved , disintegration can not be permitted to begin at home . Ireland has always been a thorn in the side of England . And the policy towards it could not have been much worse , either to impress it with a respect for authority or to win it by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concession and untimely cruelty . The problem , in fact , has physical and race elements that make it almost insolvable . A water-logged country , of which nothing can surely be predicted but the uncertainty of its harvests , inhabited by a people of most peculiar mental constitution , alien in race , temperament , and religion , having scarcely one point of sympathy with the English . But geography settles some things in this world , and the act of union that bound Ireland to the United Kingdom in 1800 was as much a necessity of the situation as the act of union that obliterated the boundary line between Scotland and England in 1707 . The Irish parliament was confessedly a failure , and it is scarcely within the possibilities that the experiment will be tried again . Irish independence , so far as English consent is concerned , and until England 's power is utterly broken , is a dream . Great changes will doubtless be made in the tenure and transfer of land , and these changes will react upon England to the ultimate abasement of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no consent to separation . The undeniable growth of the democratic spirit in England can no more be relied on to bring it about , when we remember what renewed executive vigor and cohesion existed with the Commonwealth and the fiery foreign policy of the first republic of France . For three years past we have seen the British Empire in peril on all sides , with the addition of depression and incipient rebellion at home , but her horizon is not as dark as it was in 1780 , when , with a failing cause in America , England had the whole of Europe against her . In any estimate of the prospects of England we must take into account the recent marked changes in the social condition . Mr. Escott has an instructive chapter on this in his excellent book on England . He notices that the English character is losing its insularity , is more accessible to foreign influences , and is adopting foreign , especially French , modes of living . Country life is losing its charm ; domestic life is changed ; people live in " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home is not what it was ; marriage is not exactly what it was ; the increased free and independent relations of the sexes are somewhat demoralizing ; women are a little intoxicated with their newly-acquired freedom ; social scandals are more frequent . It should be said , however , that perhaps the present perils are due not to the new system , but to the fact that it is new ; when the novelty is worn off the peril may cease . Mr. Escott notices primogeniture as one of the stable and , curious enough , one of the democratic institutions of society . It is owing to primogeniture that while there is a nobility in England there is no noblesse . If titles and lands went to all the children there would be the multitudinous noblesse of the Continent . Now , by primogeniture , enough is retained for a small nobility , but all the younger sons must go into the world and make a living . The three respectable professions no longer offer sufficient inducement , and they crowd more and more into trade . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Besides , the upper is all the time recruited from the wealthy middle ; the union of aristocracy and plutocracy may be said to be complete . But merit makes its way continually from even the lower ranks upward , in the professions , in the army , the law , the church , in letters , in trade , and , what Mr. Escott does not mention , in the reformed civil service , newly opened to the humblest lad in the land . Thus there is constant movement up and down in social England , approaching , except in the traditional nobility , the freedom of movement in our own country . This is all wholesome and sound . Even the nobility itself , driven by ennui , or a loss of former political control , or by the necessity of more money to support inherited estates , goes into business , into journalism , writes books , enters the professions . What are the symptoms of decay in England ? Unless the accumulation of wealth is a symptom of decay , I do not see many . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that never in their history were they more full of vigor . See what travelers , explorers , adventurers they are . See what sportsmen , in every part of the globe , how much they endure , and how hale and jolly they are  --  women as well as men . The race , certainly , has not decayed . And look at letters . It may be said that this is not the age of pure literature  --  and I 'm sure I hope the English patent for producing machine novels will not be infringed  --  but the English language was never before written so vigorously , so clearly , and to such purpose . And this is shown even in the excessive refinement and elaboration of trifles , the minutia of reflection , the keenness of analysis , the unrelenting pursuit of every social topic into subtleties untouched by the older essayists . And there is still more vigor , without affectation , in scientific investigation , in the daily conquests made in the realm of social economy , the best methods of living and getting the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and shows abundant life and promise for the future . I believe , from these and other considerations , that this vigorous people will find a way out of its present embarrassment , and a way out without retreating . For myself , I like to see the English sort of civilization spreading over the world rather than the Russian or the French . I hope England will hang on to the East , and not give it over to the havoc of squabbling tribes , with a dozen religions and five hundred dialects , or to the military despotism of an empire whose morality is only matched by the superstition of its religion . The relations of England and the United States are naturally of the first interest to us . Our love and our hatred have always been that of true relatives . For three-quarters of a century our ' amour propre ' was constantly kept raw by the most supercilious patronage . During the past decade , when the quality of England 's regard has become more and more a matter of indifference to us , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of increased respect , accompanied with a sincere desire to understand us . In the diplomatic scale Washington still ranks below the Sublime Porte , but this anomaly is due to tradition , and does not represent England 's real estimate of the status of the republic . There is , and must be , a good deal of selfishness mingled in our friendship  --  patriotism itself being a form of selfishness  --  but our ideas of civilization so nearly coincide , and we have so many common aspirations for humanity that we must draw nearer together , notwithstanding old grudges and present differences in social structure . Our intercourse is likely to be closer , our business relations will become more inseparable . I can conceive of nothing so lamentable for the progress of the world as a quarrel between these two English-speaking peoples . But , in one respect , we are likely to diverge . I refer to literature ; in that , assimilation is neither probable nor desirable . We were brought up on the literature of England ; our first efforts were imitations of it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We compared every new aspirant in letters to some English writer . We were patted on the back if we resembled the English models ; we were stared at or sneered at if we did not . When we began to produce something that was the product of our own soil and our own social conditions , it was still judged by the old standards , or , if it was too original for that , it was only accepted because it was curious or bizarre , interesting for its oddity . The criticism that we received for our best was evidently founded on such indifference or toleration that it was galling . At first we were surprised ; then we were grieved ; then we were indignant . We have long ago ceased to be either surprised , grieved , or indignant at anything the English critics say of us . We have recovered our balance . We know that since Gulliver there has been no piece of original humor produced in England equal to " Knickerbocker 's New York " ; that not in this century has any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Biglow Papers . " We used to be irritated at what we called the snobbishness of English critics of a certain school ; we are so no longer , for we see that its criticism is only the result of ignorance  --  simply of inability to understand . And we the more readily pardon it , because of the inability we have to understand English conditions , and the English dialect , which has more and more diverged from the language as it was at the time of the separation . We have so constantly read English literature , and kept ourselves so well informed of their social life , as it is exhibited in novels and essays , that we are not so much in the dark with regard to them as they are with regard to us ; still we are more and more bothered by the insular dialect . I do not propose to criticise it ; it is our misfortune , perhaps our fault , that we do not understand it ; and I only refer to it to say that we should not be too hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American dialect in the English that Mr. Howells writes . How can the Englishman be expected to come into sympathy with the fiction that has New England for its subject  --  from Hawthorne 's down to that of our present novelists  --  when he is ignorant of the whole background on which it is cast ; when all the social conditions are an enigma to him ; when , if he has , historically , some conception of Puritan society , he can not have a glimmer of comprehension of the subtle modifications and changes it has undergone in a century ? When he visits America and sees it , it is a puzzle to him . How , then , can he be expected to comprehend it when it is depicted to the life in books ? No , we must expect a continual divergence in our literatures . And it is best that there should be . There can be no development of a nation 's literature worth anything that is not on its own lines , out of its own native materials . We must not expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national life , character , conditions , any better than they understand that of the French or of the Germans . And , on our part , the day has come when we receive their literary efforts with the same respectful desire to be pleased with them that we have to like their dress and their speech .
