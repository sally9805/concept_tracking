ARTICLE VII. - THE OLD ACADEMIES . I As several old academies have had public celebrations the past year , it may be a matter of interest to notice some facts respecting their history and character . What are we to understand by the term " Academy " and the phrase " Old Academies ? " The term academy had its origin 2250 years ago . It was the name of a grove near Athens where Plato taught those who came to him for instruction . The word has been adopted in nearly all countries , and is used at the present day in a variety of ways , as , for illustration , academy of arts and sciences , academy of music , academy of medicine , etc . But the term academy , placed at the head of this paper , has a different application . It refers to a class of educational institutions which started in the times of the revolutionary war . It is very important that we have a clear and definite idea of their origin and character . In 1763 a school was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ School . " In 1778 another school was started at Andover , Mass. , called the " Phillips School , " but in October , 1780 , this name was changed , and the institution was incorporated by the general court as " Phillips Academy . " No reasons for this change are given in the life of Mr. Phillips nor in the proceedings of the general court . It is evident Mr. Phillips and other parties interested consulted together on the subject , and , as the term academy had been applied to a class of educational institutions in England , supported by the dissenters , they decided to apply the same name to a similar class of schools in New England . Thus , in 1782 , the Dummer School at Byfield was incorporated as " Dummer Academy , " and in 1784 a new school at Leicester was incorporated as " Leicester Academy . " In 1782 , an academy was established at Exeter , N. II. , called also " Phillips Academy , " after the Hon. John Phillips , who gave liberally for its endowment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or four principals from // its commencement , and , for fitting so many young men for Harvard University . As we are more familiar with the history of these institutions in Massachusetts our discussion of the subject will be confined chiefly to this State . Between the years 1780 and 1784 twelve academies were incorporated in Massachusetts . This was a most eventful period in history . It was at the close of the revolutionary war , when great interests were at stake , involving the highest welfare of the people . War-times had developed strong men - men of extraordinary talent and character . Though the clergy in earlier times had been foremost in their influence , it happened at this period that laymen took the lead in directing not only the affairs of State , but in moulding and establishing educational institutions . The projection and incorporation of these academies was in a great measure the work of their hands . Our Puritan fathers were wise and sagacious men . From their early training and knowledge of institutions in their fatherland , they saw the importance of establishing educational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profound appreciation of learning , of fine scholarship in the classics and of a thorough knowledge of the higher English branches . They knew what such attainments were in the old country , and the influence they had upon society there . They saw the importance of establishing schools in this country whereby young men could be trained up and become scholars of the highest order . The result of the course laid out proved their wisdom and forethought . The word " old , " applied here to " academy , " is very appropriately used , as four of these institutions have already celebrated their centennials . Another reason for the use of " old " is that very many of these academies ceased to exist long ago , and some of them continued only a few years after their incorporation . Besides , such is the rapid change of most organizations at the present day , that those which have existed very many years seem old . In establishing these academies , the founders had certain fundamental points in view which deserve careful consideration . They were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be distributed in different localities , so that there // might be from 30,000 to 40,000 inhabitants in the immediate region of each school . It was intended that they should be endowed by the State or by the contributions of individuals , to such an extent as to command the highest class of teachers , and at the same time pupils should pay a moderate tuition . It was intended that they should be governed by a board of trustees , residing in different localities and composed partly of learned men in the professions and partly of laymen skilled in finance and successful in business , all giving their services from their deep interest in education . These academies were to be open to all classes-alike to the rich and the poor ,  - -  without distinction shown to rank , race , or sect . Young men were to be thoroughly fitted in these academies for the college or university , and others in the higher English branches for teachers or departments of business . These academies came in between the university and the common or grammar schools , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was intended that they should be scattered in every conuty throughout the whole State . That the plan of establishing this class of institutions was favorably received by the people , is evident from the fact that a large number were soon incorporated . From 1780 to 1800 there were fourteen academies incorporated , and from that date to 1850 , almost one hundred more were incorporated , being located in all parts of the State . The scheme was too popular-it was overdone . Almost every large town wanted such a school located in it . The original plan was not strictly adhered to , and it was soon discovered that there were altogether too many academies . Several that were incorporated never went into operation ; others had a short existence . Some were changed in character and became female seminaries , and others were converted into high schools . Some of these academies , being favorably located and adhering to the original plan , flourished for many years , but finally from untoward circumstances , were obliged to suspend . Others having endowments and being wisely managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospering . But what has operated to the injury of these academies more than anything else , has been the general introduction of high schools into all large places . // The establishment of high schools was encouraged by boards of education , and sought for very generally by the people . In completing the common school system this grade of schools seemed necessary , especially in cities . As high schools were brought virtually to the doors of the people and their advantages were furnished free of expense to all , it was natural that they should be well patronized and in time , displace private schools . Thus a majority of the academies were saperseded by high schools in this State , but iu other States where the high school has not been so generally introduced , many of the academies have flourished . A few in our own State have had a prosperous career and may still be said to be in a flourishing condition . The fact that so many of these academies have run out or been displaced by the high school , furnishes no evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they did not do a great work . In some respects these institutions possessed certain advantages superior to those of the high school , and therefore are deserving a thoughtful consideration . It may be well to state definitely what the objects of their founders were : 1 . Our Puritan fathers intended that these academies should be so located that no one place could monopolize their advantages . 2 . They intended that there should be sufficient endowment so as to reduce the expense of tuition , and thus encourage persons of moderate means . They did not believe in furnishing such education as an entire gratuity to young people . 3 . They believed that a decided moral and religious training should l ) e made a part and parcel of this higher education for the young . 4 . In establishing these academies they aimed to make provisions whereby a high standard of scholarship , both classical and English , could be obtained . * . A fundamental principle governing our Puritan fathers in establishing these academies was that their advantages should be brought within the reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6 . It was intended that the government of these academies // should be placed in a board of trustees residing in different localities , and appointed on account of special qualifications . These six principles were fundamental . An examination into the history of these academies , especially of those which have proved successful , will show that they were preeminently governed by these principles . We believe these academies were the best institutions ever devised for educating young women and young men so as to secure the highest objects of life . We might refer to the results as the fruits of their history . If we could cite the example or summon the testimony of the thousands and ten thousands who have graduated at these academies , what evidence or demonstrations could be more conclusive ? But the reasons , the why and the wherefore , for the superiority of this class of schools , may prove more instructive than the largest possible array of personal example and testimony . In giving these reasons , it may not be unprofitable to compare certain features , or factors in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , in most places throughout the State , has superseded or taken the place of the academy . At this point of the discussion it should be premised that the age from twelve to eighteen , in every young man or young woman , is the most critical , the most important period in education . The whole future life depends much upon the habits formed , the motives governing , and the standards , moral and intellectual , that are brought to influence the pupil at this age . Character is formed more rapidly and permanently during these years than at any other time . It is a period when growth and changes , the greatest and most radical , take place in the physical system , which have a powerful influence upon success in after life . The importance of securing a sound and vigorous constitution and developing all parts of the body can not be over-estimated . To do this the muscles must be exercised , while in a state of growth . The individual should be more or less thrown upon his own resources , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent , to take care of himself , or herself , it is only in this way that physical strength and health can be secured . The brain should not be developed at the expense of the body . While pursuing studies and // obtaining knowledge , special pains should be taken that the physical system receive its proper growth and strength-that the physical and mental be developed and trained harmoniously . This important fact should constantly be borne in mind , that when young men and young women reach the age of fourteen , fifteen , and sixteen , they should begin to think and act for themselves . While they may be guided in their plans and assisted in carrying them out , they should be thrown more or less upon their own resources . Their highest interests demand it . Two or three years at this period constitute frequently the crises , the turning points , which decide the whole life and character of young persons . Now the academy possessed the means and furnished the appeals which were adapted to arouse the energies and excite the ambition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new motives for study and activity , and start inquiries in the minds of the young , if they ought not to make and do something in the world . They can attend the academy one term , one year , or more ; but they must pay tuition , furnish books , and make provision for board . This requires physical exercise and mental energy , combined with self-reliance. lilt may be the young man or woman must find temporarily a new home and make new acquaintances . In the academy the pupils come together all on an equality , without distinction as to family or means , forming a pure democracy . In establishing the academy system our Puritan fathers did not believe that education should be entirely a gratuitous commodity . The question of free schools and free tuition was discussed at the very start of these academies , and they decided to adopt no such course . They believed that the common school , or primary and grammar , should be free to all , and should be supported by taxation , but when the pupil had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruction , he should pay something towards it . At that age , he has reached a period when he can earn something and help himself . This raises a very practical and important question . What is the effect upon body and mind of free , continuous schooling of young persons till eighteen or twenty years of age . While there may be the advantages of a superior education obtained , // there are radical evils . The young person during all this time is dependent upon his parents . His wants are supplied without much exertion or self-denial ; he is not induced or compelled to make plans or calculations for future life . The young man or woman grows up with a weak body , a very active brain and a predominance of the nervous temperament , a species of physical degeneracy . Hard work , close confinement , self-denial , and an economical manner of living do not suit the organization of a person thus trained . His tastes , his wants , and the style of living sought are not so easily obtained or satisfied . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor self-supporting , but is too theoretical , too artificial and fashionable . There is another element which the academies formerly taught , and do generally at the present day , the formation of a high-toned moral and religious character . No educational sys. tem is complete or develops properly the mental faculties without some positive moral and religious instruction . This was a marked feature , a primary object , in the organization of the old academy , and in all those institutions that still exist and flourish , religious instruction and influence are prominent features . The education of the intellect alone is not a wise or safe course to pursue . The strongest and most powerful motives for influencing human action and character come from the moral and religious faculties ; and therefore in no educational system , especially in the higher class of schools , should the training of these faculties be ignored or neglected . Such a course does not harmonize with the laws of the physical system or with the highest order of mental development . While educating the intellectual faculties the moral and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring the individual under the highest class of motives . In this way only can the body and mind be developed to their fullest extent . In preparing for the duties and responsibilities of life , it is of the highest importance that the right kind of education be secured . There are things to be learned and acquisitions to be made which are of more value than mere book-knowledge . As an educator , the old academy possessed in this respect // superior advantages . It taught the value of learning , that it cost something ; that the pupil who paid for it , who made some exertion , some self-denial to secure it , made a far better use of such knowledge . The old academy was peculiarly calculated to develop a manliness of character and to beget an ambition , a determination to make and do something . In examining the history of men or women who have reached very prominent positions in society or become at all distinguished as writers or scholars , we find almost invariably that in early life they had to exert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret of their success and distinction arose from habits early formed , from the fact that they were obliged to help themselves . In this way a stronger and more healthy physical system is developed , connected with a will-power , an energy and self-reliance which are indispensable for success . It may be said that the academy as an educator was better adapted to former times and not so well suited to the present day , when population is far more condensed and greater numbers relatively are seeking a higher education who have not the means . It may be said , too , that the best interests of society and of the State demand that education in its broadest extent should be generously provided for all , by taxation , compelling those who have means and no families or children to contribute to it . While we would appreciate the vast amount of good which high schools have accomplished , and are still doing , we can not regard the system as perfect or devoid of all inherent evils . In a brief summary of these evils , onr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its charitable aspect or freedom from expense . The principle is the same , and human nature is governed by the same laws , as when , one hundred years ago , our Puritan ancestors decided that education above what the common school afforded should not be entirely gratuitous . When young men or young women reach an age that they can earn money and become selfsupporting , if they wish to pursue studies with special reference to the professions , to public business or the higher walks of life , is it not for their interests , as well as just to others , // that they should pay something towards it ? Does it accord with human nature generally , or more especially can young people be expected to appreciate and turn to the best account favors bestowed upon them without any exertion on their own part , for which they render neither equivalent or acknowledgment ? What greater favors or richer gifts than the immense expenses of the high school ? 2 . The costs of the high school , it is safe to say , border on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this kind can be brought against the old or new academy . The expenses here come mainly from the contributions of individuals . The buildings are simple and generally inexpensive . The salaries of teachers are moderate , and the tuition required of students is considerably less , we think , than the cost of instruction in the high school , though we have not the figures at hand to make the comparison . The extravagance is marked in the erection of buildings , especially in cities . 3 . But one of the greatest , the most powerful arguments against the high school is its effect upon the physical system . It begets a predominance of the brain and nerve tissue without developing or strengthening the muscles , which are indispensable in order to discharge successfully the duties of life . It has been stated that the years from twelve to eighteen in every young man or woman are the most important period for physical development . Scarcely any high school makes provision by way of gymnastics or other means for physical exercise and health . This argument will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to health and life is not understood as it should be . Let one thoroughly and impartially investigate this argument in all its bearings , he will become convinced not only of its truth , but that it has an importance and far-reaching influence that can not easily be computed . The community at large and the present generation are not the only sufferers from this mode of education . In order to make the most of human life and character , and at the same time secure the greatest amount of happiness , a sound body , well trained and preserved , is indispensable . Such an organization is also surely necessary in order to transmit qualities that will ennoble and exalt the character of those who come after us. // CURRENT EVENTS .

No more important change has been made in the whole history of the institution ; and it is one that will be regarded with interest by all friends of the higher education . In order that a reliable account of what has been done might be given to our readers , as a basis for further consideration , the editors have thought it important that the new curriculum should be described by some one who is practically conversant with the subject . They have accordingly requested Professor Ladd to prepare the following pages to accompany the tables and notes which appear in the catalogue just published .
