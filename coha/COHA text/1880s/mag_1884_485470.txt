The binding is in dark blue cloth with much gilt . Perhaps this array of topographic " documents " is better fitted for the second than for the first reading of Mr. Hughes 's story ' Cathedrals of England ' ( T. Whittaker ) is a collection of seven essays , on Westminster Abbey and half-a-dozen of the English cathedrals , each paper written by a canon or other dignitary of the church he describes  --  or , rather , illustrates , for there is little real description of the buildings in the essays . They are made up rather of such fragments of history , antiquarianism , and occasional criticism or description , as would naturally fall from any of their scholarly writers in a-walk about the churches . Archdeacon Farrar , whose name alone appears on the title-page , leads the book with the longest paper , on Westminster Abbey , which is like the talk of a cultivated and instructed cicerone : the other papers are more or less in the-same vein The book contrasts , therefore , with Mrs Van Rensselaei 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record of the churches and their history ; but it has the advantage in its weight of style and in the varying individual tone of the different writers The illustrations show that they are from divers sources . In this American reprint they have suffered considerably , particularly those from Mr. Herbert Railton 's drawings , for to blur the clear accent of his touch is to rob him of his most vital characteristic . Mr Samuel Adams Drake has added Our Colonial Homes ' ( Boston . Lee &; Shepard ) to the several books of antiquarian study by which he has been known It includes a score of papers about old buildings in various parts of New England , which are described in his lively fashion , with all the zeal of the antiquary , and with abundance of collateral gossip . Most of the papers are reprinted from Apple-tons ' Journal : they are set off with handsome letterpress and with good hall-tone prints , albeit these have been spruced up for the service with brushwork which does not always improve their effect , though , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of France , ' by Stanley J Weyman ( Longmans ) , is a romande after the style of Dumas the elder , and well worthy of being read by those who can enjoy stirring adventures told in true romantic fashion . The time is the close of the civil and religious wars in the sixteenth century ; the subject , the carrying off , for political purposes , of a very charming young lady by a graybeard of forty , who falls in love with her . The great personages of the time ? Henry III . of Valois , Henry TV , Rosny , Rambouillet , Turenne  --  are brought in skilfully , and the tragic and varied history of the time forms a splendid frame in which to set the picture of Mersac 's love and courage . The story rattles along bravely , notwithstanding - occasional dull bits and weak points , the troublous days are well described and the interest is genuine and lasting , for up to the very end the author manages effects which impel the reader to go on with renewed curiosity The translation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston : Little , Brown di Co. ) , in two volumes , is a very good translation ni which the spirit of the original is well preserved . But are not the publishers in error when they claim that this is the first English version of the novel In 1864 Brady of New York brought out a translation under the tithe Olympia of Cleves , ' and possibly there may be still another , for Dumas 's romances have been as popular abroad as in France A fine edition of The Heptameron of the Tales of Margaret of NavarXe , ' newly and admirably translated into English , has been printed in London for the Society of English Bibliophilists The text used is that edited by Le Roux de Limey . Mr. George Saintsbury has contributed an erudite essay upon the Heptameron , ' which , although interesting , is heavy and even somewhat labored His conclusion , after a repeated and careful study of the book , is that the setting is almost wholly Margaret 's work , " and that other authors had a hand in the stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seems to him that " the secret of the Heptameron , " that which distinguishes it from other similar works , is " the fear of God , the sense of death , the voluptuous longing and voluptuous regret for the good things of life and love that pass away : " , Besides this essay there is prefixed a Life of Margaret , well written , and appended are the prefaces of the earlier French versions , a complete bibliographical summary of the various editions , the notes of the best French commentate rs , and a digest of the principal suggestions offered for the identification of the characters iii the book with well-known persons of the Queen 's day The full-page illustrations , which are numerous , are printed from the plates engraved by Longueil , Halbon , and others from Freudenberg 's designs , ' made originally for the famous Berne edition of 1778-81 . The Clouet drawing in the Bibliotheque Nationale has been - reproduced as the portrait frontispiece . The five octavo volumes are turned out in perfect fashion Mr. J B. Bury 's ' History @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the death of Nero , is the latest volume in the well-known Students ' Series ( London : Murray ; New York : Harper &; Bros ) Well informed as our students generally are about the Republic , the Empire is a period of which they are apt to know very little with any exactness , and this work is therefore welcome . Though it is evidently written chiefly from the ancient sources ' themselves , yet Mr Bury bas made the best use of the writings of Mommsen and Herzog , as well as of numerous monographs , and the result is a book-brief indeed , but attractively written and certain to be useful . The exposition of the latest views about the development of the imperial constitution and the succinct account of the administration of the provinces may be particularly commended . Besides the political and literary history of the times , there are good biographies of the leading figures , and the subjects of private antiquities and religion , including the growth of Christianity , are not neglected . There are several maps and about seventy-five illustrations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter are most of them old cuts already used in well-known books , uninteresting , and of little or no artistic value Worse than this , many of the so-called portraits are unauthentic . All the illustrations have lately been the subject of well-deserved and searching criticism in the Classical Review , and the majority of them are certainly discreditable to the author of the book and to the two great houses which have published it . By far the most interesting and important of the illustrations in the American Annual of Photography for 1894 ( Scovill &; Adams Co ) is the stuffed bird , a poll parrot , printed in three colors by Mr Kurtz 's Coloritype Co . We will not undertake to say how many impressions would be required by the methods heretofore in vogue , but the difference in cost must be very great Strange to say , this outgrowth of " process , " which promises an undreamt-of popularization of color work in the highest as well as the humblest walks of art , is undescribed in the Annual , or at least we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ index For the rest the volume contains the customary articles from a wide circle of amateur and professional photographers , beginning with a brief account , with portrait , of Johann Heinrich Schultze , " the Columbus of Photography . " There are the usual lists of American and foreign photographic societies , with their officers , and of hotels having darkrooms for the convenience of tourist photographers . Robida 's etchings detract from the general daintiness of the Book-Lover 's Almanac for 1891 ( New York . Duprat &; Co ) , nor are the other illustrations an advantage to the pretty presswork with variegated borders . , We remark an account of William Bradford , New York 's first printer , , and a contribution in French from Octave Uzanne , who is very flattering to NewYorkers in the matter of private libraries .

Eben Putnam ) lies before us : Apart from the notices of Gen. Israel Putnam and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 449 - - - - the matter of most current and permanent interest is the New England pedigree of President Cleveland exhibited in six charts with annotations , but upon this we have already commented on its first appearance . No one medium of publication seems to satisfy the New England genealogical curiosity . Around- the World , the new monthly just founded by the Contemporary Publishing Co. of Philadelphia , and edited by Prof Angelo Heilprin , has in it the promise of a very useful popular magazine scientifically conducted . It aims to keep its readers abreast of the latest tours , travels , and explorations , supplying " an analysis of the progress of research in all departments touching the physical history of the earth and of its productions , " and reviews of geographical literature . Prof. Heilprin 's taste goes hand in hand with his solid learning to produce a very handsome journal with charming illustrations . The price is very moderate . The last number of Petermann 's Mitteilungen opens with an attempt to solve some of the problems connected with the geological history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is followed by a similar examination of the plain lying to the east of the Sierra de Cordova in the Argentine Republic . Among the other articles are the first of a series of papers on the regions under German protection , beginning with an account of the Marshall Islands , a discussion of the variations of longitude through the periodic movements of the poles , and the distribution of beat over the earth 's surface . In late numbers of the Historical Magazine of the Imperial University of Japan , besides articles of local and national interest , there is an interesting paper on the soroban , or abacus , ? showing its comparatively late introduction among the Japanese . In the summer of 1612 a Chinese came to Nagasaki with . one of these handy calculating-machines , then in use from Moscow to Nanking An officer named Shobei Kataoka , attendant upon the bunco , or governor of Nagasaki , requested the loan of the mathematical machine , and , af terlearning how to use it , made a copy . This identical original copy and first Japanese abacus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exposition , confirming by visible proof and contemporaneous documentary evidence the ordinary accounts in the popular histories and the annals of the Kataoka family . The original Japanese maker , on going to Yedo , showed the instrument to the Shogun 's Government , and explained its great value . Besides ordering a number for the Bureau of Accounts in the Treasury Department , the Shogunate , after examination and approval , issued seals patent , and the public were allowed to buy it . Its use soon became general . With it one can quickly add , subtract , multiply , divide , extract square and cube-roots , and work decimals and fractions . A valuable paper on the philosophy of the soroban , by Cargill G. Knott , formerly chief constructive engineer of the imperial railway system , is contained in the Proceedings of the Asiatic Society of Japan , volume xiv The catalogue of the library of the late Dr. Dollmger , the completion of which has been so long delayed , is now published under the title of ' Bibliotheca Dollingeriaua . ' It is a stately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs ten marks ( 82 50 ) . Offers for the purchase of the library as a whole will be received until June 1 , 1891 ; if none of them are satisfactory , it may then be divided and sold at auction . Further information can be obtained from the Verwalter der DollingerStiftung der Univorsitat , " Munich , Germany . Breviaries and prayer-books are excluded from the catalogue , with the exception of two ( Nos. 383 and 384 ) , which are interesting and valuable from a bibliographical point of view We may add that this noteworthy collection of books shows marked deficiencies in some departments , owing to the fact that Dr. D011inger had the Library of the University as well as the magnificent State Library of Munich at his disposal . - The literary and artistic collections of the eminent Austrian encyclopdist , Dr. Constantin Ritter von Wurzbach-Tannenberg , who died at his villa in Berchtesgaden , August 18 , 1893 , in the seventy-sixth year of his age , have been secured by the Vienna City Museum , where they have been placed in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the deceased . About a year ago we called attention to the proposed sale of these choice and really unique collections , and it is to be regretted that they were not purchased by some institution in the United States . The library is not very large ( 6,500 volumes ) , but is very valuable , and among the 50,000 portraits of distinguished persons , consisting of copperplates , steel engravings , woodcuts , etchings , etc. , are many exceedingly rare prints . The municipal council of Vienna has also named one of the streets of that city Wurzbach Strasse With the death of Dr. Julius Froebel at Zurich , Switzerland , on November 6 , in the eighty-ninth year of his age , a remarkable man has passed away , whose scientific attainments won the respect and friendship of Alexander von Humboldt , and who played an important part in the political history of Germany before and during the Revolution of 1848 , and exerted no small influence upon the course of events which led to the reconstitution of his fatherland in 1866 and the final founding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his autobiography were reviewed in these columns soon after their publication in 1890 and 1891 . He was a man of the strictest integrity and sterling merit , and might have died a millionaire if he had used the opportunities for accumulating wealth which were opened to hun and fairly thrust upon him during his connection with the Austrian Government from 1862 to 1865 ? The fortunes and character of Montrose are of perennial interest to all good Scots . Yet the " Commentary " concerning his " Deeds , " by his friend and chaplain , Vilishart ? a book which probably did more than any other save the ' Eikon Basilike ' to win sympathy in Europe for the royalist cause  --  has not been printed in an English translation since 1819 , and the Latin original has never been reissued at all since 1649 . The new translation ( followed by the text ) which has just - been prepared by Messrs Murdoch and Simpson ( ' Deeds of Montrose , ' Longmans ) , ought to be welcome ; the more so as it is accompanied by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " or continuation , telling the story of Montrose 's tragic end , which has apparently never before seen the light . The editors have added a wealth of notes which make the volume a very storehouse of historical detail , especially of that personal and genealogical sort so dear to the Scottish antiquary . They have also obtained and printed a number of documents from the Danish and Swedish archives , which add to our knowledge of Montrose 's wanderings immediately before his last ill-fated attempt . The book is somewhat too ponderous and sumptuous for the shelves of the ordinary historical student , unless he is giving special attention to this particular theme , but every , great library and every Scot of means ought to secure a copy . ? London 's latest literary excitement has been Paul Verlaine 's lecture on " Contemporary French Poetry . " It virtually resolved itself into a reading from Sagesse ' and Romances sans Paroles . ' In M Verlaine 's estimation , apparently , contemporary French poetry begins and ends with his own . In the few words with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to Baudelaire , to 1VIallarm6 , to Merrill , to les Jetines But , so far as can be gathered , with this reference he was content He was more concerned to set forth his theory , to repeat that which he has said before in his poems The poet should live ; he should be sincere . " L'art , uses enfants , e'est d ' ? tre absolument sal-meme " And then , at once , he passed on to the reading of proofs of his own sincerity , of his own truth to himself . About the wilder period of his career , that period when he plunged into what ? as he expressed it  --  the church calls sin , the world debauchery , he held his peace . Parallelement , ' its record , he never opened . But the emotions of the years that followed , years when he wore his robe of penitence , found expression in some of the , most exquisite religious poems in the little volume ' Sagesse , ' the cry of repentance which he sent to the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he drew , for London , a small audience , but still , one large enough to repay him for his visit , the tickets selling for a high price . He has lectured before , as he reminded his listeners  --  in Belgium , in Nancy , in Metz , his birthplace A couple of years ago a benefit was given him in a Paris theatre , and " tout Paris " crowded to it , twenty francs , however , was all it represented for him . London has proved more profitable , as it probably did in the days of his first visit , some twenty years since , When he played the incongruous part of teacher It would seem impertinent to dwell on this side of his latest venture , were not his poverty a tact impossible to forget ; he himself , with his inveterate tendency to autobiography , not having hesitated to help make it conspicuous Invalid as he now is , it is a pleasure to know that something has been done to add to his comfort - ?

These speculations he has continued to Prosecute in the last issue of the Asiatic Quarterly Reaietu , to which he contributes a well-written article entitled " The Red Rajputs .

In general physical features , and more especially in point of stature and color , not to speak of customs and habits , as he goes on to particularize , the Rajputs differ from any other of the various tribes scattered over Hindustan Yet their color , though in all cases sufficiently markd to distinguish them , is not uniform , but varies , as we are told on the best authority , from light red , or almost orange , to dusky reddish or reddish brown .

It jN however , to be regretted that , while they were in the Cathedral of Gubbio , Messrs . Alinari failed to photograph the finest and most interesting picture it contains , Timoteo Viti 's " Magdalen " ; and one would like to see the series of Signorellis made complete by the addition of those at Fajano and Umbertide . ? Baroness Amnia von Tautphoeus , author of the popular novels , ' The Initials , ' Quits , ' ' At Odds , ' and Cyrdla , ' died at Munich on November 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maiden name was Montgomery , and she was of Irish birth , with a strain of Scotch blood in her veins . In 1836 she visited Munich , where she married Baron von Tautphoeus . The fruit of this union was one son , who died some eight years ago as Bavarian ambassador at Rome . The shock occasioned by the sudden death of then- only child so affected her husband that he fell into a decline and expired a few weeks later . Baroness von Tautphoeus was a cousin of Maria Edgeworth , and one of the pleasantest and most vivid recollections of her youth was her association with this charming lady and with the versatile and somewhat eccentric Lady Morgan . She was endowed in an eminent degree with the fresh and kindly humor which is the heirloom of her race , and which in her case age could not wither nor the severest blows of fate wholly destroy It was this genial quality which in her childhood and early maidenhood caused her family and friends to pun on her name and call her ' , 1 ? the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have taken the rank of English classics , and seem to have suffered no diminution in popularity dining the forty years that have elapsed since she published her first work of fiction . Edition has succeeded edition with remarkable regularity up to the present time , and only a few weeks before her decease a new German translation of Quits ' appeared at Weimar , and was warmly greeted by the German press It is also pleasant to note that she received from the sale of her works in the United States , where there was no legal obligation to pay her anything , a much larger sum than from her London publisher . In her contract with the latter she was far too modest , and consented to accept what ever pittance he chose to offer , so that her pecuniary compensation was very trifling , and bore no proportion to the literary and commercial value of her writings A like modesty led her persistently to refuse to furnish editors of biographical dictionaries and compilers of cyclopmdias with any information concerning her life ; to the numerous applications of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature was not sufficiently conspicuous to render personal items of this sort of any interest to the general public . For this reason her name nowhere appears in such books of reference , and not the slightest sketch of her life derived from authentic sources has ever been printed No urgency on the part of her friends could overcome this native reserve , even her husband knew nothing of her literary work or ever saw her engaged in it , and was as surprised as any stranger would have been when the finished volumes lay on the table before him . After his death she shrank from forming new acquaintances , and confined her social intercourse to a sympathetic circle composed of her nearest kin and a few congenial friends She now lies at rest by his side in the family vault at their country-seat , Castle Marquardstem , in the Bavarian Highlands DODGE 'S ' RIDERS OF MANY LANDS ' Riders of Many Lands .

But this handsome and attractive book , which has made its pilgrimage through Harper 's Magazine , looks as if it were destined to bring its author substantial returns . It is attractive in its outward form , attractive in its sixty-eight illustrations , ranging from the statue of Alexander the Great by Lysippusto an Hawaiian girl riding astride in her divided skirt ; attractive in its subject , which is literally'as wide a one as its title indicates , for its discui sive comments run from the treatise of Xenophon to the platitudes of an Anglomaniac . It is the work not only of a horse-lover and critical observer , but of an old soldier , and contains no end of odd bits of information , as that , in the Loyal Legion , " whoever refers to politics at a meeting of the commandery is for the first offence fined thirty dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that in Persia a viceroy is appointed with a salary and emoluments of , say , four thousand lashes per annum , that , " after making himself agreeable to his new subjects and getting settled in his duties , " he sends word to a rich man of his district that " out of his own loving kindness he awards him two hundred of his four thousand annual lashes " ; that St. Paul was mistaken , and if he was not that his translators are , etc , etc .
