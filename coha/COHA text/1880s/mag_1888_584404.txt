By James Baldwin . FIRST PAPER . L iT is just one hundred years since the old Congress of the Confederation was holding its last feeble sessions in the city of New York , and making ready for that change of government which was to come in with the adoption of the Constitution . That legislative body had had a fluctuating existence of a little more than a dozen years . It had begun its work by inaugurating the war with the mother-country and by declaring the independence of the colonies ; it had been the chief law-making and executive power of the States during the long and trying struggle which followed ; it had been instrumental , in no small degree , in securing the blessings of peace and liberty to the American people . But now its work was thought to have been finished ; that it was capable of performing any further great act of legislation seemed to be impossible . With barely a quorum in attendance , hampered by many restrictions , having little more than the shadow of authority , and possessing neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was really little that could be expected of it save quietly to abdicate in favor of the new order of things . Nevertheless , at the very moment that all men 's eyes were turned toward Philadelphia and the convention of delegates that was there framing a new Constitution for the young republic , the old Congress quietly crowned the work of its short existence by an act of the highest importance , not only to the future prosperity of the country , but to the continuance of the Union . It is needless to say that this act was the passage of the now memorable Ordinance of 1787 , providing for the settlement , government , and development of the Territory Northwest of the River Ohio . No measure of legislation since the declaration of the nation 's independence has produced results more wonderful or more enduring than this last supreme effort of the dying old Congress . " Never probably in the history of the world , " says Chief-Justice Chase , " has any law so accurately fulfilled , and yet so mightily exceeded , the anticipations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Northwest of the River Ohio embraced , as every reader of history knows , that portion of the country now included within the boundaries of Ohio , Indiana , Illinois , Michigan , and Wisconsin , and that part of Minnesota lying east of the Mississippi . This region had lately been ceded to the general government by Virginia and other States which had claimed it , or portions of it , by reason of their charters from the mother-country , or on account of certain treaties made with Indian tribes . With the exception of a few trading posts and military stations , it was an unbroken , almost unexplored , wilderness . The entire number of white inhabitants did not probably exceed two thousand , and of these many , especially in the north and west , were of French extraction . The motives which prompted the passage of the Ordinance respecting this Territory were not altogether unselfish or patriotic . At the bottom of the movement there was on foot a money-making scheme  --  a private speculation in land-in which , as one of its promoters acknowledged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was proposed by a company of capitalists , mostly New Englanders , to purchase some three and a half millions of acres in the Valley of the Ohio , paying thereforin public securities , at the nominal rate of about seventy-five cents per acre . They believed that // should a good form of government be secured to this Territory the time would soon come when the land could be sold to settlers or others at a handsome advance , and thus large profits be realized . There were many persons , doubtless , who ridiculed this scheme , and who regarded its promoters as visionaries dreaming of an impossible great empire in the wilds beyond the Alleghanies ; but these capitalists had faith in the undeveloped resources of . the Ohio Valley , and were willing to risk the investment of their funds if the Congress would only guarantee a form of government which would encourage immigration to the Territory . On the other hand , Congress was anxious to sell the land , and by doing so diminish the national debt ; and thus , while the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be effected highly satisfactory to both parties and absolutely wonderful in its unforeseen results . " Every man that had a share in the passage of this act , " says Bancroft , " seemed to be led by an invisible hatidto do just what was wanted of him ; all that was wrongfully undertaken fell to the ground to wither by the wayside ; whatever was needed for the happy completion of the mighty work arrived opportunely , and just at the right moment moved into its place . " The sagacity , indeed , with which the makers of this Ordinance provided for the future interests of the " Northwest , " and thereby for the welfare and perpetuity of the Union , seems to us little short of miraculous ; nowhere has it any parallel save in the matchless wisdom displayed by the framers of the national Constitution . The Ordinance and the Constitution , although originating independently and from motives entirely different , were equally necessary to the establishment and preservation of the union of the States : each was the complement of the other-in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplish its full measure of good . The convention which was sitting at the same time in Philadelphia and debating the adoption of a new Constitution was a body greatly superior both in numbers an*l influence to the Congress at New York . Among its members were the leading statesmen of the time-Hamilton , Madison , Randolph , Franklin , Washington , and many others . Yet it is worthy of note that their vision into the future was far more limited than that of the eighteen men , unknown to fame , who voted upon the passage of the Ordinance . They had little knowledge of the hidden resources of the West ; they had less faith in the possible future of that section . The country for which they were fraitting a fundamental code of laws was , so far as their knowledge extended , only that comparatively narrow extent of territory embraced between the mountains and the sea , and bounded on the north by the St. Croix River and on the south by Florida . There were , of course , in that convention a few men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who fancied that at some dim , distant period great commonwealths might be founded beyond the mountains , and new stars be added to the galaxy of the States . But by most of the delegates there assembled any marked extension of civilization westward was deemed a possibility too remote to be seriously considered . Colonies would probably be established in the Ohio Valley , but for many generations to come these would be but little more than mere " barrier settlements " - a species of outposts between the States of the Union and the domains of barbarism . The Constitution of the United States was , therefore , intended primarily to meet the wants of that part of the country east of the Alleghanies , and not to provide for the possible needs of a western empire . Had the men of the convention possessed that faith in the future of the West which animated some of the members of the old Federal Congress , it is impossible to say to what extent of folly they might have carried their schemes of legislation . But a wise Providence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , directed their counsels and enabled them , in establishing a form of government for the East , to provide with equal sagacity and satisfaction for the future , undreamed-of demands of the West . Three years passed . The old transitional government of the Confederation of States had been dissolved . The new // government of and for the people of a great nation , as established and provided for by the Constitution , had been inaugurated . The first Congress of the United States had assumed the functions delegated to it , and with new blood in its veins and new power in its hands , it was laying firm and broad the foundations of the national republic . Among the first duties of this Congress was that of selecting a site for the permanent location of the nation 's capitaL The seat of government , it was argued , ought not to be far from the centre of the inhabited portion of the country . Where was that centre ? The first census had shown that the population of the States was nearly evenly distributed in all directions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That point , then , was practically the centre of the republic . As the population should continue to increase , what would be the result ? Would the location of the centre be changed ? If so , in what direction would it move ? Not for several ages , argued some of the members , would the centre of population depart from its present position near the city of Baltimore , and never would it move westward . The cities and towns of the Atlantic coast were increasing rapidly in wealth and importance ; if the focal point of the country should change its location at all , its course would be eastward , toward the sea . Not one of the men in that First Congress seemed to have any faith in the growth and future importance of the West . " Not for at least a hundred years , " said Fisher Ames , " will that part of the country 's population beyond the Alleghanies be sufficient to merit serious attention . " To these legislators , the trackless woods and boundless prairies lying between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance to be looked upon as actually a part of the new republic . That region was indeed within the boundaries of the national domain , and as such should be provided for and protected ; yet it was to be regarded rather as a kind of backpasture to the original homestead-a kind of dependency whose interests should be considered only so far as they affected the welfare of the States . That it would ever prove to be much more than a sort of troublesome appanage to the nation seems scarcely to have been reckoned among the possibilities . IL BUT the centre of population was at that very moment changing its location ; and , contrary to the opinions of the wisest statesmen , it was moving westward . To us , living a century later and looking backward instead of forward , it is a matter of surprise that our first national legislators should have been so blind to the promises and possibilities of the future . That their predecessors of the Continental Congress had , by the Ordinance of 1787 , opened wide the way and invited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fact unnoticed by them , or at any rate to have been regarded as a matter of no importance whatever . They seem not to have been aware that the passes of the Alleghanies were already teeming with pioneers eagerly making their way westward toward the back-pasture of the republic ; that the great forests of the Ohio Valley were being rapidly felled , and that innumerable broad farms were being opened in the rich bottom-lands along the watercourses ; that villages and towns were being founded which erelong would become the centres of trade and a busy Western commerce ; and that , beyond the mountains , men were beginning to talk of the organization of new States in the territory so lately an unexplored wilderness . Does it appear strange that men , with these evidences in existence of the westward march of empire , should fail to perceive them , and should honestly believe and assert that the centre of population and influence in this country would never pass beyond the ridge of the Alleghanies ? How much more strange is it that at this very day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States of the Atlantic slope , who hug the same delusion and look upon the " West " as still a sort of uncultivated tract of forest and prairie , inhabited by illiterate and uncultured country-folks ! // Within ten years from the passage of the Ordinance regarding the Northwest Territory the population of that region had increased to nearly fifty thousand persons . Within thirty years it was almost a miflion . Long before the taking of the fifth census , Ohio ranked as the fourth State in the Union . In 1880 the population of the five States originally embraced in the Northwest Territory was more than eleven millions-nearly one-fourth that of the entire country . To-day it can not fall short of fourteen millions . For one hundred years the point which represents the centre of the republic has been steadily moving due westward along the thirty-ninth parallel of north latitude . Its average rate of progress has been about five miles per year . In 1800 its location was eighteen miles west of Baltimore ; in 1810 it had crossed the Potomac ; in 1820 it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1830 it had reached the highest ridge of the Appalachians ; in 1850 it had passed the mountain-barriers and was following the course of the Little Kanawha through West Virginia ; within the next ten years it had , by a rapid march of more than eighty miles , reached a point over half-way across the State of Ohio ; in 1870 it was within fifty miles of Cincinnati ; in 1880 it had entered the valley of the Miami ; in 1890 it will probably be found well within the boundaries of Indiana . That sooner or later this central point which represents the westward " course of empire " in the United States will cease to advance , or otherwise will reach a turning place , is absolutely certain . Should its progress continue for another century as during the past hundred years , it would at the end of that time be more than half-way across the State of Missouri . But this is not likely to be the case . Each succeeding census for several coming decades will doubtless show a slacking up in the rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must cease . Bearing in mind the narrow vision and the mistaken forecasts of our early legislators , it seems hazardous to conjecture with regard to future probabilities . Yet there is good reason to believe that not for many years will the nucleus of the country 's population pass beyond or even reach the Mississippi River . Indeed , it requires but little boldness of assertion to predict that within the limits of the Territory Northwest of the River Ohio-that territory so grandly provided for in the Ordinance of 1787-the westward march of the centre of population will find , for a long time , its limit . That region is no longer a barrierland on the outskirts of civilization ; it is the centre of a civilization the most progressive on the globe . It is no longer a sort of back-pasture to the original national domain ; it is one of the richest and most prosperous portions of the republic . It is no longer the Northwest , nor even the West * the States which are embraced within its limits are now the Central States of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixty millions of people are distributed , is in itself a matter of but little consequence . The central location of the States north of the Ohio affords them many natural advantages ; yet the benefits arising from these advantages would deserve no mention , did not the wealth , intelligence , and moral influence of that section of the Union harmonize with its position . Nowhere within this country has progress in material affairs been more rapid or more substantial ; nowhere have social culture and intellectual enlightenment shown a more wonderful development than has been exhibited in these States within the memory of the present generation . It is the purpose of the remaining portions of this paper to call attention to some of the causes and phenomena leading to , and attendant upon , this development . U ' THE American citizen who had crossed the Alleghanies and had hewn out for himself a farm in the woods of the great Northwest could not fail to realize in a striking sense the immensity of his country . Its possibilities were not confined between the mountains and the sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I shall continue in this paper to use the term West , as the most common designation of that section of our country . // were as broad as the continent and as numerous as the water-courses which feed the flood of the Mississippi . Its boundaries-if , indeed , there were boundarieswere not included within any visible horizon . Here there was room to grow , to expand , to feel and to know true freedom , to originate projects , and to carry them to successful issues . Influenced by impressions such as these , the Western pioneer developed a kind of self-reliant patriotism of the true old Roman type . New aspirations began to fill his breast , new ideas and opinions found lodgement in his brain . In the untrammelled freedom of the forest , and beneath the limitless skies of the Western plains , old traditions were forgotten ; the conservatism bred of years of dependence upon the mother-country became a thing of the past ; a new meaning was added to the idea of independence - the true American spirit of self-government had then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man-free not only in a political sense , but in every sense . The beaten roads and ruts of servile imitation were abandoned ; originality in thought and action became common , as a matter of both necessity and choice ; instead of a meek dependence upon the leadership of others , every man acquired a kind of hardy self-reliance and a faith in his own opinions and abilities which made him under all circumstances his own master ; the ordinary class distinctions were ignored , and the equality of men , not only before the law , but in the relationships of life , was generally not more a precept than a practical reality . For the acquisition of these qualities of character and these opinions the pioneer citizen of the Northwest was indebted to a variety of circumstances and influences . He was indebted not more to the vastness of his surroundings than to the peculiar difficulties and dangers which they presented . He was indebted not more to the great natural resources and advantages which were waiting to be developed and utilized , than to the necessities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whatever came to his hand . He was indebted not more to any of these things and circumstances than to the wise provisions embodied in the Ordinance which the Congress of 1787 had enacted for the government of the Territory of which he was a citizen . By the first Article of compact in that Ordinance he was granted the right of freedom in matters of religious opinion : " No person demeaning himself in a peaceable and orderly manner shall ever be molested on account of his mode of worship or religious sentiments . " By the second Article he was assured that no law should ever be enacted which would interfere with or affect private contracts . He was also guaranteed the right of trial by jury , the writ of habeas corpus , and the privileges of the common law-rights for which Englishmen had contended for centuries , and in the possession of which they were scarcely yet secure . These rights , it is true , were also affirmed in the Constitution of the United States , but not until after their recognition in the Ordinance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary enactments which followed , the education of the pioneer 's children was assured , and the diffusion of general intelligence was made obligatory : " Religion , morality , and knowledge being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind , schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged . " By the fourth Article the Territory , and the States which might " be formed therein , " were declared to be forever a part of the United States and subject to the laws thereof-thus assuring to the pioneer the right of national citizenship and protection , while at the same time discouraging all attempts toward independent sovereignty and an undue assumption of State rights . By the fifth Article it was provided that the States-not fewer than three nor more than five-which might be formed within the Territory should be admitted into the Union " on an equal footing with the original States in all respects whatever , " - thus encouraging on the part of the pioneer an interest in local and sectional as well as in national politics . In accordance with the provisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Indiana in 1816 , Illinois in 1818 , Michigan in 1837 , and Wisconsin in 1848 . By the sixth and last Article freedom // was assured to every inhabitant , irrespective of race or social condition : " There shall be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude in the said territory otherwise than in the punishment of crimes whereof the party shall have been duly convicted . " Through such conditions and causes  --  and moulded by their environments , natural and political  --  the men of the West became thinkers and doers of a type distinctively Western . The States of the Ohio Valley became the nursery of new and progressive ideas ; the rallying point of radical movements in politics ; the birthplace of innumerable absurd theories , wild projects , and impracticable " isms ; " but , withal , the great centre of influence whence has issued a mighty leaven shaping public thought , directing public action , and lending robust strength to the national character . IV . Th the settlement of the States north of the Ohio River there occurred a peculiar blending of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York and Pennsylvania , there came a class of hardy , industrious , enterprising immigrants who sought new homes in the West because of the grand possibilities which they believed to exist in that section . From the Carolinas and from the mountain region of Virginia there came a very different class  --  a class of poor men who , unable to obtain recognition or acquire a foothold in communities where all labor was performed by slaves , were attracted thither by the abundance of game in the forests , the cheapness of the land , and the comparative ease with which a humble livelihood might be obtained . These latter were generally content to settle among the hills in the less fertile southern portions of Ohio and Indiana . Some of them penetrated as far as to the rich plains of fllinois ; but , strange to say , instead of making their homes on the prairies , where the land was ready for and inviting cultivation , they preferred the woodland and farms which could be made productive only after the slow and laborious process of clearing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few of the better class of Virginians , and perhaps also of the Quakers from North Carolina , the pioneer squatters from the Southern States were not an enterprising nor , indeed , a well-to-do class of citizens . The impress made upon them and their ancestors by two centuries ' contact with slavery was not readily removed or forgotten . With many of them there long remained a lingering respect for the institution which had made life in the South undesirable to them ; with others there was engendered a gro ' *ing antagonism , which in the course of time developed into rank abolitionism . With scarcely an exception , these early settlers were hospitable , large-hearted-generous even to a fault : yet their aspirations were exceedingly limited , and the provision which they made for future necessities was as insignificant as their knowledge of the morrow was indefinite . They were happy in that they were contented with but little ; hence , they were opposed to innovations , and were ignorant of the true meaning of progress . They had a kind of admiration for superiority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere book-learning with a peculiar indifference amounting almost to contempt . Scrupulously honest , simpleminded , chivalric-they were withal uncouth in manners , indolent , careless of personal appearance , inclined to boastfulness . Their language was a jargon the like of which has ceased to exist , but which certain critics on the Atlantic coast still imagine to be the distinguishing trait of the " typical Hoosier . " One may perhaps find to-day in the mountains of West Virginia and Tennessee a state of society similar to that which existed forty years ago among the Southern pioneers in Indiana and Ohio ; but the Hoosier , as he is commonly represented in the popular romance , or as he is pictured in the lively imagination of his Yankee kinsman who has never seen the western slope of the Alleghanies  --  the Hoosier of pioneer days has long ago disappeared from the West . If the typical countryman of the Wabash Valley to-day differs materially // from the typical countryman of Pennsylvania or Connecticut , the odds are rather in his favor . Very many causes have contributed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pioneers from the South ; but none have had greater influence than their contact with that other element of Western societythe enterprising stock of New England extraction . Indeed , the partial fusion of these two elements , like that of the Norman and Saxon in old England , has resulted in the production of a type of manhood different from that found in either and yet possessing the nobler qualities of both . It is a fact worthy of remembrance , however , that the lines of deniarcation which once so sharply separated the Southern from the Eastern tide of immigration have not yet been wholly obliterated . A careful study of country and village life as one passes leisurely from the Lakes to the Ohio River , can not fail to reveal a gradual change in the social customs , the industrial spirit , and the political preferences of the people . Yet the leaven of enterprise introduced by the Eastern element of immigration has permeated the whole mass , and the time is not far distant when these differences will have vanished . That the pioneer from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people of the West , is a fact worthy of more than passing notice . What sort of man was this New England settler in the valley of the Maumee or of the Wabash that the weight of his example and the powers of his genius should accomplish results so important ? The story of his life has not yet been written , save in caricature by the novelist or the so-called " dialect poet . " The history of his struggles and sacrifices is paralleled only perhaps by the story of his Puritan ancestors in the early settlement of the North Atlantic States . To find materials for such a history it is unnecessary to go back more than half a century from the date of this magazine , when the tide of immigration into that section was at its height . There are men still living on the farms which they won with axe and grabbing-hoe from an almost impenetra ble forest , who will tell you of their struggles with the silent yet powerful forces of Nature in the wilderness . Poor in this world 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very necessities of existence , they had no time to cultivate things purely *esthetical or to enjoy the amenities of life . And yet , although labor with its prosaic routine claimed their entire attention , we have no reason to suppose that they lacked appreciation of the beautiful and the true , or disregarded the improvement of the intellectual faculties . They were not men of broad culture or of deep learning ; yet as a rule they were not illiterate , and they had the keenest appreciation of the value of knowledge . Their poverty was not to them a source of discouragement ; it was their birthright which they had brought with them from beyond the mountains , and it was an ever-present spur and incentive to perseverance . They had come into the wilderness knowing that they would encounter discomforts and many sore trials ; and these they met , endured , and surmounted , plucking up new courage with the appearance of each additional difficulty , and content in the hope that their children , at least , should reap rich benefits from their labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for it was not in the nature of things that men with strong arms and a worthy purpose should be defeated . The story of one of these pioneers is a fair illustration of the experience of very many . I tell it briefly and without exaggeration , in almost the exact words in which he himself related it to me . A little more than half a century ago-late in the spring of 1832-he began his clearing in the dense , almost impenetrable woods of Central Indiana . In a single small wagon he had transported his family and his household goods by a long and toilsome journey from the older settlements farther east The roads for hundreds of miles were scarcely more than paths ; over a part of the course he had been obliged to cut his own way among the trees and thick underbrush . He had invested all his money in the purchase of government land , and when he arrived at his possessions he had not // a dollar in his pocket nor , indeed , any immediate means of obtaining one . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felled trees , cut them into proper lengths , and of the round logs constructed the walls of a cabin ; he hewed rough puncheons for the floor ; he rived long boards for the roof ; he made a great fireplace of clay and sticks : within six days from the beginning , he had erected and made habitable the building which for several years to come was to be his home . Not a nail nor a brick was used in the construction of that house ; nails and bricks were luxuries which the onward march of civilization would by and by bring into that region  --  but the time had not yet come for luxuries of any sort . For weeks , during that first spring in the wilderness , the doorway of the cabin was closed simply by hanging a bedquilt loosely from the top , like a kind of rude curtain . The wolves howled around the cabin at night ; the pioneer was not disturbed by such sounds-the hunger-wolf was more to be dreaded than the gray beast which skulked in the thickets . Until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no means sure of food for the winter . He carried his grain ten miles to mill , and waited for it to be ground , in order that he might not disappoint his expectant family , eagerly waiting for the much-needed grist of corn-meal . The first twelve months were months of sore trial ; but the end of the year found him firmly established in his new home and out of the reach of want . Even in the very darkest moments , he saw in imagination the wilderness giving place to fields of yellow grain and orchards of over-laden trees ; and these thoughts gave him fresh courage and strength for further conquests . Little by little the great trees and the thick underwoods were cut down and cleared away ; every year there were new " deadenings " in the forest and broader patches of corn and wheat and flax in the openings ; herds and flocks increased and flourished in the woodland pastures without expense and without especial care ; and , sooner than he had dared hope , the pioneer began to see the realization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life were long delayed in their coming . For several years all the clothing of the family was homespun -- tow-cloth and linen , from flax raised upon the farm ; jeans and linseywoolsey , of flaxen threads interwoven with wool from the farmer 's own sheep . Nobody was idle . Wife and daughters were busy from daylight till dark , caring for the cows and the poultry and the garden , carding the wool , turning the spinning-wheel , mending garments , knitting , sewing , churning ; and , if need required , they were neither afraid nor ashamed to do a day 's work in the fields-it was all a part of the family economy . Even the small boy was a manful helper of his father , knowing quite early the meaning of labor . The farmer himself was a jackof-all-trades , and good at more than one . He manufactured his own chairs and tables ; he tanned his own leather ; he made his children 's shoes and hats ; he wove jeans and tow-cloth for his own clothing and that of his boys ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a spinning-wheel , and knew how to tinker clocks ; he built barns and houses for his neighbors ; and in the long winter evenings , by the light of the blazing fire in the great chimney , he tied brooms and taught his boys and girls how to read and cipher . Was there , even in the days of republican Rome , nobler nurture and training than that which fell to the lot of these sons and daughters ? Such bringing-up would nowadays be regarded as fraught with unendurable hardships , unrelieved by any redeeming features ; but in the West , as it had done before in other countries and communities , it produced men and women of a type that was able to influence humanity , and in a measure shape the national character . When , in time , the farm produced more grain than the family and the livestock needed for food , the farmer turned his thoughts to the best methods of disposing of the surplus . During the first few years , the nearest market was more than fifty miles distant ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days ' journey , and the entire trip , both to and from , might be accomplished in less than a week . Over roads by no means the best , a few bushels of wheat , and perhaps some vegetables or a pail of // butter , were " hauled " to that distant market . It was rather a holiday jaunt than anything more serious ; the farmers of the neighborhood usually went together in caravan style , camping by the roadside at night , and withal making a right merry time of it . The produce was exchanged for salt , and some other indispensable household commodity ; and now and then a few yards of calico or some ribbona were carried home to the good wife or the grown-up daughters . There was no hardship in all this . The long journey once or twice a year relieved the monotony of pioneer life , and  --  the markets would certainly be nearer some time . And little by little the markets did draw nearer ; and there were not only larger crops , but the price of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by actually seeing and handling it , what was the color and shape of money . One comfort after another came to lighten the labors of the household . The busy noise of the steam saw-mm , and soon the whistle of the locomotive became familiar sounds . The farmer 's boys and girls gradually discarded homespun and clothed themselves , especially on Sundays , in " store goods ; " and the farmer himself indulged more and more frequently in some inexpensive luxury of which he had long been obliged to deny himself . One after the other he put aside his weaving , and tauning , and shoemaking , and carpentering ; and finally he had nothing to do but to turn his whole attention to his farm and his stock . A neat " frame-house " was built nearer the roadside , and the old log cabin , the scene of many joys as well as sorrows , was deserted . Comfort and plenty abounded on every hand . The blessings of civilization , following in the wake of honest labor , had come at last ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them himself , but rather to win them for his children , deserved his full share of them . For had he not earned them by the sweat of his brow , by cheerful perseverance , by long and hard wrestling with poverty and the savagery of the backwoods ? But after his life of privation and toil the pioneer was not the man that he might have been had another lot been his . His health had been enfeebled by exposure to the malarial atmosphere of the woods and marshes ; his face had been bronzed by the scorching heat of many summers and wrinkled by the bitter cold of many winters ; his head had been whitened by many sad experiences , and his hand had lost its former strength and cunning . More than all this , the habits of the backwoodsman , insensibly acquired , clung to him ; he was a stranger to the modes of thought and the refinements of polished society ; his language was a mixture of localisms and inaccuracies ; he could ill adapt himself to the changed order of things which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the natural wealth of the country had brought about . Yet , as a compensation for all his losses and failures , he had this knowledge to console him : He was one of ten thousand veterans who had made conquest of a mighty empire , made its wonderful resources available , and bequeathed it-an inconceivably rich heritage  --  to coming generations . No hero of history , no warriorpatriot , had ever served his country better , or earned laurels more nobly . For what he had suffered and for what he had accomplished , he was conscious that no one ought to deny to him the lasting gratitude and remembrance which posterity owes to the nation 's benefactors . And what of the sons and daughters born and bred in the midst of the trying influences of poverty and deprived of what are popularly called " advantages and opportunities ? " It is not an uncommon thing to suppose that they were illiterate , coarse , unambitious ; that even after they had acquired competence and wealth , they retained the boorish manners of the backwoods ; that their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own neighborhood ; and that their aspirations for mental and social culture remained undefined and extremely feeble . Such suppositions , although correct in some cases , are far from correct as regards the majority of those who composedwhat may be termed the first generation of natives . The privations which had been theirs , the necessarily stern discipline under which they had been brought up , the very lack of ready-made opportunities-all tended to // foster sell-reliance , to kindle ambition , and to encourage invention and the acquisition of knowledge . Were schools established ? The slender opportunities which they offered were seized upon and made the most of . Were railways constructed ? They not only brought the markets nearer , but they destroyed the isolation of communities and made one neighborhood of the whole world . Were libraries founded ? They were eagerly patronized , and the wealth of knowledge which they contained became a source of inspiration to many a hard-working farmer 's boy . Was leisure won after years of slavish toil ? It was not unfrequently given to mental improvement and to moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Western pioneers , men have come who have stood in the foremost ranks of every department of private or public life . Scholars , teachers , inventors , statesmen , divines ,  --  the most celebrated thinkers and doers in the nation-have been among those whose lives were shaped and whose characters were moulded through these influences of poverty and stern discipline . V. WITHIN the life of a single generation the States which were originally comprised within the Territory Northwest of the River Ohio have advanced to the dignity and condition of powerful commonwealths . As regards wealth , enterprise , and future prospects , that section of our country is now the worthy rival of the older States between the Alleghanies and the Atlantic . That territory , which a century ago was regarded as the profitless back-pasture of the nation , produces annually more than one-third of all the corn , and nearly one-hall of all the wheat that is raised in the United States . The value of its farm products for a single year amounts to more than seven hundred millions of dollars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producing more than four-fifths of all the copper , nearly one-third of all the iron , and more than one-third of all the bituminous coal mined in this country . The growth of its cities has had no paralleL On the spot where sixty years ago was naught but an expanse of wild prairie , stands Chicago-doubtless to-day the third city inthe Union . Cincinnati , Cleveland , Detroit , Indianapolis , Milwaukee , and scores of other cities and towns-smaller , and yet the centres of great industries-attest the marvellous wealth and unrestrainable energies of the West . The facilities of that section for commerce by water or by land are unexcelled and unlimited . Its manufactures , already extensive and profitable , are increasing in number and importance . On every hand are the evidences of thrift and of successful enterprise . These facts and many others relative to the progress and natural resources of the West are known to every schoolboy in the land , and no comment upon them is necessary . It is the purpose of these papers to trace the social and intellectual phases of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rather than to dilate upon the unexampled material prosperity of that section . And yet no clear conception can be had of the influences through which this development has taken place without some consideration of these facts . Its geographical position-bounded , as it is , by two large rivers and the Great Lakes , and being the natural passageway through which the trade between the East and the States beyond the Mississippi must necessarily pass-this , together with the fertility of its soil , and its inexhaustible resources , is alone sufficient to mark that section as the natural and ultimate centre of the Republic . Vi A nxvm*w , in this connection , of the political history of the West would be not only interesting , but in a certain measure instructive ; and yet , save with reference to one or two subjects of national importance , such a review falls scarcely within the scope of this paper . The pioneer , from whatever part of the Union he may have come , was a patriot of the truest type ; and yet , when once he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not more a patriot than partisan . In his humble cabin on the very outskirts of civilization , he felt that // he was persunally responsible for the proper management of governmental affairs . The ballot to which he was entitled was a sacred trust of which he was bound to give a good account ; and yet , in the exercise of his rights as an American citizen , there was nothing which forbade him to consult , in any honorable way , his own personal interests-indeed , he believed that his own welfare was his country 's welfare , and cast his vote in accordance with that belief . The first disturbing element in the politics of the West-strange as it may seem-was the question of slavery . There were many of the settlers , as well from the East as from the South , who were dissatisfied with the anti-slavery clause in the Ordinance of 1787 , which declared that there should be neither slavery nor involuntary servitude within the Territory . Indeed , notwithstanding this prohibition , many of the immigrants had brought slaves with them from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up ; and as slavery was permitted at that time in nearly all the States of the Union , they could not understand why it should be prohibited in the Territory Northwest of the Ohio . Soon after the admission of the State of Ohio into the Union , the people of the remaining portion-known then as Indiana Territory-petitioned Congress for at least a temporary suspension of the anti-slavery section of the Ordinance . But the committee to which the matter was referred , and of which John Randolph of Yirginia was chairman , re*ported that it deemed it " highly inexpedient to impair a provision wisely calculated to promote the happiness and prosperity of the Northwestern country , and to give strength and security to that extensive frontier . " Notwithstanding this rebufl the people of the Territory continued to petition Congress for a suspension or abrogation of the obnoxious article  --  the fifth and last appeal , signed by Governor Harrison himself , being presented and refused in the winter of 1807 , twenty years after the adoption of the Ordinance . The final submission of the people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boundaries marks the turning point in the history of slavery in the United States . Of the later effort , in 1823 , to introduce slavery into the State of Illinois ; of the steady growth thereafter of the anti-slavery sentiment ; of the opposition to the fugitive slave law ; of the aggressive movements of the Abolitionists ; of the famous " underground railroad " from the Ohio River to Canada , it is unnecessary to speak in detail . The fact of paramount importance in this counection is that it was by and through the Ordinance of 1787 that slavery received the first blow in the conflict which finally resulted in the emancipation proclamation of 1863 ; and that although the first settlers of the Northwest Territory were made parties to this action , they are deserving of but little commendation for their original attitude toward slavery . The influence of the sixth Article of the Ordinance upon the character and acts of the people of the Northwest , and the effects of its provisions in determining the ultimate destiny of the nation itself , have scarcely yet been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , also , during the pioneer period , that what is popularly known as wild-cat banking had its origin . This has been described as an " attempt to break up an odious monopoly ' in banking by making everybody a banker , and to create prosperity by unlimited issues of paper currency . " The result was much embarrassment and financial distress  --  to many , indeed , it was bankruptcy and ruin . " But the lessons it taught , " says Judge Cooley , " needed to be learned at some time , and were not likely to be learned except with experience as a teacher . One of its lessons was that neither real estate nor anything else not immediately convertible into money can support the credit of bank currency . But for the experience of the several States in banking , in the years 1837-39 , who shall say that the national currency act , when it came to be passed , might not have been as little guarded against dangerous schemes as some of its State predeces-sors ? " A further review of the political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaffirm what has already been said regarding the traits of character // which distinguish the people of that section . We should find many things to condemn because of their corrupting influences and dangerous tendencies ; many things to condone because , although they were conceived in weakness and failed to produce the intended results , they were nevertheless prompted by worthy and patriotic motives ; many things to commend because of the noble ends which they accom plished , or the good which they are still accomplishing . But we must rest content without further specification . It is pertinent in this connection simply to call attention to the fact that at the present time no other section of the Union exerts a more powerful influence upon national politics and national legislation than do the five States which have been formed from the Territory Northwest of the River Ohio .
