L* a recent interview with the editor of the NORTH AMERIOKN REVIEW , my attention was called to the article in the November number of the " Century , " page 128 et seq. , and I was asked in the interests of history to prepare some observations upon the matters therein set forth . I said there were very serious objections to a compliance with his request ; that time and my occupations precluded the preparation of an historical article ; that the time was inopportune , on account of the recent death of the author of the " Century " article , the state of the public mind , created by sympathies his death had excited , and because of the existence of strong partisan biases and partisan interests that lived and fed upon the illusions which had been created in the past . It was urged by the editor that errors in history were pernicious , and that as soon as possible they should be eradicated ; that the REVIEW was desirous of directing its efforts to the propagation of the truth of history , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and insisted that I should make some contributions to that end . My reply was that the utmost I could do would be to signalize a few of the many errors of fact which the article contained , for the purpose of warning students of history to wait until the publication of the records of the rebellion covering that pcriod should furnish the materials for demonstration . I , furthermore , represented to him that personally I had very great objections to troubling the public with piecemeal bits of information concerning war matters , to which the editor replied that it seemed a duty which men having held high commands iu the military service owed to posterity , to contribute testimony upon obscure or mooted points while they were yet alive ; that the matters treated of in the " Century " article were comparatively little understood by the general public ; that the number of living witnesses to the events the article recounted was constantly diminishing ; and that , while waiting for the means and the oppor // tunity of a thorough history , the public ought to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally said that the true way would be to make a plain and summary statement of the facts involved , but that for lack of time to refer to reports and correspondence not yet published , I could not undertake to do it ; that the most I would do would be to submit the following obser-vations : At the outset the article states " But after the investment of Vicksburg , Bragg 's army was largely depleted to strengthen Johnston , in Mississippi . " My information , which is very positive , flatly contradicts that statement . Very few troops , if any , save cavalry , were detached from Bragg 's command in Tennessee . " I frequently wrote to General Halleek suggesting that Rosecrans should move against Bragg . By so doing he would either detain the latter 's troops , or lay Chattanooga open to capture . " This shows that the author of the " Century " article did not understand the situation . Bragg , commanding the army of the Mississippi , was in middle Tennessee ; his troops were largely Tennesseeans ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of IDuck and Elk rivers , with railway communication to Chattanooga for supplying his army . He was confronting a dangerous and powerful Union army , and had every reason for believing that he was rendering services of vital importance to the cause he represented . As the commander of the Union army facetiously remarked , like Squibob in the celebrated combat with the San Diego editor , " He was holding us down with his nose , which he had inserted between our teeth for that purpose . " Bragg 's troops were already thus being detained , and the views of the author of the " Century " article to the contrary are illusory . As to laying " Chattanooga open to capture , " subsequent events show what was required for that purpose . Had Bragg been driven across the Tennessee River , the Union army , for lack of railway transportation and forage , could not have followed him further than its banks within six weeks or two months . Meanwhile , the main body of his troops not being required to watch the crossings , Bragg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enable him to attack our besieging army at Yicksburg in the rear , or to compel it to quit its intrenchments and undertake a campaign . // Thus , what the author of the " Century " article urged to have done , instead of increasing his assurance of safety , would have drawn upon him the very forces which it was necessary to keep away . The author adds : " General ilalleck strongly approved the suggestion , and finally wrote me that he had repeatedly ordered Rosecrans to advance , but that the latter had eonstantly failed to comply with the order , and at last , after having held a council of war , replied , in effect , " etc . I never failed to comply with General Halleck 's order ; for he did not order me to advance ; nor did I ever hold a council of war , as the author states , whatever may have been written to the contrary . What the article states further on , that " iRosecrans was ordered to move against the army that was detaching troops to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no such orders were given ; second , no material bodies of troops were detached . On the 23d of June the Army of the Cumberland began its movements , and by the 4th of July occupied successively the enemy 's intrenched camps , Shelbyville and Tullahoma , eighteen miles in the rear of Shelbyville , as formidably intrenched as those of the enemy at Vicksburg ; and Bragg had retreated across the mountains and across the Tennessee River , and destroyed as far as possible the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad , along which he had retired . " I knew the peril the Army of the Cumberland was in , being depleted continually not only by ordinary casualties , but also by having to detach troops to hold its constantly extending line over which to draw supplies , while the enemy in front was as constantly being strengthened . " The student of history will note the above statement , because it signalizes one of the great difficulties which the Army of the Cumberland had subsequently to overcome ; and he will best understand the paragraphs which immediately follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Cumberland had to do after the close of the Tullahoma campaign of fifteen days just mentioned-driving Bragg across the Tennessee River . First , it had to repair the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad from Murfreesboro forward to Winchester , in order to subsist the army at that point ; second , it had to repair the same thence to Bridgeport , in order to carry forward supplies ; and third , to reach Chattanooga . The reasons for this were , that this point admitted of the use of the Nashville and Chattanooga road , the Alabama // Central road , and part of the Memphis and Charleston road and river , as lines of supply . The possession of Chattanooga would make East Tennessee untenable by the enemy , cut off his use of the coal mines in the mountains on the south side of the Tennessee , from which he was supplying his furnaces at Etowah , and open the way into the heart of the Confederacy . The obstacles to be encountered were to cross these mountain ranges , keep up the supplies of the army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the face of the opposing enemy , or deceive him as to the point of crossing . Of these difficulties which had to be overcome , the author of the article appears to have had no conception . The repairs of the Nashville and Chattanooga road , the demonstrations necessary to deceive the enemy as to the point where the Tennessee River would be crossed , the preparation of material for ponton-bridges , and the training of men to handle them , were all carried on simultaneously from the day the campaign of Tullahoma ended . On the 18th of July , the first train from Nashville crossed the Elk River bridge , bringing supplies to the army of the Cumberland at Winchester . Sheridan 's division was advanced to Stevenson and Bridgeport , covering the repairs of the railway , preventing the entire destructiou of the railroad bridge , and taking possession of the river from below Caperton 's Ferry , far above Bridgeport . The scanty equipment of the road , which was a fivefeet gauge , on which no Northern engine could be used , made the process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cumberland comparatively slow . Nor could the Army of the Cumberland undertake this movement , after it crossed the Tennessee River , with a less supply than twenty days ' rations and ammunition for two great battles . Food for the animals could not be carried , and the movement could not begin until corn was sufficiently ripe to supply it . On the 14th of August , the movement of the Army of the Cumberland began . The demonstrations planned and successfully executed were such as to force the enemy to the belief that the Army of the Cumberland would cross the Tennessee at or near Blythe 's Ferry , forty-five miles above Chattanooga ; while , in point of fact , it was determined to cross the river on ponton-bridges at Bridgeport , twenty-eight miles below Chattanooga , and at Caperton 's Ferry , ten miles below Bridgeport . The length of the ponton-bridge at the latter place was 1,254 feet , and the ponton and trestle bridge at Bridgeport 2 , 700 feet long . // The success of the operations just described for the campaign depended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point of crossing , Sheridan 's head-quarters were at Stevenson , the junction of the Nashville and Chattanooga with the Memphis and Charleston road ; Athens was occupied , and our cavalry occupied the Tennessee on the south . The railroad from Stevenson to Athens was open , and trains running upon it . The greatest quietude was observed . After they crossed the Cumberland Mountains , the troops encamped out of sight of the enemy from the cliffs of Sand Mountain on the south side of the river , and the ponton train was brought forward into Crow Creek Valley , and the pontoniers there trained in putting it up and taking it down . The river front was examined from Shell Mound downward past Sequatchee Valley to Bridgeport . Sequatchee is a deep and narrow valley separating the great mountain mass into two , Cumberland Mountain on the west , and Walden 's Ridge on the east , only three or four miles wide at most , but fertile and tolerably well settled . This was occupied by the twenty-first corps , stretching for twenty miles up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of force of all arms ; while one brigade of cavalry and one brigade of mounted infantry were to drive everything across and occupy the west bank of the Tennessee River from Chattanooga northward , each backed by a brigade of infantry , encamped displayed , on the eastern edge of Walden 's Ridge in sight of the Tennessee Valley above Chattanooga , and were to keep up the impression that our point of crossing would be about Blythe 's Ferry . The enemy 's movements demonstrated his conviction that this would be so . These were but preliminary preparations . The great problem yet to be solved was to get the enemy out of Chattanooga , and the Army of the Cumberland into possession of it , and then to maintain it in that position . I had caused the enemy to concen trate his troops at and north of Chattanooga . I knew that the moment the Army of the Cumberland crossed the Tennessee River , Buckner would leave East Tennessee and join Bragg . Chattanooga is on the east side at the north end of Lookout Range , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river , available for troops of all arms , were first , at the nose of the mountain , near Chattanooga ; second , at Johnston 's pass , twenty-six miles south of it ; and third , at Valley Head , forty-six miles south , // where a road leads down by Alpine into Broomtown Valley . To assault Chattanooga over the pass at the nose of the mountain near Chattanooga was impracticable . It was absolutely necessary to maneuver Bragg with his forces out of that position , the value of which Bragg , as well as I , knew . Snch a maneuver could be successful only by threatening his communications at some considerable distance south of Chattanooga toward Atlanta , and the threat must necessarily be a very formidable one . It was therefore determined that , upon crossing the Tennessee River , the 20th Corps should go by Caperton 's Ferry , cross Saud Mountain , ascend Wills ' Creek ( Lookout Valley ) to Valley Head , whence the cavalry should precede it into Broomtown Valley , and operate with great vigor ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slope of Lookout Mountain , to Alpine , and possibly support it by two other brigades ; that Thomas , with the 14th corps , should cross at Bridgeport over into Lookout Valley by another route , and ascend that valley in sight of the enemy on Lookout Mountain , until the head of the column should arrive at the foot of Johnston 's  |p0ss  , about four miles above Trenton ; that Crittenden 's corps , the 21st , with Reynolds ' division of Thomas 's corps , should cross-part at Shell Mound in boats , the remainder on the ponton and trestle bridge-follow Thomas 's corps a short distance up Trenton Valley , sending a division to watch the road crossing over the nose of Lookout in his rear . All these movements were arranged between the 20th and 28th . The effect of their execution was to be to compel the enemy to believe that a movement was to be made , by the way of Alpine , to strike his communications at Rome or its vicinity , and , by keeping up this belief , to induce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we should be able to concentrate our entire command there . That we should be obliged to fight a great battle for the possession of Chattanooga was beyond possible military doubt . Had this movement of the Army of the Cumberland been sustained , as it ought betimes to have been , by the concentration of the Army of the Tenneseee near Decatur , for a movement into north-eastern Alabama , or further north , so as to be within supporting distance ; had Buruside closed down on the left flauk of its movement , as was the original understanding , there might have been less certainty of its being obliged to fight such a battle for the possession // of Chattanooga . But as it was , that army , the only force which stood between the enemy and the Ohio Valley , through no fault or negligence of its commander , had been put in great and needless peril . The interests of the Confederacy were supreme in crushing it , or , at least , in defeating the object of its campaign . From its inception I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the maintenance of the Army of the Cumberland at Chattanooga , when we should get possession of it . I therefore ordered to be built , at Bridgeport , five fiat-bottom , sternwheel steamboats , to be used between there and Chattanooga in the lowest stages of water , and placed the business of constructing them in charge of Captain Edwards , an efficient quartermaster . The material for the construction of these boats was brought down , the engines ordered from the shops in the North , the first hull launched , and the second hull nearly ready to be launched between the 20th and the 28th of August , when the Army of the Cumberland began its movement across the river . Daring the ten days intervening between my arrival at Stevenson and the beginning of the movement , I had also telegraphed for the representatives of the railroad bridge building firms of Fletcher &amp; Co. , of Cleveland , and Boomer &amp; Co. , of Chicago , and contracted with them for repairing the railroad bridge across the Tennessee River at Bridgeport , to be done in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only other large railway bridge between that and Chattanooga  --  to be completed within two weeks from the time of the passage of the first freight train over the Bridgeport Bridge . The Running Water Bridge was of three spans-each span 171 feet , the center pier 110 feet high . There is nothing in the " Century " article to indicate anything of this , and yet it is a very significant part of the history of that campaign . The Army of the Cumberland began to cross the Tennessee River on the 28th of August , and the movement was continued according to the plan . Its effect , as anticipated , was to cause Bragg to evacuate Chattanooga about the 8th or 9th of September , and move slowly south . Of course , the country , the air , and everything was filled with rumors as to the enemy 's movements . As soon as Bragg 's movement was known , I directed General Thomas to ascend Johnston 's Pass to the top of Lookout Mountain , and to descend at Cooper 's Gap on the east @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the gap , which would keep up the // enemy 's belief that we meant to cut his communications with Atlanta , and prevent him retracing his steps , which , upon the contrary belief , he would promptly have done , into Chattanooga . While Thomas was thus ordered to move over Lookout , at Johnston 's and Cooper 's Gaps , the twenty-first corps , under General T. L. Crittenden , instead of waiting to follow Thomas , was ordered to follow the road over the nose of the mountain into Chattanooga , taking with him the reserve artillery , leave it there in charge of a brigade , move out on the enemy 's lines of withdrawal south , and ascertain his movements . On the 9th it was found that the enemy was retiring slowly and in force , toward Lafayette , and later , on the 10th or 11th , it was found that he was concentrating at that point . What grounds there were for the popular impression which had been so assiduously fostered in certain quarters , that we had possession of Chattanooga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand what kind of possession that was . As Lafayette was only thirty miles from Chattanooga , and we had to concentrate between the enemy and that place , the space was very limited . Thomas 's corps was on the flank of that interspace , on the north side of the South Chickamanga , and Crittenden , who had moved out on the roads to the east of Thomas 's position , was ordered to move , with all possible secrecy and dispatch , westward to supporting distance of Thomas . At the same time the twentieth corps ( McCook 's ) was ordered to move with all possible celerity from its position on the eastern slope of Lookout , near Alpine , to which , without orders , it had been moved from Valley Head , and to join Thomas . Meanwhile , on the 14th , we learned that Longstreet had arrived at Atlanta with his corps from Lee 's army , and was to join in the fight . Fully aware of the perils of the situation , I had ordered up General Granger to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go immediately to Chattanooga with Steadman 's division and MeCook 's and Spear 's brigades . The suspense while these orders were being carried was fearful ; but finally , on the morning of the 18th , the head of MeCook 's column arrived at the top of Cooper 's Gap , and under cover of a strong picket line along the South Chickamauga , the movement of Crittenden 's and Thomas 's corps began to the north-eastward , to get on the roads leading through ilossyille , between the enemy and Chattanooga . Four hours of precious time were lost by the delay of // General ilazen , who , until he received orders through the regular channel , declined to be relieved by General Negly 's division sent for the purpose of enabling him to join his division commander . These two corps moved all the night of the 18th by a line of fires built through the woods ; and by daylight of the 19th , General Thomas with his corps was planted across the Gordon 's Mills and Rossville road to Chattanooga . Thus , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that just mentioned , though concentrated between the enemy and Chattanooga , our toil-worn troops , unable to choose our own battle-ground , were obliged to begin the battle of the 19th and 20th of September , 1863 , for the possession of that place , knowing that they alone stood between a powerful , veteran army and the Ohio River . In the light of all this the reader will be able to understand what is to be thought of the statement in the " Century " article , beginning , " Soon it was discovered in Washington that Rosecrans was in trouble and required assistance , " and with whom must rest the terrible responsibility that the troops of the Army of the Tennessee , anxious to come to our aid-which ought to have come up six weeks before , as the " Century " article says-did not in fact get orders to move until the 23d of September , two days after the battle of Chickamauga had given us beyond peradventure the possession of Chattanooga . It will also appear what weight should attach to the remark that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Tennessee , through and beyond Chattanooga . " Bragg was not maneuvered south of the Tennessee River , and through Chattanooga , during the campaign . He had been there for two months . Ever since the campaign of Tullahoma drove him out of middle Tennessee ho had occupied that side of the river . It will appear also what is to be thought of the statement , " if he ( IRosecrans ) had stopped and intrenched , and made himself strong there , " etc . The writer of the " Century " article , after all these years , and with all his military ideas , does not seem to comprehend the situation , nor the utter error of saying that " He pushed on , with his forces very much scattered , until Bragg 's troops from Mississippi began to join him , then Bragg took the initiative . Roseerans had to fall back in turn , and was able to get his army together at Chickamauga , " etc. // In the light of all the foregoing facts , that we fought the enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our own choosing , and offered him battle on the 21st , at iRossyille , only three miles from our position on those days , and took possession of Chattanooga on the following night , what is to be thought of the statement that " Rosecrans was badly defeated , with a heavy loss in artillery , and some sixteen thousand men killed , wounded , and captured . The corps under Majorgeneral Eleorge II . Thomas stood its ground , while Rosecrans , with Crittenden and McCook , returned to Chattanooga ? " In the light of ample documentary evidence , with which the writer certainly had abundant opportunity to become acquainted , this statement can be regarded in no other way than as a bold untruth . The order of battle of the 20th is in writing ; the official reports amply testify that I had reinforced Thomas 's corps by Johnston 's Division of McCook*s , the 20th , and Palmer 's Division of the 21st , on the day before ; that all the remaining troops on the field , save two brigades of Jeff C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by my order , with General Thomas before one o'clock of the afternoon of the 20th ; that General Thomas had repeated orders from me to hold his position at all hazards ; that having made various orders to meet actual and possible exigencies , which I sent by Garfield to explain to him , in the afternoon , near the close of the fight , I sent one to him which he received about five o'clock , while awaiting an impending attack of the enemy ; that those orders were that he should use his discretion as to whether we should hold the ground which we would occupy , and have ammunition and everything else brought there , or to retire to Rossville ; that he exercised that discretion , and ordered the troops back to that position ; that I approved of his movements , directed him to dispose of the troops , to receive the enemy 's attack , in case he dared to make one , at that point , and ordered up troops and ammunition accordingly ; that the Army of the Cumberland waited there all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he declined ; and that having laid out the lines , and made necessary dispositions for the definite and continued occupation of Chattanooga , I withdrew the army from its position at Rossville , during the night of the 21st , and took possession of the lines at Chattanooga . Thus the Army of the Cumberland , beginning to move from // Winchester on the 14th of August , had crossed the Cumberland Mountains , the Tennessee  --  a wide and formidable river-the Sand Mountain , and Lookout Ranges , carrying from Bridgeport twenty days ' rations and ammunition sufficient to fight two great battles , fought a great battle , and took and held possession of Chattanooga , seventy-six miles distant from the point of departure-fourteen miles farther than from Fredericksburg to Richmond-in a campaign of thirty-eight days . Though obliged to fight the inevitable battle for that purpose on ground of the enemy 's choosing , we defeated his attempt to crash us , and held the objective points of the campaign at a cost of men and material which the country would have willingly paid for its possession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true soldier could overlook or fail to appreciate the merits of a campaign which in thirty-eight days overcame such obstacles , and from the jaws of such peril snatched and held a strategic position so valuable . Why then did the author of the " Century " . article fail to do so ? The next thing after getting Chattanooga was to keep it . The preliminary preparations for supplying the Army of the Cumberland at that point , made before crossing the river , have been already stated-contracts for rebuilding the Bridgeport and Running Water Railway bridges , to be finished within six weeks , and the construction of five flat-bottom , stern-wheel steamers , for navigating the river between Bridgeport and Chattanooga . Now , on the 21st of September , having possession of Chattanooga , the first thing was to construct and occupy suitable and defensive lines for the army . That the intelligent reader may form some idea of what it was and how this was done , let him examine a map of Chattanooga and its vicinity , and he will see that the town is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bend of the Tennessee River , which bounds it on the north , where the river runs east and west , and on the west , where it runs in a course nearly south for about three miles and a half , to a bend where it breaks through a gorge between Lookout Mountain and the southern extremity of Walden 's Ridge , whence it takes a north-westerly direction until the mass of Raccoon Mountain drives it nearly northerly for a distance of several miles . The Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad runs from the town south-westerly , until it strikes the // east end of this big bend , and then , turning , follows the bank of the river , under high precipitous cliffs , for about a mile , where it emerges into the Valley of Lookout , or Wills ' Creek ; the*'ce it passes westerly through a gap between Raccoon Mountain on the north and Sand Mountain on the south , and from there to Bridgeport , a total distance of about twenty-eight miles . About two miles south of the town is Chattanooga Creek , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , deep channel in the alluvium , and running into the Tennessee River near the south-western side of the great bend just described . Artillery and infantry can not pass it without bridging . Three miles east of the town are foot-bills belonging to Missionary Ridge , a mountain mass , some six hundred or eight hundred feet high , running nearly north and south , and overlooking it at a distance of about four miles from the town . At the southerly end of this mass is the town of Rossville , in a low gap , the gate-way to this plane , which the Army of the Cumberland held on the 21st of September . I very much desired to extend my line south of Chattanooga Creek , to cover the railway line and wagon road across the pass over the north end of Lookout Mountain , but found that to do this would so expose my right , that , in case of a serious attack at that point , I might be obliged to withdraw my command from Chattanooga to defend it , and thus practically be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lookout Valley . This was not to be thought of . I therefore adopted such lines as I could occupy , and defend beyond peradventure , leaving the end of Lookout temporarily to be taken possession of by the enemy . But to prevent that enemy from being able to pass over it into Lookout Valley with artillery and wagons , in large force , and to impede any passage , except by stealth , across the nose of the mountain , I placed batteries on Moccasin Point , on the north side of the river opposite the nose of Lookout , so as to command the passage along the railway under the cliffs , and also greatly impede the use of the wagon road over the slopes above . Bridge connection with the north side of the river , so as to communicate at once with Bridgeport on that side , was immediately to be made . For that purpose , for many reasons , two pouton-bridges were to be built forthwith . Orders were given to the chiefs of the Pioneer Corps to have all the pontoon-trains that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also sought wherever they could be found in Chattanooga , to complete these structures . Lumber was so scarce that houses had to be torn down , and the saw-mill of which the " Century * article speaks was put in order , and Colonel Stanley , of the 18th Ohio , was charged with preparing boats , balks , and chesses , with all possible dispatch , so , that the wagon trains could at once go and come between our positions and Bridgeport by way of Jasper , in Sequatchee Valley , over Walden 's Ridge , a distance of about forty-six miles , and bring supplies to the army . Our cavalry and mounted infantry were posted along the west side of the Tennessee River , above Chattanooga , to cover from the enemy 's operations this line of communication over the mountain . The remaining portion of the Pioneer Corps was ordered to take care of the bridge at Bridgeport . Two brigades of cavalry were detailed to occupy the country south of it , to prevent incursions on our hues of supplies , and depots at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Missionary Ridge and the foothills in front of our lines , established a force on the south side of Chattanooga Creek , commanding the road over the nose of Lookout , sent troops to Summertown up on its top , planted some batteries on the northerly slope of Lookout , opposite Moccasin Point , and sent five or six regiments over into Lookout Valley to watch the west bank of that portion of the river from the railway down to far below Brown 's Ferry , which at once put a stop on attempts to repair the Nashville and Chattanooga Railway between our position and Bridgeport , until they could be driven from Lookout . General Halleck notified me on the 21st that Hooker , with the 11th and 12th Corps , Army of the Potomac ( Howard and Slocum ) , had been ordered to reinforce us , and would soon be on their way . In a few days the first ponton-bridge was completed , the river above guarded and watched to prevent attempts to break it , and the second followed as rapidly as material for it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having temporarily deprived us of the use of the road on the south side of the river , and the repairing of the railway bridges , as the contracts required , he massed his cavalry seventy miles north of Chattanooga , in the neighborhood of the mouth of the Hiwassee , under General Wheeler , who , with three divisions , forced his passage at ten // different places , driving our cavalry , only two brigades , under Crook . The object of the enemy 's movements was to cross Walden 's Ridge , the Sequatchee Valley , the Cumberland Mountains , and to strike and destroy the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad , known to be our only line of supplies . Order was promptly given to General Crook to hang on the flank and rear of the enemy 's column , and fight and delay him to the utmost . Colonel Ed . MeCook was ordered to march with the two brigades which had been watching the river below Bridgeport , to join Crook . They were then both to follow the enemy and hang upon his flank and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Louisville , was ordered to post his infantry so as to protect Duck and Elk River and other important railway bridges and trestle-works , and our depots at Stevenson and Bridgeport , with his main body at Stevenson . Neither time nor space admits of detailing the operations of this formidable and dangerous raid on our communications-it would be aside from the purpose of these observations . Suffice it to say , that the Union cavalry , faithful to its orders , harassed and kept Wheeler 's column in motion , and Hooker 's movements preserved the railway almost intact . Crook overtook the enemy at Lexington , Tenn. , fifteen miles south of Shelbyville , and defeated him , captured his cannon , and drove him pell-mell south of the Tennessee River at various points between Florence and Decatur . During Wheeler 's raid the only serious damage he did us was on his way across to McMinnville . In Sequatchee he found a train of one hundred wagons , which he destroyed before Colonel Ed . MeCook 's column reached the spot , where La Grange charged and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as this raid came to its inglorious end , Hooker closed down his troops by rail to Bridgeport and Stevenson . The capacity of the railway being already overtaxed , his trains were ordered to come down by the wagon road . For the first ten or fifteen days after we occupied Chattanooga , the mountain road north of the river was in good condition . There was a cut around the face of the cliffs of Walden 's Ridge which the wagons could follow , and our supplies came to us without difficulty . As soon as the enemy 's troops in Lookout Valley found that we were using this short cut , they posted sharp-shooters with long-range rifles on the west side of the river to fire across and in- // terrupt the movements of trains . This gave us very serious difficulty , and greatly impeded the use of the road . Along about the end of the first week of October rains set in , the roads grew worse , and the difficulty of bringing supplies by wagon greatly increased . In the midst of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy to get ready the pontons and materials for a third ponton-bridge , which was indispensable for securing and holding control of the south side of the river from Bridgeport to Chattanooga . Hooker was advised that as soon as his wagon trains could be ready to move he would be ordered to cross the river at Bridgeport and follow the line of the road up to the vicinity of Wanhatchee . He was to be put in connection with the rest of the army by a ponton-bridge across the Tennessee River at or near Brown 's Ferry , so that , in case the enemy should attempt to crush him , there would be no difficulty in receiving support from us by the short route across the neck of land between Chattanooga and Brown 's Ferry . The great difficulty was to obtain material for this third ponton-bridge . Colonel Stanley , of the 18th Ohio , who with two regiments had been employed from the beginning in getting out the necessary materials for the two bridges , was now getting the materials for this third bridge . So urgent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and almost daily visited the work . Colonel Stanley was running the saw-mill to cut out what materials we had , and searching among the houses for more . While completing the first two bridges , General William F. Smith arrived and was assigned to duty as Chief Engineer of the Army of the Cumberland . He was told what the plan was for opening communication with Bridgeport on the south side of the river , and what preparations were in progress for its execution ; and , moreover , that upon the arrival of the troops then on their way I intended to drive the enemy from Missionary Ridge . I requested him to examine the river above Chattanooga , with a view of ascertaining its capabilities and adaptation for a movement on the enemy 's right , at the north end of Missionary Ridge . A sketch was made of the river and route to Brown 's Ferry , the route by which troops would be able to communicate from the Chattanooga side of the river with Lookout Valley , over the ponton-bridge , which we were straining every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General // Thomas and General Th . L. Coulton , and a copy of the sketch was sent to General Hooker , who was told to hurry up his transportation as rapidly as possible , so that on crossing the Tennessee River he would be able to subsist his troops directly from Bridgeport . On the 19th of October , General W. F. Smith accompanied me in a ride along this route and the Tennessee near Brown 's Ferry . We returned about sunset , when I found the telegrams awaiting me which released me from the command of the Army of the Cumberland and placed General Thomas in command . These facts will show the reader what is to be thought of the statements and implications contained in the " Century " article respecting the likelihood of my evacuating Chattanooga . That calumny never had the slightest foundation in fact , and that it should have found its way , after all these years , again to the public through such a source , is all the more strange and nexcusable . The author goes on to give the pitiable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a date which he does not state , but leaves the implication that it was at the time of his arrival at Chattanooga . I affirm that when I left it , on the 20th of October , the Army of the Cumberland was in no such condition as the author of the " Century " article represents , as to supplies , rations , or fuel . Cameron Hill was covered with woods ; the whole north side of the river was wooded . Teams were hauling and delivering rations ; although the time of making the trips was lengthened , and the loads they could haul were diminished , still they were hauling . Doubtless the animals were thin , because forage was scarce . No longer ago than the 4th of November , I conversed with Colonel G. C. Kniffin , then Chief Commissary of the Army , than whom no more able or truthful officer lives , and who had the best possible opportunity of knowing the facts , and he fully concurs with me in this statement . The author of the " Century " article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " hold Chattanooga at all hazards , " informing him at the same time that " I the writer of the Century ' article would be at the front as soon as possible . " I well remember the receipt of that telegram , and the surprise and indignation with which Thomas and I viewed it . We regarded it as an aspersion on the Army of the Cumberland and its commander , founded either in ignorance or malice . We had as little idea of // abandoning Chattanooga as anybody in the world . The author says : " A prompt reply was received from Thomas , saying . We will hold the town till we starve . ' I appreciated the force of this dispatch later , when I witnessed the condition of affairs which prompted it . " The author of the " Century " article does not give the full dispatch , which was : " Our trains are hauling rations from Bridgeport , and we will hold the town until we starve . " The author says further : " On the morning of the 21st @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Alabama , after dark . Rosecrans was there on his way North . He came into my car , and we held a brief interview , in which he described very clearly the situation at Chattanooga , and made some excellent suggestions as to what should be done , " etc . The suggestions to which the author alludes were a detail of the plan , already explained , for establishing communication between the army at Chattanooga and Hooker 's troops , on the south side of the river , which were to be brought up by the way of Wanhatchee to Lookout Valley . Doubtless they were " excellent suggestions , " for they were precisely the ones which the author of the " Century " article followed . Yet he says , " My only wonder was that he had not carried them out . " I think the intelligent reader will wonder whether it was stupidity or malice which dictated this foolish expression , and will himself feel no wonder that as yet they had not been carried out . Every effort had been made to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrival in Chattanooga , the author says : " During the evening , most of the general officers called in to pay their respects , and to talk about the conditiofi of affairs . They pointed out on the maps the line marked with a red or blue pencil , which Rosecrans had contemplated falling back upon . " Poor man ! no officer of the Army of the Cumberland ever told him that I contemplated falling back . The line , if any , which was pointed out to him , was the line of communication by way of Brown 's Ferry , to be established between the troops in Chattanooga and the troops to come into Lookout Valley , which , as heretofore stated , was part of the plan for controlling the communication on the south side of the river , between Bridgeport // and Chattanooga , and had no reference whatever to a line of retreat . The author states that " I found that he ( General W. F. Smith ) had established a saw-mill on the banks of the river , by utilizing an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will understand who established the sawmill long before General Smith 's arrival , and wonder why the author of the " Century " article makes the statement in that way . He says , in addition to this , that General Smith had under way " a steamer for plying between Chattanooga and Bridgeport . " That was probably one of the five steamers which I bad ordered to be built before I crossed the river . The author of that article says , " That night ( the 24th of October ) I issued orders for opening the route to Bridgeport . " All the preliminaries for these orders have already been described . They had been detailed to him by me at Stevenson , and the reader will appreciate at its proper worth a statement which fails to take any notice of all this , and gives to the public the impression that it was his genius which conceived the plan . No intelligent reader can fail to see that the intention of the writer of the " Century " article is to have it pass for history that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened the route from Chattanooga to Bridgeport , on the south side of the river . This fraud , this lie , has been floating before the public for twenty odd years ; but it is explicitly nailed to the pillory by the opening paragraph of General Thomas 's official report of the operations , wherein he says , " In pursuance of the plan of General Rosecrans , the execution of which had been deferred until Hooker 's transportation could be got , " etc. , and then follows a description of his operations . This noble and chivalrous testimonial by General Thomas was placed on record on the books of the Army of the Cumberland , wherein was written the report made by the author of the " Century " article , in which he said that he did it . But this statement by General Thomas won for him the undying dislike of the author of the " Century " article . Further , the article says : C* General Halleck had , long before my coming into this new field , ordered parts of the 11th and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hooker in command of the whole , from the Army of the Potomac , to reinforce Rosecrans . It would have been folly to have sent them to Chattanooga // to help eat up the few rations left there . They were consequently left on the railroad , where supplies could be brought them . Before my arrival , Thomas ordered their concentration at Bridgeport . " I have already stated what were Hooker 's orders and advices ; and now and here I state that the movement of Hooker , the occupation of Lookout Valley and its connection with the troops at Chattanooga , for which the writer of the " Century " article claims such credit , would have taken place all the same had he never lived . Some of the chief witnesses are dead , but many are living ; and the records of the war , when published , will amply demonstrate these facts . I have said enough concerning this article in the " Century " to warn readers and students of the military history of the war that the article abounds in inaccurate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which any unbiased critic could readily make of the proofs that the author of the " Century " article misstated facts to gratify dislikes of others and to glorify himself , my affection for Thomas will not allow me to close these notes without calling attention to the statement on page 137 of that article " On the 7th , before Longstreet could possibly have reached Knoxville , I ordered Thomas peremptorily to attack the enemy 's right so as to force the return of the troops that had gone up the valley . I directed him to take mules , officers ' horses , or animals wherever he could get them , to move the necessary artillery . But he persisted in the declaration that he could not move a single piece of artillery , and could not see how he could possibly comply with the order . " To the casual reader this unquestionably means a reproach upon General Thomas , and upon it I ask the following questions If the execution of that order were possible , and General Thomas failed to obey , why did not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and put some one in command who would execute it ? If it were not possible , why did he give the order , and why does he now bring the matter before the public ? If Thomas was right , then the order was wrong , and the giver of it ought to have frankly said so . All the statements of his subsequent operations up to the battle of Missionary Ridge are made with a view of showing what Badeau 's calumnious and untruthful life of the author of that article pretends ; namely , that the battle of Missionary Ridge was fought as // it was planned . Neither documentary evidence nor the recollec* tion of living witnesses sustains that view . There are thousands who know and assert that the breaking of the enemy 's center was neither ordered nor foreseen . On page 140 of the " Century " article , the author of that article makes an ambiguous statement that might readily be interpreted as a reflection upon Thomas : " Thomas having done on the 23d what was expected of him on the 24th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except to strengthen his position . " This , without further remark , is open to the inference that t*cncral Thomas acted out of time , while in fact he did more than was expected , and did it well . The principles and habits of a long life with me have been against the obtrusion of personal views upon public attention ; but truth and justice require that , upon historical events especially within my cognizance , I should not in silence permit insatiable and conscienceless egotism , under the shadow of a great name , to masquerade as the muse of history .
