txt The unemployed workmen held another meeting at the Sand Lots this afternoon , and were addressed by Mayor Kalloch . He told them that while their grievances were real , and their talk for the most part sensible , yet the continuance of such gatherings only afforded opportunity for the utterance of ili-timer expressions , likely to I retard rather than advance the objects in view ; that a judicious committee would be appointed , with which he would freely confer and to which he would report progress , if any were made , in the way of relief , and that in the meantime the meetings would be dispensed with , subject to the call of the committee . This was satisfactory to the crowd , and no more meetings will be held for the present . The Bulletin , published a card from ' Mayor Kalloch this afternoon , in which , after justifying his own course as for the peace , safety , and the best interests of the city , he accounts for the present excitement on the ground of misrepresentations and misunderstandings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Health declared Chinatown a nuisance , the cry was raised that there would be slaughter and bloodshed . As a matter of fact , the working men were satisfied with the action of the Board of Health and would see it properly carried out ? but the cry of " Vigilance Committee " had been raised , and the Sand Lots had angrily responded , and the city was thus thrown into needless agitation . He had urged the action of the Board of Health for one reason , that it would take the Chinese question out of the bends of the Sand Lot agitators and give it to an organization in whose conservative character the community would have confidence . The only danger to the city was from busy and willful misrepresentation , and for this he held the Chinese Six Companies and the Chronicle mainly responsible . After some reference to personal matters , he closed by saving that neither his own utterances nor those of Kearney or of speakers on the Sand Lot were to be understood as the voice of the Working Men 's Party , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union , and emphasized by the Board of Ward Presidents . The Post also publishes a. card from the Mayor , in which he disclaims the idea that the present agitation is of a Socialistic or Communistic character , except , perhaus , in the case of a few persons  --  certainly not as regards himself and an overwhelming majority of the Working Men 's Party . To-day the agitation has been removed from this city to the Assembly Chamber at Sacramento , where it has assumed a serio-comic aspect . Since his return from the Bast Denis Kearney has been making himself very officious about the Legislature , log-rolling , ( Fee . inside the bar . This led to a motion yesterday , evidently aimed at Kearney , to exclude all but privileged persons from the floor of the Assembly . After the adjournment , Kearney approached Mr. Adams , of Sonoma , in the House and used threatening language toward him on account of his action on the motion . To-day , Mr. Tyler of Alameda , offered a resolution to exclude Kearney from ' the Assembly Chamber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , &c.,; under the control of the Assembly . The resolution was referred to a special committee , which , after hearing the evidence , decided to report that Kearney hail been guilty of an attempt to intimidate Mr. Adams . Resides this , there was a very lively passage in the Assembly to-day over another matter . A few days ago , Mr. Kingman , a member of the Assembly from San Francisco . telegraphed to Kearney : " We hear you are erecting a gallows on the Sand Lots . There is more need of erecting a gallows in Sacramento . Come up immediately , and bring some hemp . " The telegram found its way into some of the papers to-day , and a resolution to inquire into the matter was introduced . A lively discussion ensued . during which Mr. Braunbart , ( Working Man , ) from San Francisco , flatly refused to obey the order of the Speaker to sit down . He was brought to the bar of the House and suspended for three days . Subsequently , when the Kearney question came up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to vote , but tho Speaker ordered him to be removed as an intruder .
