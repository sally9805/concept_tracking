rank , on either side of that contest , to say that McClellan was actuated by a pure sense of duty , and not by political ambition , when he tendered his sword to the Government of the United States . He had been educated in its military service ; and he had so learned of its political institutions that every conviction of his intellect and every feeling of his heart bound him to the preservation of the Union . He had had , at a very early age , great opportunities for acquiring military knowledge in the war with Mexico . He had been afterward sent , at the expense of the Government , while in the flower of his youth , to increase that knowledge by personal observation of one of the most gigantic wars of modern Europe . The facilities which he there enjoyed , along with colleagues who were much his seniors in age and military rank , had enabled him to accumulate a fund of professional information which was even more extensive than it could have been if he had held a command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under our own great captain , Scott , he had seen the teachings of his education confirmed-that war is a science . In the Crimea he had seen that science applied on the grandest scale , and in the most exact methods , by the armies of three nations . He had afterward been engaged in employments that gave him an uncommon familiarity with the geographical features , the resources , and the peculiarities of vast regions of our own country . So that , when our national conflict was culminating to a territorial civil war and a struggle for the supremacy of our national Constitution , he did not feel himself at liberty to withhold from the service of his country any part of that wealth of experience and knowledge which his country had enabled him to have . It was a simple case of paying back a debt ; and , from the time when he undertook to discharge it to the moment when he was summarily retired into complete inactivity and intended disgrace , he never did an act , nor uttered a word , nor wrote a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty , or that any man can justly impute to a selfish motive . Probably in all military history there is no sudden and unexplained removal of a commander , who was on the eve of a wellplanned movement against the enemy , which furnishes a parallel to this case of General McClellan . Certainly there is none for which it is so difficult to assign a respectable motive . On the 7th of November , when McClellan is about to divide Lee 's army , an order suddenly reaches him , requiring him to turn over the command to a general whom neither the army nor the public had rea // son to regard , and who did not regard himself , as competent to the position , and to go into a disgraced retirement . So extraordinary an act demands investigation . It is one of the unsolved points in the history of the late war , on which the inqnirer must enter with the expectation of finding either an adequate or an inadequate reason for the act . We have for many years been seeking and digesting information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write upon it , the first thing that occurred to us was the necessity for knowing whether the subject of General McClellan 's removal was laid by Mr. Lincoln before his Cabinet , at any time previous to the issuing of the order , and whether any and what determination was then announced by the President . In order to ascertain this we recently addressed a note to the only surviving member of Mr. Lincoln 's Cabinet , and received from him the following reply : WASHINGTON , January 21 , 1880 . Mx DEAR SIR : I have yours of the 19th , asking if the removal of McClellan from command was discussed in the Cabinet before the order was given , and in reply I have to inform you that it was . The meeting was attended by Halleck , and it was stated by him that the excuses given by McClellan for not moving were untrue . I recollect particularly that in reference to a supply , I think , of shoes , which . General McClellan had written were indispensable and had not been received , Halleck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that McClellan had not stated the truth . I opposed the removal violently , upon the ground that Hooker , who was the person spoken of for the succession , was entirely incompetent for the position . Burnside 's name was not mentioned , and I was utterly amazed when I saw it announced . I had to accept as true the statement that McClellan had been making unnecessary delay , although , as it turned out afterward , the charge was wholly unfounded . Governor Curtin was in McClellan 's camp at the time , and afterward stated that it was true that McClellan had not the shoes required for his men to move . Mr. Lincoln did not decide at that time to remove McClellan , but I saw that he was coming to that conclusion , and I went out to Silver Spring for my father to go that night to the Soldiers ' Home , where Mr. Lincoln was then staying , to endeavor to prevent the removal . He accordingly went that night to see Mr. Lincoln , and spent a long time in arguing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both a military and political blunder for him to take that step ; that the opposition to McClellan came from Chase and Stanton , who were hostile to him ( Lincoln ) , and that the man whom they wanted to supersede McClellan with would be also adverse to him if he succeeded ; and , if he failed , he ( Lincoln ) , would have to bear the reproach of it . // Lincoln listened with attention to all my father had to say , but was not communicative himself . But at the end of the conference he rose up and stretched his long arms almost to the ceiling above him , saying : " I said I would remove him if he let Lee 's army get away from him , and I must do so . He has got the slows , ' Mr. Bair ! " It was manifest to me that there was something more than I knew of , of which McClellan 's opponents were availing themselves against him . I had stood by McClellan as I did by Grant against the attempts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their efforts to overslaugh them , without being in the confidence of either of these generals . I did not know till McClellan visited me , while attending the Porter trial the winter afterward , and read me his Harrison 's Landing letter , what it was that made Lincoln so deaf to my own and my father 's efforts . But , when McClellan read that letter , I told him at once that it was that letter which had enabled Stanton and Chase to remove him . It had been used to make Lincoln look upon him as a rival , and he had judged him from that point of view ; and while I believed Lincoln to be as unselfish as any man , he was yet a man , and no man could be told day by day that another was making use of the place he gave him to supersede him in his own place , without being afterward against him and ready to believe that he was both unfriendly and unfit for his position . Yours truly , *ONTGOMERy BLAIR . GEORGE T. CURTIs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Mr. Blair alludes was held on the 5th of November . The order requiring General McClellan to turn over the command to General Burnside was dated on the same day . No reason for it was ever assigned by the President to General McClellan or to the country . In the absence , therefore , of any avowed reason , coming from Mr. Lincoln himself , we are remitted to the inquiry , what relation the Harrison 's Landing letter may have borne to the determination of the President to recall McClellan after the battle of Antietam , and to reduce him to a condition of entire inactivity . We must ask the reader to turn back to the letter , in our first article , and to note that it proposed to Mr. Lincoln a certain policy in the prosecution of the war , to be adopted and followed out by him , and from which , if any credit or benefit of a political nature was to accrue to any one , it would accrue to Mr. Lincoln . For it is not to be forgotten that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known ; and , if Mr. Lincoln had shown it to any persons in Washington , they had kept the secret well among themselves . This remained the condition of things , as to the letter , until long after McClellan 's removal from the command . Our readers have seen that one very striking feature of the // policy which General McClellan suggested to Mr. Lincoln consisted in a mode in which the emancipation of slaves could be properly made to result from military measures and operations . It was not the same plan that Mr. Lincoln suddenly adopted nearly three months after he received General McClellan 's letter , and five days after General McClellan had gained the battle of Antietam . General McClellan 's plan proposed that the Government should permanently appropriate slave-property to its own use , recognizing the right of the owner to compensation  --  a principle which he suggested might be extended , upon grounds of military necessity and security , to all the slaves in a particular State , thus working manumission in such State . " Mr. Lincoln 's subsequent plan attempted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to compensation . It is not necessary to consider here which of these two plans was the wisest , or the most practical . We are not dealing with the merits of either of them ; but we are dealing with the historical fact that , in the month of July , 1862 , General McClellan , in a private letter to Mr. Lincoln , proposed for his adoption a comprehensive policy in the prosecution of the war , one important part of which embraced a mode of effecting the extinguishment of slavery as a legitimate measure of war . While General McClellan remained at Harrison 's Landing , and afterward , while he had as yet gained no striking successes excepting that he had saved the Army of the Potomac from destruction , after which he had been put into a kind of disgrace , his Harrison 's Landing letter , still an entirely private document in the hands of Mr. Lincoln , could not have been regarded as a matter for any political anxiety . But when he had saved Washington from capture , and had defeated Lee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written three months previously , was suddenly recalled to the recollection of Mr. Lincoln and those of his Cabinet who had seen it , they must have especially remembered his suggestion of a plan for the manumission of slaves , as a measure of military operations and necessities . We now come , therefore , to a theory which has been suggested to account for the removal of General McClellan from command after the battle of Antietam . This theory , when fully stated , is as follows : That , with this letter from General McClellan in his possession , Mr. Lincoln was persuaded to believe that , if the writer should succeed in destroying Lee 's army , he would become a formidable rival for the next Presidency ; that this letter would be McClellan 's " platform " ; that his platform must therefore be anticipated // by an Executive proclamation that slavery was to be exterminated by an Executive decree ; that circumstances had compelled Mr. Lincoln , after Pope 's defeat , to restore McClellan to command , and to permit him to free Maryland from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this had been done , it was politically necessary to prevent McClellan from becoming , by further successes , a competitor in the next Presidential election , and a competitor who would be able to show a prior claim to the policy of emancipation . This theory derives some color from the fact that Mr. Lincoln suddenly changed his mind on the subject of emancipation . On the 13th of September he told a deputation of clergymen from Chicago that an emancipation proclamation would be no more effective than " the Pope 's bull against the comet " ; but on the 22d of September , after McClellan had gained the battle of Antietam , Mr. Lincoln issued a proclamation announcing that on the first of the succeeding January he should issue another abolishing slavery in every State that adhered to the rebellion . The theory or explanation of General McClellan 's removal from the command of the army , at a moment when he was on the very eve of a great success , is that the Harrison 's Landing letter was the moving cause . But , if this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Lincoln made an enormous mistake in regard to the character and purpose of the Harrison 's Landing letter , and the character and purpose of the writer . Through every line of that letter there breathes a manifest intention to present to Mr. Lincoln 's mind a comprehensive policy in the prosecution of the war , which Mr. Lincoln was , if he should adopt it , to appropriate to himself ; which was to redound to Mr. Lincoln 's benefit , so far as it could redound to the personal benefit of any one . There is not a word in the letter which can justify any one in believing that the writer was seeking to lay up political treasure for himself , in the archives of the Government , or in Mr. Lincoln 's private repositories . Among gentlemen , it is usually considered an act of meanness to claim afterward the authorship of a paper which one has given to another who is in a high position of public trust , for adoption as a measure of public policy ; and no man , who ever knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to commit such an act of meanness . his letter was the letter of one gentleman to another . The writer , it is true , was a general in the service of the Government ; the recipient was the head of that Government . But the letter nevertheless was not an official letter ; it was a private letter , suggesting to Mr. // Lincoln 's " private consideration " a certain line of policy for his adoption . Mr. Lincoln desired , when in June he assented to General McClellan 's proposal to submit to him his views respecting the whole conduct of the war , that care should be taken to preserve secrecy . Such care was taken . General McClellan wrote the letter with his own hand in his tent at Harrison 's Landing , and placed it himself in the hands of Mr. Lincoln . Mr. Lincoln need not have shown it to a human being . He might have propounded to his Cabinet the policy which it described , without saying that General McClellan had recommended it . Public men in such positions have often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have not deemed themselves bound to disclose their authorship . If Mr. Lincoln had proposed this policy for the consideration of his Cabinet , without saying that it had been suggested by General McClellan , there can be no doubt that it would have had a fair consideration , and possibly it might have been adopted . If it had been , there can be as little doubt that the world never would have known from General McClellan that the suggestion came from him ; while he would have been able to say that he concurred in what the President had determined on , and would do everything in his power as a general to carry it out . General McClellan may well have been astonished , therefore , as we believe he was , when he heard it said , long after his removal from the command , that his private letter to Mr. Lincoln had caused the latter to regard him as having sought by means of it to set his sails for the popular breeze , and that out of his sails the wind had been taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was intent upon anything that was unselfish , and devoid of any purpose but to serve his official superior , it was General McClellan when he sketched that great policy for Mr. Lincoln 's private consideration . All that happened in the political world , two years afterward , when General McClellan , by no procurement of his own , was nominated as the Democratic candidate in the summer of 1864 , has of course no relevancy to the cause or causes which operated upon Mr. Lincoln 's mind in November , 1862 , to make him recall General McClellan from the command of the Army of the Potomac , and to bid him report at Trenton , in the State of New Jersey . Among the members of Mr. Lincoln 's Cabinet in the summer and autumn of 1802 , there were two persons who were as unfriendly to Mr. Lincoln as they were to General McClellan . Mr. Chase had reasons of his own for representing to Mr. Lincoln that the Demo // crats then had General McClellan in training as their future candidate for the Presidency , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the training consisted . Any one who remembers the condition of Democratic sentiment on the subject of slavery and the proper objects of the war , at the time when General McClellan wrote his letter to Mr. Lincoln , and even down to a much later period , can easily see that the letter never was designed by the writer as a means of recommending himself to that party as their candidate for the Presidency . But Mr. Chase  --  to borrow an old parliamentary phrase- " took nothing " by his efforts to undermine Mr. Lincoln 's confidence in McClellan . He may be dismissed to the innumerable company of those who " filed their minds " and gained nothing by it for themselves . The one redeeming part of Mr. Chase 's conduct toward McClellan is , that he never pretended to be anything but an enemy . But , in all that scene of infidelity to the military interests of the republic , there stands forth one central figure , prominent in double-dealing , celebrated for duplicity , the arch-hypocrite Stanton . The world does not now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from us . Our proof of it is only cumulative . The character to which that proof relates is one that no man can explain , one that no party and no faction can bear to defend . This man began at an early period to fawn upon McClellan . It is not improbable that the young General , in the frankness of his own nature , and in his readiness to accept all proffered aid in the great public duties which devolved upon him after he became general-in-chief by the advice of General Scott , may have believed in the personal devotion and attachment which this eminent Pennsylvania lawyer professed to himself , to his relatives , and to his friends in the army . But , there was at first a jarring string in these strains of flattery . The part was overacted , although the actor did not , until he was warned , perceive wherein he " o'erstepped the modesty of nature . " He thought to recommend himself to McClellan by the grossest ridicule and abuse of Lincoln . He found that McClellan 's sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superior . But , as Mr. Stanton was known to be a man of high ability and distinction in his profession , and as Mr. Lincoln was disposed to believe that he would be a valuable Secretary of War , both because of his energy and because of his avowed friendship for McClellan , the latter , when consulted , gave his influence with the President for the introduction of Mr. Stanton into the Cabinet . // There is a saying- " something musty " - about the displacement of ladders after an elevation has been reached . As time went on , as Mr. Stanton 's ambition grew , and " his infant fortune came to age " with the increase of his power , he came to know how necessary McClellan was to Mr. Lincoln , and how important to the country it was that the best relations should exist between them . Knowing this , he determined that McClellan should be ruined . For Lincoln he had so much contempt that he thought he could be trusted to ruin himself . Yet to the last hour of his intercourse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his purpose , Mr. Stanton professed to McClellan and his friends an unalterable fidelity , and an unchangeable conviction of his importance to the public interests : while , at the very same time , the occasional ebullitions of his hostility , bursting forth from his arrogant temper , in the presence of others , and his official acts , betrayed the object to which his hatred was carrying him , long before it was finally attained . The army saw it , if the people of the Union did not . McClellan was to be destroyed by making Lincoln distrust him . The scheme succeeded  --  the deed was done . But what of the chief conspirator ? Dante , as he walks through the infernal realms , protected by the great Mantuan Spirit " whose fame still lasts in the world , and will last as long as time , " tells us of the common herd , undistinguishable from one another , who are grouped in eternal suffering according to the nature of their besetting sin . These are they who are damned by classification . We do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , in crowds , in a situation of dreadful appropriateness to their peculiar transgression . But , when the poet encounters one of those historical personages on whom , because of the consequences which his acts have entailed upon his country or mankind , there should be fastened all the infamy that is his due , we have the individual and his history touched by the master 's stroke , and the sufferer stands for ever alone in the awful characterization of his fate . One of these ghastly objects of retribution is that Bertran de Born who " gave the evil counsels " which separated those who should have been united . The spectacle of this false counselor to a prince , which the poet describes , is too horrible to be transferred in detail to these pages . But , if any one is disposed to wonder that this image has risen up before us as we write of a passage in our national annals , let him count , if he can , the soldiers ' graves , the widows ' and the orphans ' tears , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the whole vast sum of misery and sorrow which must be charged to the malice that one man bore to another . And , when he sickens in the contemplation of these accumulated woes , let him turn to the so-called historical literature of the country , and note how , from the same source , it has been poisoned with lies . We must thread this dreary maze of Stanton 's treachery and Lincoln 's weakness , until we have reached conclusions on which it is fit that a final judgment should rest. * * An illustration of Mr. Stanton 's character comes to us while we write . On the 3d of April , 1862 , General Franklin received an order to embark his division for the Peninsula , to be under the command of General McClellan in the advance upon Richmond . Calling at the War Department on that evening , General Franklin met General McDowell . The following account is taken from the " Philadelphia Times " of April 28 , 15* ' 7 , in the words of General Franklin : " General McDowell informed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour before that General McClellan intended to work by strategy and not by fighting , and that he should not have another man from his Department ; that all of the enemies of the Administration centered around him ; and the Secretary accused him of having political ambition . Also , that he had not left the number of troops to defend Washington that the President required ; in other words , that he had disobeyed the President 's orders . General McDowell remonstrated against the step which was about to be taken , arguing that , if General McClellan had political aspirations , they would be forwarded by the very course which the Administration was taking in this case . He used all the arguments which he could bring to bear , to convince the Secretary that he was making a mistake in ordering the detachment of his corps . The result was , General McDowell 's corps was detached from the Army of the Potomac , and was marched to Catlett 's Station on the Orange and Alexandria Railroad , where it could do no possible good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement of McDowell 's corps on the north bank of the York River , was utterly destroyed . The Army of the Potomac was forced to stay a whole month on the Peninsula uselessly , and the capture of Richmond , which in all human probability would have been made in the month of May , had General McClellan 's plan been carried out , was deferred for three years . " General Franklin now writes to us as follows , inclosing a copy of his paper in the " Philadelphia Times " : " On the evening of the arrival of General McDowell 's corps at Catlett 's Station ( about April 8th or 9th ) , my division , which then formed part of the corps , was ordered to join General McClellan by way of Alexandria . While it was marching to Alexandria I went to the Peninsula , saw and conferred with the General McClellan , and returned to Alexandria to embark the division on the transports . When I was ready to start , I was informed that the President and Secretary of War wished to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was very cordial , was glad I was going to the Peninsula , would at once determine a question of my rank which was before him . He desired me to give his love to McClellan , and to say to him that he had his best wishes for his success , and that any help to him which he required that his Department could furnish would be most cheerfully accorded . In fact , nothing could have been more satisfactory to any friend of McClellan than this interview would have been to me , had not the recollection of McDowell 's interview with Stanton // It seems to us most remarkable , in all this concatenation of conspiracies against the usefulness and success of a military man who was serving the country with singleness of purpose and with no ambition but to do his military duty , that Mr. Lincoln , with his imputed shrewdness , did not see to the very bottom of the hearts of men who wished to put enmity between him and this faithful soldier . Mr. Lincoln should have had the wisdom to remember that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a political reason for depriving the country of General McClellan 's military services , was entirely under his ( Mr. Lincoln 's ) own control ; for General McClellan had not divulged its contents , and as a man of honor he could never have divulged them for any purpose but to shield himself from an unjust imputation . After it had been imputed to him that he wrote the letter for a selfish political purpose , he included a copy of it in his report , that the whole world might judge of its character . A portion of his countrymen , knowing little of the facts , and paying but little heed to the character of the letter , have permitted an unjust impression to remain in their minds . It is time for them to correct their impressions , and to observe that , if Mr. Lincoln had looked into the letter , when McClellan 's eneof April 3d been fresh in my mind . I never saw Stanton after this interview . The interview with the President amounted to nothing. ** We do not know where , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so grotesque as the fact that the destinies of a great war were to a large extent in the hands of a mere lawyer who , apart from his propensity to resort to duplicity when there was no need for it whatever , was completely destitute of all military knowledge or judgment . Such administrative faculty as Mr. Stanton had was due to the energy of an imperious will . President Buchanan , who gauged Mr. Stanton accurately when he was his Attorney-General , has left the following brief description of him , which now lies before us in Mr. Buchanan 's handwriting : " Mr. Stanton was an able , astute , and somewhat overbearing , dogmatic lawyer . He had been eminently and deservedly successful at the bar . His personal integrity has never been doubted . He was , however , deficient in the knowledge of a statesman ; but he performed his duties as Attorney-General in a respectable and satisfactory manner . He had not the calmness and sober judgment that would have fitted him for an important administrative office . He was rash and impetuous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment , and he did not stop to inquire into the remote consequences of his decision . " This was evidently written before Mr. Stanton became Mr. Lincoln 's Secretary of War . What it says of his personal integrity relates to all matters of money . In that respect Mr. Stanton 's character was without a stain . His personal duplicity , toward those who trusted him and whom he professed to serve , is an enigma which those who knew him best never could understand . He was as false to Buchanan as he was to others , and it is to be hoped that Mr. Buchanan died without knowing that he was so . // mies were perpetually trying to awaken his jealousy , he must have seen that , whatever else it was , it was no " platform " for a Democratic politician to put himself upon in the summer of 1862 . But , according to the theory on which we are commenting , Mr. Lincoln , although he had it entirely in his power , in the autumn of 1862 , to recognize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a policy to be adopted by him and made his own if he should think well of it , could not , nevertheless , resist the representations of McClellan 's enemies that it was designed for a very different purpose . No man can read that letter now , whether he knows General McClellan or not , and find in it any trace of the design that was imputed to him . No man who knows General McClellan , and knows the political history of the time when the letter was written , can believe that he ever had such a design. * On the night of the same day on which the removal of General McClellan was considered in the Cabinet , the elder Mr. Blair , as the reader has seen , visited Mr. Lincoln , and patriotically endeavored to dissuade him from that step . At the meeting of the Cabinet on the 5th Mr. Lincoln made no allusion to the Harrison 's Landing letter , for some of the gentlemen present did not know of its existence . The discussion in the Cabinet turned wholly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alleged misrepresentation of the actual condition of his army in respect to the supplies , after the battle of Antietam . When Mr. Blair saw the President on that evening , the latter remarked that he had said he would remove McClellan if he allowed Lee 's army to get away from him , and that he must remove him . When Mr. Blair saw Mr. Lincoln * It must be remembered that the letter was written in July , 1862 . One copy of it remained in manuscript in General McClellan 's possession . In August , 1863 , General McClellan drew up and transmitted to the War Department his report on the military operations in which he had been engaged . The report remained in the Adjutant-General 's office until it was sent into Congress at its next session , which commenced in December , 1863 . It contained a correct copy of the Harrison 's Landing letter . Soon after the report began to be printed by the printer of public documents , the newspaper press began to comment upon and to copy from it . An imperfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in January , 1864 ; but how it was obtained is not known . An edition of General McClellan 's report was published by Sheldon &amp; Co. , at New York , in the spring of 1864 ; and from that edition the public obtained the first authentic copy of the Harrison 's Landing letter that was ever authorized by General McClellan . He was removed from command and sent into retirement in November , 1862 . In the early part of November , 1864 , he resigned from the army . // on the next day , Mr. Lincoln said , " Mr. Blair , I was obliged to play shut pan to you last night . " The order for the change in the command had then come out , and Mr. Lincoln felt obliged to account to Mr. Blair for not having told him on the previous evening that the matter had been decided . The question arises , therefore , To whom had the President said that he would remove McClellan if he allowed Lee 's army to get away from him ? Certainly he never said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Antietam , twelve days after Lee 's army had recrossed the Potomac , Mr. Lincoln told General McClellan that he did not intend to displace him , and that he was not to move on the enemy until he felt that he was entirely ready . On the 6th of October the President ordered him to pursue Lee ; but on the 21st the President knew that it was at least doubtful whether he was in a condition to do so , and a little later the President learned that he certainly was not . If we go forward to the 5th of November , after McClellan , properly supplied , had placed his army in the best possible positions for dividing Lee 's forces and beating them in detail , we find the Cabinet council sitting at the White House debating the question of his removal from command . At that meeting the old story of unnecessary delay after the battle of Antietam was again trumped up , and , notwithstanding the information that had been obtained by Colonel Scott and communicated to the President , the Secretary of War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the delay had been wholly due to the want of indispensable supplies , at least one member of the Cabinet , who had been a steadfast supporter of General McClellan upon public grounds , was made to admit , on General ilalleck 's " statements , " that there had been unnecessary delay after the battle of Antietam . We do not know how to characterize that scene at the President 's council-table . We were about to use a word which we withhold . We can only point to the fact that , at the very moment of that discussion on the proposal to remove General McClellan from command , his headquarters were at Rectortown ; his army , in admirable discipline and spirit , was disposed in position for successive attacks upon Lee 's divided troops ; and it was yet an undecided question whether Lee was to escape , while the chances were entirely against him . For General Lee , however , that question was decided by the change in the Federal command  --  a change that was made upon a pretext which more than one person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Mr. Lincoln was in the toils laid for him by Chase , Stanton , and ilalleck , we do not believe that he had it in his power to assign publicly a reason for removing McClellan . The subject of McClellan 's allowing Lee 's army to escape was not discussed in the Cabinet . On the evening of the day on which that discussion took place , Mr. Lincoln had to say something to the elder Mr. Blair , and he went back to an old promise which he had given to somebody , that he would remove McClellan if he allowed Lee 's army to get away from him . But at that moment McClellan was about to attack Longstreet , and the result , which had not occurred , could not have been the reason why Mr. Lincoln had already allowed the order to be issued . At the Cabinet meeting , the reason urged was a delay that had occurred on the field of Antietam during the three weeks that ended on the last days of October . After the Cabinet council broke up , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mr. Chase and Mr. Stanton , during which Mr. Lincoln consented that the order should be issued , and that the name of General Burnside should be inserted in it as the successor of McClellan . But , if Mr. Lincoln had ever been asked thereafter to assign the reason why he allowed that order to be issued , we are entirely unable to see what he could have said . But , valuing McClellan highly , as we believe he did , and knowing as he did that McClellan was at that moment pursuing Lee 's army by his orders , Mr. Lincoln was so entrapped by McClellan 's enemies that he could not extricate himself without sacrificing McClellan ; for he knew that Halleck 's " statements , " produced and listened to at the Council-board , could be produced elsewhere , and would be given to the public if he allowed McClellan to remain at the head of the army . This would have produced a public issue respecting the mode in which affairs had been managed by the War Department , in meeting or failing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is another theory , less common than the one which we have thus far considered , by which some persons think that General McClellan 's removal from command is to be accounted for . This theory is entertained by officers of the army , who , while abstaining habitually from all party or political relations , were deeply interested in observing the course of the Administration in the prosecution of the war . It is this : That in the summer and autumn of // who were represented by Mr. Ch*se and Mr. Stanton , did not desire further military successes in the war until they should have made it a war for the extermination of slavery . In support of this theory those who entertain it point to the following facts : That if McClellan had captured Richmond in November or December , 1862 , the proclamation would have remained , as what Mr. Lincoln described it , a " bull against the comet " ; because , if the rebellion had been crushed then and there , the Constitution , notwithstanding the proclamation , must have remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , came Burnside and Hooker , who were not more effectually sustained and supported by the Administration than McClellan had been ; and that when it was determined to remove McClellan , so that Richmond might not fall prematurely , it was a sort of hap-hazard choice that at the last moment of deliberation made Burnside his immediate successor . This is not a theory which has been the result of an afterthought . There were intelligent and observing officers of that army who knew that McClellan , on the one hand , was straining every nerve to overtake and defeat the Confederate forces at the moment when he was displaced , and who , on the other hand , believed , at that time , that he was not permitted to succeed because the Administration did not then desire success . It is impossible , of course , to penetrate into the secret counsels of those who then controlled the course of the war . What we can see , however , is that the removal of General McClellan entailed the frightful slaughter at Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presented to our readers an accurate sketch , from which they could learn with what excellent strategy McClellan was operating , to insure the fall of Richmond with the least expenditure of precious lives . We doubt if one reader out of every hundred has ever before understood how the severance of the communications between the two parts of Lee 's army , and the forcing of Longstreet back upon Gordonsville-results that were within McClellan 's grasp on the 7th of November , 1862-would have opened to him an almost unopposed march upon Richmond . Yet this commander , thus arrested by his own Government when he was about to achieve a great success-arrested from a motive of statecraft , or from a motive of personal jealousy , or from a combination of both-is the man whose reputation has been slurred because he did not sacrifice his men by hecatombs , from which nothing could be gained , but sought to attain his object by occupying positions // that would make a battle and a*4ctory worth what they might CO5t. * In reference to the political motives by which Mr. Lincoln @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the theories that have ever been suggested . Whatever theory of political motive is the one that ought to be adopted , the deplorable fact remains that the country lost the services of General McClellan , and that great disasters ensued . At Fredericksburg , in December , 1862 , under Burnside , the Federal losses , in killed , wounded , and missing , were 12,321 . At Chancellorsville , under Hooker , in May , 1863 , the killed and wounded were 11,033 . These losses were entirely uncompensated by any advantage or prestige . In June the Confederates invaded Pennsylvania , and were barely checked at Gettysburg . Remembering these consequences , we are forced also to remember that , if anything in war can be pronounced to have been so highly probable as to amount to a moral certainty , it is that , if * At Warrenton , after the soldiers had learned that McClellan was to leave them , and as he rode through the ranks that lined the road for miles , the men called out to him repeatedly , " Come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer who rode by his side , and , with tears gathering in his eyes , asked , " What do you think of all this ? " " It is hard upon you , but best for us . " " Why ? " " Because you are not permitted to succeed , and , as the people in Washington do not intend that we shall fight at present , we shall be saved defeat and mortification . You will come back when you are wanted . " Laying his hand on the officer 's shoulder , the General asked , " How did you learn so much ? " Our informant adds that he did not think at the time how soon he was to witness Fredericksburg . A very fair writer on the " Campaigns of the Army of the Potomac " ( Swinton , New York , 1866 ) was at a loss to understand why Burnside abandoned at Warrenton all of McClellan 's plans , and , turning his back on Lee 's army , marched his own army to Fredericksburg . He says that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ; that is to say , the Administration abandoned the pursuit of Lee 's army , and allowed their own army to be transferred to Fredericksburg , without one effort to carry out McClellan 's plan of operations . This could have been done only for the purpose of obtaining a new base , where the Army of the Potomac could remain inactive until the spring . But the swift puronit of Lee , whose whole forces arrived on the south bank of the Rappahannock , for the relief of Fredericksburg , within a week after Burnside 's army had reached the river , disconcerted the whole project of " winter quarters " at Fredericksburg , and ended in conflicts which produced what Mr. Swinton justly calls " a slaughter the most bloody and the most useless of the war . " While General Buraside must be considered to have been excessively rash in attempting to carry Lee 's positions by assault , it should be remembered that he was at Fredericksburg at all by the assent of the Government . The motive which led to that assent is believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a secret determination to let the war in Virginia stand still until the effect of the emancipation proclamation had been fully dev.eloped . // McClellan had been allowed to fight Lee again , there would have been another victory , which would have insured the capture of Richmond before thc end of the year 1862 . The blood with which the Wilderness was afterward watered would have been saved . We shall now close our review of this part of General McClelIan 's military career with a summary , which may assist our readers in forming an opinion of the justice of a criticism which has long been used to excuse the conduct of the Administration . The criticism has most commonly been put in this form : that while General McClellan had great accomplishments as an organizer of armies and as an engineer , yet as a general at the head of troops he lacked decision , promptness , and vigor , from a constitutional infirmity which made him reluctant to strike a blow until he had accumulated every possible advantage for delivering it . The soundness of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history of the period over which we have passed in these papers . We have followed General McClellan for the space of a little less than five months , from the 26th of June to the 7th of November , 1862 . The week extending from the 26th of June to the 4th of July , in which there was more severe fighting than any one of our armies in an equal period ever encountered , eiAed in the rescue of the Army of the Potomac from an extraordinary peril , into which it was brought by the blundering folly of its own Government . No competent critic will deny that the tactics , the force of will , the indomitable perseverance , and the admirable judgment displayed by McClellan during the seven days ' march to the James , evinced the highest attributes of a military commander ; for no such critic will question that to rescue an army , on such a march , from the clutches of a superior force , is as great an achievement as to fight and win a pitched battle with equal or nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of July to the 5th of August , a period of comparative inactivity on the James necessarily followed , in consequence of the indecision of the Government as to what was to be done . From the 5th of August to the 16th , McClellan could do nothing but execute the orders of his superiors to remove his army to the front of Washington . From the 16th of August to the 27th , he was engaged in transferring the different bodies of his army to the command of General Pope . From the 27th of August until the morning of the 2d of September , he was without the command of more than a hundred men . Into the next two weeks , when called upon to save the capital , // he crowded an amount of energy , skill , promptness , and vigor , which should alone have made a great reputation , if he had never done anything else . If we break up those two weeks into their important subdivisions , we have , first , the five days which followed his resumption of command , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swarming toward the capital in the night , immediately restored its discipline , posted it within the defenses of the city , reconstructed some of its organizations , and then threw it forward on a march to intercept an enemy flushed with his recent victory and preparing to come down upon the Maryland side of the Potomac. iDiiring the week that intervened between the 7th and the 13th of September , McClellan was moving his columns on five parallel routes , so that he might encounter Lee before the latter could descend upon Washington by an unoccupied and unguarded road , either next to or away from the river . In one week this march was accomplished , notwithstanding the cautions with which it had to be made . On the 13th , Lee 's plans were revealed ; and it affords abundant proof of the sound judgment with which McClellan had conducted his march , and of the spirit and efficiency which he had restored to the troops , that the very first blow which he struck sent the whole Confederate army into retreat . The blow that was given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McClellan resumed the command , and on the next day after that on which Lee 's position became known ; and on the same day General Franklin , one of McClellan 's most energetic lieutenants , attacked and carried the pass called Crampton 's Gap , on the left , while the main body of McClellan 's troops attacked the Confederates at South Mountain . In three days after South Mountain , the Confederate army was overtaken on the field of Antietam , and on the night of the fourth day their shattered forces were withdrawn into Virginia , after a desperately fought battle which lasted for fourteen hours . Carping criticism , imputations of " slowness , " charges of hesitation and want of vigor , vanish into the realm of nonsense , in the face of such achievements . When we look back upon what was accomplished in the two weeks that followed McClellan 's restoration to command , with an army which he took off the hands of a general under whom it had been shockingly beaten , and when we remember that McClellan , as he marched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many officials who wished him anything but success , we can only wonder at the easy credulity of that // portion of the contemporary public who supposed him to be either slow or inefficient as a commander . The false impressions which one age derives from its own prejudices , that have been industriously cultivated for the transient policies of political or personal hostility , are a poor guide to the estimation in which a man is to be held in history . Beyond the range of their influence , even to-day , the military reputation of General McClellan among the best European judges is so high that it has often been said that he would have terminated the war in November or December , 1862 , if he had been kept in the field and been supported and supplied as other generals subsequently were . We have heard , from a source that left us no reason to doubt the authenticity of the anecdote , that General von Moltke once expressed this opinion to an American who in conversation gave him to understand that " some of us in America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others of our generals . " " It may be so , " said the great Prussian commander , " but let me tell you that , if your Government had supported General McClellan in the field as they should have done , your war would have been ended two years sooner than it was . " But it is not necessary to look abroad in order to measure what we lost by the removal of McClellan from the public service . The history of the war in Virginia , after Antietam and after the removal of McClellan from command , is a history of the endeavor of our Government to reestablish the Union armies in the position before Richmond which they had occupied in June , 1862 , when the Government withdrew fron McClellan its promised support , and left him to save his army by the flank movement to the James . That subsequent history embraces the battles of Fredericksburg , Chancellorsville , the Wilderness , and other fierce fights along the bloody overland route from Washington to Richmond . With these before him , the reader is compelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any battle fought between those two cities in which the Confederates were beaten and driven from the field ; and why the patriotic North was called upon for a lavish expenditure of treasure and of men to supply the places of the countless dead who fell in the effort to regain that old position before the capital of Virginia . The enemy fell back before the overwhelming forces of the inexhaustible Union . In 1865 they were utterly crushed and subdued , on the same ground from which , in 1862 , the Army of the Potomac was withdrawn , in disregard of the earnest appeals of its com // mander , who did not cease to reiterate the memorable words of his dispatch to General Halleck , of August 4 , 1862 : " Here is the true defense of Washington ; it is here , on the banks of the James , that the fate of the Union is to be decided . " Yet it was not for the glory snatched from McClellan that we have ever grieved . All talent , power , accomplishment , knowledge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when rightly regarded , a trust for his country ; and we are sure that General McClellan never has regretted and never can regret that he so regarded and used the gifts which it pleased Heaven to bestow upon him . Among all the distinguished military men of this or any other age , of whom the world knows so much as it knows of McClellan , there has been no man whose ambition was so perfectly unalloyed by the base element of self-seeking at the expense of others , and no man who has suffered so much injustice from official superiors . Yet that injustice has not caused him to challenge his detractors upon the issues that were made against him . Not at the time when that injustice was committed , not in the long period of eighteen years that has since elapsed , has he broken the reticence which is a part of his nature when his own public conduct or that of others is in question . That he will at some time break this silence , so far as to relate facts which he alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come after us , his contemporaries should , as we believe they do , earnestly desire .
