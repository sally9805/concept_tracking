txt The Massachusetts Reform Club , at its meeting to-day , passed resolutions denouncing the nomination of Blaine and Logan , and voted to request the independent vote throughout the country to join them in active and immediate efforts to secure the nomination by the Democratio Party of such men as can command their support , and , failing in that , to call a convention at the earliest practicable day to nominate candidates in full sympathy with the reform sentiment of the country . A committee was appointed with full powers to take such steps by correspondence or otherwise as they may deem best calculated to carry into effect the foregoing resolution . The committee were authorized to increase their numbers if desirable , and to co-operate with organizations of independent Republicans and others to secure candidates pledged to reform . On motion of Col. T. W. Higginson , the following resolutions were passed : Resolved , That the foregoing committee bo Instructed to call a meeting in Boston , at as early a day us possible . to express the opinion of Independent voters In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prepare for future action . Dispatches were received from leading New-York independents requesting early consultation in regard to taking decisive action toward repudiating the Chicago nomination . The meeting was largely attended , and letters were received from several prominent Independents who were unable to attend , all of whom condemned the Blaine and Logan ticket . The following from Charles Francis Adams , Jr. , was read : JUNE 7 , 188i . J. TV . Carter , Secretary of the Masscwhusetta Reform CI al ) : MY DEAR Sin : I received your notice of the Reform Club dinner this afternoon , and , in view of the nominations of yesterday , which are to be the subject of your discussion to-day , I regret extremely my inability to bo present . I Presume there is no question as to the attitude of the members of the Reform Club toward the Republican nominations . We will at once organize to defeat them . On this point , it seems to me , our response can not be too explicit or our action too Quick . Steps should ho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exert whatever influence we can on the other and coming convention . We have now less than no standing before that convention , for Massachusetts goes to it pledged to the support of her own political mountebank , whose nomination would actually drive many of us as a choice of ' evils to vote for Blaine . We should do what we can to prevent this , and we can do much . Could the Democratic Party be galvanized into that degree of momentary good which would lead it for once to astonish the country and itself by putting forward such a ticket as Clevcland and Carlisle , the result in November would not be in doubt for a moment . Experience tells us that the task is desperate , but so is the situation . Blaine is the other horn of our dilemma , if we will we can do more than we think to galvanize the Democracy , but to do it , we must act . I hope , therefore , that immediate steps will be taken under the auspices of the reform club towards . calling a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be represented at Chicago in July . If we fail there also , then as the Italian forestieri , or " dwellers in the woods , " so far as I now can see , we must meet together in the sylvan shades and name our own men , for whom we will cast a selfrespeeting vote . I am . &c.,; CHARLES F. ADAMS , Jr . The declaration against the nomination of Blaine and Logan was adopted in the following words : The Massachusetts Reform Club regard the nomination of Messrs . Blaine and Logan by the Republican Party as a distinct and unqualified repudiation of all its professions of reform , and as an insult to the conscience of the country , and that the members of the club will under no circumstances support them . Charles Francis Adams , Jr. , is Chairman of the committee to advance the independent movement , with Moorfleld Storey , Leverett Saistonstall , William Everett , James Fraeman Clark , Josiah Quincy , T. W. Higginson , Winslow Warren , Richard H. Dana , and others associated with him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
