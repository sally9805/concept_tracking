txt The Hon. William Walter Phelps takes the responsibility of giving to the public the following Private letter addressed to him nearly two weeks ago : AUGUSTA , Sept . G , 1884 : MY DEAR MR . PHELPS : I have your favor of the 4th advising me that " the continuous invention and wide circulation of evil reports render it advisable ( in your judgment ) not to wait the slow process of the law , but to speak directly to the public in my own vindication . " In this opinion many others on whose judgment I rely concur . I shrink instinctively from the suggestion , although I feel sure I could strengthen the confidence of all who feel friendly to me by bringing to view the simple thread of truth which is concealed in this endless tissue of falsehood . You can imagine how inexpressibly painful it must be to discuss one 's domestic life in the press , although I think with you that under the circumstances I could count upon the generosity of the public to justify a statement which otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , safely commit the facts to you for personal communication to those friends who have taken so delicate and so considerate an interest in my affairs . The leisure hours of to-day , when our campaign is ended and we wait only for the election , gives me the opportunity for this prompt reply and for the following essential details : At Georaetown , Ky. , in the Spring of 1818 , when I was but 13 years of age , I first met the lady who for more than 84 years has been my wife . Our acquaintance resulted at the end of six months in an engagement , which , without the prospect of speedy marriage , we naturally sought to keep to ourselves . Two years later , in the Spring of 1850. when I was maturing plans to leave my profession in Kentucky and establish myself elsewhere . I was suddenly summoned to Pennsylvania by the death of my father . It being very doubtful if I could return to Kentucky , I was threatened with an indefinite separation . from her who possessed my entire devotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an indissoluble tie against every possible contingency in life , and , on the 30th day of June , 1350 , just prior to my departure from Kentucky , we were , in the presence of chosen and trusted friends , united by what I knew was , in my native State of Pennsylvania , a perfectly legal form of marriage . On reaching home I found that my family , and especiallyrmy bereaved mother , stronely discountenanced ins business plans , as involving too long a separation from home and kindred . I complied with her wish that I should resume , at- least for a time , my occupation in Kentucky , whither I returned in the latter part of August . During the ensuing Winter , induced by misgivings under new responsibilities  --  misgivings which were increased by legal consultations ? I became alarmed lest a doubt might be thrown upon the validity of our marriage by reason of non-compliance with the law of the State where it had occurred  --  for I had learned that the laws of Kentucky made a license , certified by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a legal marriage . After much deliberation and with an anxious desire to guard in the most effectual manner against any possible embarrassment resulting from our position ? for which I alone was responsible ? we decided that the simplest and at the same time the surest way was to repair to Pennsylvania and have another marriage service performed . This was done , in the presence of witnesses , in the city of Pittsburg in the month of March , 1351 , but was not otherwise made public for obvious reasons . it was solemnized only to.secure an indisputable validity , the first marriage being by my wife and myself always held sacred . At the mature age of 54 I do not defend the wisdom or prudence of a secret marriage suggested by the ardo r and the inexperience of youth , but its honor and its purity were inviolate , as I believe , in the sight of God , and can not be made to appear otherwise by the wicked devices of men . It brought to me a companionship which has been my chief happiness from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me with whatever of success I have attained in life . My eldest child , a son , was born in his grandmother 's house on the lqh day of June , 1851 , in the city of Augusta , Me. , and died in her arms three years later . His ashes repose in the cemetery of his native city , beneath a stone which recorded his name and the limits of his innocent life . That stone , which had stood for almost an entire generation , has been recently defaced by brutal and sacrilegious hands . As a candidate for the Presincncy , I knew that I should encounter many forms of calumny and personal defamation , but I confess that I did not expect to be called upon to defend the name of a beloved and honored wife , who is a mother and a grandmother , nor did I expect that the grave of my little child would be cruelly desecrated . Against such gross forms of wrong the law gives no adequate redress , and I know that in the end my most effective appeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the noble manhood and the noble womanhood of America .
