IT is an old truth that commerce , founded on the basis of distributing the staples of life at the least cost , is the highest practical benevolence ; while devices to rule commerce by the suspension of competition , and to exact arbitrary profits from the masses , are the extreme of selfishness and oppression . The universal nature of this truth was perceived when the world emerged from the mediaeval system of economics , but it seems in danger of being forgotten . This is illustrated by the criticism of Mr. E. P. Alexander , the most recent writer on the railway question , that those who hold competition to be the only just measure of profits in any industry are " years behind the age in comprehension of the science of the railway question . " But the very question at issue is whether they are not more in accord with the essential principles of nineteenth century democracy than those who are turning commerce back to the era of prices fixed by combinations and the suspension of competition . Besides the anthracite coal pool , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and its direct action upon the interests of the masses , furnishes a particularly striking example of the combination policy , other signal instances can be found of monopolizing great industries , and enhancing the cost of the necessaries of life . The history of the Standard Oil monopoly has been told in such a variety of forms that it is only necessary to estimate the magnitude of its effect upon the consumers of petroleum . The claim that its rule has cheapened the cost of petroleum is reported to have nouplussed even so independent a thinker as Mr. Henry George , when presented to him at Cleveland last summer . But those familiar with the operations of that remarkable monopoly know that it can sell petroleum cheaper than other refiners , only because of the advantages given to it in transportation by the railways ; that it does sell cheaper only // at points where it desires to crush out sporadic attempts at competition ; and that on the vast aggregate of its traffic it enjoys the full benefit of the impregnable barrier which it has erected between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the millions of consumers of refined on the other . It is true that there has been a decline of SO to 60 per cent . in the retail price of refined petroleum since the ante-Standard period ; but those who regard that as a mitigation of the monopoly forget that there has been a decline of 70 to 80 per cent . in the price of crude . The marked difference between the decline which might have taken place with free competition and that which has actually occurred is shown in the United States census report on the " Necessaries of Life . " Among thirty-five places from which the retail price of petroleum is reported , at the few points which could be reached by what little competition existed at the time of the report , the retail price of petroleum was 12jY* to 15 cents per gallon , and at all other points the price ranged from 20 to 25 cents . Of late years , the price fixed by the Standard Oil Company in Texas was 35 cents when it was undisturbed in that territory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the price was reduced to 21 cents . Place the extra cost established by monopoly at 5 cents in adjacent territory , with a variation to 14 cents at remote points , and the tax thus imposed on the 38C,000,000 gallons of domestic consumption can be appreciated . A startling measure of the value of this monopoly to those who share in it , is the statement that its wealth , represented at its inception by a capital of *1,000,000 , is now placed by the quotations of shares in the various corporations and trusts which are comprised within its vast entity , at the enormous sum of *400 ,  - -  000,000 . This does not represent the profits realized from the favor of the railways ; for the actual gains , while counted by tens of millions , do not exceed one quarter of that vast sum . Nor does it stand for the real investment in property , which might , perhaps , be replaced for one-tenth the amount . It simply represents the earning power of the monopoly itself . In other words , after deducting a generous estimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which this combination has been permitted to usurp , is estimated by its own members to yield dividends upon the enormous total of *350,000,000 . Compare that estimate with // the increase of the retail price caused by the monopoly , which controls the trade from the mouth of the wells to the sale of oil from tank wagons at the doors of grocers , and it will be found that the statement of a tax of 10 cents per gallon for the benefit of the capital enjoying that monopoly errs , if at all , on the side of moderation . An interesting relation can be traced between the success of the Standard and the rise of a highly similar combination to control the coke industry of Southwestern Pennsylvania . In 1876 , forty-one firms were engaged in manufacturing coke from the Connellsville vein of coal , and the aggregate of the plant employed was 3,300 ovens . The value of that coal for coking purposes caused a rapid expansion of the industry in the years 1879-80-81 . But concurrently with that expansion the evidence afforded by the Standard Oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was too tempting for an opportunity of copying it to escape notice . While the industry has grown from 3,300 ovens in 1876 to a total of 10,796 ovens at the close of last year , the process of combination has been urged with *uch vigor that 8,300 ovens are under the control of a single syndicate , 1,646 are owned by manufacturers who consume their own product , while the competitive factor is reduced to three small firms who still manage to find a market for the product of 850 ovens , or about one-tenth the capacity controlled by the syndicate . The composition of this organization is somewhat unique in its details . It is made up of three great firms , whose union rules the industry . About one-third of the capacity under syndicate control is owned by various smaller firms , who run their works as directed by the syndicate , and turn over their entire product to it at a very liberal commission , reported to be 25c. per ton , or one-fifth the average price for the past two years . With this advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosperity , both in fat years and in lean . It directs the proportion of the trade which shall run or stand idle ; decides the rate of wages for the entire industry , as well as for its own labor , and fixes the price of the product by such surprising feats as its recent advance of *50 cents per ton , or one-third of the former price-much to the discomfort of iron-founders , who thus find the cost of their raw material suddenly increased to the extent of an extra dollar per ton on their own products . // It has been rather stunning to the agricultural interests of the South to discover , during the past fifteen months , that the cottonseed crushing mills had passed under the control of a single combination . The presence of some leading Standard Oil capitalists , and the faithful adoption of its favorite method of consolidation by means of a " Trust , " leaves little doubt as to the paternity of the scheme , which now manages 98 per cent . of the capacity of the cotton-seed oil mills , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country , and ordains exactly the price which the planters* shall get for their seed at the mills . The effect of this monopoly has not yet b.een felt by the consumers of alleged olive oil , oleomargarine , and oil cake ; but the producers have experienced a very tangible result of the removal of competition in the purchase of seed by a reduction from the price before realized , averaging $5 per ton . On the total amount of seed crushed last year this reduction amounts to $3,000,000 ; which gain may perhaps explain the fact that the price of certificates in the " Trust , " capitalized at two or three times the actual cost of the mills , is at a large premium . Naturally there is a great outcry among the planters of the South at this sudden transfer from their pockets to those of an irresponsible combination of the sum of $3,000,000 a year , with capabilities of indefinite expansion . Beyond the instances already noted of the effects of combination on the price of fuel , there is a very striking example of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard to food . It has been one of the social phenomena of the times that , after an era of general reduction in prices , and with an almost infinite expansion of the field of production , the one great staple that has nearly maintained the old level of values , is beef . Some light is thrown on this exceptional firmness by allegations that improved stock-cars , which bring the cattle to market in so much better condition as to equal a gain of $3 per head , are burdened with heavy charges , because their use would ruin the business of the stock-yards , where double prices for shelter and forage yield a rich revenue on the railway capital invested . This is an ex pane statement , but it finds strong corroboration in other quarters . For another form of transportation which effects economy by shipping only the dressed beef and saving the cost of carrying the hide and offal , is neutralized by the authority of the trunk line pool , with the principle that the consumer must be // made to pay as much freight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay had it been shipped on the hoof . The discrimination in this case is about the same as against improved live-stock cars , being 30 cents per hundred pounds between Chicago and New York . Heretofore the assertion has been made only by the critics of the railways , that improvements and economies in the transportation of meats were obstructed for the purpose of making the traffic pay tribute to the investments in stock yards ; but now we have the admission of that unquestioned railroad authority , Mr. E. P. Alexander , that the objection lies in the fact that the " investments in stock-yards and abbatoirs are threatened with destruction ; " and this gentleman turns an extraordinary light on the railway view of the question , by the declaration that " there is no abstract principle of right or wrong , or honesty or dishonesty , to which such questions can be referred . " This is a remarkable assertion to come from one of the most enlightened railway men of the day . If there is no principle of right or wrong involved in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or improve its quality shall be allowed full play ; if there is no honesty or dishonesty in the question whether the combined control of the highways of commerce can forbid such improvements in order to maintain the profits of stock-yard syndicates and livestock " eveners " rings , then let us be thankful that the nation is " years behind the age in comprehension of the science of the railway question . " A half cent per pound , which is about the extra burden thus placed on the beef that comes from the West to the seaboard , does not seem a very great imposition . But a half cent added to the primary wholesale cost grows to a cent pe* pound in the retail price . On the receipts of live stock and dressed beef at New York and New England points last year , that increase amounts to $11,000,000 . As the cost of Western beef fixes the retail price of all the beef sold in the Eastern market , the aggregate of this additional tax on food for the benefit of favored capital may be estimated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obstruction of competition in the five great staples , anthracite coal , coke , petroleum , beef , and cottonseed oil , are of such magnitude that , in comparison with the effect of that historical three-cent tax on tea , they might be expected to produce a social cataclysm . When the units of a dollar a ton on anthracite , ten cents per gallon on petroleum , twenty-five cents // per ton on coke , one cent per pound on beef , and $5 per ton on cotton-seed , are multiplied into the aggregates of consumption , it can be seen that the burdens imposed on the masses for the benefit of the interested capital are counted by the tens of millions annually ; and it no longer appears strange that the valuation of these monopolies is expressed by the hundreds of millions . If such results can be effected in the first and experimental decade of the combination , what may not be done in a quarter of a century ? If the monopoly of five industries of varying magnitude has created fortunes , held to aggregate somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prizes may not be gained by those who perfect and extend the policy to all branches of manufacture , and to the supply of every article of food ? And when every industrial process is under the combination rule , the obnoxious influence of competition wholly abolished , and the people at large left no option but to pay just such prices , and accept just such wages as the combinations may dictate , what an ideal state of society will be established-for the favored capi-talists ! What is the cause of all this ? At the foundation , of course , the trouble is the same as with Bunyan 's " Man with the Muckrake . " Men are so busy at the universal work of raking together wealth , that they have no time to look up to the higher qualities of justice and public welfare in the operation of our commercial system . But since the desire for wealth , as a motive of life , is beyond the reach of laws or public agitation , the question must be directed to the defects or abuses which allow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the few , so much to the detriment of the many . Mr. Henry George , in his recent review of the industrial condition of Pennsylvania , seems inclined to divide the responsibility between land monopoly and the protective tariff ; and many newspaper writers , who utterly reject his views on the former topic , agree with him , to the extent , at least , of charging the anthracite coal combination to protection . Pennsylvania , beyond dispute , affords a fruitful field for the study of industrial monopoly . It has the anthracite coal combination in the northeast ; the petroleum monopoly in the northwest ; the coke syndicate in the southwest ; several bituminous and gas coal pools fill in the intervals ; and if there is no corresponding combination in the // southeastern portion of the State , the omission must be excused on the ground that there is nothing there worth monopolizing . The position of Pennsylvania , as the State of the greatest protected industries , leads many to the conclusion that these phenomena are the offspring of protection . But whatever long-standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industries by a tariff to raise the price of imported products , that is entirely separate from the question whether those , or other domestic industries , shall be open to the free competition of all who wish to engage in them . The sole object of the protective tariff is to increase and encourage domestic competition in the protected industries ; the sole object of the combination policy is to prevent that competition in the industries which it controls . This appears even more plainly in the facts . If protection were the cause of monopoly , the monopolies should be the strongest in the most directly protected industries . Yet in the bituminous coal trade , which is directly protected , combination has only succeeded in controlling remote districts and limited markets ; while in the anthracite interest , which is only protected indirectly through the tariff on bituminous , the rule of combination has been practically continuous for fifteen years . Iron , steel , glass , and wool are directly protected industries ; and , except for the partially successful combination in the Bessemer steel industry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand and supply . On the other hand , petroleum is not protected at all , and presents the most complete example of unmitigated monopoly . It is not designed to discuss Mr. George 's land theory ; but it is surely a salient fact that in but one of these combinations does the ownership of land bear any part , while the abolition of property in land would not loosen the grasp of any of them on the means of preventing competition . It may also be pertinent to note in this connection that this very State , where the combinations are most rife , approaches most nearly to the application of Mr. George 's remedy , by levying , as the last message of its Governor shows , practically all of its taxation on real estate . What , then , is the source of the power over competition which gives these combinations existence and security ? The answer to that question is found in the ability to exclude competition by control of the routes of transportation . The railway pool , // although its career as the conqueror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the parent of this promising brood of combinations , each of which has attained absolutism in its especial sphere . The old fiction that the Standard 's monopoly was the growth of competition among the railroads having been lately reviewed , it is necessary to repeat the fact that the first scheme to monopolize the petroleum traffic , when the Standard Oil Company had but a local importance , possessed the pooling features of apportionment of traffic between the railways by arbitrary percentages , which were to be guaranteed by the corporation-the South Improvement Company-in whose hands the railways placed the monopoly of the business , by rebates on the part of the railways , that were avowedly " a guarantee against competition . " The railways were to guarantee the monopoly of the petroleum traffic for the sake of escaping from competition among themselves ; and this scheme being ruined by premature exposure , the Standard Oil Company fell heir to the monopolistic estate . Whenever , during the contest that resulted in the triumph of monopoly , there was any approach to competition among the railroads , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the league and covenant against free competition was established between the railways and the Standard in 1877 , as a part of the first trunk line pool , the doom of the independent industry was sealed . Within the last twelve months renewed examples have been given , how competition in transportation gives birth to new attempts at competition in the refining industry , and how the re-establishment of the pooling policy among the railroads renews the sway of the Standard . The same foundation is found in every other case where an entire industry has been monopolized . The coke syndicate holds its control of eight-tenths the production by discriminations which are privately reported on long hauls to exceed the entire cost of production at the ovens . Coal pools wherever they exist are held in place by railway pools behind them . The obstruction of new methods in the marketing of beef is a direct application of the power of railway preference ; and when railway competition has burst the bonds of pooling combinations , the freight rates on dressed beef have approached an equality with those on live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clear idea of how the cotton-seed oil monopoly was established , beyond the pathetic opinion of one planter , who writes to // the papers that " the railroads are somehow mixed up in it ; " but the fact that the average freight on a ton of cotton-seed is half its value at the mills , together with the presence , at the head of the combination , of the petroleum monopolists , who order the Southern railways to " give the screw another turn " when an independent shipper of petroleum finds his way to their territory , makes it as plain as a guide-board to those who know the history of the Standard , that its new conquest is built upon the same foundation of railway discriminations . The striking article by Mr. Lloyd , in a former number of the NORTH AMERICAX REVIEW , on the almost universal tendency toward combination , showed the effort to extend far beyond the instances I have given . But his numerous examples illustrate the presence of this law as a check upon such combinations ,  --  that unless there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combinations only serve to attract fresh capital into the business . In the case of the match combination , the barbed wire pool , the Bessemer Steel Association , and a score of minor combinations , the monopoly is simply that granted for a limited time by our patent laws . Beyond that , no combination has ever succeeded in excluding competition from the production of any staple , unless the favor of the railways was secured to forbid new competitors the benefit of as cheap transportation as the pools can command . Iron , nails , glass , and iron pipe associations fix the list prices of their wares ; but the prices of the two former products fluctuate freely ,  --  sometimes as much as forty per cent . below the card ,  --  while the market prices of glass and iron pipes are shown by discounts of 430 , 70 , and 80 per cent . from the lists . The whisky pool can not maintain the price of alcohol above the cost of manufacture with the government tax added ; and the wall paper pool , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by calling into active operation a considerable list of anti-pool manufacturers . The production of any staple has never been monopolized , except by advantages in the rates of transportation ; and the fact also appears in the history of all these combinations , that not only railway discriminations , but railway pooling is essential to their success . A single railway may impose discriminations on its local traffic ; but to maintain the discriminations which control an entire industry , the union of all the railways performing transportation for that industry is a fundamental // necessity . This enables us to estimate briefly the actual effect of the most gigantic effort of combination  --  the railway pool . The attempt of this form of combination to impose arbitrary freight rates on commerce has so far met with very limited success . Upon the traffic of the country at large its efforts to advance railway charges have not been more than temporarily successful . But the vital fact appears in the history of railway pooiing that those combinations which maintained such monopolies as the Standard Oil Company , the anthracite combination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coke syndicate have been the most enduring ; while trunk line pools and Western freight associations have accomplished little more than a succession of fierce rate-wars , and the still more ruinous result of the creation of parallel lines . But suppose that the purpose of the great railway pools could also be accomplished , and competition so suspended that dividends on the *3,7OO , OOO , OOO of fictitious capitalization , asserted by Mr. H. V. Poor to be injected into the railway system , could be imposed on the commerce of the country , what a stupendous tax would thus be levied on labor for the benefit of wholly fiat capital . It is the almost universal plea in mitigation for this infraction of economic law , that the capital engaged in combination can not earn fair profits if competition is allowed free play . But what constitutes the just measure of reward for capital ? What are the fair profits for capital seeking investment in bonds , mortgages , or loans on commercial paper ? The rate of interest that is fixed by free competition . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses , stores , farms , small manufactures , or a thousand other forms of ordinary enterprise ? Free competition . What indeed is the force which fixes the rate of wages , despite efforts of Labor organizations to oppose combination to the action of that force , and notwithstanding the violence provoked where these organizations are brought into conflict with the great combinations of capital ? The competition of labor for wages . But the result of combination is to establish , for a favored class of capital , by means of the control of the highways of commerce , an exemption from the force which fixes the just reward of all other human effort , so that excessive profits can be exacted from the masses , to be counted by the tens of millions annually ; and if the ideal of railway pooling could be attained , this policy would im-. // pose upon the nation a burden of fictitious capital three times the amount of the national debt ! The failure of the Labor leaders to perceive that this is the real foundation for the troubles of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit of regarding the workingmau solely as a wage-earner , and ignoring his interest as a consumer . Mr. Powderly has inveighed against " the national sin of cheapness " and given his assent to the principle of combination to raise prices , on the assumption that such combinations involve an advance in wages . Let us suppose , for the sake of the argument , that the abolition of competition will return a certain proportion of the enhanced profits to the workingman in the shape of increased wages . If the anthracite coal pool raises the price of coal 50 cents per ton , and gives the miners 10 cents of the advance , a gain of *3,000,000 is secured in the annual wages of the miners ; but a burden of $15,000,000 is imposed on the labor that consumes the coal . If the coke syndicate raises its price 50 cents per ton , and gives its workingman 10 cents advance , the advantage to labor at the coke ovens is $400,000 in a year ; but a loss of many times the amount is inflicted on labor in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumer . If the same operation were repeated by combinations controlling every industry and every staple of consumption , what would be the result ? An addition would be made to the cost of life , of which one-fifth would be given back to labor in the form of increased wages , and four-fifths would be drawn from labor to swell the profits of capital . Change the proportion to whatever form you like ; the fact remains that all these combinations are organized to increase the profits of the capital engaged in them ; and the increase must either be drawn from the pockets of consumers or extracted from the wages of laborers . For it is by no means the rule that these combinations increase the wages of their employ*s . The anthracite coal trade is a shining example of the opposite result ; and no better example of the different results of combination and competition on wages i8 needed than the bituminous coal industry . That interest is scattered over too vast a territory and enjoys too many routes of transportation to be brought under the control of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pools , and the significant fact appears , that in proportion as each district is open to competition , // the miner receives a larger share of the returns from the sale of the coal . From a comparison of statistics , based on official returns for 1883 , it appears that in Allegheny County , where combination among the operators has always proved impracticable , the average rate of wages for all labor in the production of coal was *2.34 for each day 's work . In Fayette and Westmoreland counties , where the industry was largely under the sway of the coke combination and the gas coal pools , the daily rate of wages was *1.79 and $1.75 respectively . In Clearfield County the control was secured by a monopoly of transportation , and the wages of the miners averaged *1.50 per day . The anthracite coal field in the same year yielded miners an average of $1.74 for each day 's work . These figures are based on the number of days actually worked . When the average earnings of the whole year are taken into consideration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operators in the Pittsburgh district afforded only 188 working days , the average pay of the miners for the year was $439 , or more than in any other mining district of the State ; while in the coke and anthracite districts , where the alleged policy of raising wages by arbitrary stoppages of work was in greater or less vogue , the total earned by miners in the year was from $20 to $50 less for from forty to sixty more days work . Another illustration shows the working of the same principle . The anthracite coal combination put up the price of coal fifty cents per ton last fall , and nothing has yet been heard of an advance in wages . The coke pool has advanced the price of coke sixty-five cents since there was an advance in wages , and the dispute is now pending whether their men shall get any of the benefit of the last advance . On the other hand , a conference between the operators and miners of the bituminous districts has just been concluded , with the result of advancing wages five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price on coal contracts , deliverable after that date , has advanced just five cents . Under combination8 the laborers are lucky if they can get a fraction of the advance in prices ; under competition the employers are satisfied if they get back the increase in wages by just the same enhancement in price . Take , as another illustration of the same principle , the freight-handlers ' strike at Galveston last year . As long as the transcontinental pool lasted the Huntington lines were protected by the pool percentages against loss from the strike . When the pool was ruptured , the // first thing done was to settle with the strikers , and get the freight moving again . These examples simply demonstrate the universal principle that competition between employers for the work of the laborer acts just as important a part in the just regulation of wages as competition for the sale of staples does in the prevention of arbitrary prices . There is no better protection for the laboring masses than the free competition of employers , transporters , and middlemen . The artificial burdens imposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitute one of the chief causes of labor difficulties . When we hear of over-production , which simply means that because too much of everything is produced the masses are unable to get enough , it should not be difficult to recognize that the paradox of general want in the midst of universal abundance is only possible through the imposition of arbitrary burdens on the transportation and distribution of great staples . That any such burdens should exist is a wrong ; that they should be used to increase the wealth of the few at the expense of laboring millions , is a still greater injustice ; but that they should be made effective solely by the control of the highways of commerce founded for the public benefit by the most supreme act of sovereignty , is a monstrous perversion of economic law and governmental power . The conquest of all departments of industry by the power of combination has but just begun . But the mere beginning has imposed unwarrantable taxes on the fuel , light , and food of the masses . It has built up vast fortunes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millions . It has added an immense stimulant to the process , already too active , of making the rich richer , and the poor poorer . The tendency in this direction is shown by the arguments with which the press has teemed for the past two months , that the process of combination is a necessary feature of industrial growth , and that the competition which fixes the profits of every ordinary trader , investor , or mechanic , must be abolished for the benefit of great corporations , while kept in full force against the masses of producers and consumers , between whom the barriers of these combinations are interposed . This is the old question of privilege for a favored class , to the disadvantage of the people , presented in a new form . Its back - ward tendency is shown in the revival of commercial monopolies // like those of the Middle Ages ; but our Modern Feudalism is most apparent in the erection of great and irresponsible rulers of industry , whose power , like that of the feudal barons , burdens the people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The only important distinction is , that in the old days of force , the power of feudalism was measured by thousands of warriors ; in the days of modern plutocracy , its power is measured by millions of money . The law recently passed by Congress , for the regulation of railway traffic between the States , attempts to prohibit the abuses of discrimination and pooling by which these combinations are maintained . Whether a legislative prohibition can effect what the common law has failed to do ; or whether these combinations have become so mighty as to be able to nullify national legislation , as well as the natural laws of trade , can only be decided by the experience of the future . But if the enormous character of the monopolies already created , and the still more threatening possibilities indicated by their example , are thoroughly understood , the public mind can not fail to recognize the vital importance of a legislative declaration against the policy of combination on the thoroughfares of commerce , or to be aroused to the necessity of enforcing the principle that no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JAMES F.
