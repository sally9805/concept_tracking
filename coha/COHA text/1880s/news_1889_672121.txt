txt President Harrison Will have to send to the Senate to-morrow a Very long list of nominations if he desires the good wishes of the crowds of place hunters who still remain e in Washington . Less than 60 nominations , including the Cabinet , in two weeks is a record which stirs up anything but pleasant feelings as it is scanned by the men who are waiting to be selected . The President 's slowness was denounced before the close of his first week in office , but the disappointed office seekers are very much more bitter now . The three days since Thursday , when the last appointments were made , have seemed a fortnight to the impatient throng , who find living in Washington hotels expensive , and who see no reason why their services to the Republican Party should not be recognized within 24 hours after their claims are presented . Grumbling is very loud all along the line tonight , but it is loudest among the Ohio men , who have been as importunate as anybody , and who have thus far been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for has yet been granted , and unless Ohio is represented in tomorrow 's nominations their anger will be something frightful for the President to contemplate . There is , however , a fair probability that one Ohio man at least will be named for a good office early in the week if not to-morrow . He is Col. Smith A. Whitfield . exPostmaster of Cincinnati , and the place he is said to be slated for is that of Second Assistant Postmaster-General . These who expect to see Col. Whitfield nominated also look for the ate pointment of ox-Assistant Postmaster-General Tyner as Assistant Attorney-General assigned to the Poet Office Department . Ex-Third Assistant Postmaster-General A. D. Hazen has a strong backing for his old place , but there are still some doubts about his success . The Kansas people are also growling without stint over the slowness of President Harrison in finding places for them . They told the President yesterday that he could not be too quick in naming Judge Chandler for Assistant Secretary of the Interior , and they hope to find his name in to-morrow 's list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the treatment their State . has received , but they want a good deal more than they have had . Ex-Gov . Stone 's supporters want him put at the head of the General Land Office , but they are not sure to-night that they will be gratified . They are afraid that ex-Senator Chilcott of Colorado is ahead in the rape for that office , and they fear they may have to be content with the selection of the ex  --  Governor as Assistant Land Commissioner . Another Interior Department office which will probably be filled this week is that of Pension Commissioner . Corporal Tanner was supposed yesterday to be reasonably sure of this desirable place . but the opposition to him is strong and aggressive , and nis chances are not now considered so good . Ho has failed to secure good political backing from his own State , having been overmatched by Gen. Poole of Syracuse . The Corporal 's friends are annoyed by a circular which has made its appearance reflecting upon the would-be Pension Commissioner . Gen. Brown of Cincinnati is working hard to defeat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for himself . The Nebraska men expect to be recognized to-morrow by the nomination of Bradley D. Slaughter to be United States Marshal for their State . President Harrison continues to receive protests against the nomination of Whitelaw Reid to be Minister to England , and the New-York men seem to be at sea as to what will be the outcome of the contest over this highly important mission . The President does not announce what he intends to do to-morrow , and all the office seekers are grumbling because of the doubt and uncertainty of the coming week . Late to-night it is said , on the authority of a gentleman who has the President 's entire confidence , that-the nominations to be sent to the Monate to-morrow will be a big batch , " and that among them will be a few foreign missions , several consulates , and a let of bureau offices . It is considered practically certain that J. W. Mason of West Virginia will be named for Internal Revenue Commissioner . Thomas D. Byron of Lowell , Mass. , wi ) was supposed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent to the rear by Daniel Hubbard of Graf ton , Mass. , who expects to be nominated to be Consul to Manchester . He is backed by Senator Hoar , and his application has the indorsement of mill owners and financiers of Massachusetts representing $200,000,000 . In this respect Mr. Hubbard 's petition is one ? of the most remarkable over filed at the State Depertinent. 4 The final adjournment a the special session of the Senate will depend very largely upon the- number of appointments made by the which they ao. and whether the salary of a Senator of the United States ought not to be raised . I know it is charged that the Senate of the United States is composed largely of rich men to whom the salary is no object But there are Senators here who have nothing to live upon but their salaries , and who are paid less for the services which they render than they would be paid in any other walk or occupation of life for similar services , and very much less . " Mr. Morrill  --  Mar I ask the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man can come here with his family and rent a decent house : and live without spending twine the amount of his salary I Mr. Platt  --  I have been aware  --  and I think , perhaps , I may as well say it as any one , because I am as poor a man as there is in the Senate  --  I have been made most painfully aware of the inability of a Senator of the United States to live in the city of Washington in anything like the style and with anything like the comforts which we have at home and which other people have in Washington who perhaps are entitled to the same social position that we are and we entitled to the same social position that they are . We are pit at a disadvantage which we feel every day of our lives ; and there are Senators here who will echo what I say , knowing it to be true . Now . I do not complain of it for myself . I can remedy it for myself , if I choose to do so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for I use that word  --  which a Senator of the United States who is compelled to live on his salary must endure . I can remedy that by resigning my place and going home to my constituents and allowing ' ahem to send somebody here who has an income which he can devote to living in Washington . I think that it is quite time that some plain words were spoken on this subject , and I have taken this occasion to speak them . All repairs on naval vessels have been at a standstill for some time , owing to the lack or funds , but the clause in the Naval Appropriation bill , making $150,000 immediately available for this work , has enabled it to be resumed , and Secretary Tracy has ordered work to be commenced to-morrow morning on the Boston and Yenta ) at New-York , the Portsmouth and Saratoga at Kittery , the Jamestown and Pensacola at Norfolk , and the Iroquois and Adams at Mare Island . The orders sent to Mare Island are to fit the Iroquois and Adams out as soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not to be sent to Samoa because a collision with the German fleet is feared , but to relieve one or two of the vessels now there . It will probably be three months before they get away . The unsettled state of affairs in Samoa will probably make it necessary to keep a small squadron there for some time , and , even if the Berlin conference should arrive trt a final settlement of the Samoan difficulty , it will be a long time before all the vessels are withdrawn . The first trip of the new cruiser Charleston , on which she may be ready to start late in the Summer , will probably be to Samoa , and , in fact , all the vessels in the Pacific are apt to have a turn at this duty . President this week . Several of the Republican Senators declare that they see no reason why the session should not end Saturday . Two things may happen , either of which would prolong the session for an indefinite time . A few Republicans are very anxious to go into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Hoar , who. in the absence of Mr. Chandler , will resume his old post as chief waver of the bloody shirt " ; Mr. Spooner . and Mr. Blaine . The last speech on the subleot was made by Mr. Coke or Texas , who talked for three days and put into the Record a lot of matter which Mr. Spooner wants to answer . A majority of the Republicans are opposed to taking up the subject now . and they are doing all they can to keep the minority quiet . If one speech is made the Democrats will insist upon replying , and nobody can tell when the discussion will end . The other possible hindrance to an early adjournment is Mr. Stewart 's silver bullion purchasing resolution , which he offered at the beginning of the session . The Nevada Senator is anxious to talk about the resolution , and if he does there will be a long debate . Other Senators are laboring to induce him to let the matter go until next Winter , and they hope to succeed , If silver and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harrison exercises reasonable speed in filling the offices , the Senate can easily complete its work in a week or 10 days . The extra session called to act upon Mr. Cleveland 's nominations lasted until April 2. but it spent a great deal of time in talking about a railroad land grant and there was a discussion over the admission of Mr. Blair under the appointment of the Governor of Now-Hampshire . A majority of the Senate , too , was hostile to the Administration and not disposed to hurry in acting upon Mr. Cleveland 's nominations . The resignation of Senator . Chace upon the threshold of his second term has aroused renewed interest in a subject that is bound to receive early and earnest consideration in the Congress . Senator Chace in private gives as the reason why be can no longer serve that the compensation of a Senator was not sufficient to warrant him in longer neglecting his business . He says he is considerably poorer for his legislative experience than he would have been had he remained at his business . He is one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the compensation of Congressmen has been receiving the earnest attention of Senators , especially of late , and there is an overwhelming sentiment among them in favor of making the salary of Congressmen $10,000 a year . instead of $5,000 , as it is at present . Members of the House of Representatives , while thoroughly in sympathy with the Senators on this point , are not yet ready to go to the full length desired by them , rearing a repetition of the outbreak of censure visited upon the Congress of 1873 for its action on the salary question . But it is argued by the advocates or the increased salary that what the people were indignant about thou was the " backpay grab " feature , and that if Lae increase were made to date from the end of the Fifty-first Congress no serious opposition would be made to it . There Was a frank expression of views by the Senators on this topic in one of the secret legislative sessions last week in the discussion that ensued upon the introduction of a resolution by Senator Teller authorizing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a per diem basis during the session of the Senate and the clerks to Senators during the coming recess , the Der diem allowed by law . Mr. Toiler , previous to presenting the resolution , which was referred to the Committee on Contingent Expenses , said that in his experience as Chairman of a committee he had been compelled at times to employ two men to attend the correspondenee devolving upon him , and it was a heavy burden upon him . He believed Senators should have annual clerks , because their duties did not cease with the adjournment of the Senate . Senators Dawes , Stewart . Harris . and - Gray indorsed the sentiments expressed by Mr. Teller , but Senators Merrill , Morgan , and Hale said it would be impossible to provide a clerk for every Senator this year , inasmuch as the appropriations have all beau made , and in any event the co-operation of the House would be essential to carrying out the proposition . In ooncluding the debate . Mr. Platt said : ... " Mr. President , When the proper committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here this morning . IthLnk that committee ought to go further . I think It ought so consider the question as to whether deaatore are fairly paid for the work
