txt Two passenger trains on the Long Island . Railroad collided on the Atlantic-avenue track at the Ralph-avenue station , Brooklyn , early , yesterday morning , seriously wounding seven passengers , one or two perhaps fatally , slightly wounding many others , and almost demolishing two cars and an engine . It was about 6:55 o'clock and a dense fog hid almost everything from view . Rapid transit train No. 5 , consisting of two coaches , drawn by Engine No. 105 , in charge of Engineer Jack Hearn , was just slowing up to take on a number of passengers for the city who wore standing on the platform . The train was from live to eight minutes behind time and the track was wet and slippery . Engineer Hearn chanced to look out of his cab window toward the rear of his train and saw the dim reflection of a locomotive headlight breaking through the fog in his rear . quick as thought he throw the throttle of his engine wide open and the train bounded ahead a few feet , but not far enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The crash came , and for a few moments the quiet of the morning was disturbed by the mingled sounds of the shrieking and groaning of injured passengers , crashing timbers and machinery , and the hissing of escaping steam . It was over iu a moment , and then the care for the Injured and the inquiry into the cause of the " accident " began . The injuries were confined to persons on the rapid transit train . The pursuing train was a through train of three cars drawn by Engine No. ' 73 , Engineer Jay Palmer In charge . Edward Kelly of 12 Columbia-street , who was in the rear car of the rapid transit train , was found jammed under a seat , his hips badly crushed and bleeding profusely from wounds about the head and body . He seemed paralyzed , but was conscious and was removed in an ambulance to his home . George Cushman , fireman on the rapid transit engine , was badly injured about the head and internally . He was thrown through the cab window to the around by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but had the strength to crawl away to the sidewalk before assistance came to take him home . W. S. Wood of Farmsdaie was injured in the back and severely cut about the face and neck with broken glass . His injuries may prove serious . Roundsman of the Twelfth Precinct , who had just boarded the train , was thrown violently to the floor and badly bruised about the Dead and shoulders . James Walsh was cut about the hands and face with broken glees . Nellie McCoy was standing on the station platform , aui was struck and painfully injured upon the ankle by a piece of broken iron from the wreck . Thomas Carnes , a mechanic , had his arm dislocated , but was able to go home without assistance . Many others received bruises and cuts of greater or less severity , but hurried as quickly as possible away to have them dressed , leaving no names or addresses . The collision resulted in the demolition of the headlights of both engines , the wrenching and twisting of engine No. 105 so that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wreck of the two passenger coaches of the rapid transit train . The forward passenger coach was driven with such force against the engine that the platform of the car and pilot of the engine were completely smashed , mixing splinters and irons in an Indistinguishable jumble . The two coaches were telescoped for several feet , every pane of glass was smashed , and several seats distributed in splinters over the floors . Both coaches were thrown from the track , and their brake rods and trusses were broken in pieces , The track was blocked for nearly an hour before a wrecking train could arrive from the shops at East New-York and remove the wreck . The cars on the through train , tieing very touch heavier than those of the rapid transit train , were not so badly damaged but that it was able to complete its run to Flatbush station , Engineer Palmer of the through train said that he was running on time , and had no intimation that the train ahead of him was not on time . In the absence of advice from any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assume that No. 5 was on time , and if that had been the ease it would have been over a mile ahead of him when he reached Ralph-avenue way station , where he was not due to stop . Tim fog was furthermore so dense that he could not see a train 's length ahead , but as soon as ho did see the cars he reversed his engine so quickly as almost to throw it out of joint ; but the tracks were so wet and slippery that the engine wheels did not take hold of time track , and the impetus with which he was running was hardly affected before the crash came . Engineer Hearn , whose presence of mind in starting his engine forward under full head of steam as soon as tae saw the engine of the pushing train bearing down upon him , probably prevented a much more serious catastrophe , said lie left Van Sicklen station 3 minutes behind time , but had partly made that up when he reached Ralph-avenue station , where he was run down . Ho was sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the same he had been on the lookout for him with ears as well as eyes wide open . For on account of the dense fog prevailing , he would not trust his eyes alone . But eyes and ears were of no avail in such an impenetrable fog and the crash came when he supposed the through train was still a wile away . When the scene of the accident was visited a few hours after the smash-up occurred , not a vestige remained of it . The damaged engine and cars had been removed to the raiiroad hospital at East New-York , and the guard at the crossing was very reticent regarding the occurrence . At the main offices of the company at Long Island city , the reporter was kid that no details of the accident beyond those above given had been received , nor was any explanation of its origin yet made . Both engineers were Informed regarding their running timealand both were supposed to know that they were on time . Their watches were ordered to be set by the standard timepiece at the engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their watches . A thorough investigation had been ordered , and the person or persons responsible for the collision and consequent damage to persons and property would be held to a strict accountability . To the suggestion that perhaps the company itself was not free from some share in the responsibility for the accident for miming both slow and fast trains on one track , the explanation was made that there were but two tracks and the fast through trains were necessary for the accommodation of their suburban patrons . The time table was carefully arranged to provide ample time for the running of all the trains without interference , and the fast trains were under orders to slow down when reaching Atlantic-avenue to a speed equal only to that of the rapid transit trams . but they were not required to stop at the way stations at which the rapid transit trains always stopped . There were ordinarily no obstructions to the view , and but for the dense fog prevailing in the early morning the accident would not have happened , Time officers were glad that no deaths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relieve the distress of those who had met with serious injury .
