txt It was not a day for racing on the water . The heavens hung low and gray over the harbor In the early morning , and the horizon looked as though it had been pot-leaded to match the smooth sides of the Puritan . The shore of Staten Island lay dim and uncertain behind the heavy screen of smoke and mist , against which slender columns of soaring steam shot straight upward from the pipes of a hundred early craft . It was after 9 before a faint circle of azure touched the centre of the dome and began to spread slowly outward like the ripple from a pebble dropped through the surface of a placid pool . The blue light crept down with stealthy tread upon the horizon until the sun , a disk of burnished copper , rode out of its dusky setting and pushed the black ring lower upon the water and land . The first faint touches of the awakening breeze gently stirred the brilliant bunting upon countless slender masts along the river front , and the whistles began their hoarse summons to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Down the harbor pointed the prows of a long line of vessels under tremulous flags , and as a rule thinly peopled with the day 's spectators . Ocean tugs , river steamboats , little private yachts and launches , big passenger carriers , all were busy .. Down through the Narrows plunged the myriad craft and out upon the moveless waste , where the sailing yachts , white-winged carrier pigeons of the sea . had spread their feathers for the lag- . Bard wind . Far down where the yellow light flashed across the golden gaff of Sandy Hook . there lay already a circling clump of hulls , ranging from lofty Sound steamers to slender yachts , which floated like long lead pencils on the placid water . In their centre , with her great white sail hauled up and a cable running from her bow to a slowly moving tug , floated the Puritan in graceful dignity . Her men , in spotless garb , were gathered at her beams , and the gentlemen in blue who occupied her stern were busied with acknowledging the blaring tributes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the colors from her ? tall masts dipped like plumes 11D011 the crests of armored knights bowing in courtly commendation , and the voices of ships and people were blended in a friendly roar . In and out among the forest of penanted spars stole the swift and silent Stiletto , cutting through the water with hardly a fleck of foam in front and leaving scarcely a trace behind . The long black body of the Atalanta lay in the thick of the crowd , her proprietor pacing up and down the bridge with a huge glass in his hand and a soft white hat upon his head . Some lads and young girls , dressed in gay colors , leaned upon her rail , and a dozen sedate and older guests walked her quarter deck . The Utowana , the Fra Diavolo , the Rival , the Corsair , the Stranger , the Norman , the Nourmahal , and fifty more with pennants flying and whistles in salute ran here and there among the statelier boats , their decks and wheelhouses peopled by laughing crowds . Suddenly a gun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure of masts and smokestacks . Her long body had crept in as silent as the night , and none had seen her till this gun marked her arrival . Then broke out a thundering chorus of acclaim . From the mouths of scores of cannon sprang the voice of welcome , and flags were dipped and hats were dotted . Amid the cheers of the multitude the cutter 's owner With pale , immovable face , bowed gravely and coldly . His hands were plunged deep in his pockets , a cigar was held between his firm teeth , and a chilly look of unconcern sat upon his grim features  --  a man to lose or win with equal absence of emotion : His sailors ? great , lounging fellows , with skins like tanned leather and caps of red and blue pulled over their eyes  --  leaned lazily over the sides . Imperceptibly the breeze was growing . There was but a thimbleful of it , but enough to hold the Genesta 's sails steady , and she cast loose from her tug to move about by herself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide , slow circle , with only her main sheet and topsail set . But an airy current was coming , such as it was , and it brought down the Bay the dozens of yachts which had been sulkily longing for it since the first gray waking of the morn . It was the time of waiting . The steamers all were idly drifting , and the sailing . vessels alone moved about . The cheers had died away , and the throug had settled down in expectant , silence . There was now and then from some great vessel to windward the hum of conversation , and once the still languid wind brought the strains of a violin , albeit somewhat involved In a too intricate melody . There was sudden activity . The paddle wheels of the big boats began to revolve and there were some cheers . The two yachts were off , and the great fleet of followers fell in behind them like a vast field of huge white hounds hot upon the trail of twin winged foxes . Presently the steamers , spreading wide from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounded and hemmed them in . From far outside the course the vast bunch of shipping , which was directly in the rear of the racers , made a sight most closely resembling a thickly populated row of wharves . One 's eyes were constantly straining for the trees and buildings beyond , and even in not finding them the illusion could with difficulty be dispelled . The sloops and schooners slowly fell out behind , snow white stragglers from a prismatic horde , but the big lusty steamers plunged steadily , forward , and the smaller ones slipped softly along between . Across the wake of the fleet as it moved up the coast the great hotel at Rocks away stood up above the water as though-lifted Upon giant stilts . The heavy steamers abreast the creeping Genesta and Puritan were lying further over on their sides than the yachts themselves . The crowds had gathered against the rails and had turned them so far over that iu Many instances the vessels were propelled by single wheels . those on the other side revolving impotently in the empty air . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canalboat of unusually graceless pattern , was floundering alone outside the remainder of the fleet , her decks packed with people and a favored few Perched like small black monkeys in herrigging . Mr. Gould 's yacht , running ahead at full speed and then stopping altogether , first distanced all else and then waited for them to catch up . The little Stiletto , cutting the water like a Damascus blade , crossed in and out , covering double space to avoid leaving the others far out of sight . The afternoon sun was beating down with white intensity upon the polished sea , and the breeze , just strong enough to fill the arching sails of the racers , was so nearly with the fleet that it could be but barely felt . So moved the  --  great pageant of the water slowly , sedately , and almost without event . A great ocean steamer coming into port with a broad flash of foam across her surging prow , as some huge monster of the deep with a giant thigh-bone in her fangs , dashed by toward the shore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and only the two contestants , winged down to the calm edge of the glassy ocean , remained among the steaming cohort . Now , as the Puritan drew , with unbending deliberation , ahead of her opponent . the crowd of following vessels stretched out in crescent form , its one horn opposite the racers in toward the shore , and the other stretching around behind them , out to sea . Quickly both yachts came about and put out from the land . The steamers halted , hesitated , backed away , and gave them room to pass . The . Genesta , seeming to get a little the greater pressure from the wind , moved a trifle the faster of the two , but the Puritan soon took up her speed . Then , as the foxes pulled out of the pack , the hounds sprang forward again upon the scent . The foxes bad nearly doubled upon their tracks , though they were going away from the shore . As they drew gradually apart the hounds pressed in between them until it looked ' as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look . The course soon led everybody back into the flock of sailing yachts , which had put straight out to sea when they found themselves unable to keep up with the steam procession on its triangular way . Further and further forward crept the coy Puritan and further and further back fell the Genesta into the pack . Shortly half the hounds ' were abreast of her and she seemed to go more and more to leeward . Another turn in the course of the , . pursued and the pursuer , and now both of them started off again in the direction originally taken . After a short space it began to be ovi ? dent that something was wrong on board the ? Genesta . Her great sail took to flapping in ? the wind , while all the canvas of the Puritan stood out rigid and steady under the pressure of the stiffening breeze . Then . after five or six minutes , the people in charge of the English , cutter succeeded in getting things tightened up again . But serious harm had been done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slipping away . with half the hounds between her and her rival . The flapping . of the ? sail was checked for a little while , and then it began again , to be kept up at intervals so long as that tack was continued . The Genesta fell back and back . The hounds crept ahead , and the race became a ragged , unkempt procession . Even the Old Dominion boat overtook tho Genesta . The pack , growing weary of it all , began to scatter . Some of them branched off and started directly for the turning point . It had begun to be clear that the contest could not possibly be finished within the time prescribed , and the occasion dwindled into an excursion to the lightship and back . The bands struck up , and that , at least , was a relief from the prevailing ' dullness . The compact mass of brightly decorated shipping that had started out to follow the two competing yachts , now covered miles of water , before , behind , and on both sides of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested that the Genesta would look better in tow of a steam tug . Another sad jester gave it as his belief that some wicked American bad fastened a log crosswise under her keel , and a dejected Briton who sat near looked as though he thought so , too , but had refrained from saying it . The sun , gone far upon his down-hill journey to the western hills , sent crimson shafts across the rippling water when the foxes stood upon their next turn outward . They had been more than three hours from the start , without traversing a third of the distance . By 5:80 more vessels ' were concentrated around the stakeboat than were trailing near the far-separated racers , and the Genesta was still falling back out of the contest . At 6 the shining sun , full of blushes for the day 's ending , went down to rest , his kingly couch draped gorgeously in purple and garnet and gold . It would stilt take the Puritan at least an hour to cross the turning point , even If the wind were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flushed with the fading color , turned slowly homeward . The hounds , which had started out to follow , had found it difficult to keep from running away from the foxes , and now came back to be kenneled till the morning . The darkness fell slowly down and wrapped its silken folds about all that floated on the silent sea . Straining eyes could no longer see the tall spars of the racers against the distant sky . Night had come .
