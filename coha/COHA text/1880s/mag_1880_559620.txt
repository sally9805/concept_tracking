THE MONARCHICAL PRINCIPLE IN OUR CON STITUTION . THE people of the States of the American Union are , and have been since the declaration of their independence , subject to two governments-that of the individual States , and a Federal or national Government . Even before the American Revolution , and while the States were still English colonies , there existed in each province a Legislature composed of two Chambers . The House of Representatives was in all cases elected by the inhabitants , though in the greater part of the colonies the Upper House , as well as the Governor , who exercised , with or without a Council , the executive power , were named by the Crown , or by proprietors residing in England , to whom , in some of the provinces , had been accorded almost sovereign rights . At the epoch of the Revolution these governments were replaced by Constitutions adopted by the people , and based on their ancient usages . Governors and Councils and elective Senates were substituted fo* the officers named by the King or by the proprietors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the charter of Charles II till 1818 , and Rhode Island hers till 1842 . In these two States the inhabitants had alway selected the Governors , as well as the two branches of the Legislature . These governments , and those adopted in general conformity to them by the new States subsequently admitted into the Union , con // stituted the local Legislatures , to whom were confided all matters of internal administration , unless expressly conceded to the General Government . " The Revolution of 1776 , " Webster declared , " did not subvert government in all its forms . It did not subvert the local laws and local legislation . " The two Houses of Congress in 1861 , at the time of the commencement of hostilities between the North and South , announced that " war is not waged on our part in any spirit of oppression , nor for any purpose of conquest or subjection , nor for the purpose of overthrowing or interfering with the rights of established institutions of the States , but to maintain and defend the supremacy of the Constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preserve the Union , with all the dignity , equality , and rights of the several States unimpaired , and that as soon as these objects are accomplished that war ought to cease . " The Government of the old Congress was a revolutionary one , whose powers were derived not directly from the people , but from the people through the States , on whom it relied to give effect to its acts . It differed , however , from an international Congress in that the States submitted to be governed , in ordinary transactions , by a majority , without requiring unanimity . A question has been made , in advocacy of centralization , by John Quincy Adams , as well as by Judge Story , whether the States , who declared their independence of Great Britain , as united colonies , could be considered to have ever had , individually , the rights of absolute sovereignty . The suggestion would seem to have been fully met by Upshur , who succeeded Webster as Secretary of State , in his able strictures on " The Commentaries of the Constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court of the United States in 1796 , the powers of Congress , such as were exercised by them from their first meeting till the ratification of the Confederation in 1781 , were in themselves revolutionary powers . The separate States retained all the rights of internal sovereignty , while Congress possessed all the rights of external sovereignty . In a previous case , in 1795 , it had been said that " the powers of Congress were powers revolutionary in their nature , arising out of events adequate to every national emergency and coextensive with the object to be attained . The Congress was the general , supreme , and controlling council of the nation . Congress raised armies , fitted out a navy , and prescribed rules for their government , conducted all military operations both by land and sea , emitted bills of credit , received and sent ambassadors and made treaties , // commissioned privateers , and prescribed rules for the distribution of prizes . In Congress were vested , because by Congress were exercised , with the approbation of the people , the rights and powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Confederation , as they were recommended by Congress in 1777 , and adopted in 1778 by eleven of the thirteen States , and in 1779 by another State , became , after the ratification by Maryland , universally obligatory in 1781 . This Constitution , as it may be appropriately termed , expressly retained for each State " its sovereignty , freedom , and independence , and every power , jurisdiction , and right , which is not by this Confederation expressly delegated to the United States in Congress assembled . " The Government established by the Articles of Confederation consisted of one representative body . In that body were united all the powers , executive , legislative , and judicial , which belonged to the United States . The members of Congress were annually chosen by the States , who might recall their delegates at any period of the year . A single vote was reserved for each State , and in certain cases the agreement of nine of the States was necessary for the adoption of a measure . Congress had power to appoint a " Committee of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their n*imber to preside , " provided that no person be allowed to serve , in the office of President more than one year in any term of three years . " The executive authority of Congress was exercised through departments accountable to them . Congress had not merely ordinary executive and legislative powers , but had authority to create courts of prize , and to constitute tribunals to settle conflicting claims as to boundaries of States and as to titles derived from different States . As regards foreign relations , the Articles accorded to the United States in Congress assembled the greater part of the powers granted to the Federal Government by the present Constitution , including The right and power of deciding alone and exclusively on the subject of peace and war , except in the case of invasion , the sending and receiving of ambassadors and of entering into treaties and alliances . It was stipulated that no State should alter the clauses of any treaties which had been concluded by Congress , or had been proposed by that body to the Courts of France and spain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided that no treaty of commerce should be made whereby the legislative power of the respective States should be " restrained from imposing such imposts and duties // on foreigners as their people are subjected to , or from prohibiting the exportation or importation of any species of goods or commodities whatsoever . " Thus , Congress had not the power of regulating foreign conmerce or establishing uniform duties on importation . Custom-house duties , as well as the regulation of the tariff , were left to the disposition of the respective States . The inefficacy of the requisitions made by Congress on the States , and the refusal , especially of Rhode Island , to grant to the General Government the power to levy duties upon merchandise imported from abroad , were among the most powerful motives for the adoption of the present Constitution . Though there were undoubtedly many persons of influence-at the head of whom may be placed ( though their views were not identical ) Adams and Hamilton-who would have preferred a close approximation to what was deemed to be the theory of the institutions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arrival from France to assume the duties of Secretary of State , under Washington , he found the sentiments of the more wealthy or aristocratic classes to be in favor of an hereditary monarchy , yet we do not remember to have met with a single complaint , before the Convention of 1787 , as to the form in which the authority of the Federal Government was exercised . Indeed , Mr. Sherman , of Connecticut , remarked in the Convention that " the complaints are , not that the views of Congress are unwise or unfaithful , but that their powers are insufficient for the execution of their views . In none of the instructions to the delegates , either at Annapolis or Philadelphia , do we find any reference to an alteration of the then existing constitution of the Confederation , which vested in Congress the executive , legislative , and judicial powers . Much less was the substitution of a President with monarchical powers , for the officer elected annually to be the exponent of the body over which he presided , even suggested . The American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government was essentially different from that established by the Articles of Confederation . Leaving out Rhode Island and North Carolina was a breach of the article which declared them to be perpetual , and that " no alteration at any time hereafter shall be made in any of them , unless such alteration be agreed to in a Congress of the United States and be afterward confirmed by the Legislatures of the States . " The validity of the // new compact , indeed , could not well be considered as authoritatively established till it had received the assent of all the members of the Confederation , which was not effected till Rhode Island , in 1790 , came into the Union . We may here note , what seems to have been overlooked by the advocates of centralization , that the cause of the change in the phraseology of the preamble to the Constitution from " We , the people of New Hampshire , " etc. , which was the form when it was referred to the committee on style , to that of " We , the people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessity of omitting from the enumeration of States Rhode Island , which had never been represented in the Convention . The first suggestion of a national Government , consisting of an Executive , Legislature and judiciary , made in the Convention , is to be found in what was called the " Virginia plan . " So far , however , was this projet from contemplating the adoption of the monarchical principle , that the mover of it , Mr. Randolph , proposed that the executive should consist of three persons , and his failure to enforce these views induced his withdrawal from the Convention without signing the Constitution . The executive power of the United States is vested in the President by the second article of the Constitution . His principal enumerated powers are the command of the army and navy , and of the militia when in actual service , and the nomination , with the assent of the Senate , of ambassadors , judges , and of all other officers whose appointment is not otherwise provided for . Upshur , in his work on " The Nature and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most defective part of the Federal Constitution , beyond all question , is that which relates to the executive department . It is impossible to read that instrument without being forcibly struck with the loose and unguarded terms in which the powers and duties of the President are pointed out . So far as the Legislature is concerned , the limitations of the Constitution are , perhaps , as precise and strict as they could safely have been made ; but , in regard to the Executive , the Convention appear to have studiously selected such loose and general expressions as would enable the President , by implication and construction , either to neglect his duties or to enlarge his powers . We have heard it gravely asserted in Congress that , whatever power is neither legislative nor judiciary , is of course executive , and as such belongs to the President under the Constitution ! Be this as it // may , it is a reproach to the Constitution that the executive trust is so ill-defined as to leave any plausible pretense , even to the insane zeal of party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States the powers of a despot-powers which are wholly unknown in any limited monarchy in the world . " John Quincy Adams , in his discourse on " The Jubilee of the Constitution , " says : " It has perhaps never been duly remarked that , under the Constitution of the United States , the powers of the executive department , explicitly and emphatically concentrated in one person , are vastly more extensive and complicated than those of the legislative . The language of the instrument in conferring legislative authority is , All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States , which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives . ' But the executive authority is committed in unreserved terms . Tun executive power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America . " ' All testimony concurs in assuring us that an office of this magnitude would not have been created unless Washington had been intended to fill it . And in this connection we may well regard the duration of the term , as provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which would induce the first appointment of him would continue him in office for life ; and whether he was to be reelected every four years or every seven years was a matter wholly immaterial . As a general proposition , a term of four years was either too long or too short . If the President was merely to personify the chief of the state , an annual election , like that of the Roman consuls , would have been preferable . If he is really to be an efficient executive , uncontrolled , as the Constitution makes him , by any council , it would require an ordinary life to stamp his policy on the country . What were the probable intentions of the Convention in creating an office for Washington , as a substitute for the hereditary throne to which others in similar circumstances might have aspired , may be deduced from the remarks of Adams , in the same connection with those cited : " The establishment of justice in the intercourse between the nation and foreign powers was thus preeminently committed to the custody of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have had occasion , in discussing , some time since , in this journal , another subject , to refer to the exercise of the executive authority in the absence of all legislative enactments , in upholding // the neutrality of the United States when all the principal states of Europe , in 1793 , were belligerents . That Adams was correct in considering the office to have been created for Washington , we have the concurrent testimony of his contemporaries , with many of whom I was in early life brought ' into frequent contact . I think it may be inferred from the rules of etiquette which , under the advice of General Hamilton , were prescribed to be observed by the President , that an office other than one of four years ' duration was in contemplation , and we may here remark , without any reference to its application to a particular ease , that it is by the letter of the Constitution , and not by any accidental circumstances which may have hitherto prevented the office from being occupied for more than two terms by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be interpreted . The idea of an unwritten law controlling a written constitution would be a solecism . Moreover , it it is by no means certain that , if Washington had not died at the time that he did , he would not have yielded to the importunities of his friends to be a candidate for the then ensuing term . One of the greatest objections to the office as now constituted is , that it presents too great a prize to the ambition of an individual ; that it is utterly removed , as was the imperial power of the Kapoleons , from the entire people , without anything to fill the space between the sovereign and the citizens at large . If the official patronage of the President , when the United States had scarcely three ' millions of inhabitants , was deemed excessive , how may it now be regarded when we have fifty millions ? It is not the augmented number of officials to which the patronage applies , and which possibly is susceptible of some modification under a well-regulated ' " civil-service system , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the projects to which the action of the Executive is ' continually invoked , with the hundreds of millions of capital involved , to legalize monopolies in railroads and other enterprises , that we have to take into account , when considering the powers of ' an American President and the possible danger of their misapplication . Upon examining the debates in the Convention , it would seem that there was no very strict analysis of the powers to be possessed by the new President , and no reference to the discussions then going on in England and elsewhere as to the limitations of a soy -- ereign 's authority in a constitutional monarchy . The elder Adams , , // though by no means averse to a single executive , regarded the present Constitution of the United States as forming a government more properly to . be classed among monarchical than democratic governments . The Duke de Rochefoucauld , in a letter to Dr. Franklin in 1789 , expresses his surprise , in view of the attempts made in France to restrain the powers of the monarch , that we should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially to one whose reelection for life was possible . Franklin , who had advocated a plural Executive , defended the reëligibility of the President . In determining to create a national Government , to consist of an Executive , Legislature , and judiciary , the Convention seem to have gone back for precedents , as to the first named , to the times of the Plantagenets and Tudors , without regard to any of the modifications of the royal authority adopted in modern times . Even the important changes introduced on the restoration of the Stuarts , and by the Revolution of 1688 , and the Act of Settlement , appear to have been overlooked . The great and leading principles of the British Constitution , as now existing , are the personal irresponsibility of the King , the responsibility of ministers , and the inquisitorial power of Parliament . The doctrines of royal prerogative , such as we see them set forth in Blackstone , De Lolme , and other text writers , have been long since obsolete . Nearly a hundred years had elapsed before the meeting of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrest the obnoxious measures presented for his sanction , by the exercise of the veto-power . Nor has the right of the Commons to withhold supplies from the Crown been exercised in a single instance since the Revolution of 1688 . The principal change , effected by the development of the English Constitution at that time , was the virtual transference of the center of the responsibility of the state from the Crown to the House of Commons . Instead of prerogative government , parliamentary government was established . The popular influence in the House of Commons was greatly strengthened by the reforms made a few years since , by which many rotten boroughs were disfranchised and their votes transferred to the now populous districts . But parliamentary reform was a matter which concerned the nobility and large land proprietors rather than the King , whose power , as affecting legislation , had long before ceased to be other than nominaL Even in the time of the Stuarts , Charles II was unable to protect his minister by the prerogative . The case of the Earl of Danby , // impeached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minister could shelter himself by pleading the authority of the Crown , is an illustration of how impotent the royal authority had even then become . Blackstone says that " the Constitution has provided that no man shall dare to assist the Crown in contradiction of the law of the land ; and any man so offending is liable to be prosecuted and punished , through the medium of an indictment or a parliamentary impeachment . " The extent of the royal prerogative as to ministerial responsibility was a source of continuous discussions in the councils of England during the whole of the American war , when George III was attempting to regain somewhat of the power lost through the ignorance and stupidity of his immediate predecessors . It is remarkable that the contest in which the King and his Mixiister , Lord Bute , took such a part , should have been overlooked in the assignment of the functions of the proposed Executive . The very irresponsibility of the King is , as in other constitutional monarchical governments , merely an indication of his utter impotency . It may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can only with safety be a roi fain*ant . Le roi r*gne et ne gouverne pas was applied by Thiers to Charles X. The adage is illustrated by the case of Louis Philippe , who had accepted , on his election to the throne , a constitution imposing ministerial responsibility , and whose talents , which could not remain inactive , lost him his crown ; as , also , in that of Napoleon III , whose liberal measures in according ministerial responsibility preceded his downfall only a few months . Nothing , perhaps , can better explain the monarchical principle in the case of an American President , as contrasted with the formal acts alone permitted to the English King , than a reference to the respective attributes of the Cabinets of the two countries . The term cabinet is in neither country known to the laws , though in both a word of universal use . Since the establishment of parliamentary government , the sole function of the King , which can have any political aspect , is the appointment of the ministers ; but in this he acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indicates when a change in the ministry must take place , and points out the men to whom the administration of the government is to be confided , usually designating some one as the Premier . It is for the statesman , who may then be sent for by the King , to ascertain whether he can form such a Cabinet as will enable him to // control the action of the Parliament . As the duties of the King cease when he has placed in the hands of the ministers the seals of their respective offices , and as it is an organic principle of the English Constitution that no act of the King is of any avail without being countersigned by a responsible minister , it may well be perceived that he can have no great motive for meddling with affairs of state which he has no power of regulating . No king has carried to such an extreme the practical application of this rule as George IV . It was difficult even to induce him to affix his sign manual to an official document . And it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consul had to be delayed months because the King could not be induced to perform even so formal an act as that of affixing his flat to a consul 's commission . In England the officers of state administering the several departments , and who form the Cabinet , really constitute the Government , the head of which is the First Lord of the Treasury for the time being . In the United States , in no possible sense are the different Secretaries vested with any power whatever , except by the authority of the President , who is responsible for their acts , not they responsible for him . So far as what we term the Cabinet is concerned , the sole provision having any possible application to it is an article of the Constitution , which says that the " President may require the opinion in writing of the principal officer in each of the executive departments , upon any subject relating to the duties of their respective offices . " Jefferson , who certainly had as much confidence in his official advisers , among whom were Madison and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was assured by one of its most trusted members , the advice of his Cabinet on , perhaps , the two most important measures of his administration  --  the purchase of Louisiana and the rejection of the treaty concluded by Monroe and Pinckney in 1806 . The former of these measures , as involving the acquisition of foreign territory , was ever regarded as the great constitutional question of the day . President Lincoln , it is understood , seldom or never had any Cabinet meetings . I have already noticed the attributes of the Executive , as referred to by John Quincy Adams , but they have no particular ref erence to the existence of a state of war . In the war of 1812 there were comparatively few attempts to give to the President powers which did not exist in time of peace , nor were any assumed in reference // to persons not connected with the army or navy . Even the extraordinary opposition of Massachusetts and other New England States to the best-defined powers of the Federal Government did not give rise to any direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Supreme Court of the United States to decide finally that , when the militia were called out to repel invasion , it belonged to the President alone to determine when the exigency existed . The writ of habeas corpus , even when issued by a State tribunal , was invariably recognized . All will remember a case where General Jackson , at New Orleans , submitted to the payment of a fine , imposed by a State judge for his disobedience to a writ , which could not have been obeyed without jeoparding the interests of his command and the safety of the city . The Hartford Convention , in the most gloomy period of the war , was permitted to concoct , without any interruption , in secret conclave , the measures which the unexpected restoration of peace alone prevented from culminating in acts of open treason . It was during the war of secession that the powers of the President were exercised to an extent unprecedented in English history . Based on an insurrection in the several States therein enumerated , and without awaiting a meeting of Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President proclaimed , on the 19th and 27th of April , the blockade of the ports of those States . By his proclamation of May 3 , 1861 , he called into service npward of forty-two thousand volunteers to serve for three years , increased the regular army by twenty-two thousand men , and added eighteen thousand seamen to the naval service . Congress at its extraordinary session raised the number of the military forces to more than six hundred thousand men . These acts were sustained by the Supreme Court , on the first occasion on which the question came regularly before it , in the case of the validity of prizes made for violation of the President 's blockade ; and it was declared that , by the acts of the enemy , a public , territorial war existed between the Confederate States and the States which remained loyal to the Union , by which all the residents on the one side of the line , without regard to their individual sentiments , were enemies of those on the other side of the line , and that a war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Constitution . President Lincoln 's Attorney-General had advised him , in 1861 , that it was for the President alone to pronounce upon the political // considerations which determine in what cases a suspension of the privilege of habeas corpus might take place , and that the authority conferred on him by the Constitution was in no wise affected by the powers with which the act of 1789 had invested the judges with regard to the writ of habeas corpus . Immediately after the secession of the South , a direct conflict arose between the executive and judicial power in consequence of the refusal , by order of the President , of a military commander , to obey a writ of habeas corpus issued by the Chief Justice of the United States . Chief Justice Taney , after declaring that a military government had been substituted for the government of the Constitution , says that nothing remains for him to do but to order all the proceedings in the case , with his opinion , to be filed and recorded in the appropriate court , and direct the clerk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the United States . " It will then remain for that high officer , in fulfillment of his constitutional obligations , to take care that the laws be faithfully executed , to determine what course he will take to cause the civil process of the United States to be respected and enforced . " Perhaps a summary of what were the pretensions of the Executive , as regards personal liberty , may be best found in a note addressed by Mr. Seward to Lord Lyons in October , 1861 " It seems necessary to state , for the information of that Government , that Congress is by the Constitution invested with no executive power or responsibility whatever , but , on the contrary , that the President of the United States is , by the Constitution and laws , invested with the whole executive power of the Government , and charged with the supreme direction of all municipal and ministerial civil agents , as well as of the whole land and naval forces of the United States , and that , invested with these ample powers , he is charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppressing insurrection , as well as of preventing and repelling invasion , and that for these purposes he constitutionally exercises the right of suspending the writ of habeas corpus whenever and wheresoever , and in whatsoever extent the public safety , endangered by treason or invasion in arms , in his judgment requires . " At the date of Mr. Seward 's note no proclamation , in the sense of his communication , had been issued , and no intimation of any such intention had been in any way given . On the 24th of September a proclamation establishing martial law was issued , and by an order of the Department of War , of September 26 , 1862 , a na // tional police was established in all the States to watch over the execution of the proclamation . It was not until the act of March 3 , 1868 , that Congress authorized the President to suspend the writ of ha1*eas corpus during the rebellion . A proclamation in accordance with that act was issued on September 15 , 1863 . This proclamation suspended throughout the United States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corpus during the whole of the rebellion , or until modified or revoked by another one issuing from the President . The proclamation made no distinction , as to the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus , between the loyal States and those which were in rebellion . The passage of the act suspending the ha6eas corpus had been preceded by the establishment of military commissions as distinct from courts-martial , thus opening the door to an unlimited abuse of arbitrary power . Nor was it until a late period in the war that the legality of these military commissions came before the Supreme Court . It was in the case of a citizen of Indiana , who had never been in any wise connected with the military forces . He had been tried by a military commission in 1864 , and condemned to be hung on May 19 , 1865 . The Supreme Court , however , in December , 1865 , not only because the provisions of the act of March 3 , 1863 , had been disregarded , but because no act of Congress authorized the action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could justify it , set the prisoner at liberty . A majority of the court were of the opinion that Congress had not the power to pass such an act . It based its decision on this point-on the clause of the original Constitution , which declared that all criminal proceedings , except in the case of impeachment , should be before juries . The motives which led to the proclamations of September 25* and January 1 , 1863 , for the emancipation of the slaves in all the States then in insurrection , but not in the States remaining loyal , have recently been a subject of discussion in this journal , and the nullity of the emancipation edict pronounced by an eminent jurist , who , as an international lawyer , enjoyed the especial confidence of the Administrations of Lincoln and Grant . In the early days of the Government there had been , in the case of the British treaty of 1794 , a grave question as to how far it was obligatory on the part of Congress to supply the funds , or to pass other acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Senate . And it may be remembered that in 1833 our Government , General Jackson being President , under analogous circum // stances , respecting Mr. Rives 's treaty of 1831 , claimed the right of making war for a non-compliance , by the other departments of the Government , with the stipulations of a treaty entered into by the executive power , it being alone known to foreign nations . While the war of secession was still going on , the possession of the Government of Mexico was a matter of belligerent contest . When complaint was made by the French Government of a protest of the House of Representatives against the establishment of the Imperial Government in Mexico , in reply to M. Drouyn de Lhuys , Mr. Seward declared that the powers claimed for the President were as unlimited with respect to international affairs as to internal matters , and that neither the vote of the House of Representatives nor of the Senate could oblige him to modify his policy or take away his liberty of action . It was after the cessation of hostilities and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were put forward on behalf of the executive power , which no longer could claim any attributes from the war power . We have referred to the fact that , at an early period of the war , each House of Congress declared that whenever hostility to the Union ceased , the several States should be maintained with all their dignity , equality , and rights unimpaired . This course had been adopted in several instructions given by President Lincoln before his assassination , having in view the status quo ante bellum ; and , if they were altered in other cases , it was certainly not so with regard to General Sherman , who concluded , on the 18th of April , 1865-the day before the assassination of Lincoln  --  a provisional convention with General Johnston , of the Confederacy , the terms of which were in strict accordance with the pledge made by Congress . Independently of any such stipulation the result would have been the same , according both to our Constitution and to international law . Though some of the earlier decisions of the Supreme Court could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political partisans in the community in which they resided , yet that tribunal ever held that the action of the State governments , which were within the jurisdiction of the so-called Confederate States , in all matters within the scope of the State Constitutions , when it had not for its object aid to the rebels , was valid . The Sherman-Johnston convention , in maintaining the organization of the State governments , as they existed at the time of its // conclusion , would have preserved the autonomy of the States , and taken away every pretext for the revolutionary measures which followed . The functionaries having been elected or named according to the local Constitutions , it would have been easy to remedy all defects of irregularity by obliging them to take the oath of allegiance to the United States . While the Confederates possessed the power , they certainly owed allegiance to them as to a de facto government . That allegiance to a king de facto protects the subject from future question is one of the oldest principles of the English constitutional law . When President Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two Governments , to which , as shown at the commencement of this article , the people of the States of the American Union were subject , but a central Government , ruling over conquered provinces , was substituted for the institutions of their ancestors in at least ten States . President Johnson , having annihilated all the governments in the soi.disctnt Confederate States , issued a partial amnesty , the spirit of which is manifested by the exclusion from its benefits of all persons having the amount of property therein specified . He , at the same time , undertook the task of reorganizing , by his sole authority , the States of the South . The right has never been claimed for a President to institute military governments , even in a conquered country , except during the existence of a war ; and the Supreme Court has decided that such governments can not act in the United States in time of peace . This subject was fully discussed in the questions growing out of our war of 1846- ' 48 with Mexico . President Johnson , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to each State a republican form of government , on his duty as Commander-in-Chief of the army and navy , and , at the same time , as the first civil officer of the United States , declared that the war which a part of the people of the United States had made against the authority of the Union had deprived this part of the people of all government . He named provisional Governors , whose duty it should be to prescribe the regulations necessary in contemplation of the assembling of a convention composed of delegates , who were to be chosen by those among the people of the State who were faithful to the United States , and none others . All were excluded who had not taken the oath of amnesty , as well as those who were not electors under the old Constitution ; the object of the latter provision // being to keep out the negroes , according to the Constitution which was in force immediately before the secession . These conventions were informed by an Executive order that the secessionist States should declare null and void @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abolition of slavery , and repudiate all the debts contracted for the rebellion . These conditions were imposed by the President of his own sole authority . And it may here be noted that on the authority of the ratification under these Presidential Constitutions depends the validity of the thirteenth article of the Constitution . The Constitutions having been modified in accordance with the views of the President , and officers having been chosen in accordance with them , the provisional Governors withdrew . Senators and representatives were chosen and went to Washington to take their seats . The two Houses , however , composed , as they were , exclusively of representatives of the States which had remained in the Union , refused to admit them . It was objected that the President , in convoking the conventions , had surpassed his powers , and that the Constitutions , made without the concurrence of the entire people , including the enfranchised slaves , were null . There were members of Congress who maintained that the secessionist States had lost all political rights , and were only Territories . The Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 18th of December , 1865 , that Amendment Thirteen , which abolished slavery , having been ratified by three fourths of the States , had become an integral part of the Constitution . Among the twenty-seven States that were necessary for its adoption were seven who were not acknowledged as States by Congress . It is not meant to intimate by this suggestion that there is any question as to the abolition of slavery in all and every part of the United States . There are certain accomplished facts which do not require any legislative sanction , but exist by universal assent . The fourteenth amendment , which , among other matters , provides that the representation shall be diminished according to the number of male inhabitants disfranchised , was submitted to those States which had formed Constitutions under President Johnson 's proclamation , and unanimously rejected by them . Nor was it until after Constitutions formed in accordance with the act of Congress to which we shall advert , that either this amendment or the fifteenth , intended to secure universal negro suffrage while it left the naturalized citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ menace of exclusion from Congress , the nominal sanction of the States . * Despite the theory which we find in text-writers , the balance of powers has no existence as a practical rule , unless it be to arrest all action on the part of the Government . As in England at one time the royal authority and then that of Parliament predominated , so it has been as regards the President and Congress in the working of the American system . Embarrassments from a want of accord between the Executive and Congress may well occur , especially in relation to foreign affairs . It so happened that , during the period when the affairs of the United States at the Court of London were confided to me , both Houses of Congress were opposed to the President . The consequence of this was , that nothing on which a question could be raised could be effected by negotiation . One of the subjects in discussion related , as I remember , to the commerce between the United States and the British Provinces . It suited the party in Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth by our Government . The consequence was that , whenever intimation was given to the British Government as to what , in certain contingencies , we might do , I was made to understand that England was perfectly aware that the President 's measures would receive no sanction in Congress . Nor was the trade , which had been closed by English orders in council , reopened till the British Government was assured that the Administration of President Jackson did not maintain the views of his predecessor . Our annals afford many other illustrations of the disadvantages growing out of a disagreement between the different departments of the Government . Cases arising from this source have been a cause of injustice to other countries , who have had good reason to complain that measures , originating with the President 's suggestion , in consequence of which action was had on their part which could not be recalled , have not even been taken into consideration by the Senate or Congress . Of this the treaty made some years ago with Denmark for the purchase of the island of St. Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inhabitants to the cession should be obtained in advance . This was done , and when the treaty came back to Washington , with his Danish Majesty 's ratification , it was not even considered by the Senate . It is by the exercise of the veto-power that the collision between the executive and legislative powers is manifested . Story said , in 1832 , " If we refer to the last forty years of our Government , we // shall see that the veto prerogative accorded to the President has been but rarely used , and it will appear that there exists no case where , when it has been exercised , two thirds of the two Houses have passed a law in despite of the President . " In 1856 President Pierce having refused to put his signature to several acts which appropriated money to make navigable some interior rivers-acts which , according to him , the Constitution did not permit-Congress passed them in spite of his veto . That is the only occasion , before the Administration of President Johnson , where the veto has been ineffectual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; we will now refer to those created by the authority of Congress . The act of the 2d of March , 1867 , designated " An Act for the more effectual Government of the Rebel States , " carries with it , by its very title , the annihilation of the autonomy of ten States . In the clause relative to military commissions , no account was had of the decision of the Supreme Court ; while , for its execution , the power of the President , after the nomination of the military satraps , was set aside . The act declared that , inasmuch as there does not exist in the rebel States any sufficient protection for life and property , the ten States designated as rebel shall be divided into five military districts , and the commander of each invested with supreme authority . He might permit civil local tribunals to have jurisdiction over offenders and to try them , but he had the power , when according to his judgment it was proper , to institute commissions or military tribunals to that effect . The act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States are admitted to be represented in the Congress of the United States , all civil governments which may exist there shall only be considered as provisional governments under the supreme authority of the United States , and subject at any moment to be abolished , nullified , controlled , or suspended . " The supplementary act of 19th July , 1867 , declares that the governments existing at that date in the rebel States are not legal governments ; and , among other provisions , it declares that no commander of a district shall be restrained in his action by any opinion coming from a civil officer of the United States . They had been previously instructed by the General of the Army not to regard the opinion of the Attorney-General as to military commissions which had been sent to them by order of the President . The original act made a condition of these States to repre // sentation in Congress the adoption of Constitutions prepared by conventions of delegates elected by male citizens of the United States , who had resided a year in the State , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servitude . There were to be excluded , both as members and as voters , all those who had been deprived of their franchises for participation in the rebellion , or , by the fourteenth amendment proposed to the Constitution of the United States , had lost the privilege of having a vote . And the Legislatures elected according to the new Constitutions must adopt that amendment before the admission to Congress of their Senators and Representatives . As the act required the naming by the President of the general officers for the command of the districts , and the assignment by him to them of a military force , as an act passed in violation of the Constitution , is an absolute nullity ; and , moreover , as this act invaded directly the attributes of the President in taking from him all control of the military commanders , transferring it to the General of the Army in any case which referred to the exercise of civil authority , it might have been supposed that he would not have permitted it to go into effect . But , having contented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which were not even taken into consideration by Congress , he performed the functions prescribed for him . An attempt was made to obtain the intervention of the Supreme Court , but it was held that no decision on the action of the President or Congress could be made in advance . The constitutionality of these acts was discussed before the Court in December , 1867 , in reference to a case arising from the action of a military commander ; but , though the high tribunal decided that it had jurisdiction of the question , the session was closed before the case could be regularly decided , and the discussion was deferred to a future session . In the mean time an act was passed which excluded the jurisdiction of the Court . In 1868 an opportunity was afforded for bringing into view the provisions of the Constitution in reference to the impeachment of the President . Many articles were presented by the House of Representatives , but no attempt was made to suspend the President from his functions during the trial . The accusations were founded principally on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Secretary of War-despite the civil-service tenure act . As no official or personal crime was imputed to the President , but those who demanded his condemna // tion maintained that it arose from a political act , it may well be a question whether the charge against him was not such as , according to the views of constitutional governments , would have been met by a change of ministry . Had he been arraigned for his repudiation of the local Constitutions of the ci-devant Confederate States and the inauguration of governments under constitutions prescribed by him , and his designation of general officers to the districts , under the act of March , 1867 , which he recognized as being unconstitutional and void , the merits of his case might have been of more interest to posterity . The impeachment provided by the Constitution would seem to form but a slight protection to the people against maladministration , as in the case of an ordinary criminal it must usually happen that his continuance in office during the impeachment would practically render the proceedings against him nugatory . It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established under Johnson 's proclamation and those created under the act of Congress wanted the essential quality of having originated from the people , the States in question have been governed from Washington as conquered provinces for the last fifteeen years . By the election of General Grant the executive and legislative departments were brought into harmony , while it would have required the united action of the two Houses-which did not exist before the second Congress of the present Presidential term  --  to have arrested the intervention , by military force , of the Executive , even in the internal affairs of those States which had submitted to the Constitutions created by Congressional legislation . It is a matter of notoriety that , through the intervention from Washington and frauds in the electoral returns thereby induced , of at least three of these States ( South Carolina , Florida , and Louisiana ) , the present incumbent of the Executive chair occupies his place . Nor can it be too strongly regretted that , in attempting special legislation in regard to the last Presidential election , instead of leaving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two Houses of Congress , the integrity of the judiciary , which we have always regarded as the safeguard of our institutions , was brought into jeopardy . And it is not an aspect of the case more favorable to the stability of our Government , that this irregular procedure was induced by the fact that the outgoing President , notwithstanding his functions terminated before those of his successor commenced , was preparing to employ the military forces of the country to sustain his partisan views . // The most important issue involved in the election is , as we understand it , whether the Congressional pledge given at the cornmenceinent of the war shall be redeemed , as far as circumstances now permit , or whether for all time to come the South shall bear to the North the same relation that Ireland bears to England . The original plan , as suggested in the Convention , was an election by the national Legislature . The advantages of that system would have been not only to introduce that accord between the executive and legislative departments , the absence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the public interest , but would have referred the choice to those whose acquaintance with the public men of the country might have been expected to insure a safe selection . As it was , however , the old idea of balance of power , combined with the desire of compensating as far as possible the small States for the loss of the equal rights which they enjoyed under the Confederacy , induced a compromise of the same character as that which led to the present constitution of the Senate . An advantage was given in the original electoral colleges to the popular vote ; but that was diminished by adding to the number of Representatives two Senatorial delegates ; and , when the original election failed , the vote was by States , each having one vote . It would seem , by the phraseology of the Constitution , that the electors were to be named by the Legislature . But it appears , practically , that even in the very first Presidential election there was a diversity of mode adopted . A change effected in the Constitution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Burr , which was not at the time supposed to be of great importance , materially altered the system . When the parties voted , according to the old rule , it was usual to nominate two candidates , one of them from the North and the other from the South , giving an equal chance to the free States and to the slave States to possess the first Magistrate . Moreover , as it could not be ascertained in advance which of the candidates of the successful party would be the President , it was equally unknown which of them would have the means of favoring their special friends . There was , therefore , less reason for making the election a partisan contest . The exorbitant power of the President induced Senator 11111-house , of Connecticut , in 1808 , to propose an amendment to the Constitution , which had for its object the modification of the monarchical principle , by selecting the President annually by lot from // the members of the Senate , and giving him a position which would scarcely differ from that of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action was , however , taken on it . The office of Vice-President , especially under the present system , would seem to be altogether objectionable . His duties , under ordinary circumstances , being of the most formal character , his selection is often made without regard to the possible succession . This office was unknown to any of the original proceedings before the Convention ; and there would seem to have been no other motive in introducing it at the final adjustment than that of having something to give to both of the two candidates voted for by each State in the electoral colleges , as hereinbefore indicated . It is not so much the mode of election as it is the manner usually adopted of bringing candidates to public notice that commands our consideration . Nothing can well differ more from the electoral colleges of the Constitution , in tended to be composed of the gravest citizens of the State and elected for their general intelligence , than the National Conventions of the two political parties , the nominee of one of whom must be President . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nomination was necessary to point out who should fill the highest offices of the state ; and , after the last term of Washington , a system was adopted by both parties which excluded unknown men . These nominations were made by caucuses of the members of Congress of the two parties . After the Federal party ceased to present any formal candidate , the caucuses of the Democratic party were not abandoned . Monroe and Tompkins were continued for the second term , as a consequence of their first election . But in the election of 1824 , instead of the unanimity which had prevailed at Mr. Monroe 's elections , every Cabinet minister was a candidate . A caucus was then held for the last time . At it Mr. Crawford and Mr. Gallatin were nominated for President and VicePresident . The latter , however , withdrew , at the suggestion , it is understood , of Mr. Van Buren , who contemplated a connection between Crawford and Clay , in which , however , the latter refused to take part . General Jackson required no nomination to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case of Mr. Calhoun , who had been Vice-President under Mr. Adams , and who was retamed on the Jackson ticket as a friend of the chief . Mr. Van Buren , whose rejection as Minister to England was effected by a combination of his prominent political opponents-Clay , Calhoun , // and Webster-was universally pointed to as the associate of General Jackson in his second term . Since then National Conventions have been resorted to by both parties . It is impossible to conceive of any worse political machinery than that which was then inaugurated . And , since these conventions have become systematized , the usual effect has been to exclude from the Presidency the prominent men of both sides . The members are without responsibility to any one . Indeed , probably in a majority of cases their names are not known to half a dozen individuals in the State from which they come . It would seem that there is motive enough , from the danger to which our institutions are exposed from the consequences to which the present system of National Conventions may lead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , enjoying the unrestrained executive power of the whole empire , is to be retained  --  to seek some remedy , as well against an incompetent selection as a disputed succession ; and perhaps there is no better mode of providing against these evils than the adoption of the parliamentary system in all its forms of which France has set us an example , and which is , moreover , recommended by the many other considerations to which we have adverted . On the same day , May 24 , 1873 , that Thiers resigned the Presidency , MacMahon , Duke of Magenta , was elected , and with the concurrence of his predecessor accepted the office that evening . Again , January 30 , 1879 , the Duke of Magenta , submitting himself to the principles of parliamentary rule , and declaring that he would not contend against the will of the people as expressed by their constitutional organs , tendered his resignation . The transfer of power was made in a few hours , M. Jules Gr6vy being elected and inaugurated the same day . France has thus the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pageantry of the English Court ; and how much should we not gain by the substitution of a President elected by and amenable to the Congress for our cumbrous system , and which , by keeping the country agitated every four years , paralyzes every branch of industry ! But as long as the office ret*ins its immense power and the country has no other protection than the intelligence and integrity of the incumbent , it is impossible that too much circumspection can be exercised in the choice of a President . The three hundred dollars of Cr6dit Mobilier dividends or a five-thousand-dollar fee for influence as chairman of an appropriation committee sink into utter // insignificance when we contemplate the 1*onanza of bankers ' syndicates , of railroad monopolies , steamship subsidies , and the great future oceanic canal . It is believed that the popular vote would not be adhered to with much tenacity if the fact were known that , in our most important elections , the President has not been the choice of the people of the United States , or of a majority of the States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the provisions of the Constitution with regard to the constitution of the electoral colleges . In 1860 , the united vote of the Democratic candidates , Douglas , Breckinridge , and Bell , was 2,787,180 , while that of Mr. Lincoln was only 1,857,660 . Mr. Lincoln had , however , 180 electoral votes ; while Mr. Douglas , who stood next to him in the electoral vote , had only 12 . Of the rest , Breckinridge had 72 and Bell 39 . There are objections to an executive consisting of a single person in confederate or composite states , that do not apply to an homogeneous country . Take , for example , the United States , whose interests , North and South , were avowedly , during the whole period of slavery , antagonistical . It can not be doubted that a single executive possessing the immense prerogative enjoyed by the President of the United States might influence legislation , as well as the administration of the Government , in favor of his section to the prejudice of the others . Some attempts were made , during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a plan by which the rights of each section might be protected . Mr. Calhoun proposed a dual executive , having a legislative and executive action , as one of the means of preserving the balance of power between the two sections . The discordant interests of Austria and Hungary induced the establishment of two general governments in the Austro-ilungarian monarchy . It ordinarily happens that when , in a confederacy , there is one head , the office is attached not to the individual but to the prominent state . For instance , in the present empire of Germany , it is the King of Prussia , not as an individual , but King of Prussia , who is Emperor of Germany . And the subordination of the other states of Germany to Prussia is always recognized . But I know of nothing more suitable to our condition than the present Constitution of Switzerland . The Swiss Constitution provides for the exercise of the supreme executive authority by a Federal Council , composed of seven members , only one of whom can be chosen from the same canton . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Houses of the Legislature ( Federal Assembly ) , denominated the National Council and Council of States , the f ormer corresponding to the House of Representatives , the latter to the Senate , of the United States . From this Federal Council the President and Vice-President of the Confederation are annually appointed by a vote , also of the two Houses ; but their functions are not materially different from those of the other members , and four members are required to sanction every deliberation . The duties of the Federal Council consist especially in superintending the national relations of the confederation . In conclusion , I would remark that the views here stated , however illustrated by recent events , have exclusively in view matters of permanent interest . So far , indeed , as regards the contest now pending , the verdict of the people will be rendered before this article comes regularly into the hands of the subscribers . W. B.
