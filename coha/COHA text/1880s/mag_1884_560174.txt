THE BASIS OF POPULAR GOVERNMENT . FENEL6N spoke from his generous heart when he said , " I love my family more than myself , my country more than my family , and the whole world more than my country . " Unfortunately , the converse of this is true of men in general , who love themselves first , their families next , then their country , and the whole world hardly at all . Hence the inefficacy of arguments intended to show that abuses in which an age takes delight will bring harm to posterity . Those who prefer the lower to the higher self will make no sacrifices for the good of their descendants , as one who is indifferent to the living will surely be unmindful of the dead and the unborn . We care nothing for ancestors who are a few degrees removed from us , unless their lives furnish food to our vanity , and it is not probable that any man is made unhappy by pondering on the destiny that may await his great grandchildren . Declaimers against the evils of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state or of civilization , alarm no one , because few have faith in such forebodings , and fewer still care to trouble themselves about the condition of mankind a hundred years hence . The masses of Europeans and Americans are not at all concerned for the wel // fare of the populations of Africa and eastern Asia ; they are too far away . And time separates even more than space . Here in America , to within a quite recent date , we have been so wholly under the influence of unreasoning optimism and youthful self-complacency , that prophets of evil have appeared to us to be simply men of unsound mind . As a people we have been , and probably still are , believers in the fundamental error that denies the original taint in man's'nature ; and hence we are persuaded that , in a society like ours , where the restraints , oppressions , and injustices of past ages have ceased to exist , the tendency to higher modes of thought and conduct , to purer and worthier life , is as irresistible as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the advent of democratic rule , and the promise of boundless good to the race with which the new order of things was ushered in , together with a knowledge of the terrible and indescribable evils that unjust laws and tyrannical governments have brought upon mankind , were sufficient to blind them to the common facts of personal experience , and to hide from philosophers a truth known to every mother and every nurse , that man is born not only weak and ignorant , but wilt such a tendency to what is vicious that each generation of children , if left to the impulse of their will , would inevitably relapse into barbarism . The bent of human nature is toward what is beneath , and the natural course of society is downward . If we consider the history of our race , we find emergence from barbarism to be the fortunate lot of exceptional people , who by some divine impulse are borne upward , and , having reached a certain height of civilization , hasten to descend , not , in deed , along the rugged paths of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in the open and easy way of sensual delights . Among the most privileged nations , only the smallest number attain to excellence , and their high endowments , whether moral or intellectual , depend upon unceasing effort . The great body of their fellow-countrymen are held to be civilized on account of their association with these better specimens of the race , just as a vulgar man is called noble because he descends from ancestors who are believed to have been really so . Few men love the best , or seek the highest , or strive to shape their lives upon the model of exalted ideals ; and the truly excellent , whether in conduct , literature , or art , is never popular . The crowd neither follow // in the footsteps of the noblest characters , nor read the best books , nor love the master-works of genius . It may , indeed , be said to be a law of human nature that attraction from below is stronger than attraction from above . The multitude live in the senses , not in the soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material objects . Hence the fatal tendency to superficial views of life and to low notions of conduct . How long and patiently must not a man labor to bring his natural endowments to some kind of perfection ? And the moment he ceases to toll marks the beginning of degeneracy . But this tireless struggle is hard to weak nature , and the multitudes yield to the current , and are carried farther and farther away from the heights their young eyes looked up to with hope , all aglow with the light of ideal worlds . The same law prevails in families . But very few rise to eminence , and they , having produced two or three men of mark , break up and are lost in obscurity . It is difficult to understand why we should imagine that there is in human nature a principle of indefinite progress . There is , indeed , in the world to-day more knowledge than there has ever been , more wealth , more comfort , more liberty ; but , apart fror*i the fact that all this is in great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted as a super . natural faith , supplying supernatural motives and helps , the essential quality of human life lies elsewhere than in knowledge , wealth , comfort , and liberty . Men and nations fail , not for lack of these , but for lack of moral strength . Conduct , to use a current phrase , is three-fourths or four-fifths of human life ; and man is to such an extent a moral being that failure in conduct is essential , hopeless failure . The sense of life , of its goodness , its joyousness , its inestimable worth , springs from right-doing , not from fine thinking , or the enjoyment of political freedom , or the possession of wealth . Pure hearts are glad , and they who tread the paths of duty find God 's world sweet . This is not a theory , but a truth that all men may verify by actual experiment , and to it the unvarying testimony of the past bears witness . That moral life is joy , peace , gladness , contentment , fulness of life , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and it is also the actual experience of every human being who walks obedient to the voice of God 's stern daughter , Duty . This is not to say that right-doing necessarily makes people happy , but that it gives them a deeper sense of the value of life // and of its sacredness , a better insight into the goodness of all things , a knowledge that evil is accidental , and in no way able to deprive man of the blessedness that comes of being in conscions harmony with the eternal laws of God 's universe . To be morally right is to be absolutely right , because the infinite truth of what is , is more nearly revealed to the conscience than to the intellect ; and the more closely we conform to the law within , the more God-like does the whole world external to ourselves grow to be . In this way moral excellence , awakening the deep and boundless harmonies that sleep within the soul , brings us near to the heart of love and creates faith in immortal life . When character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel that this union is everlastingly true , good , and fair ; and hence that our real self belongs to an order of things that is imperishable . Therefore , the good are strong , and so , happy , since weakness is misery . Just as right-doing leads to completeness of life and to belief in life everlasting , so wrong-doing begets a disesteem of life and unbelief in man 's God-like destiny . " Let us eat and drink , for to-morrow we die , " are the words of those who fail in conduct . The irtore we live in the senses , the less becomes our faith in the value and duration of life . Hence the recklessness of those who have thrown aside moral restraint , and the fatal facility with which they take their own and others ' lives . Thought , to be true and healthful , must complete itself in act . It is not , therefore , its own end , but aims at something beyond . In the same way faith , hope , and love tend to action , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all sides the truth is borne in upon us that the test of human worth is to be found in character , and . not in a cultivated mind , or a brilliant imagination , or in beauty of body , and much less , of course , in things that are purely material , as money and machinery . Progress , then , is not possible where there is moral decadence , since conduct is threefourths of life , and character the real test of man 's worth . The literary excellence and refined civilization of the age of Augustus and Louis XIV . were not only wholly powerless to arrest the decay of Roman and French society , but served rather to hasten its dissolution ; and his tory testifies to the truth that the possession of wealth destroys the virtues by which it is created . If we turn to our own country , and to what , unfortunately , we must still call an experiment , to determine whether the best // possible kind of government may become an enduring fact , we can not fail to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion as to the success or failure of this noblest effort at selfgovernment ever made by mankind , the truth that I have here sought to develop must be borne in mind . Human worth is moral worth ; man 's proper measure is character ; conduct is three-fourths of life ; right-doing brings the deepest and most lasting content and gladness to the heart of man , and thus creates a sense of completeness and harmony that nothing else can give . Righteousness is strength . As the physical forces of the boundless universe work together in every drop of water to give and maintain its form and nature , so the infinite power that makes goodness the best , codperates with every man who obeys conscience , to uphold and confirm his heart . Goodness of life tends to length of days , to health , to success . Man lives by faith , hope , and love ; and fidelity to conscience keeps him close to the clear-flowing fountain-head of faith , hope , and love . To think finely is well ; to dream nobly is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beauties of the universe gives delight ; but not in doing any of these things , but in doing right , lies the worth and goodness of life . And this great principle affects families and nations as it affects individuals . Conduct leads a whole people along the rngged and difficult ascent of progress ; and , without it , neither knowledge , nor wealth , nor numbers , nor machinery , nor fertile soil , nor healthful climate , tior* all these together , with whatever else there may be that is good and helpful , can save them from decadence and ruin . Whether alone or one of a multitude , man fails not for lack of anything else than virtue . That a democratic form of government ought to be the best , the proverb , " If you wish a thing done , do it yourself , ** would seem sufficiently to prove . Again : Since the end of government is to promote the welfare of all the governed , and since each man is more than any one else interested in his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case awakens attention and begets intelligence&gt;in matters therewith connected , it would seem to follow that to give to all men a due degree of influence in the government is the surest way to promote the welfare of all . And this conclusion gains weight when we reflect that whoever hopes more from his own industry and merit than from fortune and favor is a natural republican . On the other hand , there // seems to beno doubt but the government of the best men is really the best government ; and , since this is so , that a democratic government , where the people are corrupt , is necessarily a bad government , because the vicious will not only not elect the best , who will not stoop to their level , but , by virtue of the law of affinity , will choose the baser sort of men . It was this kind of democracy that repelled Landor - " Because , " said he , " I have always found it more jealous of merit , more suspicious of wisdom , more proud of riding on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above them , more fond of loud talking , more impatient of calm reasoning , more unsteady , more ungrateful , and more ferocious ; above all , because it leads to despotism through fraudulence , intemperance , and corruption . " As the liberty of criminals means license , so the freedom of the immoral means corruption . Declaimers are fond of affirming that man naturally loves liberty , when the truth is , he only naturally hates restraint . Liberty is obedience to law ; and is it not absurd to assert that men are naturally obedient to law , when religion , education , civil authority , criminal codes , and other means have to be continually employed to enforce respect f or authority ? Do savages , barbarians , and children love the moral restraint without which it is not possible even to think of liberty ? Have not men in all ages called liberty the opportunity to seek their own interests and gratify their passions by inflicting wrongs upon their fellow-beings ? All virtue is rare , but love of liberty is a rare virtue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to unselfish purposes and aims as large as the love of Christ . Let us not imagine , then , that a free government such as ours rests upon the natural instincts of the human heart . We love the highest when we see it , but the low can not see the highest , and only the best know the best . Our great good fortune lies in our infinite wealth of opportunity . Whoever feels within himself force of mind or heart or body , finds work to do that brings reward ; and as he moves forward , avenues open out at every step that lead or promise to lead to much that men most eagerly desire . Through these thousand channels the flood of energy finds outlets , and catastrophes are avoided . But opportunities diminish with the and the d growth of population development of the country ; and with the whole world rushing in upon us , we shall soon have to find a way to control destructive agencies that our physica. resources and sparse population now render comparatively // harmless . We must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the century we shall have nearly a hundred million people ; our wealth will be greater than that of any other nation ; our machines will be the most perfect ; and the comforts of life will here be within the reach of larger multitudes of men than have ever enjoyed them . All this will come like the leaves in spring-time , and like the fruit in summer ; but numbers do not constitute excellence , and machinery does not fashion souls , and comforts do not nourish heroes . If the outcome of our civilization is simply to be the greatest possible number of well-clad and well-fed human beings , there is little need of giving serious thought to such a lubberland of mediocrities , and we may as well agree with Renan , who thinks us farther removed from true social ideals than any other people , or with Carlyle , who maintains that the stupendous feat we have hitherto accomplished is to bring into existence in an incredibly short time more millions of bores than ever made earth dismal before . To develop the highest man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest men , is in every way more desirable than to dig gold or build *ai1ways ; and if we are to stand in the van of all the world , we must have other proofs to show than our money , our corn , our numbers , and our machines . " The end of all political struggle , " says Emerson , " is to establish morality as the basis of all legislation . " It is manifest that our politics have become essentially immoral . Neither party dares to touch any question that is higher or holier than that of tariff or no tariff , looking upon a wretched financial problem as the only vital interest for a people who lack not money , but virtue . The eternal principles of justice and morality are ignored , and our electoral contests have degenerated into mere struggles for office ; and to suggest that conscience ought again to assert itself in American politics is to make one 's self ridiculous . And all the while the evidences of moral decadence stare us in the face . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth of life that is the unfailing mark of weakening character and sinking morality . Nothing is longer certain for us but what we see or touch , so that the whole ideal world , which is our only true world , is become a dream ; and the young start out in life with no higher aims than to get money or office . Nothing is left among us that is venerable , or great , or divine We look upon God 's universe with the spirit of irreverence in which the // author of " Innocents * beheld the shrines of religion and art in Europe and Asia . Our smartness renders ns incapable of admiration , of awe , of reverence . We know what the stars are made of , and think them not more wonderful than an electric light . The press of our great cities is the chronicle of our life . What does it record ? Murders , suicides , robberies , thefts , adulteries , fornications , divorces , drunkenness , gambling , incendiarism , fraudulent bankruptcies , official peculations , with now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and property by mobs . This fills the news columns . In the editorials we meet with reckless assertion , crude generalization , special pleading , ignorant or dishonest statement of half-truths , insincere praise and lying abuse of public men , frivolous treatment of the highest and holiest subjects - all thrown into that form of false reasoning and loose style which is natural to minds that have not time to learn anything thoroughly . And this halfmental and half-bestial brothel-and-grog mixture , brought from the great cities by special trains to every household , falls like a mildew upon the mind and conscience of the people , taking from them a.l relish for literature , all belief in virtue , all reverence for God and nature , until one may doubt whether we have not lost the power of intellectual and moral growth . We have no one institution great enough to inspire the love and enthusiasm that are the soul of national unity . Our public life regards material interests alone ; our theory of education is narrow and superficial , aiming chiefly to develop smartness , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other to foster vulgarity ; and thus we have no ideal to elevate and guide us or fill us with faith in our destiny . In the meantime , the manners of Europe threaten us , and we are permitting the rapid growth of social customs that are helpful enough to tyrants , but pernicious in a democratic republic . Austere manners lead to political liberty and uphold free governments , and a people given over to sensual delights , to foolish frolicking and dissipation , love license more than freedom ; and , ifyoubut give them wine and a show , care not what master rules over them . The Puritans of New England had the truest instinct of political liberty , and that instinct made them serious , earnest , austere , averse alike to ehildish gayety and to loose conduct . It were better for us , if our liberty is dear to us , to have the Puritan Sabbath than the Pagan Sunday of parts of Europe . // " Let the passion for America , " says Emerson , " cast out the passion for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life something to appeal to minds and consciences as well as to interests ; for it is the disgrace of a nation that its chief concern should be a question of money , and that the significance of political contests should lie in the emoluments of office ; and while this state of things continues , the best men will remain aloof from the struggle , and leave the direction of public affairs in the hands of the baser sort . We need an ideal to which all noble minds and generous hearts may rally , and this ideal here in America at the present day can neither be intellectual nor religions ; it must be moraL We are too essentially practical to be deeply interested in intellectual truth , and onr religious divisions are so various and so far-reaching that a great national regeneration springing from a common faith is not now possible ; but there is still left in the mass of the people a deep moral earnestness , which , if it can be called into action , may yet lift the whole nation to higher and purer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the way of such a movement . It is not possible to arouse the American people thoroughly , except through.political agitation , and both these parties , which have become simply mills to grind the people 's corn to make bread for office-holders , oppose the whole weight of their organized power to every honest effort to bring about a moral reformation ; and so long as the multitude is led by them , our worship of majorities will throw an air of quixotism over every attempt to stem the torrent of corruption . The welfare of the nation demands that the one or the other cease to exist ; that a new party , springing from the deep yearning of multitudes for purer and nobler national life , and upheld by the enthusiasm inspired by high moral aims and purposes , may take its place . But the Democratic party is neither open to ideas , nor subject to death ; and our hope now seems to lie in the defeat of the Republican party in November . This party originated in a righteous indignation against slavery , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonds of national unity . It has done its work , and now bars the way to other conquests . Multitudes of its adherents perceive this , and they are waiting for its death-knell as the signal of hope . The limits of this article do not permit me to discuss the problems that the new party will have to solve . They will relate to moral rather than to material interests . There is , first of all , // the question of education . The dread of religious teaching in the common schools has deprived them of moral influence , and they cultivate a faculty instead of forming men . Then there is the question of the liquor traffic . The most hideous phase of our political life is that which comes of its association with barrooms , and the remedy for American pauperism is not a wage or rent theory , but economy and sobriety . There is , also , the question of woman-suffrage . The experiment will be made , whatever our theories and prejudices may be . Women are the most religious , the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , and it is not easy to understand why their influence in public life is dreaded . They are the natural educators of the race , and they and their children are the chief victims of drunken men ; and since men have been unable or unwilling to form a right system of education or to find a preventive of intemperance , there can be no great harm in giving in these matters at least an experimental vote to women . Then there is the question of the licentious and obscene press , as unlike a free press as a. sot is unlike a true man , which is a more deadly and insidious poison than the adulterated liquor that a deluded people pay for the prP*ilege of drinking . With us , material interests take care of themselves , since the whole energy of the people turns upon the development of our physical resources ; and hence the duty of those who have faith and hope in the destiny of America lies elsewhere . In the presence of a whole people thinking chiefly of money ; talking of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to get hold of it ; adulterating food and drink to make it ; displaying it in all its vulgar glitter in their homes and equipages and on their bodies ; discussing and solving all problems , even questions of the soul , from a financial point of view ; making money the measure of the value of time ; determining the worth of education by the power it develops to amass wealth , and even going so far as to hold a * money the nearest equivalent of himself ,  --  in the presence of such a people there is need of power to proclaim , as with the voice of God , that the goodness of life lies in right-doing , and not in lucre . " That every gift of noble origin Is breathed upon by Hope 's perpetual breath ; That virtue and the faculties within Are vital ; and that riches are akin To fear , to change , to cowardice , and death .
