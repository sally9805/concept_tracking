ARTICLE V. - " PROGRESSIVE ORTHODOXY . " Progre88ive Orthodoxy . A contribution to the Christian interpretation of Christian doctrines , by the Editors of " the Andover Review , " professors in Andover Theological Seminary . iloughton , Muffin &amp; Co. 1886 . THIS book has a history ; and it is impossible to separate the history altogether from the book itself in an intelligent review . Its very publication is a sort of challenge to the Christian public , a gauntlet thrown down into the arena of religions debate . It is the production of a school of Christian thinkers who claim to represent a new theological movement , and is offered as a " contribution " indicating the fundamental lines along which that movement proceeds . For ourselves , we deprecate controversy , and our studies of the history of controversy tend to lessen our faith in its theological value . Undoubtedly the great controversies which have agitated the Christian church have promoted the development of certain types of theology , but whether theological science has been so much the gainer , may well be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theological inquiry and discussion inevitably tends to produce results that are onesided and extreme . After all , the best contributions to theological thought have come from thinkers who have been allowed quietly and freely to pursue their investigations . The very defects which still cling to Christian theology , as an inheritance from the past , may be traced back to the controversial epochs . The peudnium in seasons of religious excitement is made to swing strongly one way or the other , and it is only when a season of peace has followed that it has been able to settle into its true center of rest . We hail , therefore , the indications that the recent development of the controversial spirit in our Congregational Zion is subsiding . Perhaps the time has already come when the questions at issue may be considered in the spirit of Christian candor and brotherly helpfulness . Certainly the book before us deserves such considera // tion . Though it bears the marks of warfare , it is free from theological rancor and bitterness , and appeals in true Christian fashion to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our most conspicuous Theological Seminaries , it may well assume to speak with something of authority , and its utterances demand the most careful examination . Certain general characteristics of the book may first be noted . On its very face is its claim of essential orthodoxy ; and we can not say that the content of the book belies the claim . It utters no uncertain sound in regard to the great central doctrines of the Gospel . In certain lines its orthodoxy is even intense . The universality of sin , the need of Divine intervention and atonement , Christ the God-man , the supreme efficacy of his Gospel ,  --  these cardinal truths of Christianity are maintained unflinchingly ; and whatever strictures may be made upon its eschatological views , they certainly have no affinity with what passes under the name of Universalism . It explicitly holds to final judgment with its everlasting issues of life and death . The book also claims to be conservative . There is no expressed disposition to break with the past . Rather there appears clearly an effort to preserve connection with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is treated as if it were the historical and logical development of the New England construction of the Atonement . The book also plants itself squarely on the principle of the supreme authority of Scripture . This is expressly asserted in the introduction , and is implied throughout Rationalism is feared and opposed . Other views are criticised because of their rationalistic tendencies . It is declared that " the real issue is between Christianity as a supernatural redemption and mere naturalism . " Another noticeable feature of the book is its dogmatic character . In this it betrays its origin . Born of controversy , it wears the controversial garb . . What the Germans call tendenz , that is , a theological aim and motive , runs throughout . This is frankly acknowledged from the outset . And it becomes more and more evident as the reader advances . The book is the result of an effort to construct a new theodicy or defence of the Divine administration of the world ,  --  one // problem especially being singled out for consideration . The question placed in issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a being of perfect righteousness be defended in his dealing with that large fraction of mankind who are not made acquainted with Christ and his gospel ? The solution offered by the new theodicy is that of a probation for such in another life . This solution is at first suggested tentatively . Even when directly considered in the chapter on Eschatology , it is still treated as a " related question , . " that is , as secondary and non-essential to the general course of the argument , and the conclusion reached is only " probable . " And yet it is plainly this solution which furnishes the theological motive of the whole discussion , and it is to strengthen its " probability " that the main assumptions of the book are introduced . So that while this theory of a probation in another life is not openly pressed to the front , and is treated always as a speculation rather than a dogma , yet the premises which logically involve this conclusion are so resolutely asserted and sustained that it is plain the writers believe the conclusion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed in the very introduction , in language which shows the motive of the whole discussion . Having stated what is called the " guiding principle " of the book , the writer goes on to say : " If we have been true to a great and cardinal doctrine of our holy religion , and have developed its necessary implications and consequences , we ask that any further discussion of these conclusions should recognize the connection with the principle from which they are derived , and their legitimacy , unless this principle is itself tc# 1e alandoned . " ( The italics are not ours . ) We are thus brought to the heart of the book . Its fundamental assumption is that direct knowledge of Christ in his incarnate condition is essential to full moral responsibility and probation , and therefore the only basis of Divine judgment . Christianity , by which is meant the historical manifestation of Christ in his incarnate person and gospel , is the absolute universal religion , that is , embraces within itself all morally decisive religious truth and power , and the relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is the absolute and universal principle of final judgment ; so that all the issues of // Heaven and Hell hang simply on that relation . Acceptance of the historic Christ is the only ground of salvation , and rejection of him is the only ground of retribution . This is the major premise . The minor premise is : a large fraction of the human race have had no direct knowledge of the historic Christ , and therefore have had no true probation in this life , and are not morally fitted to be the subjects of the Divine judgment . Hence the conclusion : A righteous and merciful God can not and will not bring such to judgment until a full probation is allowed them ; and hence the " probability " that the historic Christ will be proclaimed to them in all his saving power in another life , as an essential preliminary to their standing before him for final award . Such is the plain syllogism of the book . And we are ready to concede at once that , if the major premise is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but even inexorable . That it is " new theology " is frankly declared , and as readily conceded . It surely has no connection with the earlier theology of iNew England . The claim put forth that it has such a connection , seems to us without foundation . The New England doctrine of the Atonement as having a relation to the whole race , is entirely different in standpoint and principle from the universalism of this book . New England theology was essentially Calvinistic . It held firmly to a doctrine of Divine decree which was exclusive as well as inclusive , and while it allowed that the atonement was sufficient as a mediatorial work and embraced all mankind in its historic range , yet it practically and intentionally limited that range by its doctrines of election and grace which made the atonement operative only for the elect . In fact the particularism of original Calvinism had full force in the * consistent Calvinism " of the New England schooL Professor Park in his " Introductory Essay " to " The Atonement , " says : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - that of the elder Calvinists , but their theory of the Atonement is more harmonious with itself , and with other parts of the evangelical faith ; and their mode of expressing this theory is more precise , unequivocal , scientific . In the su6startce they are Calvinistic ; in the form , they are Edwardean ; hence they have been called Edwardean Calvinists . " And Dr. Griffin , // comparing the views of old school and new school on the question whether the atonement is limited or general , says : " The dispute turns out to be chiefly about words . " The only element of universalism to be found in the New England theology , is its philosophical doctrine that , by reason of " natural ability " there is a possibility that all men may be saved through Christ 's atonement . But it does not allow that the possibility will be realized in the case of the non-elect , much less does it allow that possibility to continue into the future life . How the doctrine of this book is " a necessary implication of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the atonement , " we are at an utter loss to see . It might be thought that these views have some affinity with the school of Maurice in England and Scotland , since the universal character of the atonement is made by that school the key note of its whole theology , and the universalistic element is pushed to its extreme limits . But its definition of Christianity is widely different from that of this volume . It knows of no such limitation of God 's method of redemption in this world as is here supposed , but rather enlarges its conception of " historic " Christianity to the utmost extent . Thomas Erskine in his book , " The Unconditional Freeness of the Gospel " speaks of " that Gospel which was preached to Adam , " and of course also to his posterity , and believes " that he who was the first offender was also the first monument of saving grace , " declaring that " the promise of the Saviour did for our first parents , in the extent in which it was really apprehended by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came in the flesh , did for all who received him . As many as received him , to them gave he power to become the sons of God . ' " If we seek to connect these views with the earlier theology of the church , we must go back to Clement . of Alexandria at the beginning of the third century . He represents Christ as preaching the gospel in Hades for the sake of those who had not heard the gospel in this life . And in one remarkable passage he declares that it would be arbitrary and unjust for God either to punish or save those who had not had the opportunity to accept or reject Christ . This seems to be precisely the view under consideration . But Clement 's standpoint is different . // He regards all punishments as " saving and disciplinary , leading to conversion. ** " The active power of God is everywhere and always at work " in saving " all that turn to him whether here or elsewhere . " His doctrine is not that of a special future probation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgment , but that of a probation continuing indefinitely for all , with the purpose on God 's part of ultimately saving all . It is restorationism . The truth is that the theological parentage of this book is recent and German . We do not know how far the writers of it would acknowledge their obligations to Dr. Dorner . But so close is the likeness of its peculiar views ( and even phraseology ) to those of Dr. Dorner 's " System of Christian Doctrine , " that it may be said of them as was said of Philo in his relation to Plato , " Either Plato Philonizes or Philo Platonizes . " We say this , not as joining in any outcry against German theology . The indebtedness of Christendom to the Germans in all departments of theological science is simply incalculable . For Dorner as a theological thinker we have the greatest respect . lie should be read by those who can read him aright . But he is an unsafe theological guide . His method is metaphysical and speculative . He builds on abstract a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that Church History and Scripture alike are colored and distorted in his theological system . But the important question in regard to these views is not whether they are new , but whether they are true . Let us then examine the fundamental premise a little more closely , and note what are its implications . The premise is that Historical Christianity , being the absolute and universal religion , affords the only adequate basis of a full probation ; and that knowledge of the historic Christ , and the relations growing out of it , are the only tests of final jadgmeut . Here it is implied that before Christ 's coming the world was without a salvable knowledge of God ; that the Divine method of redemption did not properly begin to act among men until after the Incarnation ; that the only religious light accessible to Pre-Christian times , the Abrahamic covenant excepted , was that of reason and conscience ; that apart from the Christian revelation the world // 255 has always been and still is under a legal , not a gracious , dispensation ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge of Christ , at least in manifestation , is one of mere justice , and not one of mercy , though holding himself in an attitude of forbearance ; that a true moral probation for such is impossible , since no motives or influences can reach them from the light of nature or conscience sufficiently powerful to move to any successful moral endeavor , or to bring them into a loving and saving relation with God ; the inference from all which would seem to be , that the heathen are not complete free moral and responsible agents , and that the present life is not for such a place of probation at all , but merely a stage of developing moral consciousness to be completed in some later stage of being when probation shall properly begin . These implications are not simply our own deductions . They are the staple of the volume before us , reiterated with varying language , but in substantial unison. * What now shall be said of these positions ? Are they to be accepted as valid and true ? For ourselves it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to convict them . Christ is indeed the Saviour of the world , " neither is there salvation in any other " ; but Christ was before the Incarnation , as the eternal Son of God . The Divine method and work of saving man did not wait four thousand years till he should appear in the flesh . " My Father worketh hitherto and I work . " The Divine movement of redemption began as soon as sin made it necessary . This book acknowledges that Abraham and his people received a special preparatory revelation looking toward Christ ; but the Biblical records carry the redemptive movement back of Abraham to the head of the race . It was Adam himself who received the first promise of mercy and hope . The Old Testament is as really a gospel as the New . The good news " was proclaimed from the beginning . Enoch * The author of this article may be quite correct ; but we had not ourselves understood the Andover opinion to be that those who lived before the coming of Christ , whether Jews or heathen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case they repent under the light given to them ,  - -  are in danger of perdition , but that the salvation of such is completed through the full disclosure of God in Christ as their Redeemer. - Ed. of the New Englander and Yale Review. // heard it , and Noah , and that primitive revelation of grace descended through the successive generations of mankind , until it reappears in Abraham to be raised through him to a still higher stage . The position that mankind were under a purely legal relation to God until the coming of Christ is contrary to the plain teachings of Scripture . It represents a gracious dispensation as coming in at the outset , and the whole of the Old Testament is filled with its light . The writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews puts Enoch and IN oah , as well as Abraham , into the list of men of faith . Melehizedec and Job , who were entirely disconnected with the Abrahamic covenant , belong to it also . Paul in the Romans declares that Abraham was justified not by works but by faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a legal basis but on a gracious and merciful one ; and then he enlarges his statement to make it include the whole Gentile world . " That he might be the father of all them that believe , though they be not circumcised ; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also . " Paul does not condemn the whole heathen world as lost outside of Christ , as this book intimates . He shows that all , both Jew and Gentile , are alike under sin , and on that premise bases the need of the gospel for all , and proceeds to develop the gracious character of the gospel , as intended to save all . Paul regarded the gospel as universalistic in this sense , that its scope and movement and saving efficacy was as universal as sin . " Where sin abounded grace did much more abound . " Nor does the apostle look forward merely ; he looks backward as well ; and not merely to Abraham but to the whole Gentile world , to the " uncircumcision " as well as to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Jews only : Is he not the God of the Gentiles also ? yea , of the Gentiles also . " Paul certainly does treat Jews and Gentiles as sinners and under condemnation , so far as the Divine law is concerned , which shows that he regarded them as undergoing a true probation . The terrible picture he draws is one of free responsible agents sinning willfully against Divine light and love . Capacity to sin implies full moral agency as much as capacity for holiness . How could Paul conclude that " every mouth would be stopped , and all the world would become guilty before God , " if the fundamental conditions of probation were wanting ! It is true that // 257 Christianity has putt new Divine agencies into action , and given new vigor and scope to the Divine movement of redemption ; but it is not true that the only earlier revelation of God to the world was merely a natural one , through the light of reason and conscience . A supernatural movement began from the first . There may not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Trinity is at work there . The Holy Spirit strove with men before Christ came to institute a new dispensation of his power . And the Eternal Word was from the beginning " the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world . " There is much truth in the statement of Justin Martyr- " But lest some should , without reason , and for the perversion of what we teach , maintain that we say that Christ was born one hundred and fifty years ago under Cyrenius , and subsequently , in the time of Pontius Pilate , taught what we say He taught ; and should cry out against us as though all men who were born before Him were irresponsible ,  --  let us anticipate and solve the difficulty . We have been taught that Christ is the first.born of God , and we have declared above that He is the Word of whom every race of men were partakers ; and those who lived with the Word ( or , as it seems to mean , in accordance with Divinely enlightened reason ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; as , among the Greeks , Socrates and Heraclitus , and men like them ; and among the barbarians , Abraham , and Ananias , and Azarias , and Mishael , and Elias , and many others whose actions and names we now decline to recount , because we know it would be tedious . So that even they who lived before Christ , and lived without the Word , were wicked and hostile to Christ . " Christ said of himself , evidently referring to the real gracious relation which he sustained as the Eternal Word to the earlier ages , " Abraham rejoiced to see my day : he saw it and was glad . " That he does not refer merely to the promise of his coming in the flesh , is shown by his answer to the Jews : " Then said the Jews to him , thou art not yet fifty years old , and hast thou seen Abraham ? Jesus said unto them , Verily , verily , I say unto you , Before Abraham was I am . " The representation of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely negative position of forbearance // 258 " Progre8sive Orthodoxy . " for ages is mechanical and anthropomorphic , not to say unscriptural . Well might Porphyry , the heathen critic , point his sneer against such a view . " How came it to pass , that the gracious and merciful God should suffer all nations , from Adam to Moses , and from Moses to the coming of Christ , to perish through ignorance of his laws and commands ? What necessity was there that he should come in the end of the world , and not till after an innumerable multitude of men had perished ! " But the sneer of Porphyry is pointless against that Divine movement of redemption which the Scriptures reveal , running as a golden thread of grace through all the events of history and providence , and steadily growing in brightness until the " fulness of time " brought its culmination in Christ himself , " the heir of the ages . " The bye of God is eternally active . It has brooded over the world from the beginning . The Divine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Christ 's parable of the lost sheep and the prodigal son have a direct reference to every human soul . Men like Socrates and Plutarch and other pious heathen have been called " Seekers after God . " Much more truly may God be called a seeker after men . We believe that he has done everything that could be done in his infinite justice and wisdom and love for the salvation of every son of Adam . He has " waited to be gracious , " and he has left no soul without " witness " of his gracious presence . That view also of probation and salvation which this book sets forth as wholly determined by a knowledge of the Historic Christ is equally mechanical and superficial . " Blessed are they that have not seen and yet have believed . " Blessed too are they who have followed the leadings of God 's truth and spirit , according to the degree of light received , whatever that light and knowledge may have been . " God has always cared more for the quality of faith than for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to religious duty and to God as far as known that is decisive of probation and salvation . It is the moral attitude of the soul , not knowledge , that is radical . " He that loveth is born of God and knoweth God . " No moral being that is obedient to his own moral instincts and to the spiritual light that shines upon him can be separated from God and his // 259 love . It was thus that Enoch " walked with God , and he was not , for God took him . " It was thus that Socrates followed the " Divine voice " which he said warned him when he was in danger of doing wrong , and drank the fatal hemlock at last with a courage and calmness that were born not of philosophy but of religious faith . It is a weak device on which to build a better theodicy , to adjourn the whole question of probation and salvation in the case of the vast majority of mankind to another world . If men are really moral beings at all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then no sin ; and if no sin , no need of a Saviour . In such a view Christ loses all his peculiar significance . For he came " to seek and to save that which was lost . " But how " lost , " if the very opportunity of probation itself rested on his coming ? We have said enough to indicate the general character of our objections to the fundamental premise of this book . Not accepting its assumptions , we can not accept its conclusions . Sympathizing strongly as we do with the object sought , we must regard the result as unsatisfactory . We believe a better theodicy is coming , but it must come by another way . There is a light that shines even into the darkness of heathenism ; it is the revelation that has been made to us of the amazing love and grace of God . The Epistle to the IRomans gives the outlines of the true theodicy . Sin is universal , and so is grace . Did sin begin with Adam ? so did grace . Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall ? So has grace followed them all , as th' shepherd of the parable sought his lost sheep . And the grace is superabundant and overflowing toward all the race . " Where sin abounded , grace did much more abound . " Paul says " did " not " will . " And as the apostle moved on in his grand demonstration of the universal working of that grace , he at length caught so clear a glimpse into the heart of the mystery that he exclaimed in admiration and awe : " Oh the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God ! " But it is said such a view " brings no relief , " since the cases of heathen saved must be " merely exceptional . " Paul , however , seems to have found relief . " How unsearchable are his judgments ! " Who has sounded the depths of God 's love ? // How secret and manifold are the methods of his gracious Spirit ! " His ways are not our ways . " " The wind bloweth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but canst not tell whence it cometh and whither it goeth . So is every one that is born of the Spirit . " Sin is a great mystery , but the mystery of redemption is greater . The more we look into it , the more fathomless it grows . Paul 's vision at last included all men , both Jew and Gentile , as " saved . " And yet Paul was no Universalist . He was not regarding exceptions , though he incidentally indicates how there may be such . His eye is fixed on the successful accomplishment of the Divine purpose of salvation . And as we look in that direction the darkness begins to lift . The mere question of numbers , whether of the saved or the lost is not the essential one . It is rather , what is the true character of man 's probation under God 's administration ? And is God a " respecter of persons ? " We are assured he is not . The Bible reveals the Divine method of redemption as moved and guided by infinite love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the excellence of the method . " So says this book , and we agree . Erasmus wrote in one of his colloquies : " I do sometimes meet with sayings in the writings of the ancient heathens , even in the poets , of so pure and holy , and divine a nature , that I can not help feeling that some gracious power was at work in their soul when they wrote them . And it may possibly have been , that the spirit of Christ was shed forth over a wide*r space than we generally suppose . Many , truly , are to be ranked among the saints who do not find a place in our lists of them . " To which we say , Amen . The fatal difficulty with the views we have been considering is their unscripturalness . Though the writers profess complete allegiance to Scripture , they make exegesis quite subordinate to metaphysical assumptions . They rest the vital conclusion of the book not on Scriptural evidence , but on premises which are drawn from extra-scriptural sources . They are satisfied if Scripture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But this is rationalistic . No doubt these writers are honest in their professions ; but there is such a thing as an unCOnSeiouS rationalism ,  --  a rationalism of method rather than of spirit . The whole argument of this book runs on rationalistic lines . We // believe in the rights of the reason . We are protestants of Protestants . We accept much of what is said in these days about the " Christian consciousness . " But we believe also in the rights of Faith . God has chosen to hide a part of his redemptive methods and purposes in mystery . To attempt to force God 's hand is the essence of rationalism . That is just what this book does . It is not content with " seeing through a glass darkly . " It has no patience with what it calls agnosticism . If the light needed can not be wrung from Scripture , then let reason have play . But how about the announcement , in the introduction , that all inquiries are to be made " under the full and constant acceptance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break forth , it will come from this source Take the question of a probation in another life for the heathen . Does Scripture sustain it ? Even this book , after an heroic wrestle with a few Scripture passages , allows that the result reached is only " probable , " and falls back on a syllogism which is a pure work of human reasoning . Then as to the affirmation of Scriptural probability , is not the evidence of Scripture strongly the other way ? There are a few obscure passages , we grant , which , taken by themselves , may look to a continuance of probation into another life . But the exegetical canon of Irenai*us is a sound one , to interpret enigmatical portions of Scripture by those which are plain and consistent with each other . The general drift of the Bible on this question is too clear for doubt . The Old Testament is full of pi'esent probation , while the very exfstence of a future life is in the dim background . It is remarkable that no words of Christ can be quoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men . Surely if his coming in the flesh was to mark a new era in the history of human probation , and if knowledge of him as the Historic Saviour was to be the absolute test of the question whether men should have their probation in this life or in another , it would have formed a prominent part of his gospel message . Paul had received no such revelation , or he would have proclaimed it on the house-tops . He was the Apostle to the Gentiles . The problem of heathenism faced him in all its appalling magnitude . Yet he gives no sign . " To-day is the accepted time , " " The Lord is at hand , " are the watchwords // and inspiration of his missionary labors . The book of IRevelation is esehatological , and its burden throughout is the finality of de8tiny which is to characterize the close of this temporal life and scene , in the case both of individuals and of this world 's history as a whole . The distinction between the present probationary dispensation and the fixed state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the judgment postponed into a far-off eternity , with vacant spaces left for new probatious . " The time is at hand . He that is nnjnst , let him be unjust still ; and he that is righteous , let him be righteous still . And , behold , I come quickly . " The arqumentum* e 8ilentia is sometimes of great weight . Even if it were true that the probation of the heathen is to be continued , the silence of Scripture concerning it shows that it is not wise for men to know it , and if this be so , then it is equally unwise to hold it up as speculatively probable . Our conclusion then is that this book has not made any permanent contribution to theological science . At the same time , it has much of good in it . The value of a book is not always determined by the success or failure of its thesis . President Warren 's " Paradise Found " may not succeed in proving that the North Pole is the cradle of the race , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ review has a special interest to us , as an indication of the new theological spirit which is being awakened in our day . The recent impulse given to historical and scientific studies seemed to have brought dogmatic theology to a standstilL But of late there have been growing signs of theological unrest , and lo , a " new theology " is already upon us . We had intebded before closing to say something in regard to this much landed aud much abused term , " new theology . " That there is a new theological movement in the air is so plain that he that runs may read . And no prophet has been needed to predict it . It is simply impossible that such an intellectual movement as the preseut century has witnessed , should be closed without affecting theology . The revolution which has been accomplished in methods of investigation , in scientific discovery , in historical research , is silently revolutionizing theological methods and results . The new views which the present // generation is gaining of the constitution and development of the system of nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and the doctrine of God is the central doctrine of theology . A new theology , in the sense of a new construction of Christian doctrine which shall be adapted to recent advances in knowledge , is inevitable . Progress is a condition of all true science , and if theology be the queen of the sciences , the capacity for progress is essential to . its life . We believe , therefore , that we are at the dawn of a new theological epoch . Its streamers are already shooting athwart the sky . It is to be expected at such a time that men will arise saying , " lo here , lo there . " " But the end is not vet . " The chief danger at present is that men shall be deceived by false lights . The very phrase , new theology , is misleading . Christian theology has its center in Christ , the God-man , who is " the same yesterday , and today , and forever .
