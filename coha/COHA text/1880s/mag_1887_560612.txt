ON the 13th of July , 1877 , the writer was elected Colonel of the Thirteenth Regiment , Second Division , of the National Guard of the State of New York . The regiment had been greatly reduced in numbers , but the men composing it were earnest , active workers , full of spirit and enthusiasm . An attempt was made to increase the size and efficiency of the organization , and the first step was to constitute a staff adapted to the requirements of the service and to give us popularity . Among many questions , this one came up : Whom could we find for Chaplain , to aid in *securing for the regiment a high standing ? My wife heard this question and , with woman 's intuition , her prompt reply was , " Why , Beecher , of course . " The suggestion was accepted at a venture . Some of Mr. Beecher 's friends were consulted , and the tender was officially made on the 10th of January , 1878 . This was the reply : BROOKLYN , January 21 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Your esteemed favor of January 10th , tendering me the office of Chaplain in the Thirteenth Regiment , N. Y. Infantry , should have been acknowledged earlier , bat continuous absence from the city , and some uncertainty as to my own course , has delayed a reply . I desire to thank the members of the regiment and the officers for their proffer of this honor , and have resolved to accept it , provided its duties , of which I am quite uninformed , are not so onerous as to interfere with my other labors . I shall be happy to render to your command any services within my power . HENRY WARD BEEcEER . Mr. Beecher 's reasons for acceptance were submitted in detail to his congregation at a Friday evening prayer-meeting in the Lecture Room of Plymouth Church , in the following words : " I did not accept , as you may readily suppose , because I had nothing to do and because 1 wanted to fill up vacant time . It was not because I had any special military gifts , or that any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position . I was as much surprised as any one could be , when a request was made by Colonei Austen that I should become the Chaplain of the Thirteenth Regiment , and // I was informed that it was the unanimous wish of the officers of the regiment that I should accept the place . And the first impulse I felt on receiving the invitation was to say no , but the second impulse was in the nature of a query , whether there was not some duty here . The question was not exactly , Should you accept the place ? hut it was rather , Why should you not accept it ? ' Is it not eminently wise that a body of young men , organized as a force of citizen soldiers , should have a Chaplain ? In an organization of this kind , made up of young men exclusively , is there not a peculiar kind of peril ? Is not a body of this kind , resembling in some respects a social club , unrestrained , and , perhaps , uncivilized , by the presence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liable to become a veritable maelstrom , in which young men may be sucked down to destruction ? It seems to me there is no question that they should be surrounded by some kind of moral influence , and it seemed to be a pertinent question , whether , if some one should respend , I was not the one to do so . In my case , there seemed to be special reasons why I should respond . I was always among the foremost in the matters that led to thewar , and was forward in upholding the various measures of the war , and it hardly seemed wise or proper for me to turn away from the citizen soldiery , after they had done their duty in that war , thus tacitly saying that they were of no further consequence to the nation or to the community . And even more than all this was the consideration that many of the young men of the regiment are members of my own flock here . And it it is wise and prudent to have a citizen soldery , properly equipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of support for the civil authorities , it is certainly well to have them fortified and strengthened by all the good influences it is possible to throw around them . I go not for pleasure , but hoping to do them good . I want to help them as soldiers , as well as individuals , for I do n't like to have anything to do with a thing that does n't go . The regiment has entered on a new life , and it will be rendered more prosperous than ever . At any rate , I hope you will have its well-being at heart , if for no other sake , at least for my sake , for I should not like to do anything in which I should not have the prayers and sympathy of my people . " The occasion of the official muster into the service of the State was an assembly of the regiment for dress parade on the 1st day of March , 1878 . In the presence of 5,000 people , on the large floor of the armory , Chaplain Beecher was called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him " You do solemnly swear that you will support the Constitution of the United States and of the State of New York , and that you will faithfully discharge your duties as a soldier in the National Guard to the best of your ability . So help you God . " With right hand raised very high , the response came " I do . " Then , on being formally introduced to his " Fellow Soldiers o ' the Thirteenth Regiment , " Mr. Beecher said : " I am not now for the first time made acquainted with this organization . The Thirteenth Regiment has a name belonging to the city of Brooklyn which is an honor to the city , and in which the city rejoices . I , therefore , deem it an honor to have been selected as your Chaplain . The duties of the position are , to be sure , not onerous ; they are more honorable than burdensome , but such as they are , I // shall endeavoi to discharge them faithfully , and to be , so far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that which I suppose every honest and honorahie man among you means to be in his sphere . Time was when these regimental formations were regarded somewhat in the nature of sports , having in them more of show and the gratification of vanity than of serious work , hut we have in the last twenty years passed through scenes which have sobered the minds of our people and educated them to the value of our soldiery . And only within the last year we have passed through intestine troubles which have taught us the lesson , or should have taug , , ht us the lesson , of the great value of citizen soldiery . In Europe the interests of nations have demanded standing armies , and from the nature of the people , and fromthe nature of their institutions , and from the long influence of historic as*ociation , the standing armies of Europe have been a perpetual menace to the liberty of the people . To-day Europe expends three hundred millions of dollars a yar in the support of her standing armies ' . They are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our land there has sprung up from the very heginning a great prejudice against a standing army ; we have permitted only a small one to be formed that we glory in and honor , but we depend upon our citizen soldiery as our main instrument I or in* estine defense ; of the country at large , and whenever foreign invasion is thratned . Let us hope that all these troubles which lie in our horizon will pass away , and that if there be any storm it shall be one of those refreshing ones which clear the air and leave things better afterward than they were before . Already the Brooklyn Thirteenth has won a name to be honored . Let it grow more and more illustrious . I shall be subject to your call in any way in which I may serve the interests of this city . " The parade was over . But the heart of every man went out to the Plymouth pastor as to a father , and , as cheer after cheer rent the air , the resolve to make an enduring fame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldier in the line . Mr. Beecher entered heartily into the spirit of regenerating and rebuilding the command , and in May , 1878 , a meeting was called in the lecture-room of Plymouth Church to organize what was to be known as Company U in the service , and as " The Beecher Company " by the people . From the platform , Mr. Beecher appealed to the young men present to enroll , and , the requisite number being immediately secured , the company was mustered into the service of the State on the 27th day of June , 1878 . This company has always been main tamed at the maximum number , and , in point of drill and discipline , has been equal to any company of the National Guard . Mr. Beecher 's first participation in a parade of the regiment was on occasion of an escort to Post Rankin No. 10 of the Grand Army of the Republic , and to participate in the decoration of the Martyrs ' Tomb , at Fort Greene , on Thursday , May 30th , 1878 . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few days in advance of any demand upon his time , so as to enable him to // arrange his lecture and other engagements not to interfere with military duty . An order was accordingly forwarded , to which a jovial reply was received the next day : BROOKLYN , No. 124 Columbia Heights . MY DEAR COLONEL : I will be present , as requested , fully armed and equipped as becomes a Chaplain of the Old Thirteenth . Yours , ever , HENRY WARD BEECHER , Captain Secular and Chaplain Spiritual of the Old Thirteenth-God bless her ! Mr. Beecher had secured a spirited horse , which I had been advised was a Kentucky thoroughbred , and which he proposed to ride . In reply to a suggestion made by me that he might have trouble in the control of so spirited a steed , Mr. Beecher said that he could " stand any demonstration , as long as the horse was pleased to enjoy himself . " The order to march was given , the drums rolled out their first notes , and the horse , unused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made an effort to have the music stopped . But Mr. Beecher himself immediately discountenanced it . The Plymouth Pastor firmly held his seat , his horsemanship exciting general admiration . He soon brought the steed under complete control , and , in passing me , on the way to his place in the Staff line , he said , quietly : " I guess this horse was unaware of the fact that I had my training in Indiana . Out there , when I went to visit my parishioners , in my younger days , I did n't follow the roads , and the rail fences did n't stand in my way . The horse knows all that now , and will march in line in proper order . " Our Chaplain was right . His bold Kentucky thoroughbred had been instantly and utterly subdued . Not once again did the animal leave the line ; but the fire of his eyes showed that it was the master mind and master hand alone that held him under control . On the march , the rain began to fall , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to leave the line and return home . " Are you going to leave ? " he inquired ; and , when I replied in the negative , he said : " A soldier desert in his first parade ? Oh , no ! I never do anything by halves . I have enlisted for the war , and my maiden battle must be fought out , even if the big drum has bursted ! " ( The drum-head of the firmament seemed to be broken just then , and the rain had caused the heads of all // the drums in the band and in the field music to burst , and the drummers were beating the marches on the shells . ) The following day I called on Mr. Beecher , and found him in his usual good health . Mr. Beecher 's first sermon to the regiment was preached in Plymouth Church on the 12th day of May , 1878 . The main points , addressed to the regiment , were these : " God bless the Thirteenth Regiment of Brooklyn ! Gentlemen of the Brooklyn Thirteenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this audience . You are the citizen soldiers , you have the virtues of a citizen , a lover of peace , and of the soldier , a defender of order . Both belong to you ; and it is your duty to prepare yourselves for efficient service . Not to holiday show or glittering gymnastics are you called ; you represent the reserve force of the civil law . That disorder which the self respect of men can not repress must be restrained by the police , and and when the police can not repress it it must be overruled by the citizen soldiery . The whole body of society can control the whole procedure of society by patience , and those who think themselves wronged can change the law . Speech is free , the press is open to all , and the whole community is a jury before which a man may plead his case , and if he can not win a verdict then he must patiently submit . No man or class of men can have to wait long for redress . Society is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that things needful for the public good can be secured in a free republic by patient discussion , and violence is a remedy worse than the disease . " To our immigrant population we are indebted for a thousand excellent things ; for wealth , for labor , for men of learning , for skill and industry ; but our foreign population can not teach us some things . We admit ourselves students in some things , we assert ourselves masters in others . They can not teach us citizenship , they can not teach us to build a State ; and while we give welcome to such ideas as may be congenial to American habits , we utterly abhor those heresies brought from abroad that are fruitful of disorder and are in antagonism with the rights of man which they assume to defend ; that are destructive of all that liberty which they pretend to seek . If any large body of men shall move to make a change in the settled habits of this free commonwealth , they will feel the energy of a free people , roused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property , that is the fruit of labor . Gentlemen , in such an emergency it will be . come your duty to defend the commonwealth , and it will rest upon you confidingly , trustingly , and you will not betray the confidence . While then you mingle social pleasures with your armory meetings and parades , it becomes you to remember that at the bottom a very grave responsibility rests upon you , and this should give you dignity . May God give to us prosperity and order , but should there come other days , may your ranks be the bank and shore against which the waves shall dash and be stayed . God prosper the old Brooklyn Thirteenth . " Measures were being discussed in June , 1878 , between Chaplain Beecher , Gen. Horatio C. King , and the writer ( Gen. King having been elected to the position of Major in the Thirteenth Regiment ) , when I said to Mr. Beecher : " We must keep the wheels of the Thirteenth Regiment revolving  --  the men must have // something to think about . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incentive to recruiting , and also to greater excellence in drill and discipline ? " Mr. Beecher , who had but recently*returned from Montreal , gave an account of the brilliant reception given by the Canadians to the Barlow Grays , from St. Albans , Vermont , on its visit in May , to participate in the celebration of the Queen 's Birthday . " Why not take our regiment there ? " asked the Chaplain . Thus originated the memorable trip of the Thirteenth to Montreal . The trip was not to take place until the following year ( 1879 ) . Meanwhile , recruiting rapidly increased , Mr. Beecher frequently visiting the armory during the drills of instruction , and adding to the enthusiasm of the men by his many words of encouragement . On the 19th day of May we left for the City of Montreal , the only regiment that has ever visited foreign shores . Five hundred and thirty-seven men were present in the ranks . Mr. Beecher met the command in Montreal , and was on board the steamer " Filigate , " which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said he " was waiting for his boys . " Mighty cheers went up for the Chaplain , which were taken up again and again . Landing on the wharf in Montreal , a magnificent standard was presented to the Regiment by Mayor Rivard , emblazoned on one side with the Stars and Stripes , and on the other the flag of the Dominion of Canada , magnificently embroidered and set with pearls . Mr. Beecher accepted the standard on behalf of the Regiment , and said : " We accept this flag in that spirit of amity which inspires its giving-may the Stars and Stripes and the Union Jack , now for the first time so happily blended on one flag , float always side by side . For whatever the flags of other nations express , ours stand for the expression of the literature of liberty and religion of liberty and progress . May our flags never be found against each other in war . May they ever go together , but never against each other . We shall place it in the most promineut place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be favored with a visit from you , we trust to be able to show that your flag has never been dishonored . " Mr. Beecher participated in the review of the Dominion forces on Fletcher 's Field . Lieut. - Gen . Sir E. Selby Smytb , K. C. B. , an officer of the English regulars , was in command , and the review was witnessed by the Marquis of Lorne and the Princess Louise . There were about 5,000 troops under arms , and Mr. Beecher was the central object of interest . // A banquet was tendered to , the officers at the Windsor Hotel by General Smyth , who presided with the Marquis of Lorne . In the early part of the evening I had been requested to say to Mr. Beecher that he would be called upon to respond to the toast of the City of Brooklyn . Later in the progress of the banquet , with an uneasy expression of countenance , Mr. Beecher beckoned to me , and I went to his chair . He whispered , " Colonel , I do not like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the best city in the world to live in and to hail from , but to be the subject of an international toast is not hot enough or brown enough . It will hardly melt butter enough to make it taste good to our Canadian friends . " I reported this to the Marquis and General Smyth , and they said that the Dominion officers would not be satisfied if they could not hear Mr. Beecher speak . So , without Mr. Beecher 's knowledge , it was quietly arranged with the United States Consul-General , Mr. Smith , to whom had been assigned the toast , " The President of the United States , " and who had said that he could not ( 10 full justice to his subject , that he would officially acknowledge the compliment , and then call on Mr. Beecher . This he did , concluding a most eloquent address by saying : " I ask Mr. Beecher to join with me in acknowledging the compliment to the President of the country we love so well . " Mr. Beecher had not been consulted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but , with not a moment for preparation , he held the assembly spellbound by his words for more than three-quarters of an hour . In the course of his *remarks , he referred to our late President as follows " Four years is not more than sufficient to learn how to govern , and another four only gives one an opportunity of displaying some knowledge in the management of governing . When Mr. Lincoln was elected President it was on the eve of the greatest civil war that the world has ever known . It burst out like the Southern tornado , and the whole country leaped into war , and along one thousand miles of coast its desolating ravages were made familiar . It seemed as though Lincoln should have a second term in which he should not be distracted . But it pleased God to give him the crown of martydom and take him out of his troubles . Mr. Johnson , who succeeded him , was a man of honest intentions . But he was a man too literal and too obstinate , and did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adapt himself to the soil over which to march ; so he set himself against his party and went out of office-more welcome than when he went in . General Grant has been called a man of luck-he was lucky-in his father and mother-lucky in the body and the mind that were given him as a birthright . For two terms Gen. Grant succeeded in having good // luck , and now , having gone abroad from his country , he has good luck abroad , and if the cheers with which he has been greeted could be linked together , it would encircle the globe in one polyglot cheer , for no man has succeeded so well in cheers , in the circumnavigation of the globe , as Gen. Grant . Contrary to the course of the sun , he rose in the West . After Grant , President Hayes was called to the chair as First Magistrate . His task of peace has not been an easy one ; his , no bed of down . He has lain upon the thorns , but with great pugnacity , great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bids fair to come out , in the judgment of the whole nation , second to no single President they have had in the last 40 years . The United States desires to express , and upon every occasion does express , the mighty principle of good will towards all nations of the earth . " Mr. Beecher returned home with the regiment , and I had reserved a state-room for him in the officers ' palace car . When shown to his traveling quarters , he said , " No , sir ; none of that for me . Too old a traveler . That is over the wheels . I wish to sleep , if you noisy fellows will permit such an idea to be entertained . Give me the upper berth in a centre section ; they are the best-more elasticity to the motion , and better ventilation than the lower . " He retired as he desired , and crawled to the upper berth with greater agility than many of the younger officers . After this trip the Lientenant-Colonelcy of the regiment became vacant , and General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clerk of the Plymouth Society , was chosen to the vacancy . In the summer of 1880 an election was held for Brigadier-General of the Fifth Brigade . I had declined to become a candidate , preferring to remain with my regiment , and General Christensen , my Lieutenant-Colonel , was chosen . Mr. Beecher wrote to me on the subject , as follows " PEEKSKILL , July 14 , 1880 . " My DEAR COLONEL : I was heartily glad that you discouraged the putting you into a brigadiership . You would certainly make a model general , but just now , what of all things is wanted , is regiments in the National Guard that exhibit perfect drill and conduct . The guard is in danger of running out through slack organization , loose discipline , and slip-shed soldiers , making the whole thing weak and contemptible in the eyes of the community . But a regiment that is raised high and exhibits perfect discipline is wholesome to the whole system . You would make a good brigadier , but we want good colonels more than good brigadiers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole system than brigade commanders do or can . I am sorry that you should lose Christensen as a right-hand man , but I am glad , if it must be , that he is in a position where he can greatly aid the Thirteenth , and that , too , without any undue partiality . For one I am glad that the old Thirteenth has not lost its Colonel " Yours in the bonds of chaplaincy , " HENRY WARD BEEcHER. " // strength of 610 men . In 1880 , there appeared on the rolls a total of 718 men . In September , 1880 , the regiment visited Boston , on the occasion of the centennial celebration of the foundation of that city . Mr. Beecher went to Boston from the White Mountains , and met the regiment . I had suggested the propriety of his giving a lecture in Boston , and that it be under the auspices of the State , in order to identify the regiment with the occasion . Chaplain Beecher , with his usual good nature , agreed to do anything to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note : " BROOKLYN , N. Y. , 124 Columbia Heights . " My DEAR COLONEL : The deed is done . I have writ . Governor Claflin has been affectionately poked in the direction of memory . Yea , I have conveyed to him your letter , that he may see the very inwards of the scheme . " Your fat Chaplain , " HENRY WARD BEEcEER . " Governor Long was then in the Executive Chair , but ExGovernor Claflin was selected as the medium of communication . The scheme was given up owing to the succession of courtesies extended to the regiment by the 5th Massachusetts , and a banquet to the officers , at Parker 's , in the evening . In October , 1880 , the regiment was called out for review by Governor Cornell , and , as was customary with me on all special occasions , I sent a letter to the Chaplain to remind him of this duty . Promptly came the reply : " BROOKLYN , N. Y. , No. 124 Columbia Heights , " October 8 , 1880 . " MY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , the moon by night ! - I'erish commerce , perish agriculture , and even mining , but spare the glorious old Thirteenth . No politics , no election , no ecclesiastical meetings shall hinder me . Even sickness must stand back , or , if it visit* , I will come in an ambulance , vial and syringe in hand . I feel ashamed of you that you should have thought it necessary to plead the case . Next , I shall expect a warm appeal to eat my dinner , to kiss my wife and children , to love my country , or to vote the Republican ticket . " Your Warlike Chaplain , " HENRY WARD BEEcEER . " The regiment paraded on this occasion second in strength only to the Seventh-such had been the remarkable growth of the command in two years . Mr. Beecher 's presence was the occasion of a marked ovation on the entire march , and his spirits were of the best order . Returning on the ferryboat , we were all placed , mounted , on the forward deck , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face to Mr. Beecher . He was entertaining us all with bright sallies of wit , when suddenly he said : " Come , Colonel , // turn about ; back your horse in here with us . Remember , back to the wind means face to the coffin . " Later in the season I conceived the idea of having Gen. Grant review the regiment , keeping up " the boom , " as it was termed among the boys . I took Mr. Beecher into my confidence , and he was to use his discretion as to how it might be brought about . In a few weeks , the plan bore fruit in the following letter , which is not dated , but written , I believe , in the latter days of November , 1880 : " No. 124 COLUMBIA HEIGHTS , SUNDAY . " My DEAR COLONEL : Grant readily said that he would review the Thirteenth sometime to he agreed upon after the holidays . He required no persuasion , asked no questions , but instantly answered my request by saving , " I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've got another lever to pry up the regiment with . I attribute his whole gracious disposition to the fact that he had been to Plymouth Church and heard a good sermon . Yours in the bonds of Chaplaincy , " HENRY WARD BEEcHER . " The formal invitation was extended , and the following reply received . " NEW YORK CITY , December 2 , 1880 . " Cot . DAvIo E. AUsTEN : " DEAR COL. : I accept your invitation to review the Thirteenth Regiment on Wednesday , the 12th January , 1881 . Very truly yours , * S. GRANT . " Mr. Beecher paraded with hi* fellow officers . After the review there followed a working drill of the regiment . An effort to induce General Grant to address the regiment proved futile , and lie retired from the floor with the brief remark : " Colonel , you have given me the best drill I have ever seen , and I am not in the habit of saying a thing like that without reason. ** The following letter refers to a visit of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His letter touches also a rumor that I had resigned , by reason of supposed displeasure in connection with a drill .

Could n't have come last Monday night . This referred to an entertainment at the armory . Could not have danced if I had come . Somebody said that things were badly managed at one of your late show-drills , and that you were resigned . How is that ? Resignation is a Christian grace . A woman , having lost her babe and giving way to excessive grief , was told by her pastor that it was the Lord 's doing , cud that she ought to be resigned . I am resigned , ' she said , but I think I ought to show a proper resentment . ' Is that your case ? " HENRY WARD BEEcHER.

But now for the new formation , so to say ; I have no open date before December 29th . Will that do ? " Your Apostolic Chaplain , " H. W. BEECH'ER . " An effort was made early in 1881 to secure the engagement of Dodworth 's Band , at Brighton Beach , in order to keep everything regimental as much before the public as possible . Mr. Beecher had been asked to interest himself for Dodworth with some of the influential directors of the road , some of whom were attendants of his church . In connection with this matter , he wrote the following characteristic letter : " BROOKLYN , No. 124 Columbia Heights , " January24 , 1881 . " My DEAR COLONEL : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ march - Brighten Beach folks are on their ear-they are going to have Levy , and their head is sot on having a foreign band , and they are in a tangle of negotiations . From the drift of things , as near as I can make it out , we shall not have much of a chance , if any . If being sorry would remedy the matter , tears should flow from both my eyes-until Jeremiah should envy me-who sighed , Oh that my head were a fountain of tears . ' " With captainly regards , " HENRY WARD BEEcHER . " I resigned my Colonelcy in 1883 , by reason of removal to the City of New York . Mr. Beecher continued to serve with the regiment as its Chaplain during the Colonelcy of Gen. Alfred C. Barnes , my successor ; but , as I am advised , there were few occasions calling for his presence . The most important was the anniversary parade of the regiment in celebration of its departure for the seat of war , which was held on the 23d day of April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to learn , was his last parade , although he was connected with the regiment at the time of his death . Company G , of the Thirteenth , which had been organized inside the walls of Plymouth Church , paid the last tribute of respect to his memory , by acting as guard of honor over his remains , and , when I visited the church , I found that the great love which the Chaplain had inspired in the hearts of his parishioners had a no less secure resting place with " the boys , " his boys , as he was pleased frequently to term them . So the great Chaplain has passed away . DAVID E. AUSTEN .
