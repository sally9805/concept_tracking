txt The Cleveland Leader of Aug. 18 publishes the following letter from Marshal Henry , of the District of Columbia : To Friends in Ohio : The Leader correspondent kindly offers the opportunity to communicate during these hours of anxiety . I saw Mrs. Garfield to-day , and received from her a detailed account of the President 's condition . She is still hopeful and cheerful , as she has been during the strain of these long , weary weeks . She said that at no time since the President was wounded had he asked any one to read to him from a book . Letters from friends have sometimes been read to him , and on a few occasions the head lines and perhaps a short article from a newspaper . This fact will illustrate to those who know him best how feeble he has been even during the most favorable days . I have conversed with some of the physicians and attendants , and am satisfied from all I can learn that the wound is doing well . The great trouble is the weakness of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bloodpoison . Dr. Boynton is more familiar with the caprices of the President 's stomach than any of the attending physicians , and I am informed that he is now consulted more particularly on that subject than formerly . Nothing is done , however , without a thorough consultation of all the physicians . At this hour the condition of the President is quite encouraging . He is very weak , however , and , in my judgment , will be feeble for some time . Let me remind you of what President Hinsdale said two weeks ago to-night . You may hope , but you must not be too hopeful . It is not the wound that we fear , but the debility and weakness of six weeks ' struggle for life . The strong man whom you have often heard talk so grandly from the rostrum is now pale and wasted , but still has the will to conquer in this terrible struggle , as he has conquered in a hundred conflicts before .
