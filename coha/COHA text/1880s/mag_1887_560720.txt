HALF the people of America have grown from childhood to manhood since the country was electrified by the news that Sherman 's army had marched from Atlanta to the sea . Twenty years have gone , and we begin to know better the significance of the most picturesque as well as the most important campaign of the Civil War . The battle of Chattanooga had proven the most crushing disaster that had happened to the Confederacy during the war ; but a greater disaster still was waiting the South . Grant had gone to the armies in the East , and Sherman was threatening to cut what was left of the Confederacy in two . Of course that could not be done without first destroying or crippling the rebel army in his front . It was a long and perilous journey for an army from Chattanooga to Atlanta , the " gate city of the South . " Nature had fortified the country against invasion almost every foot of the way , and a well commanded army of veterans occupied intrenchments , and river banks , and bridges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make almost disheartening any attempt at a forward campaign . Sherman 's campaigns , however , had all been of the forward kind . He had seldom fought twice over the same ground , and he led an army accustomed to victory . In himself was represented a type of soldier that comes not once in a century ; courageous , original , blest with great resources of intellect , a trained soldier , with the heart of a civilian , perfect in knowledge of the conduct of wars , cool in judgment , audacious in action , enthusiastic in the cause he was fighting for ; an intense patriot , and possessed of the universal affection of his troops . Only such a leader could undertake with hopes of success a campaign so difficult as the 120 days ' battle that lay between him and Atlanta . This 120 days ' fighting was more than preliminary to the march to the sea ; in a sense , it was a part of // that march . To destroy the armies in front of him , to take Atlanta , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines that fed Lee 's army ; to show the Confederacy that their very interior and strongest places were not invulnerable ; to put a victorious Northern army right in the heart of the South , and show the world that it could stay there ; this was what Sherman set out to do . To do it , the Atlanta campaign became a necessity ; so did the march to the sea . Throwing the same army that marched to Savannah right into Lee 's rear , and later compelling him to surrender to Grant or flee to the mountains , was the additional possibility planned for , and believed in , long before the march seaward was commenced . The plan to strike Lee 's rear with Sherman 's army from Atlanta , 1,000 miles away , developed slowly . Its execution meant a tremendous move on the military chess board . Lee saw the fatal danger , ere the campaign was half done , and mentally resolved , as we see later , on leaving Richmond the moment Sherman 's columns should get as far toward him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign , between the Tennessee River and Atlanta , had never been surpassed on the Continent . They were scarcely surpassed by the great single battles of Spottsylvania , the Wilderness , and Cold Harbor . It was not so much one very great battle , as a constant succession of heavy battles and fights in the woods . Day and night were heard the roar of cannon and the clash of musketry . Those not engaged in the perpetual conflict on the lines could scarcely sleep when the cracking of musketry ceased at times , so accustomed were they to the continued sound of guns . It was like a constant siege , filled up by never ending assaults , charging breastworks , taking bridges , maneuvres , reconnaissances , skirmishes , and battles : then the siege , and the assaults on Atlanta itself , the flanking movements , and , at last , the end . " Atlanta ours and fairly won , " flew across the wires to Washington , and the first act in Sherman 's campaign was finished . It had been a tremendous succession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The great commander on the James realized the magnitude of the events . " You have accomplished , ' said Grant , in a letter to Sherman , " the most gigantic undertaking of any man in this wai . And what next ? Grant wrote from Virginia . And he , too , // asked what next . What had Sherman gone to Atlanta for ? Could he stop there ? " It is now my opinion , " wrote Sherman to Grant , " that I should keep Hood employed , and put my army in fine order for a march on Charleston ( the sea ) . " These are the first written words about the " march " to be found in the records of the war . And again he wrote : " I would not hesitate , Were there a new base in our hands at the coast , to cross the State of Georgia with sixty thousand men . " The possibility of a march somewhere seaward had , as said , been looked forward to when the army left Chattanooga . Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether new events would permit a march at all , were left wholly unsettled in his mind in the beginning ; but at Atlanta Sherman conceived the true plan , and adopted the direction he would take , if only Hood would be foolish enough to march his Confederate army north into Tennessee , where Thomas stood waiting to welcome him . At last Hood did move , and northwards , and , to make the blunder more visible , Jefferson Davis himself rushed out to Palmetto , near Atlanta , and approved the plans of his General . Addressing the soldiers and the public , he pictured Sherman 's army as now about to be lost . Advance he could not ; and the retreat of Napoleon from Moscow was child 's play compared with what would happen were the Federal General to attempt to fall back . A scout took the speech to Sherman , and that moment he determined on his " march to the sea . " Davis was Commanderin-Chief of the Confederate armies , and his speech had convinced Sherman that the Confederate President was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All surplus material and men were at once sent to the rear , and arrangements for another move in the brilliant campaign completed . The origin of the plan of marching to the sea was Sherman 's own , as much as was the execution of it , spite of certain malevolent critics , who sought to rob him of this part of the glory . " The honor is all yours , " wrote President Lincoln , when success had crowned the march ; " none of us went further than to acquiesce . Nothing but the overzeal of one of General Grant 's admirers , orthe malice of some jealous enemy , could have thought to put the origin of the march in doubt . To Halleck Sherman now telegraphed : " I prefer for thefuture to make the movement on Milledgeville , Millen , and Savan*. // nah ; " and almost the same day he telegraphed General Grant : " If Hood goes north , why will it not do for me to leave Tennessee to Thomas and his forces at Nashville , and for me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Grant advised him first to follow Hood , destroy him , and afterwards move towards the sea . Thomas opposed the idea of moving South entirely , as did others . In no direction was the undertaking much encouraged . Events were drifting slowly ; Hood was starting northward , and then Grant telegraphed to Sherman on November 2d , 1864 : " I say go on , then , as you propose . " Being authorized to act , Sherman wrote to Thomas , speaking of the march : " I want all things bent to the plan . I purpose to demonstrate the vulnerability of the South , and make its inhabitants feel that war and individual ruin are synonymous terms . " And again , to Thomas : " The only hope of a Southern success is in the remote regions , difficult of access .. We have now a good entering wedge , and should drive it home . We must preserve a large amount of secrecy , and I may actually change the ultimate point of arrival , but not the main object . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beauregard busy , and the people of the South will realize his inability to protect them . " Beauregard was kept busy - very busy . He , like Hood , and all the rest of the Confederates there , had , in fact , been having a busy time of it for many months , opposing soldiers like Thomas , Schofield , Logan , Howard , Hooker , McPherson , Morgan L. Smith , Stanley , Cox , *Gresham , and others of the great fighting heroes of the Atlanta campaign . To Stanton Sherman now wrote : " I will wait a few days yet to see what head he ( Hood ) makes about Decatur , and may yet turn to Tennessee , but it would be a great pity to take a step backward . " On the same day , learning more of Hood 's starting north , he telegraphed again to Washington : " I am pushing my *preparations to march through Georgia . " He had telegraphed to Thomas that " things must be bent to his plan , " and they were bent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting the trains and the sick to the rear ; no neglect , no delay of anykind , would be brooked for a moment . Even apparent delays , and the temper of the commander flew to a white heat , no matter who might be at fault . Certain condemned horses and cavalry trains had been ordered sent back . Somebody had blundered , or // not been prompt . " I gave ten days ' notice , " exclaims the General , in a furious telegram to the Chief of Cavalry , " and I want to know who is responsible for this outrageous delinquency ? I hope all will be killed or captured . Be ready for the saddle at an hour 's notice . " Here is the laconic order for the final destruc .. tion of Atlanta . " C*rr . Pon : " Ycu may commence the work of destruction at once , but do n't use fire until towards the 1a*t moment . " SHERMAN . " In burning Atlanta he was fighting the rebels , not conciliating them . Of course , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ echo , even in the North . It did not disturb him . " If my reasons , " he wrote to Washington , " are satisfactory to the United States , it makes no difference whether it pleases General Hood and his people or not . " He was now ready for the start . Jefferson Davis was apparently doing his best to aid him on his way . Cotton was no longer to be " king " in the South . Jefferson Davis had said it . " Corn " must grow on every field . It must have been with a grim smile that Sherman wrote to Secretery Stanton : " Convey to Jefferson Davis my personal and official thanks for abolishing cotton , and substituting corn and sweet potatoes in the South . These facilitate our military plans much , for food and forage are abundant . " Just then came the news of Sheridan 's victory in the East . Sherman had been killing men all summer , and he liked to see war of just the killing kind , the more desperate the better , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world , he still liked Sheridan 's way . " I am satisfied , " he wrote the latter , just before leaving Atlanta , " and have been all the time , that the probl'em of this war consists in the awful fact that the present class of men who rule the South must be killed outright , rather than in the conquest of territory . Hard bulldog fighting , and a great deal of it , remains yet to be done . " Sheridan was one of the men he believed capable of doing it . The South had thrown down the desperate gage of battle . It was kill or get killed , and while Sherman , as his course always proved , pitied the South , and would have given his life for honorable peace , nothing to his mind could bring that peace so quick as fighting in dead earnest . // Peace restored , no man in all America so prompt to offer the hand of reconciliation . Sherman 's first thought , after Atlanta had been taken , was to march on Augusta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If you can manage , " he writes to Grant , on September 10th , " to take the Savannah River as high as Augusta , or the Chattahoochee as far up as Columbus , I can sweep the whole State of Georgia . " In fact , three routes seaward had been considered by Sherman : the line direct south , striking the sea at Appalachicola ; the line to Augusta ; and the middle , or southeast one to Savannah . Events proved the last the best iu many senses : that route follc*ved , Lee 's army could be hurt the quickest , and it was Lee 's army now , not Hood 's , that Sherman was striking at . It was also time to choose . The whole Confederacy was waking to the danger of leaving him longer at Atlanta . The time had come possibly to drive him to the death . Davis said it had come . Hood was reaching his lines of communication , and quietly putting an army between him and the North . Grant telegraphed Sherman on the 27th September @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him at Atlanta . Three courses were open to him : to remain at Atlanta , and risk losing his supply lines ; to turn back and follow Hood 's army northwards ; or to cut loose , march south , and destroy Lee 's chances from his far rear . He had already determined , however , not to fight the old ground over again  --  to take no step backward , but leave Hood and his Northern invasion to the competent hands of General Thomas . The gigantic labor of supplying large armies from distant points can scarcely be realized . To feed Sherman 's army about Chattanooga , from its supply base at Nashville , had required the labor of thousands of men and teams , and the use of one hundred and forty-five railway cars daily . That meant the use of a hundred locomotives &amp;ud a thousand railway cars . The risk to supplies , with thousands of well-led hostile cavalry in the rear , was too serious to contemplate . A move somewhere from Atlanta was rapidly becoming not only the best thing to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last campaign were not to be lost . The reveille beat at four o'clock in the morning of November // saw sixty-two thousand two hundred and four men , with sixtyfive cannon , moving in separate , but nearly parallel , columns seaward . The orders had been carefully given ; every officer , every soldier , knew his place , and something in the very air told them they were starting on a march that would end with the closing of the war . Sixty-two thousand men was no small army to cut loose from a base and enter the lines of a hostile country , with no foothold but the ocean beyond . The last mile of the railroad behind had been destroyed ; the last message , a good-bye and an " all right , " had been telegraphed back to Thomas ; the wires were cut , the last link lost communicating with the North . Passing the city in flames and ruin , Sherman rode forward , joined one of his columns , and the march to the sea had begun . Three hundred miles southeast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ columns were headed , though greatly diverging at times , threatening important positions , like Macon and Augusta , right and left , and , by mysterious movements on the flanks , leading the enemy at the front to concentrate to-day in one place and to-morrow forty miles away . Two great wings , almost equally divided as to numbers , formed the marching army . The right was led by Major-General Howard , and Major-General Slocum commanded the left , with soldiers such as Blair , Davis , Williams , and Osterhaus , directing Army Corps , and veterans like Gorse , Geary , Force , Ward , Mower , Morgan , Woods , Hazen , Smith , Leggett , Baird , and Carlin , leadng Divisions . Fighting men , every one of them , and the soldiers were veterans , hardened by scores of battles . Sherman 's cavalry , kept under his personal direction , was commanded by Kilpatrick  --  but in numbers , it was inferior to the cavalry of Wheeler in his front , and hanging on his flanks . The enemy possessed strong garrisons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Columns from these were liable to be concentrated and thrown in front of Sherman at any hour ; troops from Virginia , even , might be hastening , by train , to stop the invaders ' way . If there had been audacity in conceiving the movement , and entering on the march , the utmost caution and vigilance were necessary to prevent surprise , detection of routes and concentrating of hostile forces at unexpected places , and at unexpected times . Possibly for safety , the cavalry force seemed inadequate , but the weakness was made up by a force never before known in // war  --  the mounted " foragers . " Every twentieth man in the army was regularly detailed to scour the country right and left , and sometimes front , for food and forage . In three days ' time the greater number of these foragers had mounted themselves on some species of horse or mule , and the " foragers " became a sort of irregular , or partisan cavalry-flying hither and thither , at all times , and in all places . They confiscated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poultry , grain , fodder , potatoes and meat in such enormous quantities as to supply the whole army . Only occasionally were the regular rations in the supply trains touched at all . The army was living completely off the country . The corn Jefferson Davis had ordered planted in the cotton-fields was feeding Sherman 's soldiers . The " foragers " were becoming the historic personages of the campaign . They were men accustomed to danger , to improvising defenses , to fighting on foot or mounted , to ambuscades and open fields ; soldiers of infinite resources , and it is doubtful if any cavalry in existence could have been half so useful to the army as Sherman 's mounted " foragers . " Their irregularities , and they were not great , for discipline met them when they came to camp , were overlooked in the good that they accomplished . At times on the march , the whole army concentrated , as at Milledgeville , Millen , and at the approaches to Savannah , and diverged , or else marched in parallel lines , seldom more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right and to the left of them , as protectors , the Savannah and the Ogeechee rivers , leading seaward . Sometimes the columns , as at Duncan 's farm by Macon , met the enemy , and with a sharp battle hurled them back ; or , as at the crossing of Briar River , where the cavalry met in severe engagement , fighting for a bridge , or when the advance run on to the hidden intrenchments in the swamps outside Savannah . Unexpectedly , however , there was little fighting on the march ; but fighting , of a desperate kind , too , might still occur at any moment . Once , the enemy 's wires were tapped , and a dispatch captured saying that Bragg , with ten thousand men and part of Wade Hampton 's cavalry , was leaving Augusta for his rear that very night . Day after day the invading army tramped along through the unknown country , their very whereabouts a mystery to the waiting North , whose anxiety , fed by false reports from Richmond , became intenser every hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steady step , and then , in the distance , // they beheld the sea . The swamps , the woods , the intrenchments and the well manned forts guarding the City of Savannah had been reached . Sherman 's eyes strained for the white sails of the friendly fleet . They were not to be seen . His army lapped almost around the city , but there was no possibility of reaching the sea-side or the Union ships . On his left lay the swamps , the forts , and a rebel army ; on his right , bristling with heavy guns , and armed with heroic men , frowned Fort McAllister . That captured , communication with the fleet were possible . Different troops begged the privilege to assault . Just before sundown of December 13th , a division of blue coats under Major General Hazen appeared from the thick wood skirting the approaches to the fort . From the top of a rice mill , across the river , Sherman , glass in hand , was watching the movement . In front of these men , whose guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood a strong fort armed with heavy guns , protected by a deep ditch , by continuous palisades and abattis , and by veteran soldiers . Sherman looked at the setting sun and feared the approach of night . " Signal Hazen to assault at once , " he ordered . The little signal flag at his side fluttered a little , and was answered by Hazen 's whole line advancing to the palisades . That moment the fort belched forth its artillery . Steadily the line advanced , spite of bidden torpedoes exploding under their feet ; spite of the musketry and shells from the fort , and in a few moments entered the cloud of smoke made by the battle . For a minute , only the rattle of musketry was heard ; all was darkness there , and then the cloud-vail lifted , revealing the stars and stripes planted on the fort . In fifteen minutes Fort McAllister had been taken by assault . Such quick work had hardly been done in the war . That night communication was established with the fleet , and Sherman slept in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second step of the march to the sea was finished , and from the whole North went up a prayer of thankfulness . The end of the war was now in sight . The resources of the South were gone ; Lee 's lines of supply were cut in two , and the confidence of the South in her leaders was turning into hate . For Sherman to . serve South Carolina as he had served Georgia , to march his army to the Roanoke , demolishing Charleston and Columbia on the way , would be to end the war . In a sense , Richmond was . already taken by a force five hundred miles away . General Lee . // saw what Sherman 's movements were resulting in . " It was easy to see , " he writes in a private letter three years later " WAnr , I SPRINGS , Va. , July 27 , 1868 . " Gmrmui Wx . S. SMITH : " As regards the movements of General Sherman , it was easy to see that unless they were interrupted I should be compelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a view of arresting his progress , I so weakened my force by sendbig re-enforcements to Scuth and North Carolina that I had not sufficient men to man my lines . " Had they not been broken I should have abandoned them as soon as General Sherman reached the Roanoke . " ( Signed ) R. E. Lxx . " Sherman did reach the Roanoke or its neighborhood , and was but eighteen miles away when the evacuation of Richmond begun . If the hopes of the South failed when Sherman reached Savannah , the spirits of the North were correspondingly buoyant . Grant himself , so reticent usually , hastened to lay a tribute*aV the feet of his friend . " I never had a doubt of the result when apprehensons for your safety were expressed by the President . I assured him that with the army you had , and , you in command of it , there was no danger , but you would strike bottom on salt water some place ; that I would not feel the same security ; in fact , would not have intrusted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and your army upon the splendid results of your campaign , the like of which is not read of in past history . " Now , more than ever , Sherman and his army felt they were striking Lee 's army from behind . Hood was no longer a factor in the game , and the force between Sherman and the Roanoke River was not a force to fear . It was Lee Sherman was thinking of only . To Halleck he wrote on the 24th of December : " I think my campaign of the last month , as well as every step I take from this point North , is as much a direct attack upon Lee 's army as though I were operating within the sound of his artillery , and to Grant , three days before Christmas he wrote : " I have now completed my first step , and should like to join you via Columbia and Raleigh . If you can hold Lee , and if Thomas can continue as he did on the 18th ( referring to his battle of Nashville ) I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and // break up roads as far as the IRoanoke . " Grant did hold Lee , and Thomas did do as well as on the 18th , and Sherman did smash things all to pieces in South Carolina . He went to the Roanoke , and Lee went from Richmond . The war was done , and Sherman 's victorious soldiers tramped on another four hundred miles to Washington . The fighting had commenced on the Tennessee River , the marching ended on Pennsylvania avenue , and whole divisions of the soldiers who saluted the President that afternoon of the grand review had marched with their rifles on their shoulders a distance of almost three thousand miles , S. H. M. BYERS.
