txt An independent appraisal of the Sharps rifle factory property in this city , on which the Continental Life Insur-ance Company , of Hartford , holds a mortgage for $212,000 , has been made under the authori-ty of State Treasurer Warner . The appraisers were State Controller Clark , Charles F. Brooker , Treasurer of the Coe Brass Manufacturing Com-pany at Torrington , and Presideut Mason , of the Bridgeport Brass Company , of this city . The sworn appraisal is $125,000 . The course of State Treasurer Warner in having the property appraised at this time is not without public Interest . Among the securities of the Continental Life , amounting to $100,000 , held by the Treasurer under the laws of several of the States as a guarantee to the polidy holders in such States , is a block of Connecticut State bonds , aggregating $30,000 .
