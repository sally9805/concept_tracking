BRANDYWINE , GERMANTOWN , AND SARATOGA . WE have seen how , owing to the gross negligence of Lord George Germaine , ' discretionary power had been left to Howe , while entirely taken away from Burgoyne . The latter had no choice but to move down the Hudson . The former was instructed to move up the Hudson , but at the same time was left free to depart from the strict letter of his instructions , should there be any manifest advantage in so doing . Nevertheless , the movement up the Hudson was so clearly prescribed by all sound military considerations that everybody wondered why Howe did not attempt it . Why he should have left his brother general in the lurch , and gone sailing off to Chesapeake Bay , was a mystery which no one was able to unravel , until some thirty years ago a document was discovered which has thrown much light upon the question . Here there steps again upon the scene that miserable intriguer , whose presence in the American army had so nearly wrecked the fortunes of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceeded to act the part of a doubly-dyed traitor . A marplot and mischief-maker from beginning to end , Charles Lee never failed to work injury to whichever party his selfish vanity or craven fear inclined him for the moment to serve . We have seen how , on the day when he was captured and taken to the British camp , his first thought was for his personal safety , which he might well suppose to be in some jeopardy , since he had formerly held the rank of lieutenant-colonel in the British army . He was taken to New York and confined in the City Hall , where he was treated with ordinary courtesy ; but there is no doubt that Sir William Howe looked upon him as a deserter , and was more than half inclined to hang him *See Atlantic Monthly for March , 1889. without ceremony . Fearing , however , as he said , that he might " fall into a law scrape , " should he act too hastily , Sir William wrote home for instructions , and in reply was directed by Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In pursuance of this order , Lee had already been carried on board ship , when a letter from Washington put a stop to these proceedings . The letter informed General Howe that Washington held five Hessian field-officers as hostages for Lee 's personal safety , and that all exchange of prisoners would be suspended until due assurance should be received that Lee was to be recognized as a prisoner of war . After reading this letter General Howe did not dare to send Lee to England for trial , for fear of possible evil consequences to the five Hessian officers , which might cause serious disaffection among the German troops . The king approved of this cautious behavior , and so Lee was kept in New York , with his fate undecided , until it had become quite clear that neither arguments nor threats could avail one jot to shake Washington 's determination . When Lord George Germaine had become convinced of this , he persuaded the reluctant king to yield the point ; and Howe was accordingly instructed that Lee , although worthy of condign punishment , should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchanged as such , whenever convenient . All this discussion necessitated the exchange of several letters between London and New York , so that a whole year elapsed before the question was settled . It was not until December 12 , 1777 , that Howe received these final instructions . But Lee had not been idle during all this time while his fate was in suspense . Hardly had the key been turned upon him in his rooms at // the City Hall when he began his intrigues . First , he assured Lord Howe and his brother that he had always opposed the declaration of independence , and even now cherished hopes that by a judiciously arranged interview with some of the delegates in Congress he might persuade the misguided people of America to return to their old allegiance . Lord Howe , who always kept one hand on the olive-branch , eagerly caught at the suggestion , and permitted Lee to send a letter to Congress , urging that a committee be sent to confer with him , as he had " important communications to make . " Could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his zeal for effecting a reconciliation would interest the Howes in his favor , and might save his precious neck . Congress , however , flatly refused to listen to the proposal , and then the wretch , without further ado , went over to the enemy , and began to counsel with the British commanders how they might best subdue the Americans in the summer campaign . He went so far as to write out for the brothers Howe a plan of operations , giving them the advantage of what was supposed to be his intimate knowledge of the conditions of the case . This document the Howes did not care to show after the disastrous event of the campaign , and it remained hidden for eighty years , until it was found among the domestic archives of the Strachey family , at Sutton Court , in Somerset . The first Sir Henry Strachey was secretary to the Howes from 1775 to 1778 . The documnent is in Lee 's well-known handwriting , and is indorsed by Strachey as " Mr. Lee 's plan , March 29 , 1777 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Maryland could be overawed , and the people of Virginia prevented from sending aid to Pennsylvania , then Philadelphia might be taken and held , and the operations of the " rebel government " paralyzed . The Tory party was known to be strong in Pennsylvania , and the circumstances under which Maryland had declared for independence , last of all the colonies save New York , were such as to make it seem probable that there also the loyalist feeling was very powerful . Lee did not hesitate to assert , as of his own personal knowledge , that the people of Maryland and Pennsylvania were nearly all loyalists , who only awaited the arrival of a British army in order to declare themselves . He therefore recommended that 14,000 men should drive Washington out of New Jersey and capture Philadelphia , while the remainder of Howe 's army , 4000 in number , should go around by sea to Chesapeake Bay , and occupy Alexandria and Annapolis . From these points , if Lord Howe were to issue a proclamation of amnesty , the pacifica* tion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two months ; and so confident of all this did the writer feel that he declared himself ready to " stake his life upon the issue , " a remark which betrays , perhaps , what was uppermost in his mind throughout the whole proceeding . At the same time , he argued that offensive operations toward the North could not " answer any sort of purpose , " since the Northern provinces " are at present neither the seat of government , strength , nor politics ; and the apprehensions from General Carleton 's army will , I am confident , keep the New Englanders at home , or at least confine em to the east side the Hudson river . " It will be observed that this plan of Lee 's was similar to that of Lord George Germaine , in so far as it aimed at thrusting the British power like a wedge into the centre of the confederacy , and thus cutting asunder New England and Virginia , the two chief centres of the rebellion . But instead of aiming his blow at the Hudson River , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital ; " and his reason for doing this shows how little he understood American affairs , and // how strictly he viewed them in the light of his military experience in Europe . In European warfare it is customary to strike at the enemy 's capital city , in order to get control of his whole system of administration ; but that the possession of an enemy 's capital is not always decisive the wars of Napoleon have most abundantly proved . The battles of Austerlitz in 1805 and Wagram in 1809 were fought by Napoleon after he had entered Yienna ; it was not his acquisition of Berlin in 1806 , but his victory at Friedland in the following summer , that completed the overthrow of Prussia ; and where he had to contend against a strong and united national feeling , as in Spain and Russia , the possession of the capital did not help him in the least . Nevertheless , in European countries , where the systems of administration are highly centralized , it is usually advisable to move upon the enemy 's capital . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the height of absurdity . Philadelphia had been selected for the meetings of thi Continental Congress because of its geographical position . It was the most centrally situated of our large towns , but it was in no sense the centre of a vast administrative machinery . If taken by an enemy , it was only necessary for Congress to move to any other town , and everything would go on as before . As it was not an administrative , so neither was it a military centre , It commanded no great system of interior highways , and it was comparatively difficult to protect by the fleet . It might be argued , on the other hand , that because Philadelphia was the largest town in the United States , and possessed of a certain preeminence as the seat of Congress , the acquisition of it by the invaders would give them a certain moral advantage . It would help the Tory party , and discourage the patriots . Such a gain , however , would be trifling compared with the loss which might come from Howe 's failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signally proved . Just how far the Howes were persuaded by Lee 's arguments must be a matter of inference . The course which they ultimately pursued , in close conformity with the suggestions of this remarkable document , was so disastrous to the British cause that the author might almost seem to have been intentionally luring them off on a false scent . One would gladly take so charitable a view of the matter , were it not both inconsistent with what we have already seen of Lee , and utterly negatived by his scandalous behavior the following year , after his restoration to his command in the American army . We can not doubt that Lee gave his advice in sober earnest . That considerable weight was attached to it is shown by a secret letter from Sir William Howe to Lord George Germaine , dated the 2d of April , or four days after the date of Lee 's extraordinary document . In this letter , Howe intimates for the first time that he has an expedition in mind which may modify the scheme for a joint campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To this suggestion Loid George replied on the 18th of May : " I trust that whatever you may meditate will be executed in time for you to coöperate with the army to proceed from Canada . " It was a few days after this that Lord George , perhaps feeling a little uneasy about the matter , wrote that imperative order which lay in its pigeon-hole in London until all the damage was done . With these data at our command , it becomes easy to comprehend General Howe 's movements during the spring and summer . His first intention was to push across New Jersey with the great body of his army , and occupy Philadelphia ; and since he had twice as many men as Washington , he might hope to do this in time to get back to the Hudson as soon as he was likely to be needed there . He began his march on // the 12th of June , five days before Burgoyne 's flotilla started southward on Lake Champlain . The enterprise did not seem hazardous , but Howe was completely foiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had fairly begun to move , Washington , from various symptoms , divined his purpose , and , coming down from his lair at MorristoWn , planted himself on the heights of iMliddlebrook , within ten miles of New Brunswick , close upon the flank of Howe 's line of march . Such a position , occupied by 8000 men under such a general , was equivalent to a fortress , which it would not do for Howe to pass by and leave in his rear . But the position was so strong that to try to storm it would be to invite defeat . It remained to be seen what could be done by manwuvring . The British army of 18,000 men was concentrated at New Brunswick , with plenty of boats for crossing the Delaware River , when that obstacle should be reached . But the really insuperable obstacle was close at hand . A campaign of eighteen days ensued , consisting of wily marches and countermarches , the result of which showed that Washington 's advantage of position could not be wrested from him . Howe could neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prudent to attack him ; and accordingly , on the last day of June , he abandoned his first plan , and evacuated New Jersey , taking his whole army over to Staten Island . This campaign has attracted far less attention than it deserves , mainly , no doubt , because it contained no battles or other striking incidents . It was purely a series of strategic devices . But in point of military skill it was , perhaps , as remarkable as anything that Washington ever did , and it certainly occupies a cardinal position in the history of the overthrow of Burgoyne . For if Howe had been able to take Philadelphia early in the summer , it is difficult to see what could have prevented him from returning and ascending the Hudson , in accordance with the plan of the ministry . Now the month of June was gone , and Burgoyne was approaching Ticonderoga . Howe ought to have held himself in readiness to aid him , but he could not seem to get Philadelphia , the , " rebel capital , " out of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half of Lee 's scheme . He decided to go around to Philadelphia by sea , but he was slow in starting , and seems to have paused for a moment to watch the course of events at the North . He began early in July to put his men on board ship , but confided his plans to no one but Cornwallis and Grant ; and his own army , as well as the Americans , believed that this show of going to sea was only a feint to disguise his real intention . Every one supposed that he would go up the Hudson . As soon as New Jersey was evacuated Washington moved back to Morristown , and threw his advance , under Sullivan , as far north as Pompton , so as to be ready to cooperate with Putnam , in the Highlands , at a moment 's notice . As soon as it became known that Ticonderoga had fallen , Washington , supposing that his adversary would do what a good general ought to do , advanced into the Eamapo Clove , a rugged defile in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Sullivan and Stirling across the river to Peekskill . All this while Howe kept moving some of his ships , now up the Hudson , now into the Sound , now off from Sandy Hook , so that people might doubt whether his destination were the Highlands , or Boston , or Philadelphia . Probably his own mind was not fully made up until after the news from Ticonderoga . Then , amid the general exultation , he seems to have concluded that Burgoyne would be able to take care of himself , at least with such coöperation as he might get from Sir Henry Clinton . In this mood he wrote to Burgoyne as follows : " I have . . // heard from the rebel army of your being in possession of Ticonderoga , which is a great event , carried without loss . Washington is waiting our motions here , and has detached Sullivan with about 2500 men , as I learn , to Albany . My intention is for Pennsylvania , where I expect to meet Washington ; but if he goes to the northward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at bay , be assured I shall soon be after him to relieve you . After your arrival at Albany , the movements of the enemy will guide yours ; but my wishes are that the enemy be drove sic out of this province before any operation takes place in Connecticut . Sir Henry Clinton remains in the command here , and will act as occurrences may direct . Putnam is in the Highlands with about 4000 men . Success be ever with you . " This letter , which was written on very narrow strips of thin paper , and conveyed in a quill , did not reach Burgoyne till the middle of September , when things wore a very different aspect from that which they wore in the middle of July . Nothing could better illustrate the rash , overconfident spirit in which Howe proceeded to carry out his Southern scheme . A few days afterward he put to sea with the fleet of 228 sail , carrying an army of 18,000 men , while 7000 were left in New York , under Sir Henry Clinton , to garrison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailing he wrote a letter to Burgoyne , stating that the destination of his fleet was Boston , and he artfully contrived that this letter should fall into Washington 's hands . But Washington was a difficult person to hoodwink . On reading the letter , he rightly inferred that Howe had gone southward . Accordingly , recalling Sullivan and Stirling to the west side of the Hudson , he set out for the Delaware , but proceeded very cautiously , lest Howe should suddenly retrace his course , and dart up the Hudson . To guard against such an emergency , he let Sullivan advance no farther than Morristown , and kept everything in readiness for an instant counter-march . In a letter of July 30th he writes , " Howe* s in a manner abandoning Burgoyne is so unaccountable a matter that , till I am fully assured of it , I can not he*p casting my eyes continually behind me . " Next day , learning that the fleet had arrived at the Capes of Delaware , he advanced to Germantown ; but on the day after , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea again , he at once suspected that the whole movement had been a feint . He believed that Howe would at once return to the Hudson , and immediately ordered Sullivan to counter-march , while he held himself ready to follow at a moment 's notice . His best generals entertained the same opinion . " I can not persuade myself , " said Greene , " that General Burgoyne would dare to push with such rapidity towards Albany if he did not expect support from General Howe . " A similar view of the military exigencies of the case was taken by the British officers , who , almost to a man , disapproved of the southward movement . They knew as well as Greene that , however fine a city Philadelphia might be , it was " an object of far less mjlitary importance than the Hudson River . " No wonder that the American generals were wide of the mark in their conjectures , for the folly of Howe 's movements after reaching the mouth of the Delaware was quite beyond credence , and would be inexplicable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the marplot Lee . Howe alleged as his reason for turning away from the Delaware that there were obstructions in the river and forts to pass , and accordingly he thought it best to go around by way of Chesapeake Bay , and land his army at Elkton . Now he might easily have gone a little way up the Delaware River without encountering any obstructions whatever , and landed his troops at a poiiit only thirteen miles east of Elkton. // Instead of attempting this , lie wasted twenty-four days in a voyage of four hundred miles , mostly against head-winds , in order to reach the same point ! No sensible antagonist could be expected to understand such eccentric behavior . No wonder that , after it had become clear that the fleet had gone southward , Washington should have supposed an attack on Charleston to be intended . A council of war on the 2lst decided that this must be the case , and since an overland march of seven hundred miles could not be accomplished in time to prevent such an attack , it was decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry Clinton . But before this decision was acted on Howe appeared at the head of Chesapeake Bay , where he landed his forces at Elkton . It was now the 25th of August , - nine days after the battle of Bennington and three days after the flight of St. Leger . Since entering Chesapeake Bay , Howe had received Lord George Germaine 's letter of May 18th , telling him that whatever he had to do ought to be done in time for him to cooperate with Burgoyne . Now Burgoyne 's situation had become dangerous , and here was Howe at Elkton , fifty miles southwest of Philadelphia , with Washington 's army in front of him , and more than three hundred miles away from Burgoyne ! On hearing of Howe 's arrival at the head of Chesapeake Bay , Washington had advanced as far as Wilmington to meet him . The first proceeding of the British general , on landing at Elkton , was to issue his proclamation of amnesty ; but it did not bring him many recruits . A counter-proclamation , drawn up by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were many people in the neighborhood who cared little for the cause of independence , there were but few who sympathized with the invaders enough to render them any valuable assistance . It was through a country indifferent , perhaps , but not friendly in feeling , that the British army cautiously pushed its way northward for a fortnight , until it reached the village of Kennett Square , six miles west of the Brandywine Creek , behind which Washington had planted himself to oppose its progress . The time had arrived when Washington felt it necessary to offer battle , even though such a step might not be justified from purely military reasons . The people were weary of a Fabian policy which they did not comprehend , and Washington saw that even if he were defeated , the moral effect upon the country would not be so bad as if he were to abandon Philadelphia without a blow . A victory he was hardly entitled to expect , since he had but 11,000 men against Howe 's 18,000 , and since the British were still greatly superior in equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his usual sagacity , and took possession of it by a swift and masterly movement . The Brandywine Creek ran directly athwart Howe 's line of march to Philadelphia . Though large enough to serve as a military obstacle , - in England it would be called a river , - it was crossed by numerous fords , of which the principal one , Chadd 's Ford , lay in Howe 's way . Washington placed the centre of his army just behind Chadd 's Ford and across the road . His centre was defended in front by a corps of artillery under Wayne , while Greene , on some high ground in the rear , was stationed as a reserve . Below Chadd 's Ford , the Brandywine becomes a roaring torrent , shut in between steep , high cliffs , so that the American left , resting upon these natural defenses , was sufficiently guarded by the Pennsylvania militia under Armstrong . The right wing , stretching two miles up the stream , into an uneven and thickly wooded country , was commanded by Sullivan . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practically inaccessible . // To try storming it in front would be a doubtful experiment , sure to result in terrible loss of life . The only weak point was the right , which could be taken in flank by a long circuitous march through the woods . Accordingly , on the morning of the 11th of September , the British right wing , under Knyphausen , began skirmishing and occupying Washington 's attention at Chadd 's Ford ; while the left column , under the energetic Cornwallis , marched up the Lancaster road , crossed the forks of the Brandywine , and turned southward toward Birmingham church , with the intention of striking the rear of the American right wing . It was similar to the flanking movement which had been tried so successfully at the battle of Long Island , a year before . It was quite like the splendid movement of Stonewall Jackson at Chancellorsyille , eighty-five years afterward . In Howe 's time such flanking marches were eminently fashionable . It was in this way that the great Frederick had won some of his most astonishing victories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous expedients , as the stupendous overthrow of the Austro-Russian army at Austerlitz was by and by to show . There is always a serious chance that outnumbers the army attacked , as at the Brandywine . But in all cases the chief element in their success is secrecy ; above all things , the party attacked must be kept in the dark . These points are admirably illustrated in the battle of the Brandywine . The danger of a flank attack upon his right wing was well undQrstood by Washington ; and as soon as he heard that Cornwallis was marching up the Lancaster road , he considered the feasibleness of doing what Frederick would probably have done , - of crossing quickly at Chadd 's and Brinton 's fords , in full force , and crushing Knyphausen 's division . This he could doubtless have accomplished , had he been so fortunate as to have inherited an army trained by the father of Frederick the Great . But Washington 's army was not yet well trained , and its numerical inferiority was such that Knyphausen 's division might of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The British movement was , therefore , well considered , and it was doubtless well that Washington did not return the offensive by crossing the creek . Moreover , the organization of his staff was far from complete . He was puzzled by conflicting reports as to the enemy 's movements . While considering the question of throwing his whole force against Knyphausen , he was stopped by a false report that Cornwallis was not moving upon his flank . So great was the delay in getting intelligence that Coruwallis had accomplished his long march of eighteen miles , and was approaching Birmingham church , before it was well known where he was . Nevertheless , his intention of dealing a death-blow to the American army was forestalled and partially checked . Before he had reached our right wing , Washington had ordered Sullivan to form a new front and advance toward Birmingham church . Owing to the imperfect discipline of the troops , Sullivan executed the movement rather clumsily , but enough was accomplished to save the army from rout . In the obstinate and murderous fight which ensued near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at length slowly pushed back in the direction of Dilworth . To save the army from being broken in two , it was now necessary for the centre to retreat upon Chester by way of Dilworth , and this moven*ient was accomplished by Greene with most consummate skill . It was now possible for Knyphausen to advance across Chadd 's Ford against Wayne 's position ; and he did so , aided by the right wing // of Cornwallis 's division , which , instead of joining in the oblique pursuit toward Dilworth , kept straight onward , and came down upon Wayne 's rear . iNothing was left for Wayne and Armstrong but to retreat and join the rest of the army at Chester , and so the battle of the Brandywine came to an end . This famous battle was admirably conducted on both sides . The risk assumed in the long flanking march of Cornwallis was fully justified . The poor organization of the American army was of course well known to the British commanders , and they took advantage of the fact . Had they been dealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course would have been foolhardy . On the other hand , when we consider the relative strength of the two armies , it is clear that the bold move of Cornwallis ought not simply to have won the field of battle . It ought to have annihilated the American army , had not its worst consequences been averted by Washington 's promptness , aided by Sullivan 's obstinate bravery and Greene 's masterly conduct of the retreat upon Dilworth . As it was , the American soldiers came out of the fight in good order . Nothing could be more absurd than the careless statement , so often made , that the Americans were " routed " at the Brandywine . Their organization was preserved , and at Chester , next day , they were as ready for fight as ever . They had exacted from the enemy a round price for the victory . The American loss was a little more than 1000 , incurred chiefly in Sullivan 's gallant struggle ; rolls afterward captured at Germantown showed that the British loss considerably exceeded that figure . So far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was decisive . When the news came , next morning , that the army had retreated upon Chester , there was great consternation in the " rebel capital . " Some timid people left their homes , and sought refuge in the mountains . Congress fled to Lancaster , first clothing Washington for sixty days with the same extraordinary powers which had been granted him the year before . Yet there was no need of such unseemly haste , for Washington detained the victorious enemy a fortnight on the march of only twenty-six miles ; a feat which not even Napoleon could have performed with an army that had just been " routed . " He had now heard of Stark 's victory and St. Leger 's flight , and his letters show how clearly he foresaw Burgoyne 's inevitable fate , provided Howe could be kept away from him . To keep Howe 's whole force employed near Philadelphia as long as possible was of the utmost importance . Accordingly , during the fortnight following the battle of the Brandywine , every day saw manoeuvres or skirmishes , in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a loss of three hundred men . On the 26th , while Howe established his headquarters at Germantown , Cornwallis entered Philadelphia in triumph , marching with bands of music and flying colors , and all the troops decked out in their finest scarlet array . Having got possession of the " rebel capital , " the question now arose whether it would be possible to hold it through the winter . The Delaware River , below the city , had been carefully obstructed by chevaux - de - frise , which were guarded by two strong fortresses , - Fort Muffin on an island in mid-stream , and Fort Mercer on the Jersey shore . The river was here about two miles in width , but it was impossible for ships to pass until the forts should have been reduced . About the first of October , after a rough return voyage of four hundred miles , Lord Howe 's fleet appeared at the mouth of the Delaware . It was absolutely necessary to gain control of the river , in order that the city might get supplies by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unbroken , the Americans were quite able to cut off all // supplies by land . Sir William Howe , therefore , threw a portion of his forces across the river , to aid his brother in reducing the forts . The quick eye of Washington now saw an opportunity for attacking the main British army , while thus temporarily weakened ; and he forthwith planned a most brilliant battle , which was fated to be lost , ftt the very moment of victory , by an extraordinary accident . The village of Germantown , on the bank of the Schuylkill River , was then separated from Philadelphia by about six miles of open country . The village consisted chiefly of a single street , about two miles in length , with stone houses on either side , standing about a hundred yards apart from each other , and surrounded by gardens and orchards . Near the upper end of the street , in the midst of ornamental shrubbery , vases , and statues , arranged in a French style of landscape gardening , stood the massively built house of Benjamin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mile below , at the Market House , the main street was crossed at right angles by the Old School Lane . Beside the main street , running over Cbestnut Hill . the village was approached from the northward by three roads . The Monatawny road ran down by the bank of the Schaylkill , and , crossing the Old School Lane , bore on toward Philadelphia . The Limekiln road , coming from the northeast , became continuous with the Old School Lane . The Old York road , still further eastward , joined the main street at the Rising Sun tavern , about two miles below the Market House . The British army lay encampeA just behind the Old School Lane , in the lower part of the village : the left wing , under Knyphausen , to the west of the main street ; the right , under Grant , to the east . A strong detachment of chasseurs , under Sir Charles Grey , covered the left wing . About a mile in advance of the army , Colonel Musgrave 's regiment lay in a field opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward a battalion of light infantry was stationed on the slight eminence known as Mount Airy , where a small battery commanded the road to the north . Washington 's plan of attack seems to have contemplated nothing less than the destruction or capture of the British army . His forces were to advance from the north by all four roads at once , and converge upon the British at the Market House . The American right wing , under Sullivan , and consisting of Sullivan 's own brigade , with those of Conway , Wayne , Maxwell , and Nash , was to march down the main street , overwhelm the advanced parties of the British , and engage their left wing in front ; while Armstrong , with the Pennsylvania militia , was to move down the Monatawny road , and take the same wing in flank . The American left wing , commanded by Greene , was also to proceed in two columns . Greene , with his own brigade , supported by Stephen and McDougal , was to march down the Limekiln road , and assail the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smallwood and Forman , coming down the Old York road , were to strike the same wing in the rear . The flank attack upon the British left , entrusted as it was to militia , was intended merely as a demonstration . The attack upon their right , conducted by more than half of the American army , including its best troops , was intended to crush that wing , and , folding back the whole British army upon the Schuylkill River , compel it to surrender . Considering that the Americans had not even yet a superiority in numbers , this was a most audacious plan . No better instance could be given of the spirit of wild and venturous daring which was as conspicuous in Washington as his cautious vigilance , whenever any fit occasion arose for displaying it . The // brilliant scheme came surprisingly near to success ; so near as to redeem it from the imputation of foolhardiness , and to show that here , as in all Washington 's military movements , cool judgment went along with fiery dash . At seven in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon Germantown began , Washington accompanying Sullivan 's column . At sunrise a heavy fog came up , and the darkness went on increasing . Soon after the hour of daybreak the light infantry upon Mount Airy were surprised and routed , and the battery was captured . Musgrave was next overwhelmed by the heavy American column ; but he , with a small force , took refuge in Judge Chew 's house , and set up a brisk fire from the windows . The Americans opened an artillery-fire upon the house , but its stone walls were too solid to be beaten down by the three-pound and six-pound fieldpieces of that day ; and so Maxwell 's brigade was left behind to besiege the house , while the rest of the column rushed on down the street . The chief effect of this incident was to warn the enemy , while retarding and somewhat weakening the American charge . Nevertheless , the fury of the attack was such as to disconcert Knyphausen 's veterans , and the British left wing slowly gave way before Sullivan . At this moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right wing with such vigdr as presently to force it back toward the Market House . The British ranks were falling into confusion , and Smallwood 's column had already arrived upon their right flank , when the accident occurred which changed the fortunes of the day . From the beginning the dense fog had been a source of confusion to both armies , and had seriously interfered with the solidity of the American advance . Now , as Stephen 's brigade , on the right of Greene 's column , came into the village , the heavy firing at Judge Chew 's seems to have caused him to diverge more and more to the west , in the belief that there was the thick of the battle . At the same time , Wayne , in driving the enemy before him , had swayed somewhat to the east , so that his brigade stood almost directly in the line of Stephen 's progress . In this position he was attacked by Stephen , who mistook him for the enemy . This lamentable blunder instantly ruined the battle . Wayne 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggling to extricate themselves , were thrown upon the left flank of Sullivan 's brigade , and a panic suddenly ran through the army . The confusion grew worse and worse , till a general retreat began , and Grey , who had come up to support the crumbling right wing of the British , was now able to lead in the pursuit of the Americans . He was joined by Coruwallis , who had sprung from his bed in Philadelphia at the first sound of the cannon , and had brought up two battalions with him at doublequick . But the panic had subsided almost as soon as the golden moment of victory was lost , and the retreat was conducted in excellent order . One regiment in Greene 's column was surrounded and captured , but the army brought away all its cannon and wounded , with several cannon taken from the enemy . The loss of the Americans in killed and wounded was 673 , and the loss of the British was 535 . The fog which enshrouded the village of Germantown on that eventful morning has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the armies engaged . The reports of different observers conflicted in many details , and particularly as to the immediate occasion of the fatal panic . The best accounts agree , however , that the entanglement of Stephen with Wayne was chiefly responsible for the disaster . It was charged against Stephen that he had taken too many pulls at his canteen on the long , damp night march , and he was tried by court - martial and dismissed from the service . The chagrin of the Americans // at losing the prize so nearly grasped was profound . The total rout of Howe , coming at the same time with the surrender of Burgoyne , would probably have been too much for Lord North 's ministry to bear , and might have brought the war to a sudden close . As it was , the British took an undue amount of comfort in the acquisition of Philadelphia , though so long as Washington 's army remained defiant it was of small military value to them . On the other hand , the genius and audacity shown by Washington , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British army only three weeks after the defeat at the Brandywine , produced a profound impression upon military critics in Europe . Frederick of Prussia saw that presently , when American soldiers should come to be disciplined veterans , they would become a very formidable instrument in the hands of their great commander ; and the French court , in making up its mind that the Americans would prove efficient allies , is said to have been influenced almost as much by the battle of Germantown as by the surrender of Burgoyne . Having thus escaped the catastrophe which Washington had designed for him , the British commander was now able to put forth his utmost efforts for the capture of the forts on the Delaware . His utmost efforts were needed , for in the first attack on Fort Mercer , October 22 , the Hessians were totally defeated , with the loss of Count Donop and 400 men , while the Americans lost but 37 . But after a month of hard work , with the aid of 6600 more men sent from New York by Clinton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Delaware was wrested from the Americans . Another month of manuuvring and skirmishing followed , and then Washington took his army into winter quarters at Valley Forge . The events which attended his sojourn in that natural stronghold belong to a later period of the war . We must now return to the upper waters of the Hudson , and show how the whole period , which may be most fitly described as a struggle for the control of the great central State of New York , was brought to an end by the complete and overwhelming victory of the Americans . We have seen how it became impossible for Howe to act upon Lord George Germaine 's order , received in August , in Chesapeake Bay , and get back to the Hudson in time to be of any use to Burgoyne . We have also seen how critical was the situation in which the Northern general was left , after the destruction of Baum and St. Leger , and the accumulation of New England yeomanry in his rear . Burgoyne now fully acknowledged the terrible mistake of the ministry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the machinations of a few wily demagogues , and that the people would hail the approach of the king 's troops as deliverers . " The great bulk of the country , " said he , " is undoubtedly with the Congress in principle and zeal , and their measures are executed with a secrecy and dispatch that are not to be equaled . . . . The Hampshire Grants , in particular , a country unpeopled and almost unknown last war , now abounds in the most active and most rebellious race of the continent , and hangs like a gathering storm upon my left . " The situation had , indeed , become so alarming that it is hard to say what Burgoyne ought to have done . A retreat upon Ticonderoga would have been fraught with peril , while to cross the Hudson and advance from Albany would be doing like Cortes , when he burned his ships behind him . But Burgoyne was a man of chivalrous nature . He did not think it right or prudent to abandon Sir William Howe , whom he still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a letter to Lord George Germaine , written three days after the surrender , he says , " The difficulty // of a retreat upon Canada was clearly foreseen , as was the dilemma , should the retreat be effected , of leaving at liberty such an army as General Gates 's to operate against Sir William Howe . This consideration operated forcibly to determine me to abide events as long as possible , and I reasoned thus : the expedition which I commanded was at first evidently intended to be hazarded ; circumstances might require it should be devoted . " Influenced by these views , which were supported by all his generals except Riedesel , Burgoyne threw a bridge of boats across the Hudson , and passed over with his whole army on the 13th of September . The Americans had taken a strong position on Bemis Heights , where Kosciuszko had skillfully fortified their camp with batteries and redoubts . Burgoyne felt that the time for desperate fighting had now come , and it seemed to him that the American position might be turned and carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning of the 19th , he advanced through the woods , with the centre of his army , toward the point where the Quaker road passes Bemis Heights . The right wing , under Fraser , proceeded somewhat more circuitously toward the same point , the plan being that they should join forces and strike the rear of the American camp , while Riedesel and Phillips , with the left wing and the artillery , marching down the river road , should assail it in front . Three heavy guns , announcing to the left wing the junction of Burgoyne and Fraser , were to give the signal for a general assault . American scouts , lurking among the upper branches of tall trees that grew on steep hillsides , presently caught glimpses of bright scarlet flitting through the green depths of the forest , while the long sunbeams that found their way through the foliage sent back quick burning flashes from a thousand bayonets . By noon the course of the British march and their plan of attack had been fully deciphered , and the intelligence was carried to Arnold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army . Gates appears to have been unwilling to let any of the forces descend from their strong position ; but the fiery Arnold urged and implored , until he got permission to take Morgan 's riflemen and Dearborn 's infantry , and go forth to attack the enemy . Arnold 's advance , under Morgan , first fell upon Burgoyne 's advance , at Freeman 's Farm , and checked its progress . Fraser then , hearing the musketry , turned eastward to the rescue , while Arnold , moving upon Fraser 's left , sought to cut him asunder from Burgoyne . He seemed to be winning the day , when he was attacked in flank by Riedesel , who had hurried up from the river road . Arnold had already sent to Gates for reinforcements , which were refused him . Arnold maintained that this was a gross blunder on the part of the commanding general , and that with 2000 more men he could now easily have crushed the British centre and defeated their army . In this opinion he was probably right , since even as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight , for two hours , until darkness put an end to the struggle . The losses on each side are variously estimated at from 600 to 1000 , or from one fifth to one fourth of the forces engaged , which indicates severe fighting . Arnold 's command had numbered about 3000 , and he bad been engaged , in the course of the afternoon , with at least 4000 of Burgoyne 's army ; yet all this while some 11,000 Americans - most of the army , in short - had been kept idle on Bemis Heights by the incompetent Gates . Burgoyne tried to console himself with the idea that he had won a victory , because his army slept that night at Freeman 's Farm ; but , in his testimony given afterward before the House of Commons , he rightly maintained that his plan of attack had been utterly defeated by the bold and skillful tactics of " Mr. " Arnold . // In the dispatches which he now sent to Congress , Gates took to himself all the credit of this brilliant affair , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , rang with praise of the fighting general , until Gates , who never could bear to hear any one but himself well spoken of , waxed wroth and revengeful . Arnold , moreover , freely blamed Gates for not supporting him , and for refusing to renew the battle on the next morning , while the enemy were still disconcerted . Arnold 's warm friendship with Schuyler gave further offense to the commander ; and three days after the battle he sought to wreak his spite by withdrawing Morgan 's riflemen and Dearborn 's light infantry from Arnold 's division . A fierce quarrel ensued ; and Gates told Arnold that as soon as Lincoln should arrive he would have no further use for him , and he might go back to Washington 's camp as soon as he liked . Arnold , in a white rage , said he would go , and asked for a pass , which his enemy promptly gave him ; but after receiving it , second thoughts prevented him from going . All the general officers except Lincoln - who seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so high in the good graces of Massachusetts as Gates - united in signing a letter entreating Arnold to remain . He had been sent here by Washington to aid the Northern army with all his might , and clearly it would be wrong to leave it now , on the eve of a decisive battle . So the proud , fiery soldier , smarting under an accumulation of injuries , made up his mind once more to swallow the affront , and wait for a chance to make himself useful . He stayed in his quarters , awaiting the day of battle , though it was understood that he was relieved of his command , and Gates took no more notice of him than if he had been a dog . Nothing more was done for eighteen days . Just before the crossing of the Hudson by the Northern army , Sir Henry Clinton , acting " as circumstances may direct , " had planned an expedition up the river in aid of it ; and Burgoyne , hearing of this the day after the battle at Freeman 's Farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assault upon the American lines . But things were swiftly coming to such a pass that it would not do to wait . On the 21st , news came to the British camp that a detachment of Lincoln 's troops had laid siege to Ticonderoga , and , while holding the garrison in check , had captured several ships and taken 300 prisoners . A day or two later came the news that these stout New Englanders had embarked on Lake George in the ships they had captured , and were cutting off the last sources of supply . And now , while even on shortest rations there was barely three weeks ' food for the army , Lincoln 's main force appeared in front , thus swelling the numbers of the American army to more than 16,000 . The case had become as desperate as that of the Athenians at Syracuse before their last dreadful battle in the harbor . So , after eighteen weary days , no word yet coming from Clinton , the gallant Burgoyne attempted , by a furious effort , to break through the lines of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . On the morning of October 7th , leaving the rest of his army in camp , Burgoyne advanced with 1500 picked men to turn the American left . Small as the force was , its quality was superb , and with it were all the best commanders , - Phillips , Riedesel , Fraser , Balcarras , and Ackland . Such a compact force , so ably led , might manwuvre quickly . If , on sounding the American position on the left , they should find it too strong to be forced , they might swiftly retreat . At all events , the movement would cover a foraging party which Burgoyne had sent out , - and this was no small matter . Arnold , too , the fighting general , held no command ; and Gates was known // to be a sluggard . Such thoughts may have helped to shape the conduct of the British commander on this critical morning . But the scheme was swiftly overturned . As the British came on , their right was suddenly attacked by Morgan , while the New England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After a short , sharp fight against overwhelming numbers , their whole line was broken , and Fraser sought to form a second line a little further back and on the west border of Freeman 's Farm , though the ranks were badly disordered and all their cannon were lost . At this moment , Arnold , who had been watching from the heights , saw that a well-directed blow might not only ruin this retreating column , but also shatter the whole British army . Quick as thought he sprang upon his horse , and galloped to the scene of action . He was greeted with deafening hurrahs , and the men , leaping with exultation at sight of their beloved commander , rushed upon Fraser 's half-formed line . At the same moment , while Morgan was still pressing on the British right , one of his marksmen shot General Fraser , who fell , mortally wounded , just as Arnold charged with mad fury upon his line . The British forthwith turned and fled from the field . Arnold next attacked Lord Balcarras , who had retired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but finding the resistance here too strong , he swept by , and charged upon the Canadian auxiliaries , who occupied a position just north of Balcarras , and covered the left wing of Breymann 's forces at the extreme right of the British camp . The Canadians soon fled , leaving Breymann uncovered ; and Arnold forthwith rushed against Breymann on the left , just as Morgan , who had prolonged his flanking march , assailed him on the right . Breymaun was slain and his force routed ; the British right wing was crushed , and their whole position taken in reverse and made untenable . Just at this moment , a wounded German soldier , lying on the ground , took aim at Arnold , and slew his horse , while the ball passed through the general 's left leg , that had been wounded at Quebec , and fractured the bone a little above the knee . As Arnold fell , one of his men rushed up to bayonet the wounded soldier who had shot him , when the prostrate general cried , " For God 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine fellow ! " The poor German was saved , and it has been well said that this was the hour when Benedict Arnold should have died . His fall and the gathering twilight stopped the progress of the battle , but the American victory was complete and decisive . Nothing was left for Burgoyne but to get the wreck of his army out of the way as quickly as possible , and the next day he did so , making a skillful retreat upon Saratoga , in the course of which , during a skirmish , his soldiers burned General Schuyler 's princely country-house , with its barns and granaries , thus inflicting upon the general a loss of more than ? 10,000 . As the British retreated , General Gates steadily closed in upon them with his overwhelming forces , which now numbered nearly 20,000 . Gates knew how to be active after the victory , although , when fighting was going on , lie was a general of sedentary habits . When Arnold rushed down , at the critical moment , to complete the victory of Saratoga , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Call back that fellow , " said Gates , " or he will be doing something rash ! " But the eager Arnold had outgalloped the messenger , and came back only when his leg was broken and the victory won . In the mean time Gates sat at his headquarters , forgetful of the battle that was raging below , while he argued the merits of the American Revolution with a wounded British officer , Sir Francis Clarke , who had been brought in and laid upon the // commander 's bed to die . Losing his temper in the discussion , Gates called his adjutant , Wilkinson , out of the room , and asked him , " Did you ever hear so impudent a son of a b-h ? " And this seems to have been all that the commanding general contributed to the crowning victory of Saratoga . When Burgoyne reached the place where he had crossed the Hudson , he found a force of 3000 Americans , with several batteries of cannon , occupying the hills on the other side , so that it was now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandon all the artillery and baggage , push through the woods by night , and effect a crossing higher up , by Fort Edward , where the great river begins to be fordable . But no sooner had this plan been made than word was brought that the Americans were guarding all the fords , and had also planted detachments in a strong position to the northward , between Fort Edward and Fort George . The British army , in short , was surrounded . A brisk cannonade was opened upon it from the east and south , while Morgan 's sharpshooters kept up a galling fire in the rear . Some of the women and wounded men were sent for safety to a large house in the neighborhood , where they took refuge in the cellar ; and there the Baroness Riedesel tells us how she passed six dismal nights and days , crouching in a corner near the doorway , with her three little children clinging about her , while every now and then , with hideous crashing , a heavy cannonball passed through the room overhead . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little food could be obtained , and the suffering from thirst was dreadful . It was only a few steps to the river , but every man who ventured out with a bucket was shot dead by Virginia rifles that never missed their aim . At last the brave wife of a British soldier volunteered to go ; and thus the water was brought again and again , for the Americans would not fire at a woman . And now , while Burgoyne 's last ray of hope was dying , and while the veteran Phillips declared himself heartbroken at the misery which he could not relieve , where was Sir Henry Clinton ? He had not thought it prudent to leave New York until after the arrival of 3000 soldiers whom he expected from England . These men arrived on the 29th of September , but six days more elapsed before Sir Henry had taken them up the river and landed them near Putnam ' s headquarters at Peekskill . In a campaign of three days lie outwitted that general , carried two of the forts after obstinate resistance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus laid open the river so that British ships might go up to Albany . On the 8th of October , Sir Henry wrote to Burgoyne from Fort Montgomery : " Nous y voici , and nothing between us and Gates . I sincerely hope this little success of ours will facilitate your operations . " This dispatch wa* written on a scrap of very thin paper , and encased in an oval silver bullet , which opened with a tiny screw in the middle . Sir Henry then sent General Vaughan , with several frigates and the greater part of his force , to make all haste for Albany . As they passed up the river , the next day , they could not resist the temptation to land and set fire to the pretty village of Kingston , then the seat of the state legislature . George Clinton , governor of the Staten just retreating from his able defense of the captured forts , hastened to protect the village , but came up only in time to see it in flames from one end to the other . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roadside , was caught and taken to the governor . He had been seen swallowing something , so they gave him an emetic , and obtained the silver bullet . The dispatch was read ; the bearer was hanged to an apple-tree ; and Burgoyne , weary // with waiting for the news that never came , at last sent a flag of truce to General Gates , inquiring what terms of surrender would be accepted . Gates first demanded an unconditional surrender , but on Burgoyne 's indignant refusal he consented to make terms , and the more readily , no doubt , since he knew what had just happened in the Highlands , though his adversary did not . After three days of discussion the terms of surrender were agreed upon . Just as Burgoyne was about to sign the articles , a Tory made his way into camp with hearsay news that part of Clinton 's army was approaching Albany . The subject was then anxiously reconsidered by the British officers , and an interesting discussion ensued as to whether they had so far pledged their faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . The majority of the council decided that their faith was irrevocably pledged , and Burgoyne yielded to this opinion , though he did not share it , for he did not feel quite clear that the rumored advance of Clinton could now avail to save him in any case . In this he was undoubtedly right . The Amencan army , with its daily accretions of militia , had now grown to more than 20,000 , and armed yeomanry were still pouring in by the hundred . A diversion threatened by less than 3000 men , who were still more than fifty miles distant , could not now have averted the doom of the British army . The only effect which it did produce was , perhaps , to work upon the timid Gates , and induce him to offer easy terms in order to hasten the surrender . On the 17th of October , accordingly , the articles were signed , exchanged , and put into execution . It was agreed that the British army should march out of camp with the honors of war , and pile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ march through Massachusetts to Boston , from which port they might sail for Europe , it being understood that none of them should serve again in America during the war ; all the officers might retain their small arms , and no one s private luggage should be searched or molested . At Burgoyne 's earnest solicitation , the American general consented that these proceedings should be styled a convention , ' ' instead of a surrender , in imitation of the famous Convention of Kloster-Seven , by which the Duke of Cumberland , twenty years before , had sought to save his feelings while losing his army , beleaguered by the French in Hanover . The soothing phrase has been well remembered by British historians , who to this day continue to speak of Burgoyne 's surrender as the " Convention of Saratoga . " In carrying out the terms of the convention , both Gates and his soldiers showed praiseworthy dclicacy . As the British marched off to a meadow by the river side and laid down their arms , the Americans remained within their lines , refusing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looking omi . As the disarmed soldiers then passed by the American lines , says Lieutenant Anbury , one of the captured officers , " I did not observe the least disrespect or even a taunting look , but all was mute astonishment and pity . " Burgoyne stepped up and handed his sword to Gates , simply saying , " The fortune of war , General Gates , has made me your prisoner . " The American general instantly returned the sword , replying , " I shall always be ready to testify that it has not been through any fault of your excellency . " When Baron Riedesel had been presented to Gates and the other generals , he sent for his wife and children . Set free at last from the dreadful cellar , the baroness came with some trepidation into the enemy 's camp ; but the only look she saw upon any face was one of sympathy . " As I approached the tents , " she says , " a noble-looking gentleman came toward me , and took the children out of the wagon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with tears in his eyes , helped me also to alight . Presently he said , It may be embarrassing to you to dine with so many gentlemen . If you will come with your children to my tent , I will give you a frugal meal , but one that will at least be seasoned with good wishes . ' Oh , sir , ' I cried , you must surely be a husband and a father , since you show me so much kindness ! ' I then learned that it was General Schuyler . " Schuyler had indeed come , with unruffled soul , to look on while the fruit which he had sown , with the gallant aid of Stark and Herkimer , Arnold and Morgan , was plucked by an unworthy rival . He now met Burgoyne , who was naturally pained and embarrassed at the recollection of the beautiful house which his men had burned a few days before . In a speech in the House of Commons , some months later , Burgoyne told how Schuyler received him . " I expressed to General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the event which had happened , and the reasons which had occasioned it . He desired me to think no more of it , saying that the occasion justified it , according to the rules of war . He did more : he sent an aide-decamp to conduct me to Albany , in order , as he expressed it , to procure me better quarters than a stranger might be able to find . This gentleman conducted me to a very elegant house , and , to my great surprise , presented me to Mrs. Schuyler and her family ; and in this general 's house I remained during my whole stay at Albany , with a table of more than twenty covers for me and my friends , and every other possible demonstration of hospitality . " Madame Riedesel was also invited to stay with the Schuylers ; and when first she arrived in the house , one of her little girls exclaimed , " Oh , mamma ! Is this the palace that papa was to have when he came to America ? " As the Schuylers understood German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and put her at ease . With the generosity and delicacy thus shown alike by generals and soldiers , it is painful , though instructive , to contrast the coarseness and bad faith with which Congress proceeded to treat the captured army . The presence of the troops in and about Boston was felt to be a hardship , and General Heath , who commanded there , wrote to Washington , saying that if they were to stay till cold weather he hardly knew how to find shelter and fuel for them . Washington replied that they would not be likely to stay long , since it was clearly for Howe 's interest to send them back to England as soon as possible , in order that they might replace other soldiers who would be sent over to America for the spring campaign . Congress caught up this suggestion with avidity , and put it to uses the furthest possible removed from Washington 's meaning . When Sir William Howe proposed Newport as a point from which the soldiers might more speedily be shipped , Washington , for sound and obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strict letter of the convention . Congress forthwith not only acted upon this suggestion so far as to refuse Sir William Howe 's request , but it went on gratuitously and absurdly to charge the British general with bad faith . It was hinted that he secretly intended to bring the troops to New York for immediate service , in defiance of the convention , and Congress proceeded to make this imputed treachery the ground for really false dealing on its own part . When Lord Howe 's transports reached Boston , it was not only ordered that no troops should be allowed to embark until all the accounts for their subsistence should have been settled , but it was also required that these accounts should be liquidated in gold . In the instructions given to General Washington a year before , a refusal on the part of anybody to receive the Continental paper money // was to be treated as a high misdemeanor . Now Congress refused to take its own money , which had depreciated till it was worth barely thirty cents on a dollar . The captured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for by General Heath with Continental paper , and now Congress insisted that General Burgoyne should make his repayment dollar for dollar in British gold , worth three times as much . In fairness to the delegates , we may admit that in all probability they did not realize the baseness of this conduct . They were no doubt misled by one of those wonderful bits of financial sophistry by which the enacting mind of our countrymen has so often been hopelessly confused . In an amusing letter to Washington , honest General Heath naively exclaims , " What an opinion must General Burgoyne have of the authority of these States , to suppose that his money would be received at any higher rate than our own in public payment ! Such payment would at once be depreciating our currency with a witness . " Washington was seriously annoyed and mortified by these vagaries , - the more so that he was at this very time endeavoring to arrange with Howe a general cartel for the exchange of prisoners ; and he knew that the attempt to make thirty cents equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroy the very idea of a cartel . " While these discussions were going on , Congress , like the wicked king in the fairy tale , anxious to impose conditions unlikely to be fulfilled , demanded that General Burgoyne should make out a descriptive list of all the officers and soldiers in his army , in order that if any of them should thereafter be found serving against the United States they might be punished accordingly . As no such provision was contained in the convention , upon the faith of which Burgoyne had surrendered , he naturally regarded the demand as insulting , and at first refused to comply with it . He afterwards yielded the point , in his eagerness to liberate his soldiers ; but meanwhile , in a letter to Gates , he had incautiously let fall the expression , " The publick faith is broke sic ; " and this remark , coming to the ears of Congress , was immediately laid hold of as a pretext for repudiating the convention altogether . It was argued that Burgoyne had charged the United States with bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the convention on his own part ; and on the 8th of January , Congress accordingly resolved , " that the embarkation of Lieutenant - General Burgoyne and the troops under his command be suspended till a distinct and explicit ratification of the Convention of Saratoga shall be properly notified by the court of Great Britain to Congress . " Now as the British government could not give the required ratification without implicitly recognizing the independence of the United States , no further steps were taken in the matter , the " publick faith " was really broken , and the captured army was never sent home . In this wretched affair , Congress deliberately sacrificed principle to policy . It refused , on paltry pretexts , to carry out a solemn engagement which had been made by its accredited agent ; and it did so simply through the fear that the British army might indirectly gain a possible reinforcement . Its conduct can be justified upon no grounds save such as would equally justify firing upon flags of truce . Nor can it be palliated even upon the lowest grounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " to a people struggling for political life the moral support derivable from the maintenance of honor and good faith was worth a dozen material victories . " This sacrifice of principle to policy has served only to call down the condemnation of impartial historians , and to dim the lustre of the magnificent victory which the valor of our soldiers and the self-devotion of our people had won in the field . // It was one out of many instances which show that , under any form of government , the moral sense of the governing body is likely to fall far below the highest moral standard recognized in the community . The captured army was never sent home . The officers were treated as prisoners of war , and from time to time were exchanged . Burgoyne was allowed to go to England in the spring , and while still a prisoner on parole he took his seat in Parliament , and became conspicuous among the defenders of the American cause . The troops were detained in the neighborhood of Boston until the autumn of 1778 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here a rude village was built on the brow of a pleasant ridge of hills , and gardens were laid out and planted . Much kind assistance was rendered in all this work by Thomas Jefferson , who was then living close by , on his estate at Monticello , and did everything in his power to make things comfortable for soldiers and officers . Two years afterward , when Virginia became the seat of war , some of them were removed to Winchester in the Shenandoah Valley , to Frederick in Maryland , and to Lancaster in Pennsylvania . Those who wished to return to Europe were exchanged or allowed to escape . The greater number , especially of the Germans , preferred to stay in this country and become American citizens . Before the end of 1780 they had dispersed in all directions . Such was the strange sequel of a campaign which , whether we consider the picturesqueness of its incidents or the magnitude of its results , was one of the most memorable in the history of mankind . Its varied scenes , framed in landscapes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of manhood as the feathei*ed Mohawk sachem , the helmeted Brunswick dragoon , and the blue-frocked yeoman of New England , - types of ancient savagery , of the militant despotism bequeathed from the Middle Ages , and of the industrial democracy that is to possess and control the future of the world . These men had mingled in a deadly struggle for the strategic centre of the Atlantic coast of North America , and now the fight had ended in the complete and overwhelming defeat of the forces of George III . Four years , indeed , - four years of sore distress and hope deferred , - were yet to pass before the fruits of this great victory could be gathered . The independence of the United States was not yet won ; but the triumph at Saratoga set in motion a train of events from which the winning of independence was destined surely to follow .
