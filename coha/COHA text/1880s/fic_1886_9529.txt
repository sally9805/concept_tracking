Discovered : At rise of curtain , Mary enters at gate , C. , from garden , with a basket on each arm . She is singing . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song before going on with the act . Mary . Mary Let me see . The left one is for old Mrs. Churchly  --  and the jellies and things in the right are for the curate 's sick wife . I trot around with so many bundles and baskets , I get them mixed up sometimes . Ha , ha , ha ! Yesterday I took Miss Magdalen 's cast-off gown to that poor widower with one boy baby . Ha , ha , ha ! What with a gentleman running in my mistress ' head  --  and a gentleman 's gentleman running in mine  --  we are getting everything so confused at Ivers Dean . Sings , and is going over stile L. She starts back Who 's this ? Oh ! One of those tramps . Enter Paul Daly , over stile L. He stops on its top , looks at Mary a moment , steps down . He has the general appearance of a tramp Paul . Paul Daly I beg your pardon  --  allow me . Offers to assist her over the stile . She tosses her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking back at him contemptuously . She begins to sing and disappears , her voice dying away gradually , Paul looking after her My polite attentions have been reject Ed . If she had been a peeress of the realm , she would have given me her hand and thanked me for helping her over the stile . But she is n't a peeress of the realm . We must make allowances . Looks about him Snug little place ; I wonder what 's the best policy to be pursued here . Sits on the stile Ask for what you can get  --  or get what you can , without asking . Well , I have n't been in polite society for so long that I may as well do the civil thing for a change . I 'll call at the back door ; I should think a tale of woe would find them at home .

Paul Daly Oh , nothing , thank you kindly , sir  --  nothing  --  merely hunger ; five and forty miles to tramp and not a penny for a loaf of bread . Mark . Mark Fleming Half a mile further on and you will find a very excellent institution called the Union , where you can stop and get relief . Paul . Paul Daly Thank you kindly again , sir , but I 'd rather walk on . I 'm a very poor man , sir ; but even hunger can not tempt me to part with my self-respect . Honest pride is all that I have left in the world . Mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul Daly Obsequiously taking it Thank you , sir . You have saved me the humiliation of begging for charity . Exits through gate , C. , moving to house R. Mark . Mark Fleming Laughing Now , I wonder what that fellow 's definition of the word " begging " is . A queer lot , these tramps . They always interest me . They 're such original devils ; such a keen perception of the ludicrous . Honest pride  --  beautiful ! It seems as though I know that fellow 's face , by the way . I 've seen it in the dock . A barrister becomes as sharp as a detective in the matter of faces . Where the deuce have I got ? I wish I 'd taken the dogcart Ned sent down for me . I 'm in a labyrinth of prescriptive paths . This looks like Rosamond 's Bower  --  in the middle of the labyrinth . I could swear some beautiful captive was imprisoned here . There 's the touch of a woman 's hand in every rosebush , a young woman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall " L-o-v-e . " Of course , it 's a young woman . I see her hand in that word  --  and her heart , too . Horticultural spelling . On the bark of that old beech down there , I distinctly saw two names  --  " Edward " and " Magdalen . " This ca n't be far from Chilcote Hall ; I wonder if Ned Chilcote  --  Pshaw ! He 's a captain in His Majesty 's service . I 'm in love myself , but I 'm not such a fool as to go cutting my signature on the trees . " Kate Chilcote  --  Mark Fleming , barrister ! " How would that look on the bark of an oak ? Here comes fair Rosamond 's pretty maid . My curiosity is piqued . Reenter Mary by stile , with empty baskets , singing Will you kindly tell me whether I am anywhere near Chilcote Hall ? Mary . Mary Straight through the shrubbery  --  only a few steps , sir . Mark . Mark Fleming Only a few steps ! Aside Suspicious proximity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I suppose , coming to visit him ? Mark .

There is n't a sweeter young lady than my mistress in the whole country . Mark . Mark Fleming Oh  --  ah  --  precisely . I was thinking of an aunt of hers . Mary . Mary She has n't any aunt , sir . Mark . Mark Fleming Oh  --  I 'm sorry to hear her aunt is dead . Mary . Mary She never had any aunt that I know of . Mark . Mark Fleming That pains me still more .

Reaching up and speaking in his ear Did you ever see your own shadow ? Ha , ha , ha , ha ! Going , looks back Ha , ha , ha , ha ! Mark exchanges winks and nods with her . She sings and goes off through gate C. Mark . Mark Fleming Sly dog , Ned is . During my three-months tour abroad he has given me every possible detail about their new home  --  and how they all moved into it  --  and not one word about this little dovecot under the eaves , and its occupant . And yet he has sworn to me , by all that is sacred in friendship , he hopes I shall become his brother-in-law . By jove ! I have an interest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like . " Edward  --  Magdalen .

Impudence befriend me . His hand on gate , looks off Who 's this ? A gentleman  --  eh  --  oh  --  it 's Whyte Browne . Now how did that mild idiot get so far away from London as this ? Perhaps he 's a rival of Chilcote  --  in the affections of fair Rosamond . Ha , ha , ha ! Enter Whyte Browne , L.1.E . Browne . Mr. Whyte Browne Stopping , L. , and looking at Mark through his glasses Ah  --  Fleming . Mark . Mark Fleming Ah  --  Browne . Browne . Mr. Whyte Browne Returned from the Continent ? Mark .

Did he stray so far from London as this ? Browne . Mr. Whyte Browne You have n't heard of my good luck ? Dead uncle . Three intervening heirs . Railroad smashup  --  quick consumption  --  typhoid fever . Special providence , you know . Mark . Mark Fleming If Providence keeps on at this rate , the next heir has a remarkably good chance . Browne . Mr. Whyte Browne Do you see those old ruins over yonder ? Mark . Mark Fleming Yes  --  the remains of a Norman castle apparently  --  perched on a precipice , and frowning on the peaceful country it once commanded ; I was admiring the old castle as I came along . Browne . Mr. Whyte Browne That 's my property . Mark . Mark Fleming Ah . I dare say you have plenty of tenants . I hope the bats pay their rent promptly . Browne . Mr. Whyte Browne Oh  --  I 've got lots of other tenants , you know . That precipice is two hundred feet high . The precipice is my property , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this little nook and the Chilcote Hall estate . Mark .

Mr. Whyte Browne I 'm going to get married , too . Mark . Mark Fleming That 's another sort of a breeze . Browne . Mr. Whyte Browne You used to know Miss Kate Chilcote . Mark . Mark Fleming Quickly Yes  --  why ? What about Miss Kate Chilcote . Browne . Mr. Whyte Browne Nothing in particular . She 's the woman I 'm going to marry . Mark . Mark Fleming The devil you are ! He walks down under excitement . Then upstage , and down again . Browne watches him through his glasses ; then turns and looks at the ruins Browne . Mr. Whyte Browne My uncle once told me those were the best preserved ruins of their size , in England . Mark . Mark Fleming You are going to marry Kate Chilcote ? Browne . Mr. Whyte Browne Y-e-s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him as before , then turns up My uncle said they were first-class ruins , considering their age ; and property like that improves with time , you know . They will be particularly valuable to my great-grandchildren . Mark . Mark Fleming Kate Chilcote has accepted you as her husband ? Browne . Mr. Whyte Browne Y-e-s . Movement as before That is  --  the old ruins  --  I mean  --  the old lady  --  Kate 's mother  --  she and I arranged it between us . I have n't mentioned the subject to the girl , herself . I never met her but twice . She was talking to another fellow both times ; and I went off to play billiards . Mark . Mark Fleming Miss Chilcote herself has had nothing to say upon the subject ? Browne . Mr. Whyte Browne N-o . The old ruins  --  the  --  the old lady  --  fixed it up with me , you know  --  and so I let her fix it up with her , too . Turns This is the best view we can get of those ruins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Chilcote ? Browne . Mr. Whyte Browne N-o . But I have n't the slightest objection to her , you know . Turns There 's a story to go with those ruins . It belongs to the property . Mark . Mark Fleming I will be frank with you . I am interested in Miss Kate Chilcote  --  and I have every reason to believe that she returns my affection . Browne . Mr. Whyte Browne Oh ! Mark . Mark Fleming Approaching him , and speaking sternly I tell you this ; I will not stand quietly by , and see her heart and mine sacrificed  --  for the sake of your " property " and her mother 's ambition . Browne . Mr. Whyte Browne That 's all right , old boy . I 'm in no hurry to get married . There 's plenty other old ladies in the world . Mark bursts into a fit of laughter , reels across R. and supports him sell against a tree Mark . Mark Fleming Ha , ha , ha , ha ! Here 's a rival worthy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Browne . Mr. Whyte Browne You talk with the old ruins  --  I mean  --  the old lady . I 'll not stand in the way ; only if she insists on having me for a son-in-law , of course , I 'll marry the girl . Mark . Mark Fleming Ha , ha , ha , ha ! All right , Browne  --  ha , ha , ha ! I 'll talk with the old lady , ha , ha , ha ! Browne . Mr. Whyte Browne My uncle told me a pair of lovers once fell down the precipice from those ruins . Some of the stones gave way . They were both killed . The property was badly damaged . Mark . Mark Fleming Helloa  --  there 's Ned Chilcote , now . Look at him , his eyes fixed upon the ground  --  his hands thrust deep into his pockets  --  a perfect stranger would know he was in love . Browne . Mr. Whyte Browne Y-e-s . He wants to marry the lady that lives here in Ivers Dean  --  Miss Magdalen Dorme . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her  --  she has n't got any mother . Mark . Mark Fleming He 'll run against a tree directly . There , he 's nearly knocked down a young oak . Enter Captain Edward Chilcote , R. , rubbing his forehead and straightening out his hat Ned , old fellow ! Ed . Captain Edward Chilcote Eh ? Oh  --  Fleming ! Mark . Mark Fleming Taking his hand The oak had the best of it , old boy ! Ha , ha , ha ! What 's all this about ? Dreaming ? Ed . Captain Edward Chilcote Oh  --  nothing  --  I  --  I was thinking . I 'm delighted to see you returned , Mark . Ah  --  Browne  --  you will find the ladies back there  --  they are coming this way . Browne . Mr. Whyte Browne Y-e-s . Going Fleming  --  talk it over with the old lady . Do n't mind me . Mark . Mark Fleming Oh , I sha n't . Exit Browne , R. Well , Ned  --  your groom and dogcart met me at the station ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Your man gave me simple directions for finding the short cut across the fields . I found several ; but unfortunately none of them took me anywhere in particular . In despair I turned off at right angles and suddenly found myself close to this  --  what shall I call it  --  this charming bower . Ed . Captain Edward Chilcote Heigh-ho  --  It is indeed a lovely spot . Mark . Mark Fleming Heigh-ho  --  Imitating his sentimental air It is indeed ! Ha , ha , ha , ha ! Ned , I 've found you out . I 've discovered your fair Rosamond . But as there 's no jealous Queen Eleanor in the case , why so much mystery ? Ha ha , ha ! " Edward-Magdalen "  --  on the old beech yonder  --  Ha , ha , ha , ha ! A bed of violets . " L-o-v-e ! " Ha , ha , ha , ha ! The maid assured me that you are as familiar an apparition here as a man 's own shadow . Come  --  that 's all I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself . Trouble in the way ? The governor objects ? Ed . Captain Edward Chilcote The governor never objects to anything . Mark . Mark Fleming Mamma , perhaps ? Ed . Captain Edward Chilcote You know my mother 's weakness  --  family . Mark . Mark Fleming Ah  --  I see . The maid said the young lady had n't any aunt . And Browne just told me she had n't any mother . Ed . Captain Edward Chilcote She is an orphan . Mark . Mark Fleming No father , either . That 's a bad beginning for a family , certainly . She is equally deficient I dare say , in the more remote branches of the ancestral tree . What does that matter to you ? If a beautiful woman is ready and willing to do her fair share in providing a man with a posterity , he need n't trouble himself about her ancestry . Ed . Captain Edward Chilcote My mother is forever telling me that I must make what she is pleased to call a " good match . " Mark . Mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consign you to the infernal regions of a loveless marriage . Ed . Captain Edward Chilcote My father would as soon have a fresh attack of the gout as cross her wishes . He says he prefers it , indeed . Mark . Mark Fleming Precisely . The gout can be cured . Ed . Captain Edward Chilcote Who are we  --  the Chilcotes ? Wool  --  trade  --  success  --  money ! My father once swept a warehouse . I admire him for his energy . We are rich now . But who are we , that I should suffer the horrors of aristocratic affectation ? Common people have , at least , one privilege  --  marrying for love . Throw that privilege away  --  what do we receive in return ? Smiles of contempt from those above us  --  and from those beneath us  --  alike ! Chilcote Hall ! It 's name was " Chucksters " before we bought it , three months ago . Mother rechristened it . Bah ! If she must feed her ambition , let her do it on something besides my heart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ned ! I dare say your mother is right after all . A man in love is not a judge of these things ; she stands between you and your love , for your own good . Your mother is a wise woman , Ned ; she is a wise woman . Here they come . Aside , looking out That young jackanapes , with his new property , is talking with the old lady . If she stands between me and my love  --  the infernal old female idiot !  --  I 'll make her my mother-in-law , in spite of her ! Crosses and pats Ned on the shoulder Listen to your mother , Ned ; she 's a wise woman . He walks up , Edward drops into a seat . Enter Mrs. Chilcote and Browne , R. She is talking with Browne and does not see Mark Mrs. C. Mrs. Chilcote Ha , ha , ha ! Ah , Mr. Browne ! Ha , ha , ha ! If you are as entertaining to the young girls as you are to their mothers  --  I wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fund of native wit . Browne . Mr. Whyte Browne Y-e-s . It came with the property , I suppose . Mark . Mark Fleming Aside Special providence ! Like the typhoid fever . Mrs. C. Mrs. Chilcote I 'm sure you and my darling Kate will be very happy together . Browne . Mr. Whyte Browne Y-e-s  --  of course . But you must tend to all that sort o'thing . I 've got to look after the property , you know . Mark . Mark Fleming Coming down A-h-e-m . Mrs. C. Mrs. Chilcote Turning Ah  --  Draws up coldly , they bow I am glad you have returned to England . Mark . Mark Fleming Thank you . Aside What an outrageous fib . Mrs. C. Mrs. Chilcote Aside Why did Edward ask him to visit us , just at this time ! Browne . Mr. Whyte Browne Moving to C. , between them Oh  --  by the way  --  Mrs. Chilcote ; Mr. Fleming said he wanted to speak to you  --  Fleming springs to him and pulls his coat Eh ? H 'm ? He wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H 'm ? Mark . Mark Fleming Apart Leave that to me  --  damn it ! I 'll speak to her when I think best . Browne . Mr. Whyte Browne Apart All right , old boy . To Mrs. Chilcote Anything Mr. Fleming says to you  --  why  --  do n't mind me , you know . Walks up . Looks at ruins Mrs. C. Mrs. Chilcote Walking down R. What can the man mean by that ? Enter Mr. Chilcote , followed by Kate , R. Mr. C. Mr. David Chilcote Ah  --  my dear  --  you and Mr. Browne hurried on ahead . Mr. Fleming ! Mark . Mark Fleming Mr. Chilcote , Miss Kate . Kate . Kate Mr. Fleming . Moving toward him Mrs. C. Mrs. Chilcote Sharply Kate . Kate stops , bows to Fleming , who returns it , and then walks to her mother Mr. C. Mr. David Chilcote I hope you enjoyed yourself on the Continent , Mr. Fleming . Mark . Mark Fleming As much as I possibly could  --  under the circumstances . Mr. C. Mr. David Chilcote Circumstances ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I see . My dear boy  --  you must never allow circumstances to trouble you . I never do . Ed . Captain Edward Chilcote Aside No , hang it ! He never does . I wish he did . Mr. C. Mr. David Chilcote There are so many circumstances in this world . We ca n't dodge them , you know ; and we might as well make the best of them . Weather is a circumstance . Loss of property is a circumstance . A mother is a circumstance . A wife is a circumstance . I never allow circumstances to make me uncomfortable . Mark . Mark Fleming Heigh-ho  --  a very delightful philosophy . Mr. C. Mr. David Chilcote The great secret of happiness is never to allow oneself to be unhappy . Mark . Mark Fleming Prima facie , an excellent theory . I trust it works in practice ? Mr. C. Mr. David Chilcote Perfectly . Thirty years ' experience . Try it . Ah  --  Browne . Walks up ; Browne has been standing with his back to the audience and looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Chilcote ? Mr. C. Mr. David Chilcote Never better , never better . Ed . Captain Edward Chilcote Aside The governor never is better ; always at his best . Mr. C. Mr. David Chilcote Looking off How are the ruins today ? Browne . Mr. Whyte Browne Never better , thank you . Mr. C. Mr. David Chilcote Still there , I see . Browne . Mr. Whyte Browne Y-e-s . That 's what I like about ruins . You can always depend on them . Mrs. C. Mrs. Chilcote Suddenly Kate ! Kate has been talking , L.C. , with Mark . She moves to her mother Mark . Mark Fleming Aside Hang the old female ruins  --  as Browne calls her . She 'll be my mother-in-law yet ! Aloud Charming spot  --  Ivers Dean . It belongs to your estate , I suppose Mr. Chilcote ? Mrs. C. Mrs. Chilcote It ought to but it does n't  --  heigh-ho . Mark . Mark Fleming Somebody bought it over his head , I presume . Mrs. C. Mrs. Chilcote Quite the contrary . It was cut from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it any use , my dear , referring to the past ! That was only a circumstance , my love  --  only a circumstance . Mrs. C. Mrs. Chilcote Circumstance , indeed ! Ivers Dean belonged to Miss Chilcote , my husband 's only sister . Of course she ought to have left it to us . But she was an eccentric creature ; she bequeathed it , with a few hundreds a year , to a girl whom her ridiculous philanthropy had rescued from a depth of infamy . Ed . Captain Edward Chilcote Springing to his feet Mother ! You have no right to say that . Mrs. C. Mrs. Chilcote Edward ! Mr. C. Mr. David Chilcote The Fifth Commandment , my dear boy , the Fifth Commandment . Mrs. C. Mrs. Chilcote From a depth of infamy , I repeat . Ed . Captain Edward Chilcote And I repeat , you have no right to say that . Mrs. C. Mrs. Chilcote Oh ! Oh ! Heigh-ho  --  to be spoken to like this by one 's own son ! Handkerchief to eyes Mr. C. Mr. David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than being spoken to like this by anybody else 's son . Indulge in a little lively repartee , it will do you good . Say something strong . Mrs. C. Mrs. Chilcote David  --  you are silly . Mr. C. Mr. David Chilcote By all means , my dear . Say it again . Mrs. C. Mrs. Chilcote You are simply ridiculous . Mr. C. Mr. David Chilcote Go on , my love . It does you good and it does n't do me any harm . Mrs. C. Mrs. Chilcote You are too absurd to notice . Mr. C. Mr. David Chilcote I never allow circumstances to disturb my serenity . Mrs. C. Mrs. Chilcote Spitefully Oh !  --  Mr. C. Mr. David Chilcote This is a circumstance . Mrs. C. Mrs. Chilcote Angrily Mr. Fleming ! Mark . Mark Fleming Starting from Kate 's side I beg your pardon . Mrs. C. Mrs. Chilcote I was telling you that Ivers Dean ought to belong to us . That it was bequeathed away from us by the abominable artifices of a designing young woman , a female Jesuit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dorme , we were just talking about you . How are you , my dear ? You look rather pale . Mag . Magdalen Dorme Coming through gate Thanks , Mrs. Chilcote , I am quite well . Crosses to Kate Kate . Kate Kissing her Dear Magdalen , I have n't seen you for two whole days . Mag . Magdalen Dorme I have missed you so much . Mrs. C. Mrs. Chilcote Aside Thinks to creep into my affections through my child . Viper ! Mr. C. Mr. David Chilcote Magdalen , my love , our friend , Mr. Fleming . Mark . Mark Fleming I was very nearly trespassing on your grounds , Miss Dorme . Indeed I almost mistook Ivers Dean at first for Chilcote Hall . Mrs. C. Mrs. Chilcote Aside The idea ! Mark . Mark Fleming I should have walked straight into your garden , but a wretched tramp stopped me with the usual tale of woe . Mag . Magdalen Dorme Quietly A tramp ? Mark . Mark Fleming If nothing worse . The man reminded me strongly of that which a barrister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Verdict of manslaughter . Penal servitude for twenty years . There is a strong family likeness among villains . The tramp reminds me of the clever rascal . Mag . Magdalen Dorme Indeed ! I saw him , as he hobbled up to the back door ; I should judge , however , that he was merely an ordinary beggar . Heigh-ho  --  it is a dreadful thing to beg . I know it , myself , by experience .

Could he have spoken to me as he has spoken if he knew the history of the woman to whom he blindly offers his devotion ? Would he not rather hate me if I told him all ? No , his nature is too noble . Had I the choice into what ranks of society I should be born ? If I have been an outcast and a vagabond , does not the verdict of infinite justice acquit me of all guilt ?

But she was troubled with that inconvenient thing which the preachers call a " conscience . " It was always a mystery to me where she picked up such a clean conscience in the filthy streets of London . Hang the girl ! I was in love with her . But she put on airs , as if she had as good a right to be virtuous as a duchess with fifty thousand a year . I 'm in love with her yet !

He seemed determined not to enjoy anything . He said the cathedral at Cologne was a humbug  --  a humbug , my dear ! The cathedral at Cologne !  --  a humbug ! He turned up his nose at Mount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alps ! He shrugged his shoulders at the Coliseum in Rome !

His mother wanted to go to Egypt and see the Pyramids  --  the family tombs of the Pharaohs  --  as she called ' em . Edward said he did n't care for old families , anyway .

Paul Daly Aside Cool as ever . She 'll gel the start of me , yet . Mag . Magdalen Dorme You promised to leave England forever . You have broken faith with me . But let your mind rest easy upon that subject . I am not in the least disappointed . I expected it . You are a thief , a burglar , and a murderer . Of course  --  you are a liar , also . Paul springs up angrily , Magdalen retains her seat and motions to him quietly Be seated , Mr. Daly . Paul resumes his seat Paul . Paul Daly Aside Magnificent courage that woman has ! How I love her for it ! I 'll stake everything  --  but I shall win her ! Mag . Magdalen Dorme You arrived at Chilcote Hall yesterday evening , in answer to a telegram from Mrs. Chilcote ? Paul . Paul Daly After a quick glance Go on . Mag . Magdalen Dorme Mrs. Chilcote found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her that you had documents in your possession going to prove that Ivers Dean came into my possession by a forged will . Paul . Paul Daly Aside She has seen the letter already . Aloud Proceed . Mag . Magdalen Dorme You have been working this case up for the past six months . You knew that the witnesses to the will were both dead . The hundred pounds I sent you enabled you to accomplish some new and profitable villainy . You then hired some keen , but disreputable , attorney to work up a case for you . Paul . Paul Daly You 've been wandering about in the form of a spirit , Maggie  --  looking over my shoulder . Mag . Magdalen Dorme It puzzles me  --  somewhat  --  why you should attempt to deprive me of that very property , without which I can be of no use to you . Paul . Paul Daly Earnestly You can not guess the reason , Magdalen Dorme ? Mag . Magdalen Dorme Yes ; you love me . He starts to his feet , clasping his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Be seated , Mr. Daly . You are interrupting me . He resumes his seat I can not even pity the unrequited love which seeks to ruin and degrade its object . When we met again , Paul Daly , six months ago , I was your friend . I am now your enemy . I shall be , however , an open-handed enemy . I shall denounce Mr. Pierre Frederic Delevaine to the police as Paul Daly , the escaped convict , as soon as I possibly can , after you leave this house . You will consult your own interests by leaving the vicinity of Ivers Dean and Chilcote Hall as rapidly as possible . Paul . Paul Daly I admire your pluck , Maggie . Not one woman in fifty thousand , in a lonely house like this , and all her servants gone , would dare say such a thing as that to a desperate man like me . I admire your keen wit , too . You have traced this little conspiracy of mine as accurately as if you were an entire corps of detectives and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once . Pierre Frederic Delevaine is not Paul Daly . Paul Daly is dead . Mag . Magdalen Dorme Dead ? Paul . Paul Daly Dead and buried . I attended his funeral . I read an obituary notice of him , in the police reports . It was not very complimentary ! But I dropped a friendly tear on the poor fellow 's bier . Following the name of the escaped convict Paul Daly , in the prison records , there is inserted this memorandum  --  " Killed in a brawl at the Three Ships Tavern , White Chapel . " I had the curiosity to read the entry myself . There is so much red tape in these official matters , it will take more than the assertion of one young lady  --  herself accused of forgery  --  to establish an identity between a living gentleman , with plenty of money , and a dead convict . You have been , frank with me . I am frank with you . Mag . Magdalen Dorme Have you anything further to say , sir ? Paul . Paul Daly Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this matter of a forged will is to separate you from Mr. Edward Chilcote  --  and to bring you , so far as possible , as you have yourself suggested , within my own power . Mag . Magdalen Dorme Yes . Calmly Paul . Paul Daly As to the Ivers Dean estate , there is a tolerably good chance , with the evidence I have secured  --  Mag . Magdalen Dorme By bribery . Paul . Paul Daly Of course  --  how otherwise ?  --  a tolerably good chance of depriving you of the estate . But that will depend on my continuance in the scheme . There is a certainty , I think of securing the other object . However strong evidence it may require in a court of law to prove an honest will a forgery , enough suspicion can be thrown on it to prevent a marriage between the woman accused of such a crime and the son of the heir-at-law . Mag . Magdalen Dorme Proceed . Paul . Paul Daly I come here this afternoon  --  to make a compromise . The terms I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Magdalen starts , shrinking I think I will make you a good husband , Magdalen . We will live here quietly together in Ivers Dean ; you will find me the most domestic husband in the world . I have seen enough of " life , " as people call it . I am anxious to settle down  --  a dressing gown , slippers , and a loving wife . We will raise a family and become eminently respectable  --  Who knows ?  --  some future Delevaine may yet become a peer of the realm . Consider the subject , Magdalen . Weigh it carefully in your mind . And remember  --  do n't confuse Pierre Frederic Delevaine with a man you once knew named Paul Daly . Paul Daly is dead . Mag . Magdalen Dorme Rising Paul Daly shall rise from the tomb ! Paul starts to his feet and looks at her fiercely , but half shrinking Trick the officers of justice as you may  --  his death  --  the funeral  --  the record  --  they shall all be nothing . Paul Daly shall have his resurrection in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the walls of Dartmoor prison . Paul . Paul Daly Fiercely Magdalen Dorme !  --  He rushes to her and seizes her by the wrists If Paul Daly rises from his tomb  --  remember this  --  Hissing in her ear He was a murderer ! Beware of him ! She looks him full in the eye Mag . Magdalen Dorme I am alone in the house . There is no one else within hearing . Do your worst , Paul Daly ! She looks steadily at him . He releases her wrists , and shrinks from her gaze , moving down L.C. Coward ! He turns toward her savagely Coward as well as villain ! Paul . Paul Daly Aside . Turning away L. The spirit of a lioness ! Mag . Magdalen Dorme Bursting into a laugh Ha , ha , ha , ha !  --  I flattered myself I was playing the leading female rle in a tragedy . I am only the heroine of a farce . Ha , ha , ha , ha , ha !  --  Walking R. Paul . Paul Daly She is laughing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ha , ha ! I will see if my maid has returned . I shall tell her to call a police officer . In the meantime  --  play out your own character in the farce . Jump out of the window , while I am away . Ha , ha , ha , ha !  --  Crosses L. He crosses R. front . She stops at door and looks back at him Ha , ha , ha , ha !  --  Exits L.2.E . Paul . Paul Daly She has almost persuaded me that I am Paul Daly . If I am  --  the sooner I disappear from this , the better . She is right . This is a farce . It may yet become a tragedy . In the meantime , however , I will follow her advice . He goes up to window , throws open the sash and starts back ; moves down Edward Chilcote ! Coming this way . The farce is becoming more and more comical . He opens the door , R. Starts as he looks in Her bedroom ! Ha , ha , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room , closing the door Mag . Magdalen Dorme Without , as she opens door If there is no policeman at hand , Mary  --  the errand boy at the inn will do . It is not a serious case . Ha , ha , ha , ha ! She enters laughing ; looks around He has adopted my suggestion . " Reenter heroine . " Ha , ha , ha !  --  Then seriously This farce will have another act . What scene will the curtain next rise on ? Looks at clock Nearly half past three . Edward ! She feels of her hair I must rearrange my toilet . She moves to door , R. , and has her hand upon the knob . The door is partly open . She stops and listens as if to a sound from the window Footsteps ! Edward appears suddenly at window , with an eager manner , looking in Ed . Captain Edward Chilcote Magdalen ! Magdalen turns ; her hand still on knob and leaning back against the door , as if supporting herself , and looking up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edward ! He steps in eagerly ; stops and points at the clock Ed . Captain Edward Chilcote Six months to the moment , Magdalen ! I have obeyed you . He extends both arms . She runs up to him joyously . He embraces her My own dear Magdalen ! It has been an age of misery to me . The door of Magdalen 's room opens and Paul appears Paul . Paul Daly Maggie , my darling , I  --  He shrinks back R. , as if surprised and confused . Edward steps L.C. , thunderstruck . Magdalen glances at Paul ; then drops her head , standing C. Tableau ACT III . Scene : The ruins of an old castle . At back of stage is a wide archway in a very crumbling condition . At the left upper corner is an old tower , extending beyond wing . A door opens from tower above , leading by a step down to a platform on a level with top of the arch . This platform is formed by an angle in the masonry . A crumbling parapet runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone lying upon it . The platform may be supported by a buttress extending toward front . On the right of the archway is seen a distant view , showing that the ruins stand on a high precipice , overlooking the surrounding country . It will enhance the effect , where this can be done , to have Ivers Dean seen nestling among the trees in the central distance , showing the same architectural forms as seen in Act I. A larger building on the left is Chilcote Hall . Discovered : Magdalen on the platform , leaning idly against the tower and looking off , an open book in her hand hanging at her side . Music as curtain rises , and continuing a moment . Enter Whyte Browne , accompanied by a Gamekeeper , R.1.E . When Browne speaks , Magdalen looks around , then sits reading the book . Browne . Mr. Whyte Browne The lunch is all ready , in the shooting box , Robert ? Game . Robert It 'll be all ready , sir , before the party arrives . Browne . Mr. Whyte Browne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes , now . You 're ready to feed the pheasants for us ? Game . Robert All ready , sir . There has n't been a more likely lot of young pheasants on the property for many a long year . Walks R. Your uncle could n't hunt much during the last few years of his life  --  he had the gout ; so there ai n't a many foxes . Browne . Mr. Whyte Browne Y-e-s . The gout is bad for hunting . But I dare say Uncle John could hunt quite as well with the gout as I can without . Game . Robert Better , Master Whyte . Ha , ha , ha ! Better , sir . Ha , ha , ha ! I do n't want to say anything disrespectful , Master Whyte , but if your Uncle John had had both arms in a sling and his two feet done up in cotton  --  he  --  he would n't have missed that rabbit that you let go the other day  --  the one that ran between your legs , you know . Ha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Y-e-s . But I was looking at the dog , you know . He looked so funny , standing there with his nose sticking straight out before him . Game . Robert Asid e Ha , ha , ha , ha ! I wonder if he expected the dog 's nose to be sticking out behind him . Ha , ha , ha , ha ! Browne . Mr. Whyte Browne And his tail stuck straight out in the opposite direction . Game . Robert Ha , ha , ha , ha ! Did you expect his nose and his tail to point in the same direction , Master Whyte ? Ha , ha , ha , ha ! Browne . Mr. Whyte Browne N-o ; but that was one thing that confused me . You told me the dog was a pointer , but you did n't tell me which end he pointed with . Game . Robert Ha , ha , ha , ha ! Browne . Mr. Whyte Browne Seeing Magdalen Ah  --  Miss Dorme . Mag . Magdalen Dorme Mr. Browne . Browne . Mr. Whyte Browne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Miss Dorme . Mag . Magdalen Dorme Thank you . I have been a frequent trespasser , as your keeper will testify , during the past few months . He and I have become quite familiar friends . I have even dropped in at the shooting box , now and then ; but this is my favorite spot . I am under obligation to you for many a pleasant afternoon , here by myself . Some of my time would have hung wearily enough without your charming ruins , Mr. Browne . Browne . Mr. Whyte Browne The obligation is on my side . You 're an ornament to the property , you know . The old ruins look so nice with a young woman on them . Such a contrast , you know . Mag . Magdalen Dorme Thank you , Mr. Browne . Browne . Mr. Whyte Browne But how did you manage to get up there ? I tried to climb up once but I fell back and tore my clothes . You could n't have crossed on the old arch ? Mag . Magdalen Dorme Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , to sustain its own weight . You have not discovered it , yet ? There is a winding stairway in this old lower . Browne . Mr. Whyte Browne Yes , I dare say , but  --  Mag . Magdalen Dorme I have discovered its entrance  --  among a heap of dbris . It is overgrown with briars  --  down among the rocks yonder , only a few steps . Browne . Mr. Whyte Browne Oh  --  I remember , now . Edward Chilcote told me that you and he found an entrance to the tower , wandering around here all by yourselves , you know , nearly a year ago  --  before he went to the Continent . Mag . Magdalen Dorme Rising I will come down to you . Browne . Mr. Whyte Browne I wo n't trouble you to do that . I 'll find the way . Mag . Magdalen Dorme I will come down . Exits into tower Browne . Mr. Whyte Browne Coming downstage Rather odd ! The old stairway is on my property . I must put it in the inventory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentleman  --  that has been spending so much time about the property ? Game . Robert Yes , your honor , he was up at the box this morning , before seven o'clock . I do n't know where he sleeps , but he gets up very early in the morning for a gentleman  --  though he does n't seem to have anything in particular to do after he gets up . Browne . Mr. Whyte Browne Encourage him , Robert . I 'm anxious to get a look at him , myself . Encourage him to remain on the property . Game . Robert I will , sir . He plays me a good game of cards , and is a rather jolly companion . I 'll encourage him , sir . I 'll look after the lunch , your honor . Exits L. Browne . Mr. Whyte Browne I wonder if it is that military-looking fellow , that appeared so mysteriously at Chilcote Hall on the night of our return , and disappeared as suddenly next day . Enter Magdalen , L.U.E. Mag . Magdalen Dorme Mr. Browne . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whyte Browne I wanted to speak to you , Miss Magdalen , about two things  --  though I 'm not quite certain the two things are n't one thing , you know . Mr. Edward Chilcote and that military-looking chap  --  Mag . Magdalen Dorme Mr. Edward Chilcote and Captain Delevaine ! One thing , Mr. Browne ? Browne . Mr. Whyte Browne Why , no  --  not exactly one thing  --  only somehow they seem to have something to do with each other ; and you  --  Mag . Magdalen Dorme I ? How do either of those  --  gentlemen  --  interest me , Mr. Browne ? Browne . Mr. Whyte Browne Not at all  --  not in the least . Only this Captain Delevaine , as he calls himself  --  I think he 's  --  on the property . Mag . Magdalen Dorme Interested On  --  on the  --  property ? Browne . Mr. Whyte Browne Y-e-s . So I judge from what my gamekeeper says about a new visitor to the shooting box . Mag . Magdalen Dorme Aside I was certain he was not far from Ivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he has an object to gain . Paul Daly will risk much , rather than fail in that object . Browne . Mr. Whyte Browne What I particularly wanted to speak to you about was the other thing  --  Mr. Edward Chilcote ? Mag . Magdalen Dorme Well ? Browne . Mr. Whyte Browne He 's been in such an awful state since the day after we returned home about two weeks ago . He said he might come up here with me today , but I begged him not to  --  I was afraid he would toss himself over the precipice , or something . Kate told me that you would n't see him . He 's been threatening to shoot Captain Delevaine if he ever crossed his path again , and he 's raving because he ca n't see you , and the old ruins  --  his respected mother , I mean  --  she helps on the row . She always helps on a row . I 'm going to accept the old lady 's urgent invitation to find quarters somewhere else , if this sort o ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house is old Mr. Chilcote . He says it 's nothing but a circumstance , anyway . Everybody else is so deuced uncomfortable  --  I thought , perhaps  --  you know  --  I  --  I fixed things up with Mr. Fleming and Miss Kate  --  I thought I might fix things up with Mr. Edward and you , you know . Mag . Magdalen Dorme My dear Mr. Browne , I know you wish to act as a friend ; but you will forgive me  --  Putting her hand in his if I ask you never to refer to the subject again ? Browne . Mr. Whyte Browne Certainly . It 's not my affair , at all . I 'm not engaged to you or Edward as I was to Kate , you know . Here comes the party . Mag . Magdalen Dorme The party ? Browne . Mr. Whyte Browne They 're going to look at the property . Enter Kate , followed by Mark , L. Kate runs up to Magdalen and kisses her . Mark and Browne talk , up R. Kate . Kate Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You wicked , wicked thing ! To keep us all out of the house . I ca n't imagine what could have happened , but poor Edward has been frantic . You 've been a naughty , cruel girl . But I 've caught you now  --  and I 'm going to keep you awhile . Kisses her , puts her arm about her waist and they walk up L. Mark . Mark Fleming To Browne , up R. Your gamekeeper describes him as a  --  Browne . Mr. Whyte Browne The exact description of the fellow that arrived from London the day after we got home . He had a long talk with our future mother-in-law . Mark . Mark Fleming Moving down Miss Dorme . Kate . Kate With Magdalen , up L. You ca n't have her . I 've got too much to say to her .

Kate Business ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " business " with me . I shall flirt with you , Whytie , dear . Joining Browne , up R.C. Browne . Mr. Whyte Browne Y-e-s . We 'll have one of our desperate flirtations . Mark . Mark Fleming To Magdalen I have reason to believe that the object of our search is in this vicinity . Mag . Magdalen Dorme So I understand . Mark . Mark Fleming I called at Ivers Dean on the way from the station , this morning . Mary said you were up here ; I hoped to meet you . I have fully succeeded , at last , in arousing the interest of the authorities . The officers at Dartmoor already had been suspicious that Paul Daly was not dead  --  in spite of the funeral and the record . A detective came from London with me today . He is now at the Duke 's Head Inn  --  disguised as a clergyman . Mag . Magdalen Dorme Bad as Paul Daly is , I dread sending him back to the horrors of a living tomb . Mark . Mark Fleming This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed it in my hands . I have no womanly compunctions . Moving R. Mrs. C. Mrs. Chilcote Without , L. , calling Will you come , Mr. Chilcote ?

Now , there 'll be a row on the property . Mark . Mark Fleming R. Browne , my boy . Browne moves down to him R. Kate joins Magdalen up R.C. They walk off together , up R. Mrs. Chilcote stands rigidly L. , looking off . Mark , apart to Browne Will you do me a favor , old fellow ? Taking a card from his pocket Browne . Mr. Whyte Browne Certainly .

Browne . Mr. Whyte Browne The Reverend Mr. Samuel Robertson  --  certainly . Are you and Kate going to be married on the property ? Mark . Mark Fleming Not today . Unfortunately this reverend gentleman has not a license for making people happy  --  rather the other way . Browne crosses L. , stops near Mrs. Chilcote . He raises his hat . She sails by him , up C. , with a slight inclination of the head Browne . Mr. Whyte Browne Old Melrose Abbey will knock down some of the other ruins before she gets through . Fleming , keep an eye on our mother-in-law . Exits L.1.E . Mrs. C. Mrs. Chilcote Suddenly Oh ! oh ! Looks around , upstage , then off R. Kate has gone off with that wretch . Kate ! Calls Mark .

Magdalen Dorme Tearfully True  --  true , Edward ; you were too noble  --  too generous for that . Ed . Captain Edward Chilcote And you ? After the first shock of surprise  --  as that man stood before us  --  I turned to you lovingly . You ordered me from your presence as if I had committed a crime against your honor . Your door has been closed to me since that day . No charge from me . I believe it to have been some scoundrel 's trick . Yet I am banished from your presence without a word . Mag . Magdalen Dorme Do you know what a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . It is something so sensitive , she can not look into the eyes of the man who loves her , if there be anything between them reflecting on her honor  --  that demands an " explanation . " Ed . Captain Edward Chilcote I have asked for none . Mag . Magdalen Dorme No . If you had !  --  I could have looked boldly in your face , and refused to answer you  --  with the air of an empress . But you did not . As you turned your face so lovingly to me , all trust and confidence , at the moment when you might have suspected everything , I thought of that sudden start  --  the flitting expression of doubt  --  I knew the seeds of suspicion had been planted in your heart , in spite of your honest manliness and your deep affection . Answer me truly , Edward ! Since that fatal moment , have you not started from your reveries , to find jealous thoughts  --  suspicions long suppressed  --  struggling for a mastery in your mind ? Have you not fought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when your faithful love has been off its guard ? Is there not something there , which ought not to be there , if the woman you are dreaming of should become your wife ? Ed . Captain Edward Chilcote Magdalen , I  --  With a wave of the hand I  --  Mag . Magdalen Dorme You confess it with a gesture . What " explanation " can a woman like me give which shall kill all the small suspicions that may spring up hereafter ? My woman 's pride tells me there is none . There was too much for you to take on trust already , Edward . My humble origin  --  my early life  --  my former companions  --  I can never be your wife . Walking up L. Ed . Captain Edward Chilcote Magdalen ! Approaching her . She turns with a gesture , checking him Mag . Magdalen Dorme I will be just to you , Edward . Within a few days , perhaps  --  weeks at the utmost  --  I will tell you all about the man who has thrust himself between us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend  --  and I will speak frankly with you . A woman can " explain " such things to a " friend " but not to her future husband . She approaches him , extending her hand Come to me as a friend , Edward  --  the door of Ivers Dean will not be closed to you . Ed . Captain Edward Chilcote Sighs , reluctantly taking her hand As a friend . She drops his hand and walks up L. Magdalen . She pauses and looks back Hall . Mag . Magdalen Dorme Thank you , Edward . I do prefer to remain here . Ivers Dean has lost its attractions for me . Exits L.4.E . Ed . Captain Edward Chilcote Moving up and looking after her Seeking the old hidden stairway that she and I discovered during our rambles here last summer . Ah , those happy hours !

Captain Edward Chilcote Pardon me , sir . Though we have met before , at Ivers Dean , and I saw you once at Chilcote Hall , I have never had the honor of an introduction . But I wish to ask you a question . Paul . Paul Daly Certainly , by all means , I delight in answering questions . Aside It gives one such a fine opportunity to lie . Aloud You are curious to know , perhaps , how I happen to be here . I am immensely fond of field sports  --  most military men are . I 've rented a little box down here , with right of shooting . Pheasants just coming in . I 've been so much engaged I have found it quite impossible to pay my respects at Chilcote Hall again . I have just been making my apologies to your respected mother . Magdalen issues from the tower above , stepping down to the platform . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ed . Captain Edward Chilcote The question I wished to ask is this : Can you give me any valid reason why I should not seize you by the throat and hurl you over that precipice ? Paul glances at him in surprise Paul . Paul Daly Several . I prefer the long way round . Ed . Captain Edward Chilcote That reason does not interest me . Paul . Paul Daly You would be hung . That does interest you . Ed . Captain Edward Chilcote I have less objection to being hung , perhaps , than you imagine . I am willing to defy the laws and take the risk , though I will do so in another direction . I am a captain in Her Majesty 's service ; you are a scoundrel . For the chance of taking your life , however , I will waive all distinctions of etiquette . You have a military air , though hardly the air of a gentleman . I will assume that you are my equal . Hands him a card Paul . Paul Daly Thank you . You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! And I am doing myself a disgrace . I am fully aware of the fact . You , I imagine , are a desperate man . So am I  --  for the time being . The laws are fitted to our case , precisely . The survivor runs a fair chance of following his unsuccessful opponent to the next world . Let me hear from you . Edward is walking L. Sees Magdalen ; starts ; glances back at Paul and goes out L. Paul . Paul Daly I 'll be in luck  --  as things look  --  if he does n't " hear of me " through the police reports . Curse that woman ! She has set the detectives on me  --  in the teeth of all my threats . She knows I am near Ivers Dean , too , and could murder her , in that lonely spot , at any hour of the night . Magnificent courage . She flinches at nothing . Magdalen Dorme , I love you ! Mag . Magdalen Dorme Paul Daly ! He starts , turns , springs forward and looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of escape . I can not bear the thought of consigning a fellow being to the miseries of a convict prison . Fly ! A detective arrived from London this morning . He has learned of your whereabouts  --  he has been sent for  --  he is now , perhaps , within calling distance  --  I will have mercy on you  --  fly ! Paul . Paul Daly Magdalen Dorme ! I ask no mercy . He springs rapidly up the pile of masonry on the right of the arch , and is about to cross . Magdalen screams and motions him back . He hesitates Mag . Magdalen Dorme Oh ! It will not bear your weight  --  you will be hurled over the precipice . He springs across recklessly . A huge stone falls , but the arch remains intact . Paul seizes Magdalen 's wrist fiercely . She shrinks from him , powerless Paul . Paul Daly Magdalen Dorme ! I love you . You rejected , long ago , my impure love  --  I have offered to be your lawful husband . Fraud and threats and trickery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall make you mine in death . The officers of the law shall find us both  --  at the foot of the precipice . A struggle . Magdalen screams . Mark runs in hurriedly , L.2.E . He bounds across , and runs up the masonry on the right of arch . Kate follows Mark and stops R. , looking up . Paul , seeing Mark , releases Magdalen , lifts a huge stone with both hands , and hurls it upon the arch , which breaks , leaving a wide gap . Fleming on one side , Paul on the other , staring at each other . Magdalen crouches half fainting L. Edward emerges from the tower , quietly , and stands just back of Paul , looking at him . Paul turns suddenly as if to seize Magdalen again . Edward seizes him by the throat . Paul draws a knife . A very brief struggle .

You 've got me again  --  have n't you , Jack ?  --  and you attended my funeral , too  --  I saw you there . The Detective quietly walks up , his back to audience . He puts his hand to the pocket in the tail of his coat , draws out a pair of handcuffs , and tosses them up to Paul , who catches them , and continues Thank you . I 'll do the gentlemanly thing . He fastens them on his own wrists You 've always been kind to me , in your way  --  tell them you captured me , Jack . It 'll be a feather in your cap .
