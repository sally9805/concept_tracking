txt On Oct. 2 THE TIMES published the prediction sent from hero that " if the Democratic Party shall be defeated next week , there will have to be an entire reorganization of its central machinery . " Since the defeat in both October and ovem ? her the internecine quarrels of the factions of the Democratic Party have been going on very vigorously but very quietly , The defeat of Senator for the compliment of a renomination to the Senate is notice to the old managers that they must give place to a new set , and that the reorganization must be commenced . This defeat was really greatly unexpected , and has fallen like a bombshell in the Democratic ranks . Col. Gray represents the young and progressive Democracy , who are not afraid of the war issue , and do not believe it treason for a Democrat to have served on the Federal side in the rebellion . It is a revolt against the Bourbons , mixed up with an element of the Voorhees inflation greenback idea . It is unjust to on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Greenbackers as iow as any one could have wanted him to bow , going so far as to write a letter advocating a combination with the fiat party . Today there have been curses long and loud . Some of the oldest Democrats in the Legislature assert that they will not vote for Col. Gray on Tuesday next . As an indication of the determination of the Gray men to smash things in the caucus last night , one Senator nominated Hendricks in the interests of peace and harmony . But the name of that oleaginous statesman , which has always hitherto evoked a groat calmness , was hooted out of the caucus , and he did not receive a single vote . The vote resulted Gray , 32 ; , 19 ; Lowery , 2 . The friends of Senator are very bitter to-day in condemnation of the caucus action . Some of them carry their opposition so far as to declare that they will not vote for Gray in joint convention , NA will cast their votes for , regardless of the caucus dictation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vote of censure on Mr. , and they see no reason why this should be done . They aver that it will ruin Gray 's chances for advancement , because this will so embitter 's friends against him that he will have no chance in the future . It is generally conceded that the large vote for Gray is the result of promises made during the recent canvass , when he was very active . Only five members of the Senate voted for , and the remaining eighteen for Gray , so that more than half of the letter 's votes comes from that body . Gray 's friends are less bitter , but positive that the leadership of the party in this State has changed . They say it indicates a reorganization of the party in the State . 's friends and the old party managers will now combine to kill off Gray for anything he may want in the future . Ho has been used simply as the instrument to break of ? the shackles of the old dynasty , but will ho needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself .
