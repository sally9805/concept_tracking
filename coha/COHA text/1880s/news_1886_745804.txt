txt The statesmen who make river and harbor bills always provide for a wide extension of the field of river and . harbor legislation . Every appropriation carries with it a very much larger appropriation to be expended in coming years . For example . $225,000 for the proposed . Hennepin Canal may bind . the Government to spend $15,000,000 on . that project . Every bill also contains the seed , so to speak , of other bills , in the surveys which the War Department is directed to make . Upon the results of these surveys of streams and so-called harbors that have not been touched . the makers of the bill hope to build up the river and harbor bills of the future . The bill now pending appropriates $100 , - 000 for 141 surveys , and the Secretary of War is required to tell Congress next year whether the brooks and inlets in question are worthy of improvement . In the list are several projeots  --  upon which the department has heretofore made adverse reports , and . in one case the bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This money is to be spent in trying to overcome the unfavorable report concerning the proposed harbor of refuge at Atlantic City . Major HEUER declared , in October , 1884 , that there was " no public necessity " for the proposed . work . In January , 1885 , the Secretary of War sent to Congress reports showing that surveys in 54 cases had . shown that the streams or harbors examined were " not worthy of improvement . " Those reports throw a curious side light upon the manufacture of river and harbor bills . A North Carolina Congressman had caused an appropriation to be made for a survey of Green River , in his State . The report - was made by Capt . HIN'ux of the . engineers . The river had " all the characteristics of a mountain stream , abounding in rock ledges , boulders , gravel bars , falls , ' rapids , pools , &c."; Capt . HINMAN was forced . to make the greater part of Iris examination in a wagon , because there was " not water enough to go by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road . he counted 75 rock ledges crossing the stream , " from 3 inches to 4 feet in height . " From time to time he took a sounding , and the depth was " from a few inches to four feet , depending on location , on ledges , or in pools . " He remarks that the stream " could . be made to afford fine water power . " For a few miles he made his way in a barge drawing six inches of water . The County Commissioner of the adjoining county was on . board . " The trip was a novel one to him , " says Capt . HINMAN . " He has resided . on the river for many years , and has never heard of any one having attempted the trip before . Old . residents were surprised that it could be made . " Congressman VANCE wrote : " I suppose that two and one-half feet of water will be all that is expected . Wing dams in places may be necessary . " Plainly Mr. VANCE knew very little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " I am not sure that I understand fully the object of your inquiries . If the purpose is to ascertain the advantage of the river for manufacturing purposes  --  I mean factory sites  --  I can commend it . From a point south of Hendersonville the river probably falls 1,000 feet within twenty miles . I am told that one of the falls is as much as 75 feet , and there are many smaller ones . Though it is a small mountain stream it has water enough for factories of ordinary size . The suggestion that it would be a suitable stream for navigation purposes is simply laughable , though some kinds of fish are found in. it . " Capt . POST reported that the improvement of the Kankakee River in . Indiana was desired , in. order that about 400,000 acres of marsh might be drained . There was little or no commerce , and the required . expenditure of $550,000 would . probably " be detrimental . to such navigation as there is . " In several cases the improvements would benefit saw log commerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be folly to improve the Osage River by movable dams until the Missouri below should be improved , but Ulf pending bill contains an appropriation of $10,000 for this riVer . The officer-who was directed to examine the Susquehanna between Salt Lick and Buttermilk Falls reported that there was not w.ater enough between these two points " to float an empty skiff . " Concerning the Greenbrier , in Wes ' Virginia , Col. CRAIGITILL ? said : " The rives is not navigable , and the portion of New River below its mouth is also unnavigable . " Notwithstanding ' the tenor of these reports , many of the streams or harbors to which they relate will creep into river and harbor bills after lapse of time shall haw dulled. tholorceof the engineers ' criticism , Appropriations are provided in the pending bill for streams , like the Green River , navigable only for fish , and for small fish at that .
