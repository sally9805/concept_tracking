THESE opening words of one of the most peaceful and beautiful hymns in our language give fitting expression to the thought which enters every mind , I am sure , as we meet to-day for the burial of our revered and honored friend . The long life , with its bright and joyful morning , and its grand and glorious noon-day , and its rich , fruitful afternoon , and its calm , sweet evening , and its brief dream of the night , has come to its end . The faithful and noble soul has , as we tenderly say , fallen asleep . The earthly house has closed its gateway for the resting-time , and its inmate , like the traveler wearied with his journey , sinks into a gentle slumber-his rest guarded safely by the Divine friend whom he loved , and his thoughts and true life moving on into the brighter light beyond . We call it a sleep , because the form which we saw , and by which the heart and mind were revealed to us , seems to be quietly sleeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know who watches over the mortal and immortal part , and keeps all that is committed to him even to the end . But it is a sleep only as we think of it from the earthly side-blessed because the soul which has been in communion with Jesus in the years past is still in communion with him , yet not as if in the visions of the night-season , bright though they may be with an unreal beauty , but with the clear sight of the day-light hours-  --  a living , personal communion with the living friend in his own kingdom . A sleep it is thus , yet not a sleep . A new life rather for the waking soul , rising in its freedom and joy , as it were , out of the gentle slumber into which the kind Father has suffered the tired body to fall . Why should we not rejoice , and say , All is well . The loss to our life and our world , indeed , is a sad one , but the losses NOTE-Dr . Woolsey died at New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funeral services were held on Friday , July 5 , at Battell Chapel . // for this life , we may well bear in mind , are gains for the other , and the other world is the one for the abode of the perfected soul . The sleeping here is for the waking there , and the friend who has trusted the Lord Jesus in the long earthly ccurse knows the sleep at the end as a blessed one  --  a sleep which is a quiet resting on the mortal side , and a restful activity and joy on the immortal side . We stand to-day at the point where the sleeping and the waking seem to meet-at the ending of the life which we have known , and the beginning of that which we do not know . We say our farewell word when we can move forward no longer on his way with the friend whom we have loved , and we leave him thankfully and hopefully with a guardian and helper and comforter more wise and powerful than we are . We say to each other : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace and joy await him ; and we turn backward to our old , familiar life with a new inspiration . But the inspiration comes from the life which is ended . And what do we say of this life , which brings it to us ? When a man of greatness and of goodness dies , there are always two thoughts that enter our minds  --  the thought of what he did , and what he was . As we follow out the two thoughts in their relation to each other , and thus call to our remembrance the whole career , we bring before ourselves the man in his completeness , and assign him his true place of honor in the world . The right adjustment of all things , as they are seen in both of these spheres , gives us the true estimate of the life , and the verdict of history becomes , in this way , the verdict of wisdom and justice . But there is an order of thought here , as there is everywhere and the hour of tender feeling waits for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We speak our sorrowful word of parting first , and our joyful word of benediction , as we see the honored friend of former years pass within the veil , and then we move homeward saying to ourselves and one another , What was he ? Afterward , when the parting has gone by and we are in the world once more , we ask the other question , as to what he did ; and we make up the sum of his life in this regard with thought , more than with feeling -- with admiration , rather than with love alone . It must be so , and should be so , in the case of this venerated friend of ours , in whose honor we are assembled this afternoon . We commit his body to its last resting // place , and his spirit to the blessed God who gave it , rejoicing in what he was . This alone we gratefully and lovingly speak of to-day . On some later day , when the brotherhood of the University may be present here at a fitting season of commemoration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thankfalness , what he accomplished for this home of our education and for the world . The words which shall be spoken on that other day , as well as those which we utter to-day-if they worthily describe himself and his work-will show him to have been a man of goodness and greatness ; one of the greatest and best , as I think we may truly say , of our country in our time . In the sphere of the intellect , Dr. Woolsey was so remarkable that he impressed every intelligent person who knew him . He had strength and vigor of mind , clear apprehension of truth , a penetrating insight which detected at once all falsity and unreality , and a scholar 's faculty of acquisition and attainment . He had , also , richness of imagination , much of the poetic sense , large mental grasp , openness to thought in many lines , originality and variety in his ideas and thinking , the ease of a perfectly working mechanism in his mental operations , wonderful power of memory , great facility for accurate learning and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was stored with knowledge . He was an independent , honest , earnest thinker , subjecting all knowledge and learning to the true tests . He was suggestive by reason of what he knew and what he thought . He gave forth from the rich stores within himself abundant gifts to help the thought and reflection of others . lie always had his thoughts at command , and I have often felt that he must be happier than most men about him because he had so much of interest to think of , and so many things of the present and the past alike to occupy and stir his mind . Though not possessing some of the brilliant gifts of genius which nature , in rare instances , bestows upon men , he was a man of sounder judgment and keener perception oftentimes than such men , because the common sense of an intelligent mind evenly balanced the other powers . For clearness of apprehension , for the wisdom which adapts means to ends , for the ability to guide his thoughts to calm and right conclusions , for the working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruitful and helpful and valuable and quickening , for the true sincerity and honesty which keep the intellectual faculties within and near the sphere of truth , he was distinguished above most of // the leading men of his time . He commanded respect in every company of men where he found himself by reason of his intelligence , his great mental force , his well-considered views , his wise judgment , and his forceful expression of original thought . As a preacher he exhibited much of this power  --  and as a teacher also , so far as the possibilities of the case allowed . Those who came into connection with him as students were impressed by his mental characteristics in all these respects , and the nearer they came to his real life the more they were impressed . The influence of his intellectual powers was one of the great forces affecting their own lives . In the power of the will , Dr. Woolsey had unusual strength . He was born to command . Though of weak , rather than strong physical development , his imperious will gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of the college he was able to control the body of students by the exercise of this power , even in times of excitement and disorder , and notwithstanding a certain natural timidity he became , by reason of it , fully equal to any emergency . He had the courage of the soldier in the hour of conflict , and the firmness of the wise statesman in times of peace . Among his associates and equals this will-force had a checking and controlling influence oftentimes , even when he was not himself conscious of exerting it . He was ready to ask their views always , and to give them due consideration . But if persuaded that his own view was the right one , he was sufficient for the hour , and was ready to move forward with*out the support , or against the opinions of others , if necessity *compel1ed him so to do . This power in him was recognized by all who came in contact with him . And yet the energy of his will was exercised as fully in controlling himself , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a masterful way . He did so more than those who observed his life at a little distance thought that he needed to do . Like many men of the best and most religious households , whose education , like his , was in the earlier part of the century , he had a more exclusive sense of justice with reference to his own inner life , as compared with other things , than he well might have had , and so he was introspective and self-contemplative in a condemnatory way . lie saw what he felt to be evils and imperfections in himself , and heroically repressed and subdued them by his will-force . He changed timidity into courage by this means , when the call for it // came , as he himself testified . And he controlled himself as a Christian disciple many times when he thought he was assailed by enemies within , or evils without . We have happily gained something for the peace and joy of our souls by the growing appreciation , in these more recent years , that justice is not everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in human character or the divine government . But the men , whose character had its roots and foundation in the earlier time , had a magnificent will-power which we are in danger of losing . This power had a grand manifestation of itself in our venerated frieAd 's life , and to it was due no small share of that strength of manhood which was so much admired by all . Dr. Woolsey was a man of tender feeling . There was in him a child-like tenderness and gentleness and trustfulness , which were charming to all who beheld them . I think that those whose acquaintance with him was somewhat intimate must have been surprised , sometimes , when they saw the strong , intellectual , forceful man putting himself under their care for the moment , as it were , and listening like a child to their wisdom or suggestions . He had a , if the occasion required it , or even could have a cold or severe manner when he was busily occupied , or was preoccupied , he was kindly considerate in his natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart , and , for myself , I think of him most pleasantly and affectionately , because of the gentle and friendly way in which he so many times talked with me when I called upon him in my earlier years , as well as in the more recent ones . He had a most kindly appreciation of young men , and believed in them . He prayed often , in his morning prayer at college , that they might be wiser and better than their fathers were . His faith went with his prayer . He did not look backward , but forward . He trusted the young men , and was ready to trust the future , under the divine guidance , to their care and keeping . He loved children , and his own children , and played with them . He taught his own children , and read with them , and inspired them with the love of knowledge . When sorrow came to his household , as it did again and again , in the death of his children , his grief was that of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never forget his saying to me , just after he heard of the sudden dying of his two daughters in Jerusalem , that it was a sweet thought to him // that they died where Jesus died . He had a childlike trust in God , and loved the Lord Jesus as his elder brother and friend . He was generous , liberal in thought and feeling , magnanimous , honest , sine ere , full of faith and good works , a man of large mind and a large soul . He was of the highest integrity ; of the most transparent simplicity ; of a truly modest estimate of himself ; kindly in his judgment of others , while clearly understanding character ; retiring in his disposition , but sufficient for every duty ; with humility towards God , and courage in his relations to men . He knew his faults , and manfully resisted them . He grew stronger in his virtues , year by year , and bore witness of them to all observers by his daily life . He was one of those whose character and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very presence in a city or walking through the streets is an elevating and purifying influence . In the relations of personal friendship he was confiding , faithful , and sincere . He cherished his friends with much warmth of feeling and held fast to them through the years . He depended on them , gladly took their counsel , opened his heart to those with whom his intimacy was greatest in his times of deepest need , sought their generous indulgence if he ever seemed for a moment to try their feeling , honored them for their works ' sake and for their worthiness of his love . His tender regard and friendship for Professor Thacher and for his own successor in office were a constant and most pleasant evidence of his power of affection . His readiness to take lessons for his own life from those much younger than himself , whose character he admired and trusted , was a touching proof of his loving spirit . As a scholar , Dr. Woolsey was earnest , impartial , learned , truthful . He had a genuine love of learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his scholarship was very conspicuous . He was an authority in classical Greek , in History , and in Political Science . He was an energetic and large-minded student in theology ; a preacher of uncommon ability , suggestiveness , and originality ; a scholar in the department of New Testament interpretation ranking among the first in the country . He modestly sat at the feet of men whom he thought to know more than himself in special departments , while in reality he had quite as much knowledge as they had , or perchance even more . As a member of the company of New Testament Revisers-those who worked together for eight years in the revising of the English // Version-he seemed to me to be the most fully rounded scholar of them all , fitted to preside among them , as he did , both by reason of his eminent position and of what he was in this sphere of learning . From my earliest days of familiar acquaintance with him as a student , in the years immediately following my college graduation , he has always more fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scholar-enriched by scholarship , but greater in himself than in his learning-than any man whom I have ever known . As a teacher , he had the best powers , with the exception of that one which is the rarest of all gifts among teachers  --  a peculiar blessing granted to some men , but denied to most , even where the other gifts are greatest ,  --  magnetic power . lie had the inspiring influence of his personal example as a student ; the power which comes from accuracy and from the love of knowledge for its own sake ; the impulse which the teacher gives by his own honesty in investigation , by the respect awakened for his attainments , by his manly demand for faithful work , by his abhorrence of all deceit and half-fulfilled duty , by his placing of character above all things else and showing the bearing of true learning upon character . He was himself an inspiration in the student community , because he was an honest , truthful 4scholar , as he was an honest , truthful man . But if we speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought near the sphere of what he did , and the story of this must be deferred to another and , perchance , more fitting occasion . We are now thinking of what he was . Much more , indeed , might be said in answer to this question , but enough has been already spoken , I trust , to recall the man as we knew him . It is pleasant to think that we know what his manhood was better than any one can tell us . His personality is stamped upon our minds and characters . Those who met him as his pupils have his influence in themselves-an ever-abiding possession-an ever-realized power . But the Christian life was to him the life of all life , and we may not pass this hour without a word as to what he was as a Christian disciple . He was a true Christian disciple . This we have none of us ever doubted , for the character was too pure and elevated and holy and Christ-like to make it possible for doubt to enter our minds . He might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideal standard , but we // could not . He might have been self-distrustful . The purest souls often are . But we could not be distrustful . The man of God was before us , moving forward toward the kingdom of heaven , filled with the light and hope of that kingdom , animated and inspired by the spirit of the sons of that kingdom . The character of the sons of the kingdom is set before us in those words of Peter 's second epistle , where he bids his readers add virtue , or manliness , to faith ; and knowledge to manliness ; and self-control to knowledge ; and patience to self-control ; and godliness to patience ; and love of the Christian brethren to godliness ; and wide-reaching love to love of the brethren . If we look at the life now ended ,  --  the truest , inmost life of the man-where do we find its deep foundation , but in faith ? The life itself was a continual testimony to faith , calm , peaceful , intelligent , victorious faith , as that on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would know God ? And what do we see built upon faith , but manliness ? Where , in any life that we have known , was there that manliness which is the sum of virtuethat virtue which is the essence of manly living-more truly than in the life of our revered friend . And in whom has knowledge ever come nearer to manliness , or self-control to knowledge , than in him ? The knowing of Christiark duty and Christian living was to him the counterpart , and the direct antecedent , of that control of self which subdued the man to Christian duty everywhere and in all things . He knew , also , that patience  --  the steadfast endurance to which self-control leads-must be added to self-control in order that the good fight may be fought and the victory gained . Surely his patience in suffering , and his patient continuance in the struggle of the soul , were manifest in his sorrows and in his efforts through all the years . And then upon these virtues , growing more as we may say from the human side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from God-the movement of the soul towards the Father , which has its source in the Father 's tenderness towards his child . And when all these were gained and were increasing through the years , how brotherly love , and wide-reaching love for all men , seemed to glorify the character more and more . It is eighteen years now since this venerated man laid down the burden of his official life , and withdrew to the retirement of his own home . We have all watched his course during these years-some of us from a nearer point of observation-some of // us from a more distant one . But to all , I am sure , the incoming and outgoing of love has been more and more manifest as related to his inner life . It was my privilege to see him during eight years of this quiet , peaceful evening-time , as he turned his thoughts and studies towards the writings which tell of the Divine Master 's life and love . The joy of the calm evening seemed to grow deeper as the time passed on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and teacher and preacher seemed to rejoice with a gentle and sweet satisfaction in the interchange of love between himself and the world-in the kindly and reverential feeling which all men had towards himself , and in the answering kindliness which he felt for alL The eveningtime moved forward , and the light faded peacefully and gradually towards the time for sleep . And now the Father 's appointed hour has come . The man of many years , and many virtues , and many gifts , and many sorrowing , yet rejoicing friends , has fallen asleep . Our farewell word for him , and concerning him , as we lay his body in its resting-place and go to onr life 's work once more , is a beautiful word-is it not ? " Asleep in Jesus-blessed sleep .
