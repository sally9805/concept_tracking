txt A handsome young woman created a decided sensation in the vicinity of the White House to-day , the sensation arising more from the novelty of her costume than from her demand for admission to the President , whom she dedlared she could save by a drop of blood infused into his veins . The name of the woman is Mary Pauline Reininger , wife of Anthony Reininger , of Brooklyn , Eastern District . About 8 o'clock this morning Mrs. Reininger approached the officer on duty at the entrance to the White House grounds , and , grasping his hand , gave it a peculiar grip . The officer asked her what she meant , when she said : " That is the grip . " " I have come , " she continued . " all the way from Paris to save the President .

She gave her name as Mary Pauline Remeric , and in shaking hands with those who approached her gave a peculiar grip , which , she said , was a Templars ' grip .
