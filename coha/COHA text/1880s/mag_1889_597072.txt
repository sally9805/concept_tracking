E have seen what effect the Hampton Roads conference produced upon Jefferson Davis , and to what intemperate and wrathful utterance it provoked him . Its effect upon President Lincoln was almost directly the reverse . His interview with the rebel commissioners doubtless strengthened his former convictions that the rebellion was waning in enthusiasm and resources , and that the Union cause must triumph at no distant day . Secure in his renewal of four years ' personal leadership , and hopefully inspirited by every sign of early victory in the war , his only thought was to shorten , by generous conciliation , the period of the dreadful conflict . His temper was not one of exultation , but of broad patriotic charity , and of keen , sensitive personal sympathy for the whole country and all its people , South as well as North . His conversation with Stephens , Hunter , and Campbell had probably revealed to him glimpses of the undercurrent of their anxiety that fraternal bloodshed and the destructive ravages of war might somehow come to an end . To every word or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and tender heart of President Lincoln responded with bounding impulses . As a ruler and a statesman , he was clear in his judgment and inflexible in his will to reestablish union and maintain freedom for all who had gained it by the chances of war ; but also as a statesman and a ruler , he was ready to lend his individual influence and his official discretion to any measure of mitigation and manifestation of good-will that , without imperiling the union of the States , or the liberty of the citizen , might promote acquiescence in Impending political changes , and abatement and reconcilement of hostile sectional feelings . Filled with such thoughts and purposes , he spent the day after his return from Hampton Roads in considering and perfecting a new proposal , designed as a peace-offering to the States in rebellion . On the evening of February 5 , 1865 , he called his Cabinet together and read to them the following draft of a message and proclamation , which he had written during the day , and upon which he invited their opinion and advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I respectfully recommend that a joint resolution , substantially as follows , be adopted , so soon as practicable , by your honorable bodies : " Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled , That the President of the United States is hereby empowered , in his discretion , to pay four hundred millions of dollars to the States of Alabama , Arkansas , Delaware , Florida , Georgia , Kentucky , Louisiana , Maryland , Mississippi , Missouri , North Carolina , South Carolina , Tennessee , Texas , Virginia , and West Virginia , in the manner and on the conditions following , to wit : The payment to be made in six per cent . Government bonds , and to be distributed among said States pro rake on their respective slave populations as shown by the census of i86o , and no part of said sum to be paid unless all resistance to the national authority shall be abandoned and cease , on or before the first day of April next ; and upon such abandonment and ceasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in manner aforesaid , and the remaining half to be paid only upon the amendment of the national Constitution recently proposed by Congress becoming valid law , on or before the first day of July next , by the action thereon of the requisite number of States . " The adoption of such resolution is sought with a view to embody it , with other propositions , in a proclamation looking to peace and reunion . Whereas , a joint resolution has been adopted by Congress , in the words following , to wit : Now therefore I , Abraham Lincoln , President of the United States , do proclaim , declare , and make known , that on the conditions therein stated , the power conferred on the Executive in and by said joint resolution will be fully exercised that war will cease and armies be reduced to a basis of peace ; that all political offenses will be pardoned ; that all property , except slaves , liable to confiscation or forfeiture , will be released therefrom , except in cases of intervening interests of third parties ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not lying within Executive control.2 It may be said with truth that this was going to the verge of magnanimity towards a foe already in the throes and helplessness of overwhelming defeat- a foe that had rebelled without adequate cause and maintained the contest without reasonable hope . But Mr. Lincoln remembered that the rebels , notwithstanding all their offenses and errors , were yet American citizens , members of the same 2 Unpublished MS. 1 Copyright by J. G. Nicolay and John Hay , i886 . All rights reserved . 132 // nation , brothers of the same blood . He remembered , too , that the object of the war , equally with peace and freedom , was the maintenance of one government and the perpetuation of one Union . Not only must hostilities cease , but dissension , suspicion , and estrangement be eradicated . As it had been in the past , so it must again become in the future-not merely a nation with the same Constitution and laws , but a people united in feeling , in hope , in aspiration . In his judgment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whether their complaints for the past were well or ill founded , he would remove even the temptation to complain in the future . He would give them peace , reunion , political pardon , remission of confiscation wherever it was in his power , and securing unquestioned and universal freedom through the constitutional amendment , he would at the same time compensate their loss of slavery by a direct money equivalent . It turned out that he was more humane than his constitutional advisers . The indorsement of his own handwriting on the manuscript draft of his proposed message records the result of his appeal and suggestion : " FEBRUARY 5 , 1865 . To-day these papers , which explain themselves , were drawn up and submitted to the Cabinet and unanimously disapproved by them. -A . LINCOLN . " 1 It would appear that there was but little discussion of the proposition . The President 's evident earnestness on the one side , and the unanimous dissent of the Cabinet on the other , probably created an awkward situation which could be best relieved by silence on each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brief mention of the important incident , but it reflects the feeling which pervaded the Cabinet chamber : offer were made . If attempted and defeated it would do harm.2 The statement of Secretary Usher , written many years afterwards from memory , also records the deep feeling with which the President received the non-concurrence of his Executive Council : The members of the Cabinet were all opposed . He seemed somewhat surprised at that and asked , " How long will the war last ? " No one answered , but he soon said : " A hundred days . We are spending now in carrying on the war three millions a day , which will amount to all this money , besides all the lives . " With a deep sigh he added , " But you are all opposed to me , and I will not send the message . " * The entry made by Secretary Welles in his diary on the morning after the Cabinet meeting , as to the amount and time , is undoubtedly the correct one , coinciding as it does with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the two witnesses is of little moment . Both accounts show us that the proposal was not based on sentiment alone , but upon a practical arithmetical calculation . An expenditure of three or four hundred millions was inevitable ; but his plan would save many precious lives , would shield homes and hearths from further sorrow and desolation , would dissolve sectional hatred , and plant fraternal goodwill . Though overborne in opinion , clearly he was not convinced . With the words , " You are all opposed to me , " sadly uttered , Mr. Lincoln folded up the paper and ceased the further discussion of what was doubtless the project then nearest his heart . We may surmise , however , that , as he wrote upon it the indorsement we have quoted and laid it away , he looked forward to a not distant day when , in the new term of the Presidency to which he was already elected , the Cabinet , with new and more liberal views , would respond more charitably to his own generous impulses .

Stephens , Hunter , and 1 Unpublished MS. 2 Unpublished MS. 3 " New York Tribune , " Sept. 23 , i88*. 4 " Globe , " Feb. 8 , 1865 , p. 665 . VOL . XXXIX. - 20. // Campbell , came aboard of our steamer , and had an interview with the Secretary of State and myself of several hours ' duration . No question of preliminaries to the meeting was then and there made or mentioned . No other person was present ; no papers were exchanged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed that the conversation was to be informal and verbal merely . On our part , the whole substance of the instructions to the Secretary of State , hereinbefore recited , was stated and insisted upon , and nothing was said inconsistent therewith ; while , by the other party , it was not said that in any event or on any condition they ever would consent to reunion ; and yet they equally omitted to declare that they never would so consent . They seemed to desire a postponement of that question , and the adoption of some other course first , which , as some of them seem to argue , might or might not lead to reunion ; but which course , we thought , would amount to an indefinite postponement . The conference ended without result.l A short discussion occurred in the House on the motion to print this message , but it did not use above the ordinary level of a party wrangle . The few Democrats who took part in it complained of the President for refusing an armistice , while the Republicans retorted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the more recent declarations of his Richmond harangue , announcing his readiness to perish for independence . On the whole , both Congress and the country were gratified that the incident had called out Mr. Lincoln 's renewed declaration of an unalterable resolve to maintain the Union . Patriotic hope was quickened and public confidence strengthened by noting once more his singleness of purpose and steadfastness of faith . No act of his could have formed a more fitting prelude to his second inauguration , which was now rapidly approaching , and the preliminary steps of which were at this time being consummated . A new phase of the reconstruction question was developed in the usual congressional routine of counting the electoral votes of the late presidential election . Former chapters have set forth the President 's general views on reconstruction , and shown that though the executive and legislative branches of the Government differed as to the theory and policy of restoring insurrectionary States to their normal federal functions , such difference had not reached the point of troublesome or dangerous antagonism . Over the new question also dissension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military commanders and in private letters to prominent citizens Mr. Lincoln had strongly advised and actively promoted the formation of loyal State governments in Louisiana , Tennessee , and Arkansas , and had maintained the restored government of Virginia after the division of that State and the admission of West Virginia into the Union , and had officially given them the recognition of the Executive Department of the Government . The Legislative Department , however , had latterly withheld its recognition , and refused them representation in Congress . The query now arose whether the popular and electoral votes of some of those States for President should be allowed and counted . The subject was taken up by the House , which on January 30 passed a joint resolution naming the insurrectionary States , declaring them to have been " in armed rebellion " on the 8th of November , C 864 , and not entitled to representation in the electoral college . A searching debate on this resolution arose in the Senate , which called out the best legal talent of that body . It could not very consistently be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Federal troops and controlled by Federal commanders in part at least , were " in armed rebellion " on election day , under whatever constitutional theory of reconstruction . The phraseology was finally amended to read that the rebel States " were in such condition on the 8th day of November , 1864 , that no valid election for electors of President and VicePresident of the United States , according to the Constitution and laws thereof , was held therein on said day , " and in this form the joint resolution was passed by both houses . Joint resolutions of Congress have all the force and effect of laws , and custom requires the President to approve them in the same manner as regular acts . His signature in this case might therefore be alleged to imply that he consented to or adopted a theory of reconstruction at variance with his former recommendation and action . To avoid the possibility of such misconstruction , Mr. Lincoln sent Congress a short message , in which he said : The joint resolution , entitled " Joint resolution declaring certain States not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been signed by the Executive , in deference to the view of Congress implied in its passage and presentation to him . In his own view , however , the two houses of Congress , convened under the twelfth article of the Constitution , have complete power to exclude from counting all electoral votes deemed by them to be illegal ; and it is not competent for the Executive to defeat or obstruct that power by a veto , as would be the case if his action were at all essential in the matter . He disclaims all right of the Executive to interfere in any way in the matter of canvassing or counting electoral votes ; and he also disclaims that , by signing said resolution , he has expressed any opinion on the recitals of the preamble , or any judgment of his own upon the subject of the resolution.2 1 " 1-louse Journal , " Feb. io , 1865 , p. 237. 2 Lincoln , Message , Feb. 8 , s86* .

When the two houses met in joint convention on the eighth day of February , mention was made by the Vice-President , presiding , that " The Chair has in his possession returns from the States of Louisiana and Tennessee ; but in obedience to the law of the land , the Chair holds it to be his duty not to present them to the convention . " 1 No member insisted on having these returns opened , since they could not possibly change the result .

" 2 The usual committee was appointed to wait upon Mr. Lincoln and notify him of his second election ; and in response to their announcement , he read the following brief address : With deep gratitude to my countrymen for this mark of their confidence ; with a distrust of my own ability to perform the duty required , under the most favorable circumstances , and now rendered doubly difficult by existing national perils ; yet with a firm reliance on the strength of our free Government and the eventual loyalty of the people to the just principles upon which it is founded , and , above all , with an unshaken faith in the Supreme Ruler of Nations , I accept this trust . Be pleased to signify this to the respective houses of Congress.3 In the informal friendly conversation which followed , the President said to the committee , in substance : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yet unended national peril , I can view this call to a second term in nowise more flatteringly to myself than as an expression of the public judgment that I may better finish a difficult work in which I have labored from the first than could any one less severely schooled to the task.4 1 " Globe , " Feb. 8 , 1865 , p. 668. 2 Ibid. , p. 669. 3 Unpublished MS . The reply reported by the notification committee is incorrect , having apparently 35 The formal inauguration of Mr. Lincoln for his second presidential term took place at the appointed time , March 4 , 1865 . There is little variation in the simple but impressive pageantry with which this official ceremony is celebrated . The principal novelty commented upon by the newspapers was the share which the hitherto enslaved race had , for the first time , in this public and political drama . Civic associations of negro citizens joined in the procession , and a battalion of negro soldiers formed l ) art of the military escort . The weather was sufficiently favorable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in view of a vast throng of spectators . Imaginative beholders , who were prone to draw augury and comfort from symbols , could rejoice that the great bronze statue of Freedom now crowned the dome of the Capitol , and that her guardianship was justified by the fact that the Thirteenth Amendment virtually blotted slavery from the Constitution . The central act of the occasion was President Lincoln 's second inaugural address , which enriched the political literature of the Union with another masterpiece , and which deserves to be quoted in full . He said : FELLOW-COUNTRYMEN : At this second appearing to take the oath of the presidential office , there is less occasion for an extended address than there was at the first . Then , a statement , somewhat in detail , of a course to be pursued , seemed fitting and proper . Now , at the expiration of four years , during which public declarations have been constantly called forth on every point and phase of the great contest which still absorbs the attention and engrosses the energies of the nation , little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our arms , *ipon which all else chiefly depends , is as well known to the public as to myself ; and it is , I trust , reasonably satisfactory and encouraging to all . With high hope for the future , no prediction in regard to it is ventured . On the occasion corresponding to this four years ago , all thoughts were anxiously directed to an impending civil war . All dreaded it - all sought to avert It . While the inaugural address was being delivered from this place , devoted altogether to saving the Union without war , insurgent agen s were in the city seeking to destroy it without warseeking to dissolve the Union , and divide effects , by negotiation . Both parties deprecated war ; but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive ; and the other would accept war rather than let it perish . And the war came . One-eighth of the whole population were colored slaves , not distributed generally over the Union , but localized in the southern part of it . These slaves constituted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest was , somehow , the cause of the war .

Neither party expected for the war the magnitude or the duration which it has already attained . Neither anticipated that the cause of the conflict might cease with , or even before , the conflict itself should cease . Each looked for an easier triumph , and a result less fundamental and astounding . Both read the same Bible , and pray to the same God ; and each invokes his aid against the other . It may seem strange that any men should dare to ask a just God 's assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men 's faces ; but let us judge not , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be answered - that of neither has been answered fully . The Almighty has his own purposes . " Woe unto the world because of offenses ! for it must needs be that offenses come ; but woe to that man by whom the offense cometh . " If we shall suppose that American slawry is one of those offenses which , in the providence of God , must needs come , but which , having continued through his appointed time , he now wills to remove , and that he gives to both North and South this terrible war , as the woe due to those by whom the offense came , shall we discern therein any departure from those divine attributes which the believers in a living God always ascribe to him ? Fondly do we hope-fervently do we pray-that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away . Yet , if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondman 's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk , and untilevery drop of blood drawn with the lash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as was said three thousand years ago , so still it must be said , " The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether .

Men are not flattered by being shown that there has been a difference of purpose between the Almighty and them . To deny it , however , in this case , is to deny that there is a God governing the world . It is a truth which I thought needed to be told , and , as whatever of humiliation there is in it falls most directly on myself , I thought others might afford for me to tell it.2 A careful student of Mr. Lincoln 's character will also find this inaugural address instinct with another meaning , which , very naturally , the President 's own comment did not touch . The eternal law of compensation , which it declares and applies to the sin and fall of American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dignity of the old Hebrew prophecies , 3 may , without violent inference , be interpreted to foreshadow an intention to renew at a fitting moment the brotherly good-will gift to the South which has been treated of in the first part of this chapter . Such an inference finds strong corroboration in the phrases which closed the last public address he ever made . On Tuesday evening , April i i , a considerable assemblage of citizens of Washington gathered at the Executive Mansion to celebrate the victory of Grant over Lee . The rather long and careful speech which Mr. Lincoln made on that occasion was , however , less about the past than the future . It discussed the subject of reconstruction , as illustrated in the case of Louisiana , showing also how that issue was related to the questions of emancipation , the condition of the freedmen , the welfare of the South , and the ratification of the constitutional amendment .

FRoi*I the hour of Mr. Lincoln 's reelection the Confederate cause was doomed . The cheering of the troops which greeted the news from the North was heard within the lines at Richmond and at Petersburg , and although the leaders maintained to the end their attitude of defiance , the impression rapidly gained ground among the people that the end was not far off . The stimulus of hope being gone , they began to feel the pinch of increasing want . rheir currency had become almost worthless . In October a dollar in gold was worth thirtyfive dollars in Confederate money ; a month later it brought fifty dollars ; with the opening of the new year the price rose to sixty dollars , and soon after to seventy ; and despite the efforts of the Confederate treasury , which would occasionally rush into the market and beat down the price of gold ten or twenty per cent . in a day , the currency gradually depreciated until a hundred for one was offered and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their money a portentous rise took place in the prices of all the necessaries of life . It is hard for a people to recognize that their money is good for nothing ; to do this is to confess that their Government has failed : it was natural , therefore , for the unhappy citizens of Richmond to think that monstrous prices were being extorted for food , clothing , and fuel , when , in fact , they were paying no more than was reasonable . The journals and diaries of the time are filled with bitter execrations against the extortioners and forestallers ; but when we translate their prices into the gold standard , we wonder how the grocers and clothiers lived . 1 Raymond , " Life of Lincoln , " p. 687. 2 Jones , Vol . II. , p. 361. 3 " Rebel War Clerk 's Diary , " Vol . II. , p. 384 . To pay a thousand dollars for a barrel of flour was enough to strike a householder with horror ; but ten dollars is not a famine price . A suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but if you divide this sum by seventy-five , there is very little profit left for the tailor . High prices , however , even if paid in dry leaves , are a hardship when dry leaves are not plentiful ; and there was scarcity , even of Confederate money , in the South . In Richmond , which lived upon the war , the dearth was especially evident . The clerks in the departments received say four thousand dollars a year , hardly enough for a month 's provisions . Skilled mechanics fared somewhat better . They could earn , so long as they kept out of the army , something like six thousand dollars a year . Statesmanship was cheap . A congressman 's pay was five thousand five hundred dollars ; but most of the civil officers of the Government managed to get their supplies at cost prices from the military stores . It was illegal ; but they could not have lived otherwise , and they doubtless considered their lives necessary to their country . The depreciation of the Confederate currency was an unmistakable symptom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since it did not arise from inflation . On the contrary , Mr. Trenholm , the Secretary of the Treasury , did all he could to check this dangerous tendency , going so far as to incur the reproaches of many who imagined his action enhanced prices . All dealers instinctively felt the money was worthless , and their only object was to get it out of their hands as soon as possible , at whatever prices , in exchange for objects of real value . One Confederate diarist2 records with indignation that he saw a Jew buy at auction an old set of table-spoons for five hundred and seventyfive dollars , and makes this a cause of complaint against the Government , which permits men to acquire in this way the means of running away . Anybody who was able to leave the country became the object of the envy and hatred of those who remained behind . They began to treat their own financial system with contempt . When the officer in charge of the TreasuryNote Bureau at Columbia , alarmed at the approach of Sherman , asked where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his inquiries ; one high functionary advising that he go to the devil.3 At every advance of General Grant 's lines a new disturbance and alarm was manifested in Richmond , the first proof of which was always a fresh rigor in the enforcement , not only of existing conscription laws , but of the arbitrary orders of the frightened authorities . After the capture of Fort Harrison , on the north side of the James , squads of guards were sent into // the streets with directions to arrest every ablebodied man they met . They paid no regard to passes or to certificates of exemption or detail , but hurried the unhappy civilians off to the field , or herded them , pending their assignment to companies , within the railings of the public square . Two members of the Cabinet , Reagan and George Davis , were thus arrested on the streets by the zealous guards in spite of their protestations , though they were , of course , soon recognized and released . The pavements were swept of every class of loiterers ; the clerks in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off whether able to do duty or not . It is said by one Confederate writer1 that the medical boards were ordered to exempt no one who seemed capable of bearing arms for ten days , and he mentions an instance where a man died , on the eleventh day of his service , of consumption . Human nature will not endure such a strain as this : a week after this sweeping of Richmond for recruits , General Gardner reported that more than half the men thus dragged to the trenches had deserted . Of those who remained , the members of influential families came , one by one , back to the town on various pretexts , increasing the bitterness of feeling among those too poor or too obscure to rescue their sons and brothers . Desertion grew too common to punish . Almost every man in the Confederacy was , by statute or decree , liable to military service , and yet hundreds of thousands of them were not in the army . If men were to be shot for deserting , it would have been a question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Davis acted prudently in remitting the death sentences laid before him , although this occasioned great dissatisfaction in the army . Near the end of the year 1864 Longstreet reported one hundred men of Pickett 's division as in the guard-house for desertion , attributing the blame for it to the numerous reprieves which had been granted , no one having been executed for two months . General Lee sent this report to Richmond with his approval , which gave great offense to the Confederate President . He returned the paper , with an indorsement to the effect that the remission of sentences was not a proper subject for the criticism of a military commander.2 As disaster increased , as each day brought its catastrophe , the Confederate Government steadily lost ground in the confidence and respect of the Southern people . It is characteristic of every failing revolt that in the hour of ruin the participators turn upon one another with reproaches , often as causeless and unjust 1 Jones , Vol. 11. , p. 305. 2 Ibid. , p. 343. as those they cast upon their legitimate government . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were doing their best , but they no longer got any credit for it . From every part of the Confederacy came complaints for what was done , demands for what it was impossible to do . Some of the States were in a condition near to counter-revolution . Governor Brown of Georgia made no pretense of concealing his contumacy . The march of Sherman across his State seemed to have emancipated him from any obligations to the Confederacy . His letters to Richmond from that moment lost all color of allegiance . The feeling in North Carolina was little better . A slow paralysis was benumbing the limbs of the insurrection , and even at the heart its vitality was plainly declining . The Confederate Congress , which had hitherto been the mere register of the President 's will , now turned upon him and gave him wormwood to drink . On the i9th of January they passed a resolution making Lee general-in-chief of the army . This Mr. Davis might have borne with patience , although it was intended as a notification to him that his meddling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far worse was the necessity put upon him , as a sequel to this act ,  - -  and in conformity with a resolution of the Virginia legislature ,  --  of reappointing General Joseph E. Johnston to the command of the army which was to resist Sherman 's victorious march to the North . After this he might say that the bitterness of death was past . The Virginia delegation in Congress passed a vote of want of confidence in the Government 's conduct of the war . Mr. Seddon , considering his honor impugned , and not unwilling to lay down a thankless task , resigned his post of Secretary of War . Mr. Davis at first wished him to reconsider his action , claiming that such a declaration from congressmen was beyond their functions and subversive of the President 's constitutional jurisdiction ; but Mr. Seddon insisted , and General John C. Breckinridge was appointed in his place in February , for the few weeks that remained before the final crash.3 Warnings of serious demoralization came daily from the army ; even that firm support to the revolt seemed crumbling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was not thought politic to call public attention to it by repression . A detective reported a member of Congress as uttering treasonable language , and for his pains was told at the War Department that matters of that sort were none of his business.4 It is a curious and instructive thing to note how the act of emancipation had by this time 3 Pollard , p. 441. 4 " Rebel War Clerk 's Diary , " Vol . II. , p. 390. // virtually enforced itself in Richmond . The value of slave property was gone . It is true that a slave was still occasionally sold , at a price less than one-tenth of what he would have brought before the war . But servants could be hired of their nominal owners at a barley-corn rate ; six dollars in gold would pay the hire of a good cook for a year-merely enough to keep up the show of vassalage . In effect any one could hire a negro for his keeping , which was all that anybody in Richmond got for his work . Even Mr. Davis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events . In his message of November he had recommended the employment of 40,000 slaves in the army ,  --  not as soldiers it is true , save in the last extremity ,  --  with emancipation to come later . Lee assumed command of all the Confederate forces on the ninth day of February . His situation was one of unprecedented gloom . The day before , he had reported to Richmond that his troops , who had been in line of battle for two days at Hatcher 's Run , exposed to the bitter winter weather , had been without meat for three days . " If some change is not made , " he said , " and the commissary department organized , I apprehend dire results ; you must not be surprised if calamity befalls us . " Mr. Davis indorsed this discouraging dispatch with words of anger and command easy to write : " This is too sad to be patiently considered ; . . . criminal neglect or gross incapacity . . . . Let supplies be had by purchase or borrowing . " A prodigious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment averted , but no permanent improvement resulted in the situation of affairs . The armies of the Union were closing in from every point of the compass . Grant was every day pushing his formidable left wing nearer the only roads by which Lee could escape ; Thomas was threatening the Confederate communications from Tennessee ; Sheridan was moving for the last time up the Valley of the Shenandoah to abolish Early ; while from the south the redoubtable columns of Shermanthe men who had taken Vicksburg , who had scaled the heights of Chattanooga , and having marched through Georgia had left Savannah loyal and Charleston evacuated - were moving northward with the steady pace and irresistible progress of a tragic fate . It was the approach of this portent which shook the nerves of the Confederate leaders more than the familiar proximity of Grant . Beauregard , and afterwards Johnston , were ordered to " destroy Sherman , " 1 Beauregard , after his kind , showed his Government its duty in loud and valiant words . He advised Mr. Davis to send him at 1 Breckinridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give the enemy battle and crush him " ; " then to concentrate all forces against Grant , march to Washington and dictate a peace " - c - -   a plan of limpid simplicity , which was not adopted . Johnston superseded the brilliant Louisianian the next day , and thereafter did what he could - with the scraps and remnants of an army allowed him - to resist the irresistible . A singular and significant attempt at negotiations was made at this time by General Lee . He was now so strong in the confidence of the people of the South , and the Government at Richmond was so rapidly becoming discredited , that he could doubtless have obtained the popular support , and compelled the assent of the Executive to any measures he thought proper for the attainment of peace . From this it was easy for him and for others to come to the wholly erroneous conclusion that General Grant held a similar relation to the Government and people of the United States . General Lee seized upon the pretext of a conversation reported to him by General Longstreet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary flag of truce for exchange of prisoners , to address a letter to Grant , sanctioned by Mr. Davis , saying he had been informed that General Ord had said that General Grant would not decline an interview with a view " to a satisfactory adjustment of the present unhappy difficulties by means of a military convention , " providing Lee had authority to act . He therefore proposed to meet General Grant , " with the hope that upon an interchange of views it might be found practicable to submit the subjects of controversy between the belligerents to a military convention . " In such event he said he was " authorized to do whatever the result of the proposed conference may render necessary or advisable . " Grant at once telegraphed these overtures to Washington . Stanton received his dispatch at the Capitol , where the President was , according to his custom , passing the last night of the session for the convenience of signing bills . The Secretary handed the telegram to Mr. Lincoln , who read it in silence . He asked no advice or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pen , wrote with his usual slowness and precision a dispatch in Stanton 's name , which he showed to Seward and then handed to Stanton to be signed , dated , and sent . The language is that of an experienced ruler , perfectly sure of himself and of his duty : The President directs me to say that he wishes you to have no conference with General Lee unless it be for capitulation of General Lee 's army , or on some minor or purely military matters . He instructs me to say that you are not to decide , discuss , or confer upon any political questions . Such questions the // President holds in his own hands , and will submit them to no military conferences or conventions . Meanwhile you are to press to the utmost your military advantages . General Grant , on the receipt of this instruction , *vrote , in answer to General Lee , that he had no authority to accede to his proposition - such authority being vested in the President of the United States alone ; he further explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grant reported to Washington what he had done , adding that he would in no case exceed his authority , or omit to press all advantages to the utmost of his ability . This closed the last avenue of hope to the Confederate authorities of any compromise by which the dread alternative of utter defeat or unconditional surrender might be avoided.1 Early in March , General Lee came to Richmond and had a conference with Mr. Davis on the measures to be adopted in the crisis which he saw was imminent . The General-inChief had not taken his advancement seriously . He had not sympathized in the slight which it involved towards the civil government ; he had positively refused to assume the dictatorial powers pith which the Richmond Congress had clearly intended to invest him ; he had ostentatiously thanked " the President alone " for a promotion which in reality came from the President 's enemies and critics . He continued to the end , in accordance with the Constitution of the Confederate States , to treat Mr. Davis as the Commander-in-Chief of the forces . He now laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environed : Richmond and Petersburg must be evacuated before many days ; a new seat for the Confederate Government , a new base of defense for the armies , must be taken up farther south and west . There is a direct contradiction between Mr. Davis and the friends of General Lee as to the manner in which the former received this communication . Mr. Davis says2 he suggested an immediate withdrawal , but that General Lee said his horses were too weak for the roads , in their present state , and that he must wait till the ground became firmer . But General Long , who gives General Lee as his authority , 3 says that the President overruled the general ; that Lee wanted then to withdraw his forces and take up a line behind the Staunton River , from which point he might have indefinitely protracted the war . However this may be , they were both agreed that sooner or later the Richmond lines 1 Jefferson Davis refers to this incident in his message of March 13 to the Confederate Congress , and says : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor the authorities of any State , nor through the commanding generals , will the Government of the United States treat or make any terms or agreement whatever for the cessatioa of hostilities . There must be abandoned ; that the next move should beto Danville ; that a junction was to be formed with Johnston ; Sherman was to be destroyed ; a swarm of recruits would come in after this victory ; and Grant , being caught away from his base , was to be defeated and Virginia delivered from the invader . Mr. Davis gravely set forth this programme as his own , in his book written sixteen years after the war . But before he turned his back forever upon those lines he had so stoutly defended , before he gave up to the nation the capital of the State for whose sake he had deserted his flag , Lee resolved to dash once more at the toils by which he was surrounded . He placed half his army under the command of General John B. Gordon with orders to break through the Union lines at Fort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind them . The reticence in which General Lee enveloped himself in his last years has left his closest friends in doubt as to his real object in this apparently desperate enterprise . General Gordon , who takes to himself the greater share of responsibility for the plan , says : " I decided that Fort Stedman could be taken by a night assault , and that it might be possible to throw into the breach thus made in Grant 's lines a sufficient force to disorganize and destroy the left wing of his army before he could recover and concentrate his forces . " * It is certainly true that any fort can be taken , by day or night , if the assaulting party has men enough and is willing to pay the price ; but to take a place which can not be held is not what we expect from a wise and experienced general . Grant had , with singular prescience , looked for some such movement from Lee a month before . He had ordered5 Parke , then in command of the Ninth Corps , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let his commanders understand they were to lose no time in bringing all their resources to bear on the point of danger . " With proper alacrity in this respect , " he adds , " I would have no objection to seeing the enemy get through . " This is one of the most characteristic phrases we have met with in Grant 's orders . It throws the strongest light both on his temperament and on his mastery of the business at which he had arrived . A month beforehand he foresaw Gordon 's attack , prepared for it , and welcomed the momentary success which attended it . Under such generalship an army 's lines are a trap into which entrance is suicide . remains then for us no choice hut to continue this contest to a final issue , " etc. 2 " Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government , " Vol . II. , p. 648. 3 Long , " Memoirs of R. E. Lee , " p. 403. // The assault was made with great spirit at half-past four on the morning of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a singular cause . The opposing lines at the point chosen were only 150 yards apart ; the pickets were only *o yards from each other ; it was therefore a favorite point of departure for those Confederates who were tired of the war . Desertions had of late become very numerous and had naturally been encouraged in every way ; orders had been issued allowing deserters to bring their arms with them . When Gordon 's skirmishers came stealing through the darkness they were at first mistaken for an unusually large batch of deserters , and they overpowered several picket posts without a shot being fired . The storming part ) T at once followed , took the trenches with a rush , and in a few minutes had possession of the main line on the right of Stedman . Turning on the fort , they soon drove out or made prisoners the garrison . It was the dark hour before dawn , and the defense could not distinguish friends from foes ; and for a little while General Parke , who acted with his usual vigor and intelligence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swarmed on both sides of the breach in the lines . General N. B. McLaughlen , who was posted to the left of Fort Stedman , at once got to work and recaptured an outlying battery with the bayonet , and then hurrying into the fort , in ignorance of its capture , was made prisoner . As soon as it was light , Parke 's troops advanced from every direction to mend the breach ; Potter on the left , XVilcox on the right , and Hartranft , who had been held in reserve , attacking directly from the high ground in the rear . The last two , between them , first made short work of the Confederate detachments that were moving on the City Point road and telegraph and searching in vain for three forts in the rear of Stedman which they had been ordered to take , and which in reality did not exist . By half-past seven Parke had his task well in hand . He had repulsed the Confederate attack to the right and left of Fort Stedman , recaptured two of the detached batteries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fort , and concentrated upon them a heavy artillery fire from three sides . A few minutes later Hartranft 's division carned Fort Stedman by assault , and Gordon withdrew to the Confederate lines what he was able to save of his attacking force . The cross fire of artillery was now so withering that few of the Confederates could get back , and none could come to their assistance . General Parke captured 2000 prisoners , including 71 officers and 9 stands of colors ; his own total loss was about iooo. 1 Grant , " Personal Memoirs , " Vol . II. , p. 424 . VOL . XXXIX. - 21 . But this heavy loss was not the only damage the Confederates suffered . Humphreys and Wright , in command of the troops on the Union left , who were to be routed and dispersed according to General Lee 's plan , on being informed of the racket in the center , correctly assuming that Parke could take care of himself , instantly searched the lines in their front to see if they had been essentially weakened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but in the process of gaining this information they captured the enemy 's intrenched picket lines in front of them , which , in spite of repeated attempts to regain them , were firmly held , and gave inestimable advantage to the Union army in the struggle of the next week . The net results therefore to General Lee of the day 's work were a bitter disappointment , a squandering of four thousand of his best troops against half that number on the other side , and the loss of his intrenched picket line , which brought such dangerous neighbors as Wright and Humphreys within arm s-length of him . For several weeks General Grant 's chief anxiety had been lest Lee should abandon his lines . At first he feared a concentration of Lee and Johnston against Sherman ; but when the victorious army of the . West had arrived at Goldsboro ' and formed connection with Schofield his anxiety on that score was at rest , and there only remained a keen eagerness to make an end of the Army of Northern Virginia . " I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would awake from my sleep to hear that Lee had gone , and that nothing was left but a picket line . " 1 Still - just as Lee , though feeling every hour of waiting was fraught with danger , was prevented from moving by the bad roads and the Richmond complications-Grant , although burning to attack , was delayed by the same cause of bad roads , and by another . He did not wish to move until Sheridan had completed the work assigned him in the Valley and joined either Sherman or the army at Petersburg . But at last , satisfied with Sheridan 's progress and with Sherman 's condition , he resolved to wait no longer , and on the 24th of March , at the very moment when Gordon was making his arrangements for the next day 's sortie , Grant issued his orders for the great movement to the left which was to finish the war . He intended to begin on the 29th , but Lee 's desperate dash of the 25th appeared to the Union commander to indicate an intention to secure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediate move of the Confederates westward , and he felt more than ever that not a moment was to be lost . Sheridan reached City Point on the 26th , and Sherman came up from // North Carolina for a brief visit the next day . He said he would be ready to move on the ioth of April , and laid before Grant a plan for a cooperative campaign , which was of course satisfactory , as was always everything that Sherman proposed , but which the swift rush of events soon rendered superfluous . The President was also there , and an interesting conversation took place between these famous brothers-in-arms and Mr. Lincoln , after which Sherman went back to Goldsboro ' and Grant began pushing his army to the left with even more than his usual iron energy . It was a great army ; it was the result of all the power and wisdom of the Government , all the devotion of the people , all the intelligence and teachableness of the soldiers themselves , and all the ability and character which the experience of a mighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced better corps commanders than Sheridan , Warren , Humphreys , Ord , Wright , and Parke , taking their names as they come in the vast sweep of the Union lines from Dinwiddie Court House to the James in the last days of March ; north of the James was Weitzel , vigilant and capable . Between Grant and the Army of the Potomac was Meade , the incarnation of industry , zeal , and talent ; and in command of all was Grant , then in his best days , the most extraordinary military temperament this country has ever seen . When unfriendly criticism has exhausted itself , the fact remains not to be explained away by any reasoning , subtle or gross , that in this tremendous war he accomplished more with the means given him than any other two , on either side . The means given him were enormous , the support of the Government was intelligent and untiring ; but others had received the same means and the same support - and he alone captured three armies . The popular instinct which hails him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who write ingenious arguments to prove that one or another of his subordinates or his adversaries was his superior will please for a time their diminishing coteries , and then pass into silence without damaging his robust fame . The numbers of the respective armies in this last grapple have been the occasion of endless controversy . We take the figures given by General Humphreys-not merely on account of his profound study of the subject and personal acquaintance with it , but because we consider him the most thoroughly candid and impartial man who has written the history of this army . The effective force of infantry of the Army of the Potomac was 69,000 ; of field artillery , 6ooo , with 243 guns . The effective force of infantry of the Army of the James was 32,000 ; of field artillery , 3000 , with i 26 guns and 1700 cavalry , though General Ord took with him only about one-half his infantry ; Sheridan 's cavalrymen , present for duty , 13 ,  - -  000 ; the grand total of all arms was 124,700 . Lee 's infantry numbered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 6ooo ; in all , 57,000 . Grant 's plan , as announced in his instructions of March 24 , * was at first to dispatch Sheridan to reach and destroy the South Side and Danville railroads , at the same time moving a heavy force to the left , primarily to insure the success of Sheridan 's raid , 2 and then to turn Lee 's position . But his purpose grew and developed every hour , and before he had been a day away from his winter headquarters he had given up the comparatively narrow scheme with which he started and had adopted the farbolder and more comprehensive plan , which he carried out to his immortal honor . It is probable that to General Sheridan belongs a part of the credit of this change of plan . He informs us that when discretion was given him , in the Valley , either to go south , past Lee 's right flank , and join Sherman , or to turn east and unite with the Army of the Potomac , he chose the latter course , because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus far won scanty laurels when compared with the Western , should have the glory of this final victory ; and that when he arrived at City Point and found General Grant 's plans once more contemplated the possibility of sending his cavalry to Sherman and bringing that commander , after disposing of Johnston , to share in the destruction of Lee , Sheridan urged the General-in-Chief to finish the work immediately with the Army of the Potomac , that had so richly merited the glory which would come of the fruition of their long years of blood and toil . Both commanders were full of the spirit of victory . On the evening of the 29th of March , Sheridan 's cavalry was at Dinwiddie Court House , and the left of the moving force of infantry extended to the Quaker road - almost to Lee 's right flank on the White Oak Ridge . Grant 's purpose had now taken complete shape in his mind . From his tent on Gravelly Creek he wrote to Sheridan , telling him the position of all his corps , and adding in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reader for ages to come , " I now feel like ending the matter . . . before we go back . " He ordered Sheridan not to cut loose and go after the railroads , but to push for the qwq // enemy 's right rear . " We will all act together as one army here , until it is seen what can be done with the enemy. ** The next day Sheridan advanced to Five Forks , where he found a heavy force of the enemy . Lee , justly alarmed by Grant 's movements , had drawn all his available troops out of the trenches , dispatched a sufficient force under Fitzhugh Lee to Five Forks to hold that important cross-roads , and had taken personal command of the rest on the White Oak Ridge . A heavy storm of rain began the night of the 29th , continuing more than twenty-four hours , and greatly impeded the march of the troops . Warren , on the morning of the 2 1st , worked his way towards the White Oak road ; but before he reached it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advanced division ( Ayers 's ) with such impetus that it was driven back on the main line at Gravelly Run . There , gallantly supported by General Miles of Humphreys 's corps , who made a spirited attack on Lee 's left flank , Warren held his own , and in the afternoon moved forward and drove the enemy into his works . Lee , not satisfied with opposing Sheridan at Five Forks with cavalry , had on the 3oth sent Pickett there with some 7000 infantry , which , with nearly an equal force of cavalry , was too much for the Union horse to handle . Sheridan was therefore , on the 3Ist , forced back to Dinwiddie Court House . " Here , " says Grant , " Sheridan displayed great generalship . " He fought with obstinate tenacity , disputing every inch of ground , deploying his cavalry on foot , leaving only men enough with his horses to guard them . He gave Pickett and Lee a hard day 's work on the way to Dinwiddie , and at night reported his situation to Grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed , was far more disturbed than Sheridan . He rained orders and suggestions all night upon Meade , Warren , and Sheridan , the purpose of which was to effect a concentration at daylight on that portion of the enemy in front of Sheridan . Warren , giving his troops , who had been marching and fighting for three days , a few hours ' needed rest , came in on Sheridan 's right about dawn . But Pickett , seeing that he was out of position , did not wait to be caught between the two Union columns ; he withdrew noiselessly during the night 1 and resumed his 1 The testimony of the Confederate generals in the Warren court of inquiry shows that Pickett and Fitzhugh Lee , anticipating Warren 's arrival at daybreak , resolved to retire at ten o'clock on the night of the 31st of March , and that the movement began at once . " Nearly everything on wheels , " Fitzhugh Lee said , " was away by midnight . " At daylight the cavalry moved , covering the rear of the infantry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) General XV . H. F. Lee 's testimony is to the same effect , p. 536. strongly intrenched post at Five Forks . Grant , in ignorance of this timely flight of Pickett , was greatly incensed at Warren for not having done what is now seen to have been impossible to do , since Pickett was gone before the hour when Grant*vished Warren to attack him . The long-smoldering dislike of Warren , which had been for months increasing in Grant 's mind , now blazed out into active hostility , and he sent an aide-de-camp to Sheridan , suggesting that Warren be relieved from his command.2 Sheridan hurried up to Five Forks with his cavalry , leaving Warren to bring up the Fifth Corps . Filled , as Sheridan was all this day , with the most intense martial ardor , his judgment and control of his troops were never more powerful and comprehensive . He pressed with his cavalry the retreating Confederates until they came to Five Forks , and then assigned to Merritt the duty of demonstrating strongly on Pickett 's right , while with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left flank , which ran along the White Oak road about three-quarters of a mile east from Five Forks and then made a return of a hundred yards to the north , perpendicular to the road . It was the old tactics of the Valley repeated , with the additional advantage in this case that , if successful , he would drive Pickett westward and cut him off from Lee . To guard against any interruption from the east , Mackenzie had been sent to take possession of the White Oak road , some three miles east of the Forks , a task which he promptly performed , and then came back to take his position on the right of the Fifth Corps . The battle was fought almost as it was planned : the only difference between conception and execution arose from the fact that it had not been practicable to ascertain the precise position of the enemy 's left flank , lest the attempt might put them on their guard . Ayers 's division was on the left , Crawford on the right , Griffin behind Crawford , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o'clock . Warren , understanding that the enemy 's lines reached farther down the road than was the case , sent Ayers , his smallest division , in a direction which brought it against the angle , and Crawford and Griffin were moving across the road and altogether past the left of the enemy into the woods , when the heavy firing in front 2 Thorough inquiry among the friends of both generals seems to establish the fact that Grant 's animosity towards Warren arose from the habit Warren had of discussing his orders , suggesting changes in plans of battle , and movements in support of his own . Grant regarded this habit as lacking in respect to himself , and although Warren was looked upon as one of the ablest and most devoted officers in the army , it was evident that sooner or later Grant 's irritation would come to a point which would prove ruinous to Warren . // of Ayers warned Warren of his error , and he immediately bestirred himself to rectify it , sending his aides in every direction , and finally riding off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point where they were so greatly needed . All this occupied considerable time , and in the mean while the brunt of the battle fell upon Ayers 's division . They were hardly strong enough for the work thus accidentally assigned them , and there might have been a serious check at that moment but for the providential presence of Sheridan himself , who , with a fury and vehemence founded on the soundest judgment , personally led the troops in their attack on the intrenchments . Those who saw him that day will tell the story to their latest breath , how , holding the colors in his hand , with a face darkened with smoke and anger , and with sharp exhortations that rang like pistol-shots , he gathered up the faltering battalions of Ayers and swept like a spring gust over Pickett 's breastworks . Meanwhile Warren was doing similar work on the right . He had at last succeeded in giving his other two divisions the right direction , and came in on the reverse of the enemy 's lines . At one moment , finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Warren , riding forward , " says Humphreys , " with the corps flag in his hand , led his troops across the field . " His horse was shot dead in the final charge . The dusk of evening came down on one of the most complete and momentous victories of the war . Pickett was absolutely routed ; every man was driven from the field except the killed and wounded , and the prisoners , who were gathered in to the number of some five thousand , with a great quantity of guns and colors . As the battle was ending , Sheridan sent an order to Warren relieving him of his command and directing him to report to General Grant for orders . It does not come within the compass of this work to review all the circumstances which led General Grant to entertain so rooted a dislike to Warren , and General Sheridan , who had but a slight acquaintance with him , 1 to adopt his chief 's opinions . In removing him from command they were perfectly justified . Honestly holding the opinion they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evils they thought might result from his retention in so important a trust . But it is not improper here to say that a court of inquiry , which General Warren succeeded in obtaining after General Grant had for twelve years denied it to him , decided that the opinions under which Grant and Sheridan acted were erroneous , and that 1 " As we had never been thrown much together , I knew but little of him . " Sheridan , " Memoirs , " Vol . II. , p. i68 . Warren did his whole duty at Five Forks . Grant never changed his opinion of him . It is true he offered him another command the next day , and soon afterwards he was given an important department to administer ; but the General-in-Chief was always implacable towards him . Even on his death-bed , when he forgave all his enemies , and sent forth that touching appeal for human kindliness , not only to his friends , but to those who had not hitherto been friends , he kept his feeling of keen dislike for Warren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down for future ages in his " Memoirs . " A curious instance of his increasing bitterness is seen in one phrase . In his report of 1865 he says Warren was relieved " about the close of this battle " ; in his " Memoirs " he says " the troops were brought up and an assault successfully made " - after Warren was relieved . APPOMATTOX . THE battle of Five Forks ought to have ended the war : Lee 's right had been shattered and routed ; his line , as he had long predicted , had been stretched westward until it broke ; there was no longer any hope of saving Richmond , or even of materially delaying its fall . But General Lee apparently thought that even the gain of a day was of value to the Richmond Government , and what was left of the Army of Northern Virginia was still so perfect in discipline and obedience that it answered with unabated spirit and courage every demand made upon it . It is painful to record or to read the story of the hard fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent on the lines of Petersburg that day seems to have been shed in vain . Parke and Wright had been ordered on the 3oth of March to examine the enemy 's works in their respective fronts with a view to determine whether it was practicable to carry them by assault ; they had both reported favorably . After the great victory of Five Forks , Grant , whose anxiety for Sheridan seems excessive , thought that Lee would reinforce against him heavily , 2 when , in fact , Lee had already sent to his right all the troops that could be spared , and Sheridan had routed them . To relieve Sheridan , and to take advantage of any weakness in Lee 's extended front , Grant now ordered an assault all along the lines . The answers came in with electric swiftness and confidence : Wright said he would " make the fur fly " ; Ord promised to go into the Confederate lines " like a hot knife into butter . " The ground , 2 Grant to Ord : " I have just heard from Sheridan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " // however , in front of Ord was so difficult that Grant gave him no positive orders to assault , but , on the contrary , enjoined upon him great vigilance and caution . Similar instructions were given to Humphreys ; Miles , of his corps , was ordered westward on the White Oak road to help Sheridan , and Wright and Parke were directed to attack at four o'clock on the morning of the 2d . Grant 's principal anxiety was lest Lee should get away from Petersburg and overwhelm Sheridan on the White Oak road . Lee was thinking of nothing of the kind . The terrible blow his right had received seemed to have stunned him . He waited , with a fortitude not far from despair , for the attack which the morning *v as sure to bring , making what hasty preparations were in his power for the coming storm . It came with the first glimmer of dawn . Wright , who had carefully studied the ground in his front , from the safe point of vantage he had gained the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space in front of Forts Fisher and Walsh as the weak point in the Confederate harness . Not that it was really weak , except in comparison with the almost impregnable works to right and left : the enemy 's front was intersected by marshy rivulets ; a heavy abatis had to be cut away under musketry fire from the parapets and a rain of artillery from the batteries . It was a quarter to five before there was light enough to guide the storming columns ; but at that instant they swarmed forward , rushing over the Confederate pickets with too much momentum to be delayed a minute , and , gaining the main works , made them their own after a brief but murderous conflict . In fifteen minutes Wright lost eleven hundred men . They wasted not an instant after this immense success . Some pushed on in the ardor of the assault across the Boydtown road as far as the South Side Railroad ; 1 the gallant Confederate General A. P. Hill rode unawares upon a squad of these skirmishers , and , refusing to surrender , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body of the troops wisely improved their victory . A portion of them worked resolutely to the right , meeting strong resistance from the Confederates under Wilcox ; the larger part re-formed with the celerity that comes from discipline and experience , and moved down the reverse of the captured lines to Hatcher 's Run , where , about seven o'clock , having swept everything before them and made large captures of men and guns , they met their comrades of the Twenty-fourth Corps , whom they joined , facing about and marching over ground cleared of the enemy till the left closed in on the Appomattox River . 1 Humphreys , p. 365. 2 W. H. Taylor , " Four Years with General Lee . " Parke also assaulted at the earliest light , meeting with a success on the outer line equally brilliant and important , capturing four hundred yards of intrenchments with many guns , colors , and prisoners . But there was in front of him an interior line , heavily fortified , and here the enemy , under General Gordon , not only made a stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day , without success , the lines which Parke had seized in the morning and hastily reversed . On the left Humphreys displayed his usual intelligent energy ; as soon as he heard of the success of Wright and Parke , on his right , he attacked with Hays 's division the Confederate redoubt at Crow 's House , capturing the works , the guns , and most of the garrison , while upon his left Mott 's division drove the enemy out of their works at Burgess 's Mill . Humphreys wanted to concentrate his whole corps against the scattered enemy by the Claibourne road ; but General Meade countermanded the movement . Mott and Hays were ordered towards Petersburg , and Miles , who had been holding the White Oak road for Sheridan , was therefore left alone to deal with Heth 's division , which had hastily intrenched itself near Sutherland 's Station , and here a sharp fight took place . Miles , twice repulsed , stuck obstinately to his task , and about three o'clock whipped and dislodged the enemy , making large captures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House . Two forts- Gregg and Whitworth- on the main line of the Confederate intrenchments west of Petersburg made a stout resistance to the National troops . The former was a very strong work , surrounded by a deep and wide wet ditch , flanked by fire to the right and left . It was an ugly thing to handle , but Foster 's and Turner 's divisions of Gibbon 's corps assaulted with unflinching valor , meeting a desperate resistance . Every advantage , except that of numbers , was on the side of its brave defenders , and they put twice their own number hors dl/ combal before they surrendered . Gibbon reports a loss of 714 killed and wounded ; 55 Confederate dead were found in the work . After Gregg had fallen , Turner 's men made short work of Whitworth , and the Confederates , from the Appomattox to the Weldon road , fell slowly back to their inner line of works near Petersburg , now garrisoned by Longstreet 's troops , who had come in from the north side of the James . The attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came upon General Lee with the stunning effect of lightning . Before the advance of the National army had been reported to Lee or Hill , they saw squads of men in blue scattered about the Boydtown road , 2 and it was in riding forward to ascer // tam what the strange apparition meant that General Hill lost his life . General Lee , in full uniform , with his dress sword , which he seldom wore , but which he had put on that morning in honor of the momentous day he saw coming , 1-being determined , with that chivalrous spirit of his , to receive adversity splendidly ,  - -  watched from the lawn in front of his headquarters the formidable advance of the National troops before whom his weakened lines were breaking into spray , and then , mounting his iron-gray charger , slowly rode back to his inner line . There his ragged troops received him with shouts and cheers which showed there was plenty of fight left in them ; and there he spent the day in making preparations for the evacuation which was now the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richmond , carrying in brief and simple words the message of doom to the Confederate authorities : " I see no prospect of doing more than holding our position here till night . I am not certain I can do that . " He succinctly stated the disaster that had befallen him , announced his purpose of concentrating on the Danville road , and advised that all preparations be made for leaving Richmond that night . Some Confederate writers express surprise that General Grant did not attack and destroy Lee 's army on the afternoon of the 2d of April ; but this is a view , after the fact , easy to express . Wright 's and Humphreys 's troops on the Union left had been on foot for eighteen hours ; they had fought an important battle , marched and countermarched many miles , and were now confronted by Longstreet 's fresh corps , behind formidable works , led by the best of Lee 's generals ; while the attitude of the force under Gordon , on the south side of the town , was such as to require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early retirement of Lee from his citadel , wisely resolved to avoid the waste and bloodshed of an immediate assault on the inner lines at Petersburg . He ordered Sheridan to get upon Lee 's line of retreat , sent Humphreys to strengthen him ; then , directing a general bombardment for five o clock the next morning , and an assault at six , he gave himself and his soldiers a little of the rest they had so richly earned , and which they so seriously needed , as a restorative after the labors past and a preparation for the labors to come . He had telegraphed during the day to President Lincoln , who was at City Point , the great day 's news as it developed hour by hour . He was particularly happy at the large captures . " How many prisoners ? " was always the first question as an aide-de-camp came galloping in with news of success . Prisoners he regarded as so much net gain : he was weary of slaugh ter ; he wanted the war ended with the least bloodshed possible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to telegraph on this Sunday afternoon , " The whole captures since the army started out gunning will amount to not less than twelve thousand men and probably fifty pieces of artillery . " General Lee , after the first shock of the breaking of his lines , soon recovered his usual sang-froid , and bent all his energies to saving his army and leading it out of its untenable position on the James to a point from which he could effect a junction with Johnston in North Carolina . The place selected for this purpose was Burkeville , at the crossing of the South Side and Danville roads , fifty miles from Richmond , whence a short distance would bring him to Danville , where the desired junction might be made . Even in this ruin of the Confederacy , when the organized revolt which he had sustained so long with the bayonets of his soldiers was crashing about his ears , he was able still to cradle himself in the illusion that it was only a campaign that had failed ; that he might withdraw his troops , form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in another field . Whatever we may think of his judgment , it is impossible not to admire the coolness of a general who , in the midst of irremediable disaster such as encompassed Lee on the afternoon of the 2d of April , could write such a letter as he wrote to Jefferson Davis under date of three o'clock.2 He began it by a quiet and calm discussion of the question ofnegro recruitment ; promised to give his attention to the business of finding suitable officers for the black regiments ; hoped the appeal Mr. Davis had made to the governors would have a good effect ; and , altogether , wrote as if years of struggle and effort were before him and his chief . He then went on to narrate the story of the day 's catastrophe and to give his plans for the future . He closed by apologizing for " writing such a hurried letter to your Excellency , " on the ground that he was " in the presence of the enemy , endeavoring to resist his advance . " At nightfall all his preparations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the town dismounted at the mouth of the road leading to Amelia Court House , the first point of rendezvous , where he had directed supplies to be sent , and standing beside his horse , the bridle reins in his hand , he watched his troops , file noiselessly by in the darkness . At three o'clock the town , which had been so long and so stoutly defended , was abandoned ; only a thin line of skirmishers was left in front of Parke , and before daybreak he pierced the 1 J. E. Cooke , " Life of R. E. Lee . " 2 Davis , " Rise and Fall , " Vol . II. , p. 66o. // pickets that were left . The town was formally surrendered to Colonel Ely at half-past four , anticipating the capitulation which some one else offered to General Wright a few minutes later . Meade reported the news to Grant and instantly received the order to march his army immediately up the Appomattox by the river road ; and Grant , divining the intentions of Lee , dispatched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all speed to the Danville road with Humphreys and Griffin and all the cavalry . Thus the flight and the pursuit began almost at the same moment . The swift-footed Army of Northern Virginia was now racing for its life ; and Grant , inspired with more than his native tenacity and energy , and thoroughly aroused to the tremendous task of ending the war at once , not only pressed his enemy in the rear , but hung upon his flank , and strained every nerve to get in his front . It is characteristic of him that he did not even allow himself the pleasure of entering Richmond , which , deserted by those who had so often promised to protect it , and wrapped in flames lighted by the reckless hands of Confederate officials , surrendered to Weitzel early on the morning of the 3d . All that day Lee pushed forward towards Amelia Court House . He seemed in higher spirits than usual . As one who has long been dreading bankruptcy feels a great load taken from his mind when his assignment is made , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and conflagration in which the Confederate dream of independent power was passing away , and marched with his men into the vernal fields and woods of his native State , was filled with a new sense of encouragement and cheer . " I have got my army safe out of its breastworks , " he said , " and in order to follow me the enemy must abandon his lines , and can derive no further benefit from his railroads or James River . " 1 But he was now dealing with the man who , in Mississippi , had boldly swung loose from his base of supplies in an enemy 's country , in face of an army equal to his own , and had won a victory a day without a wagon train . There was little fighting the first day except among the cavalry . Custer attacked the Confederates at Namozine Church , and later in the day Merritt 's cavalry had a sharp contest with Fitzhugh Lee at Deep Creek . On the 1 J. E. Cooke , " Life of R. E. Lee , " p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrender . Other Confederate writers insist that the train which should have borne these supplies to Lee was directed to Richmond to assist the flight of the Confederate authorities . ( Pollard , 47 4th , Sheridan , who was aware of Lee 's intention to concentrate at Amelia Court House , brought his cavalry with great speed to Jetersville , about eight miles southwest of the Court House , where Lee 's army was resting . Sheridan intrenched , and sent tidings of his own and the enemy 's position to Grant , and on the afternoon of the next day2 the Second and Sixth corps came up . A terrible disappointment awaited General Lee on his arrival at Amelia Court House . He had ordered , ' he says , supplies to be sent there ; but when his half-starved troops arrived on the 4th of April they found that no food had been sent to meet them , and nearly twenty-four hours were lost in collecting subsistence for men and horses . " This delay was fatal , and could not be retrieved . " 3 The whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him , when he started on the night of the 5th of April to make one more effort to reach a place of temporary safety . Burkeville , the junction of the Lynchburg and Danville roads , was in Grant 's possession ; the way to Danville was barred , and the supply of provisions from the south cut off . Lee was compelled to change his route to the wdst ; and he now started for Lynchburg , which he was destined never to reach . It had been Meade 's intention to attack Lee at Amelia Court House on the morning of the 6th of April , but before he reached that place he discovered that Lee 's westward march had already begun , and that the Confederates were well beyond the Union left . Meade quickly faced his army about and started in pursuit . A running fight ensued for fourteen miles ; the enemy , with remarkable quickness and dexterity , halting and partially intrenching themselves from time to time , and the National forces driving them out of every position , moving so swiftly that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At several points the cavalry , on this and the preceding day , harassed the moving left flank of the Confederates and worked havoc on the trains , on one occasion causing a grievous loss to history by burning Lee 's headquarters baggage with all its wealth of returns and reports . Sheridan and Meade pressed so closely at last that Ewell 's corps was brought to bay at Sailor 's Creek , a rivulet running northward into the Appomattox . Here an important battle , or rather series of battles , took place , with fatal results to Lee 's fast vanishing army . The Fifth Corps held the extreme " Lost Cause , " p. 703 . ) Jefferson Davis ( " Rise and Fall , " Vol . II. , p. 668 ) denounces the whole story as a malignant calumny , and gives voluminous statements from Confederate officers to confute it .

Humphreys , coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drove Gordon down towards the mouth of the creek . A sharp battle was fought about dark , which resulted in the total defeat of the Confederates , Humphreys capturing 1700 prisoners , 13 flags , 4 guns , and a large part of the main trains ; Gordon making his escape in the night to High Bridge with what was left of his command . Wright , on the left-hand road , had also a keen fight , and won a most valuable victory . With Wheaton 's and Seymour 's divisions he attacked Ewell 's corps , in position on the banks of the creek , enveloping him with the utmost swiftness and vehemence ; Sheridan , whose cavalry had intercepted the Confederates , ordered Cook and Merritt to attack on the left , which was done with such vigor - Davies 's horsemen riding over the enemy 's breastworks at a single rush - that , smitten in front and flank , unable either to stand or to get away , Ewell 's whole force was captured on the field . The day 's loss was deadly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; among them such famous generals as Ewell , Kershaw , Custis Lee , Corse , and others were prisoners . In the mean time Ord , under Sheridan s orders , had moved rapidly along the Lynchburg road to Rice 's Station , where he found Longstreet 's corps intrenched , and night came on before he could get into position to attack . General Read , Ord 's chief-of-staff , had gone still farther forward with eighty horsemen and five hundred infantry to burn High Bridge , if possible . He passed through Farmville , and was within two miles of the bridge , when he fell in with two divisions of Confederate cavalry under Rosser and Munford . One of the most gallant and pathetic battles of the war took place . General Read , Colonel Washburn , and all the cavalry officers with Read were killed , and the rest captured ; the Confederate loss was also heavy . Read 's generous self-sacrifice halted the Confederate army for several hours . Longstreet lost the day at Rice 's Station waiting for Anderson , Ewell , and Gordon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruitless attempt to save their trains , 1 which resulted , as we have seen , in the almost total loss of the trains , in the capture of Ewell 's entire force , and in the routing and shattering of the other commands . The day 's work was of incalculable value to the National arms . Sheridan 's unerring eye appreciated the full importance of it ; his hasty report ended with the words , " If the thing is pressed , I think that Lee will surrender . " Grant sent the dispatch to President Lincoln , who instantly replied , " Let the thing be pressed . " 2 In fact , after nightfall of the 6th Lee 's army could only flutter like a wounded bird with one wing shattered ; there was no longer any possibility of escape . Yet General Lee found it hard to relinquish the illusions of years , and his valiant heart still dreamed of evading the gathering toils and forming somewhere a junction with Johnston and indefinitely prolonging the war . As soon as night had come down on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up his weary march westward . Longstreet marched for Farmville , crossed to the north bank of the Appomattox , and on the 7th moved out on the road which ran through Appomattox Court House to Lynchburg . His famishing troops had found provisions at Farmville , and with this refreshment marched with such celerity that Grant and Sheridan , with all the energy they could breathe into their subordinates , could not head them off or bring them to decisive battle that day . Nevertheless the advance of the Union army hung close upon the heels of the Confederates . The rear corps under Gordon had burned the railroad bridge , near Farmville , behind them ; but General Barlow , sending his men forward at double-quick , saved the wagon bridge , and the Second Corps crossed over without delay and continued the chase , Humphreys taking the northern road , and sending Barlow by the railroad bed along the river . Barlow overtook Gordon 's rear , working great destruction among his trains . Humphreys came up with the main body shortly after noon , and pressing them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and Wright and Crook to cross the river and attack from the south , a movement which the swollen water and the destruction of the bridge prevented . General Irwin Gregg 's brigade had indeed succeeded in getting over , but was attacked by an overwhelming force of Confederate cavalry ,  --  three divisions ,  --  Gregg being captured , and his brigade driven back . This trivial success in the midst of unspeakable disaster delighted General Lee . He said to his son , W. H. F. Lee , " Keep your command together , General ; do not let it think of surrender . I will get you out of this . " * But his inveterate optimism was not shared by his subordinates . A number of his principal officers , selecting General Pendleton as their spokesman , made known to him on the 7th their belief that further resistance was useless , and advised surrender . General Lee replied : " I trust it has not come to that . . We have yet too many bold men to think of laying down our arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he made the first overtures for capitulation Grant would regard it as a confession of weakness , and demand unconditional sur1 Ilumphreys , p. 385. 2 Badeau , Vol . III. , p. 581. 3 j . F. Cooke , " Life of R. E. Lee , " p. 455. // render . " 1 But General Grant did not wish to drive a gallant antagonist to such extremes . On this same day , seeing how desperate was Lee 's condition , and anxious to have an end of the now useless strife , he sent him this courteous and generous summons:2 The result of the last week must convince you of the hopelessness of further resistance , on the part of the Army of Northern Virginia , in this struggle . Ifeel that it is so , and regard it as my duty to shift from myself the responsibility of any further effusion of blood , by asking of you the surrender of that portion of the Confederate States army known as the Army of Northern Virginia . This letter was sent at night through Humphreys 's lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not entertaining the opinion you express of the hopelessness of further resistance on the part of the Army of Northern Virginia , I reciprocate your desire to avoid useless effusion of blood , and therefore , before considering your proposition , ask the terms you will offer on condition of its surrender . " The forlorn remnant of the Confederate army stole away in the night , on the desperate chance of finding food at Appomattox and a way of escape to Lynchburg , and at daybreak the hot pursuit was resumed by the Second and Sixth corps . All this day the flight and chase continued , through a portion of Virginia never as yet wasted by the passage of hostile armies . The air was sweet and pure , scented by opening buds and the breath of spring ; the early peach trees were in flower ; the sylvan by-paths were slightly shaded by the pale-green foliage of leafing trees . Through these quiet solitudes the fast-diminishing army of Lee plodded on , in the apathetic obedience which is all there is left to brave men when hope is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grant , inspired to the forgetfulness of pain and fatigue by the stimulus of a prodigious success . Sheridan on the extreme left , by unheardof exertions at last accomplished the important task of placing himself squarely on Lee 's line of retreat . His advance , under Custer , captured , about sunset on the evening of the 8th , Appomattox Station with four trains of provisions , then attacked the rebel force advancing from Farmville , and drove it towards the Court House , taking twenty-five guns and many prisoners . A reconnaissance revealed the startling fact that Lee 's whole army was coming up the road . Though he had nothing but cavalry , Sheridan with undaunted courage resolved to hold the inestimable advantage he had gained , sending a request to Grant to hurry up the required infantry support , saying that if Gibbon and Griffin could get to him that night " the job might be finished in the morning . " He added , with singular prescience , referring to Voi . XXXIX. - 22. the negotiations which had been opened , " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * This was strictly true . When Grant received Lee 's first letter he replied on the morning of the 8th , saying : " Peace being my great desire , there is but one condition I would insist upon ; namely , that the men and officers surrendered shall be disqualified from taking up arms again against the Government of the United States until properly exchanged . I will meet you , or designate officers to meet any officers you may name for the same purpose , at any point agreeable to you , for the purpose of arranging definitely the terms upon which the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia will be received . " But in the course of the day a last hope seemed to have come to Lee that he might yet reach Appomattox in safety and thence make his way to Lynchburg- a hope utterly fallacious , for Stoneman was now on the railroad near Lynchburg . He therefore , while giving orders to his subordinates to press with the utmost energy westward , answered General Grant 's letter in a tone more ingenious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the chance of breaking away . In my note of yesterday he said I did not intend to propose the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia , but to ask the terms of your proposition . To be frank , I do not think the emergency has arisen to call for the surrender of this army ; but as the restoration of peace should be the sole object of all , I desire to know whether your proposals would lead to that end . I can not therefore meet you with a view to surrender the Army of Northern Virginia ; but as far as your proposal may affect the Confederate States forces under my command , I should be pleased to meet you at IOA . M. , to-morrow , on the old stage road to Richmond between the picket lines of the two armies . Grant was not to be entrapped into a futile negotiation for the restoration of peace . He doubtless had in view the President 's peremptory instructions of the 3d of March , forbidding him to entertain any proposition except for the surrender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or conference . He therefore answered General Lee on the morning of the 9th of April with perfect courtesy , but with unmistakable frankness , saying : " I have no authority to treat on the subject of peace . The meeting proposed for bA . M. , tO-day , could lead to no good . I will state , however , General , that I am equally desirous for peace with yourself and the whole North entertains the same feeling . The terms upon which peace can be had are well understood .

Seriously hoping that all our difficulties may be settled without the loss of another life , I subscribe myself , " etc . He dispatched this letter to Lee and then set off to the left , where Sheridan was barring Lee 's last avenue of escape . It appears from General Lee 's report , made four days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night of the 8th of giving up the fight . Heordered Fitz Lee , supported by Gordon , in the morning " to drive the enemy from his front , wheel to the left and cover the passage of the trains , while Longstreet . . . should close up and hold the position . " He expected to find only cavalry on the ground , and thought even his remnant of infantry could break through Sheridan 's horse while he himself was amusing Grant with platonic discussions in the rear . But he received , on arriving at the rendezvous he had suggested , not only Grant 's stem refusal to enter into a political negotiation , but other intelligence which was to him the trump of doom . Ord and Griffin had made an almost incredible march of some thirty miles during the preceding day and night , and had come up at daylight to the post assigned them in support of Sheridan ; and when Fitzhugh Lee and Gordon made their advance in the morning and the National cavalry fell slowly back , in obedience to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formidable force of infantry filling the road , covering the adjacent hills and valley , and barring as with an adamantine wall the further progress of the army of the revolt . The marching of the Confederate army was over forever . The appalling tidings were instantly carried to Lee . He at once sent orders to cease hostilities , and , suddenly brought to a sense of his real situation , sent a note to Grant , asking an interview in accordance with the offer contained " in Grant 's letter of the 8th for the surrender of his army . " Grant had created the emergency calling for such action . As Sheridan was about to charge on the huddled mass of astonished horse and foot in front of him a flag of truce was displayed , and the war was at an end . The Army of Northern Virginia was already captured . " I ye got em , like that ! " cried Sheridan , doubling up his fist , fearful of some ruse or evasion in the white flag . The Army of the Potomac on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south and west , completely encircled the demoralized and crumbled army of Lee . There was not another day 's fighting in them . That morning at three o'clock Gordon 1 The President in his Amnesty Proclamation of December 8 , 1863 , expressly excepted officers above the rank of colonel , all who left seats in Congress to aid the rebellion , and all who resigned commissions in LINCOLN had sent word to Lee that he " had fought his corps to a frazzle , and could do n*othing more unless heavily supported by Longstreet . " Lee and his army were prisoners of war before he and Grant met at Appomattox . The meeting took place at the house of Mr. McLean , in the edge of the village . Lee met Grant at the threshold , and ushered him into a small and barely furnishea parlor where were soon assembled the leading officers of the National army . General Lee was accompanied only by his secretary , Colonel Charles Marshall . A short conversation led up to a request from Lee for the terms on which the surrender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the terms which would be accorded . Lee acceded to them , and Grant wrote the following letter : In accordance with the substance of my letter to you on the 8th inst . I propose to receive the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia on the following terms , to wit : Rolls of all the officers and men to be made in duplicate ; one copy to be given to an officer to be designated by me , the other to be retained by such officer or officers as you may designate . The officers to give their individual paroles not to take up arms against the Government of the United States until properly exchanged ; and each company or regimental commander sign a like parole for the men of their commands . The arms , artillery , and public property to be parked and stacked , and turned over to the officers appointed by me to receive them . This will not embrace the side-arms of the officers , nor their private horses or baggage . This done , each officer and man will be allowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States authorities so long as they observe their paroles and the laws in force where they may reside . General Grant says in his " Memoirs " that up to the moment when he put pen to paper he had not thought of a word that he should write . The terms he had verbally proposed , and which Lee had accepted , were soon put in writing , and there he might have stopped . But as he wrote , a feeling of sympathy for his gallant antagonist gradually came over him , and he added the extremely liberal terms with which his letter closed . The sight of Lee 's sword , an especially fine one , suggested the paragraph allowing officers to retain their side-arms ; and he ended with a phrase which he had evidently not thought of and for which he had no authority , which practically pardoned and amnestied every man in Lee 's army - a thing he had refused to consider the day before , and which had been , expressly forbidden him in President Lincoln 's order of the 3d of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victory , so the army or navy of the United States and afterwards participated in the rebellion . The terms granted at Appomattox practically extended amnesty to many persons in these classes . // deep was the gratitude of the Government and the people to Grant and his heroic army , that his terms were accepted as he wrote them , and his exercise of the Executive prerogative of pardon entirely overlooked . It must be noticed here , however , as a few days later it led the greatest of Grant 's generals into serious error . Lee must have read the memorandum of terms with as much surprise as gratification . He said the permission for officers to retain their side-arms would have a happy effect . He then suggested and gained another important concession - that those of the cavalry and artillery who owned their own horses should be allowed to take them home to put in their crops . Lee wrote a brief reply accepting the terms . He then remarked that his army was in a starving condition , and asked Grant to provide them with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and asked for how many men the rations would be wanted . Lee answered , " About twenty-five thousand , " and orders were at once given to issue them . The number surrendered turned out to be even larger than this . The paroles signed amounted to 28,231 . If we add to this the captures at Five Forks , Petersburg , and Sailor 's Creek , the thousands who deserted the failing cause at every by-road leading to their homes , and filled every wood and thicket between Richmond and Lynchburg , we can see how considerable an army Lee commanded when Grant " started out gunning . " Yet every Confederate writer , speaker , and singer who refers to the surrender says , and will say forever , that Lee surrendered only seven thousand muskets . 5 ' With these brief and simple formalities one of the most momentous transactions of modem times was concluded . The news soon transpired , and the Union gunners prepared to fire a national salute ; but Grant would not permit it . He forbade any rejoicing over a fallen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer . The next day he rode to the Confederate lines to make a visit of farewell to General Lee . Sitting on horseback between the lines , the two heroes of the war held a friendly conversation . Lee considered the war at an end , slavery dead , the national authority restored ; Johnston must now surrender - the sooner the better . Grant urged him to make a public appeal to hasten the return of peace ; but Lee , true to his ideas of subordination to a government which had ceased to exist , said he could not do this without consulting the Confederate President . They parted with courteous good wishes , and Grant , without pausing to look at the city he had taken or the enormous system of works which had so long held him at bay , intent only upon reaping the peaceful results of his colossal victory , and putting an end to the waste and the burden of war , hurried away to Washington to do what he could for this practical and beneficent purpose . He had done an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor for himself ; but neither then nor at any subsequent period of his life was there any sign in his words or his bearing of the least touch of vainglory . The day after Appomattox he was as simple , modest , and unassuming a citizen as he was the day before Sumter . D TELLUS.
