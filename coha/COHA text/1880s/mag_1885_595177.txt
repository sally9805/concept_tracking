CHATTANOOGA . , FTER the fall of Vicksburg I urged ? 71. strongly upon the Government the propriety of a movement against Mobile . General Rosecrans had been at Murfreesboro ' , Tennessee , with a large and well-equipped army from early in the year 1863 , with Bragg confronting him , with a force quite equal to his own at first , considering it was on the defensive . But after the investment of Yicksburg , Bragg 's army was largely depleted to strengthen Johnston , in Mississippi , who was being reinforced to raise the siege . I frequently wrote to General Halleck suggesting that Rosecrans should move against Bragg . By so doing he would either detain the latter 's troops , or lay Chattanooga open to capture . General Halleck strongly approved the suggestion , and finally wrote me that he had repeatedly ordered Rosecrans to advance , but that the latter had constantly failed to comply with the order , and at last , after having held a council of war , replied , in effect , that it was a military maxim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . " If true , the maxim was not applicable in this case . It would be bad to be defeated in two decisive battles fought the same day , but it would not be bad to win them . I , however , was fighting no battle , and the siege of Vicksburg had drawn from Rosecrans 's front so Thany of the enemy that his chances of victory were much greater than they would be if he waited until the siege was over , when these troops could be returned . Rosecrans was ordered to move against the army that was detaching troops to raise the siege . Finally he did move on the 24th of June , but ten days afterward Vicksburg surrendered , and the troops sent from Bragg were free to return . It was at this time that I recommended to the general-in-chief the movement against Mobile . I knew the peril the Army of the Cumberland was in , being depleted continually not only by ordinar* casualties , but also by having to detach troops to hold its constantly extending line over which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as constantly being strengthened . Mobile was important to the enemy , and , in the absence of a threatening force , was guarded by little else than artillery . If threatened by land and from the water at the same time , the prize would fall easily , or troops would have to be sent to its defense . Those troops would necessarily come from Bragg . My judgment was overruled , however , and the troops under my command were dissipated over other parts of the country where it was thought they could render the most service . Four thousand were sent to Banks , at New Orleans ; five thousand to Schofield , to use against Price , in Arkansas ; the Ninth Corps back to East Tennessee ; and finally , in August , the whole of the Thirteenth Corps to Banks . I also sent Ransom 's brigade to Natchez , to occupy that point , and to relieve Banks from guarding any part of the river above what he had guarded before the fall of Port Hudson . Ransom captured a large amount of ammunition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river going east for the rebel armies . At this time the country was full of deserters from Pemberton 's army , and it was reported that many had also left Johnston . These avowed they would never go back to fight against us again . Many whose homes were west of the river went there , and others went North to remain until they could return with security . Soon it was discovered in Washington that Rosecrans was in trouble and required assistance . The emergency was now too immediate to allow us to give this assistance by making an attack in the rear of Bragg upon Mobile . It was therefore necessary to reinforce directly , and troops were sent from every available point . On the *3th of September Halleck telegraphed me to send all available forces to Memphis , and thence east along the Memphis and Charleston railroad to cooperate with Rosecrans . This instruction was repeated two days later , but I did not get even the first until the 23d of the month . As fast as transports could be provided all the troops except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose services up to this time demonstrated his superior fitness for a separate command . I also moved McPherson , with most of the troops still about Vicksburg , eastward , to compel the enemy to keep back a force to meet him . Meanwhile Rosecrans had very skillfully maneuvred Bragg south of the Tennessee River , and through and beyond Chattanooga . If he had stopped and intrenched , and made himself strong there , all would have been right , and the mistake of not moving earlier partially compensated . But he pushed on , with his forces very much scattered , until Bragg 's * Copyright , 1885 , by U. S. Grant . All rights reserved . // troops from Mississippi began to join him. * Then Bragg took the initiative . Rosecrans had to fall back in turn , and was able to get his army together at Chickamauga , some miles south-east of Chattanooga , before the main battle was brought on . The battle was fought on the *9th and 20th of September , and Rosecrans was badly defeated , with a heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wounded , and captured . The corps under Major-General George H. Thomas stood its ground , while Rosecrans , with Crittenden and McCook , returned to Chattanooga . Thomas returned also , but later , and with his troops in good order . Bragg followed and took possession of Missionary Ridge , overlooking Chattanooga . He also occupied Lookout Mountain , west of the town , which Rosecrans had abandoned , and with it his control of the river and river road as far back as Bridgeport . The National troops were now strongly intrenched in Chattanooga Valley , with the Tennessee River behind them , and the enemy occupying cominanding heights to the east and west , with a strong line across the valley , from mountain to mountain , and Chattanooga Creek for a large part of the way in front of their line . On the 29th of September Halleck telegraphed me the above results , and directed all the forces that couldbe spared from my department to be sent to Rosecrans , suggesting that a good commander like Sherman or McPherson should go with the troops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to superintend the movement . Sherman was already on his way and McPherson also was moving east with most of the garrison of Vicksburg long before this dispatch was received . I a1 once sent a staff-officer to Cairo , to communicate , in my name , directly with the Government , and to forward me any and all important dispatches without the delays that had attended the transmission of previous ones . On the 3d of October a dispatch was received at Cairo ordering me to move with my staff and headquarters to that city , and to report from there my arrival . This dispatch reached me on the ioth . I left Vickshurg the same day , reached Cairo on the i6th , and reported my arrival at once . The reply came on the morning of the *7th , directing me to proceed immediately to the Galt House , Louisville , Kentucky , where I would meet an officer of the War Department with my instructions . I left Cairo within an hour after the receipt of this dispatch , going by rail by the way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on was starting out of the depot at Indianapolis , a messenger came running up to stop it , saying the Secretary of War was coming into the station and wanted to see me . I had never met Mr. Stanton up to that time , though we had held frequent conversations over the wires , the year before , when I was in Tennessee . Occasionally , at night , he would order the wires freed from the War Departmentto my headquarters , and we would hold a conversation for an hour or two . On this occasion the Secretary was accompanied by Governor Brough , of Ohio , whom I had never met , though he and my father were old acquaintances . Mr. Stanton dismissed the special train that had brought him to Indianapolis and accompanied me to Louisville . Up to this time no hint had been given me of what was wanted after I left Vicksburg , except the suggestion in one of Halleck 's dispatches that I had better go to Nashville and superintend the operation of the troops sent to relieve Rosecrans . Soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders , saying that I might take my choice of them . The two were identical in all but one particular . Both created the Military Division of the Mississippi , giving me the command , composed of * Bragg was also reinforced by Longstrect , from the Army of Northern Virginia. - EDIToR. // the Departments of the Ohio , the Cumberland and the Tennessee , and all the territory from the Alleghanies to the Mississippi River , north of Banks 's command in the south-west . One order left the department commanders as they were , while the other relieved Rosecrans and assigned Thomas to his place . I accepted thelatter . We reached Louisville after night , and , if I remember rightly , in a cold , drizzling rain . The Secretary of War told me afterwards that he caught a cold on that occasion from which he never expected to recover . He never did recover . A day was spent in Louisville , the Secretary giving me the military news at the capital , and talking about the disappointment at the results of some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all matters of discussion seemed exhausted , and I left the hotel to spend the evening away , both Mrs. Grant and myself having relations li*iing in Louisville . In the course of the evening Mr. Stanton received a dispatch from Mr. C. A. Dana , then in Chattanooga , informing him that unless prevented Rosecrans would retreat , and advising peremptory orders against his doing so . A retreat at that time would have been a terrible disaster . It would not only have been the loss of a most important strategic position to us , but it would have been attended with the loss of all the artillery still left with the Army of the Cumberland , and the annihila tion of that army itself , either by capture or demoralization . All supplies for Rosecrans had to be brought from Nashville . The railroad between this base and the army was in possession of the Government up to Bridgeport , the point at which the road crosses to the south side of the Tennessee River ; but Bragg , holding Lookout and Raccoon mountains west of Chattanooga , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and best wagon roads both south and north of the Tennessee , between Chattancoga and Bridgeport . The distance between these two places is but twenty-six miles by rail ; but owing to this position of Bragg all supplies for Rosecrans had to be hauled by a circuitous route , north of the river , and over a mountainous country , increasing the distance to over sixty miles . This country afforded but little food for his animals , near ten thousand of which had already starved , and none were left to draw a single piece of artillery or even the ambulances to convey the sick . The men had been on half rations of hard bread for a considerable time , with but few other supplies , except beef driven from Nashville across the country . The region along the road became so exhausted of food for the cattle that by the time they reached Chattanooga they were much in the condition of the few animals left alive there , " on the lift . " Indeed , the beef was so poor that the soldiers were in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they linesdeleted // were living on half rations of hard bread and " beef dried on the hoof . " Nothing could be transported but food , and the troops were without sufficient shoes or other clothing suitable for the advancing season . What they had was well worn . The fuel within the Federal lines was exhausted , even to the stumps of trees . There were no teams to draw it from the opposite bank , where it was abundant . The only means for supplying fuel , for some time before my arrival , had been to cut trees from the north bank of the river , at a considerable distance up the stream , form rafts of it , and float it down with the current , effecting a landing on the south side , within our lines , by the use of paddles or poles . It would then be carried on the shoulders of the men to their camps . If a retreat had been ordered at this time it is not probable that any of the army would have reached the railroad as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receipt of Mr. Dana 's dispatch Mr. Stanton sent for me . Finding that I was out , he became nervous and excited , inquiring of every person he met , including guests of the house , whether they knew where I was , and bidding them find me and send me to him at once . About eleven o'clock I returned to the hotel , and on my way , when near the house , every person met was a messenger from the Secretary , apparently partaking of his impatience to see me . I hastened to the room of the Secretary and found him pacing the floor rapidly , in a dressing-gown . Saying that the retreat ftmust be prevented , he showed me the dispatch . I immediately wrote an order assuming command of the Military Division of the Mississippi , and telegraphed it to General Rosecrans . I then telegraphed to him the order from Washington assigning Thomas to the command of the Army of the Cumberland ; and to Thomas that he must hold Chattanooga at all hazards , informing him at the same time that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A prompt reply was received from Thomas , saying , " We will hold the town till we starve . " I appreciated the force of this dispatch later when I witmessed the condition of affairs which prompted it . It looked , indeed , as if but two courses were open : one to starve , the other to surrender , or be captured . On the morning of the 20th of October I started by train with my staff ; and proceeded as far as Nashville . It was not prudent to travel beyond that point at that time by night , so I remained in Nashville until the next morning . Here I met for the first time Andrew Johnson , Military Governor of Tennessee . He delivered a speech of welcome . His composure showed that it was by no means his maiden effort . It was long , and I was in torture while he was delivering it , fearing something would be expected from me in response . I was relieved , however , the l ) eople assembled having apparently heard enough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although trying where there is so much of it , was a great relief to me in this emergency . From Nashville I telegraphed to Burnside , who was then at Knoxville , that important points in his department ought to be fortified so that they could be held with the least number of men ; to Admiral Porter at Cairo , that Sherman 's advance had passed Eastport , Mississippi , and that rations were probably on their way from St. Louis , by boat , for supplying his army , and requesting him to send a gun-boat to convoy them ; to Thomas , suggesting that large parties should be put at work on the wagon road then in use back to Bridgeport . On the morning of the 21st we took the train for the front , reaching Stevenson , Alabama , after dark . Rosecrans was there on his way north . He came into my car , and we held a brief interview in which he described very clearly the situation at Chattanooga , and made some excellent suggestions as to what should be done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . We proceeded to Bridgeport , where we stopped for the night . From here we took horses and made our way by Jasper and over Waldron 's Ridge to Chattanooga . There had been much rain and the roads were almost impassable from mud , knee-deep in places , and from washouts on the mountain-sides . I was on crutches at the time , and had to be carried over places where it was not safe to cross on horseback . The roads were strewn with the debris of broken wagons and the carcasses of thousands of starved mules and horses . At Jasper , some ten or twelve miles from Bridgeport , there was a halt . General 0 . 0 . Howard had his headquarters there . From this point I telegraphed Burnside to make every effort to secure five hundred rounds of ammunition for his artillery and small arms . We stopped for the night at a little hamlet some ten or txvelve miles farther on . The next day we reached Chattanooga , a little before dark . I went directly to General Thomas 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could establish my own . During the evening most of the general officers called in to pay their respects and to talk about the condition of affairs . They pointed out on the maps the line marked with // CHATTANOG GA , NOV. *3,24*2&amp; 1863 . REPRODUCED BY PERMISSION FROM " THE MILITARY HISTORY OF ULYSSRS S. GRANT , " BY GENERAL ADAM BADRAU . ( N. Y. : D. APPLETON &amp; Co. ) a red or blue pencil which Rosecrans had contemplated falling back upon . If any of them had approved the move , they did not say so to me . I found General W. F. Smith occupying the position of chief-of-staff and chief engineer with the Army of the Cumberland . I had known Smith as a cadet at West Point , but had no recollection of having met him after my graduation , in 1843 , up to this time . He explained the situation of the two armies , and the topography of the country so plainly that I thought I could see it without an inspection . I found that he had established a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old engine found in the neighborhood ; and by rafting logs from the north side of the river above had got out the lumber , and completed pontoons and roadway- plank for a second bridge , one flying bridge ' being there already . He was also rapidly getting // tion to this he had far under way a steamer for plying between Chattanooga and Bridgeport whenever we might get possession of the river . This boat consisted of a scow made of the plank sawed out at the mill , housed in , and a stern-wheel attached which was propelled by a second engine taken from some shop or factory . I telegraphed to Washington this Bight , notifying General Halleck of my arrival , and asking to have General Sherman assigned to the command of the Army of the Tennessee , headquarters in the field . The request was at once complied with . The next day , the 24th , I started out to make a personal inspection , taking Thomas and Smith with me , besides most of the members of my personal staff . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving to the north of detached spurs of hills , reached the Tennessee , at Brown 's Ferry , some three miles below Lookout Mountain , unobserved by the enemy . Here we left our horses back from the river and approached the water on foot . There was a picket station of the enemy , on the opposite side , of about twenty men , in full view , and we within easy range . They did not fire upon us , nor seem to be disturbed by our presence . They must have seen that we were all commissioned officers . But I suppose they looked upon the garrison of Chattanooga as prisoners of war , feeding - or starving-themselves , and thought it would be inhuman to kill any of them except in selfdefense . That night I issued orders for opening the *oute to Bridgeport - a cracker line , as the soldiers appropriately termed it . They had been so long on short rations that their first thought was the establishment of a line over which food might reach them . Chattanooga is on the south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due west . It is at the northern end of a valley five or six miles in width through which Chattanooga Creek runs . To the east of the valley is Missionar - Ridge , rising from five to eight hundred feet above the creek , and terminating somewhat abruptly a half mile or more before reaching the Tennessee . On the west of he valley is Lookout Mountain , twenty-two hundred feet above tide-water . Just below the town , the Tennessee makes a turn to the south and runs to the base of Lookout Mountain , leaving no level ground between the mountain and river . The Memphis and Charleston railroad passes under this point , where the mountain stands nearly perpendicular . East of Missionary Ridge flows the South Chickamauga River ; west of Lookout Mountain is Lookout Creek ; and west of that , Raccoon Mountain . LookVOL . XXXI. - i4. 33 out Mountain , at its northern end , rises almost perpendicularly for some distance , then breaks off in a gentle slope of cultivated fields to near the summit , where it ends in a palisade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sloping ground , between the upper and lower palisades , there is a single farm-house , which is reached by a wagon road from the valley east . The intrenched line of the enemy commenced on the north end of Missionary Ridge and extended along the crest for some distance south , thence across Chattanooga valley to Lookout Mountain . Lookout Mountain was also fortified and held by the enemy , who also kept troops in Lookout valley west , and on Raccoon Mountain , with pickets extending down the river so as to command the road on the north bank and render it useless to us . In addition to this there was an intrenched line in Chattanooga valley extending from the river east of the town to Lookout Mountain , to make the investment complete . Besides the fortifications on Missionary Ridge there was a line at the base of the hill , with occasional spurs of rifle-pits half-way up the front . The enemy 's pickets extended out into the valley towards the town , so that the pickets of the two armies could converse . At one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives its name to the valley and town , and from which both sides drew water . The Union lines were shorter than those of the enemy . Thus the enemy , with a vastly superior force , was strongly fortified to the east , south , and west , and commanded the river below . Practically the Army of the Cumberland was besieged . The enemy had stopped , with his cavalry north of the river , the passing of a train loaded with ammunition and medical supplies . The Union army was short of both , not having ammunition enough for a day 's fighting . General Halleck had , long before my coming into this new field , ordered parts of the Eleventh and Twelfth corps , commanded respectively by Generals Howard and Slocum , Hooker in command of the whole , from the Army of the Potomac , to reinforce Rosecrans . It would have been folly to have sent them to Chattanooga to help eat up the few rations left there . They were consequently left on the railroad , where supplies could be brought them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . General W. F. Smith had been so instrumental in preparing for the move which I was now about to make , and so clear in his judgment about the manner of making it , that I deemed it but just to him that he should have command of the troops detailed to execute the design , although he was then acting as a staff-officer , and was not in command of troops . CHA TfL'ANOOGA. // On the 24th of October after my return to Chattanooga , the following details were made : General Hooker , who was now at Bridgeport , was ordered to cross to the south side of the Tennessee and march up by Whiteside 's , and Wauhatchie to Brown 's Ferry . General Palmer , with a division of the Fourteenth Corps , Army of the Cumberland , was ordered to move down the river on the north side , by a back road until opposite Whiteside 's , then cross , and hold the road in Hooker 's rear after he had passed . Four thousand men were at the same time detailed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them , under General Hazen , were to take sixty pontoon-boats and , under cover of night , float by the pickets of the enemy at the north base of Lookout , down to Brown 's Ferry , then land on the south side and capture or drive away the pickets at that point . Smith was to march with the rest of the detail , also under cover of night , by the north bank of the river , to Brown 's Ferry , taking with with him all the material for laying the bridge , as soon as the crossing was secured . On the 26th Hooker crossed the river at Bridgeport and commenced his eastward march . At three o'clock on the morning of the 27th Hazen moved into the stream with his sixty pontoons and eighteen hundred brave and well-equipped men . Smith started enough in advance to be near the river when Hazen should arrive . There are a number of detached spurs of hills north of the river at Chattanooga , back of which is a good road parallel to the stream , sheltered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this road Smith marched . At five o'clock Hazen landed at Brown 's Ferry , surprised the picket-guard and captured most of it . By seven o'clock the whole of Smith 's force was ferried over and in possession of a height commanding the ferry . This was speedily fortified while a detail was laying the pontoon bridge . By ten o'clock the bridge was laid , and our extreme nght , now in Lookout valley , was fortified and connected with the rest of the army . The two bridges over the Tennessee River ,  - -  a flying one at Chattanooga , and the new one at Brown 's Ferry ,  --  with the roftd north of the river , covered from both the fire and the view of the enemy , made the cOnnection complete . Hooker found but slight obstacles in his way , and on the afternoon of the 28th emerged into Lookout valley at Wauhatchie . Howard marched on to Brown 's Ferry , while Geary , who commanded a division in the Twelfth Corps , stopped three miles south . The pickets of the enemy on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and surrendered . The river was now open to us from Lookout valley to Bridgeport . Between Brown 's Ferry and Kelley 's Ferry the Tennessee runs through a narrow gorge in the mountains , which contracts the stream so much as to increase the current beyond the capacity of an ordinary steamer to stem . To get up this rapid , steamers must be cordelled , that is , pulled up by ropes from the shore . But there is no difficulty in navigating the stream from Bridgeport to Kelley 's Ferry . The latter point is only eight miles from Chattanooga , and connected with it by a good wagon-road , which runs through a low pass in the Raccoon Mountains on the south side of the river to Brown 's Ferry , thence on the north side to the bank of the river opposite Chattanooga . There were several steamers at Bridgeport , and abundance of forage , clothing , and provisions . On the way to Chattanooga I had telegraphed back to Nashville for a good supply of vegetables and small rations , which the troops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him from the east a full supply of land transportation . His animals had not been subjected to hard work on bad roads without forage , but were in good condition . In five days from my arrival at Chattanooga the way was open to Bridgeport , and with the aid of steamers and Hooker 's teams , in a week the troops were receiving full rations . It is hard for any one not an eye-witness to realize the relief this brought . The men were soon reclothed as well as fed , an abundance of ammunition was brought up , and a cheerfulness prevailed not before enjoyed in many weeks . Neither officers nor men looked upon themselves any longer as doomed . The weak and languid appearance of the troops , so visible before , disappeared at once . I do not know what the effect was on the other side , but assume it must have been correspondingly depressing . Mr. Davis had visited Bragg but a short time before , and must have perceived our condition to be about as Bragg described it in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " faithfully sustained , insured the enemy 's speedy evacuation of Chattanooga , for want of food and forage . Possessed of the shortest route to his depot and the one by which reinforcements must reach him , we held him at our mercy , and his destruction was only a question of time . " But the dispositions were not " faithfully sustained , " and I doubt not but thousands of men engaged in trying to " sustain " them , now rejoice that they were not . There was no time during the rebellion when I did not think , and often say , that the South was more to be benefited by defeat than the North . The latter had the people , the institutions and the territory to make a great // and prosperous nation . The former was burdened with an institution abhorrent to all civilized peoples not brought up under it , and one which degraded labor , kept it in ignorance , and enervated the governing class . With the outside world at war with this institution , they could not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not skilled , nor allowed to become so . The whites could not toil without becoming degraded , and those who did were denominated " poor white trash . " The system of labor would have soon exhausted the soil and left the people poor . The non-slaveholders would have left the country , and the small slaveholder must have sold out to his more fortunate neighbors . Soon the slaves would have outnumbered the masters , and not being in sympathy with them , would have risen in their might and exterminated them . The war was expensive to the South as well as to the North , both in blood and treasure ; but it was worth all it cost . The enemy was surprised by the movement which secured to us a line of supplies , and appreciated its importance , and hastened to try to recover the line from us . His strength on Lookout Mountain was not equal to Hooker 's command in the valley below . From Missionary Ridge he had to march twice the distance we had from Chattanooga , in order to reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an attack was made on Geary at Wauhatchie , by Longstreet 's corps . When the battle commenced Hooker ordered Howard up from Brown 's Ferry . He had three miles to march to reach Geary . On his way he was 1*ed upon by rebel troops from a foothill to the left of the road , and from which the road was commanded . Howard turned to the left and charged up the hill , and captured it before the enemy had time to intrench , taking many prisoners . Leaving sufficient men to hold this height , he pushed on to reinforce Geary . Before he got up , Geary had been engaged for about three hours , against a vastly superior force . The night was so dark that the men could not distinguish one another except by the light of the flashes of their muskets . In the darkness and uproar Hooker 's teamsters became fright*ed , and deserted their teams . The mules also became frightened , and breaking loose from their fastenings , stampeded directly toWard the enemy . The latter no doubt took this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the morning the battle had entirely ceased , and our " cracker line " was never afterwards disturbed . In securing possession of Lookout valley , Smith lost one man killed , and four or five wounded . The enemy lost most of his pickets at the ferry , captured . In the night engage-35 ment of the 28th-29th Hooker lost four hundred and sixteen killed and wounded . I never knew the loss of the enemy , but our troops buried over one hundred and fifty of his dead , and captured more than a hundred . Having got the Army of the Cumberland in a comfortable position , I now began to look after the remainder of my new command . Burnside was in about as desperate a condition as the Army of the Cumberland had been , only he was not yet besieged . He was a hundred miles from the nearest possible base , Big South Fork of the Cumberland River , and much farther from any railroad we had possession of . The roads back were over mountains , and all supplies along the line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had been starved , and their carcasses lined the road from Cumberland Gap , and far towards Lexington , Kentucky . East Tennessee still furnished supplies of beef , bread , and forage , but it did not supply ammunition , clothing , medical supplies , or small rations , such as coffee , sugar , salt , and rice . As already stated , Sherman had been ordered from Vicksburg to Memphis before my assignment to the command of the Military Division of the Mississippi ; at iVlemphis he was directed by the general-in-chief to organize as large a force as could be spared by Hurlbut , who was in command there , and to move with that and his own corps along the line of the Memphis and Charleston railroad to the relief of Chattanooga . He left Vicksburg on the 27th of September and was in Memphis on the 2d of October . Stopping to organize his new command , he started for Corinth on the *xth . His directions required him to repair the road in his rear in order to bring up supplies . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hostile country . His entire command could not have maintained the road if it had been completed . The bridges had all been destroyed by the enemy and much other damage done ; a hostile community lived along the road ; guerilla bands infested the country , and more or less of the cavalry of the enemy was still in the west . Often Sherman 's work was destroyed as soon as completed , and he only a short distance away . The Memphis and Charleston road strikes the Tennessee River at Eastport , Mississippi . Knowing the difficulty Sherman would have to supply himself from Memphis , I had previously ordered supplies sent from St. Louis on small steamers , to be convoyed by the navy , to meet him at Eastport . These he got . I now ordered him to discontinue his work of repairing roads , and to move on with his whole force to Stevenson , Alabama , without // delay . This order was borne to Sherman by a messenger who paddled down the Tennessee in a canoe , and floated over Muscle Shoals ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this Sherman was notified that the rebels were moving a force towards Cleveland , East Tennessee , and might be going to Nashville , in which event his troops were in the best position to beat them there . Sherman , with his characteristic promptitude , abandpned the work he was at , and pushed on at once . On the 1st of November he crossed the Tennessee at Eastport , and that day was in Florence , Alabama , with the head of column , while his troops were still crossing at Eastport , with Blair bringing up the rear . Sherman 's force made an additional army , with cavalry , artillery , and trains , all to be supplied by the single-track road from Nashville . All indications pointed also to the probable necessity of supplying Burnside 's command , in East Tennessee , twenty-five thousand more , by the same road . A single track could not do this . I gave , therefore , an order to Sherman to halt General G. M. Dodge 's command of eight thousand men at Athens , and subsequently directed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Decatur , north towards Nashville , and to rebuild that road . The road from Nashville to Decatur passes over a broken country , cut up with innumerable streams , many of them of considerable width , and with valleys far below the roadbed . All the bridges over these had been destroyed by the enemy , and the rails taken up and twisted . All the locomotives and ca* not carried off had been destroyed as effectually as they knew how . All bridges and culverts had been destroyed between Nashville and Decatur , and thence to Stevenson , where the Memphis and Charleston and the Nashville and Chattanooga roads unite , The rebuilding of this road would give us two roads as far as Stevenson over which to supply the army . From Bridgeport , a short distance further east , the river supplements the road . General Dodge , besides being a most capable soldier , was an experienced railroad builder . He had no tools to work with but those of the pioneers - axes , picks , and spades . With these he was able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small parties of the enemy . As he had no base of supplies until the road could be completed back to Nashville , the first matter to consider , after protecting his men , was the getting in of food and forage from the surrounding country . He had his men and teams bring in all the grain they could find , or all they needed , and all the cattle for beef , and such other food as could be found . Millers were detailed from the ranks to run the mills along the line of the army ; when these were not near enough to the troops for protection , they were taken down and moved up to the line of the road . Blacksmith shops , with all the iron and steel found in them , were moved up in like manner . Blacksmiths were detailed and set to work making the tools necessary in railroad and bridge building . Axemen were put to work getting out timber for bridges , and cutting fuel for the locomotives when the road was completed ; car-builders were set to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroad building , making tools to work with , and supplying the workmen with food , was all going on at once , and without the aid of a mechanic or laborer except what the command itself furnished . But rails and cars the men could not make without material , and there was not enough rolling stock to keep the road we already had worked to its full capacity . There were no rails except those in use . To supply these deficiences I ordered eight of the ten engines General McPherson had at Vicksburg to be sent to Nashville , and all the cars he had , except ten . I also ordered the troops in West Tennessee to points on the river and the Memphis and Charleston road , and the cars , locomotives , and rails from other railroads to be sent to the same destination . The military manager of railroads also was directed to furnish more rolling stock , and as far as he could , bridge material . General Dodge had the work assigned him finished within forty days after receiving his order . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighty-two , many of them over deep and wide chasms . The length of road repaired was one hundred and two miles . The enemy 's troops , which it was thought were either moving against Burnside , or were going to Nashville , went no farther than Cleveland . Their presence there , however , alarmed the authorities at Washington , and on account of our helpless condition at Chatt anooga , caused me much uneasiness . Dispatches were constantly coming , urging me to do something for Burnside 's relief ; calling attention to the importance of holding East Tennessee ; saying the President was much concerned for the protection of the loyal people in that section , etc. , etc . We had not at Chattanooga animals to pull a single piece of artillery , much less a supply train . Re*nforcements could not help Burnside , because he had neither supplies nor ammunition sufficient for them ; hardly indeed bread and meat for the men he had . There was no relief possible for him , except by expelling the enemy from Missionary Ridge and about Chattanooga. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short time he would be relieved . All of Burnside 's dispatches showed the greatest confidence in his ability to hold his position as long as his ammunition held out . He even suggested the propriety of abandoning the territory he held south and west of Knoxville , so as to draw the enemy farther from his base , and to make it more difficult for them to get back to Chattanooga when the bat*ie should begin . Longstreet had a railroad as far as Loudon ; but fronb there to Knoxville he had to rely on wagon trains . The suggestion , therefore , was a good one , and it was adopted . On the *4th I telegraphed Burnside : " Sherman 's advance has reached Bridgeport . His whole force will be ready to move from there by Tuesday at furthest . If you can hold Longstreet in check until he gets up , or , by skirmishing and falling back , can avoid serious loss to yourself , and gain time , 1 will be able to force the enemy back from here , and place a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former take to the mountainpasses by every available road , to get to his supplies . " Longstreet , for some reason or other , stopped at Loudon until the i3th . That being the terminus of his railroad communications , it is probable he was directed to remain there awaiting orders . He was in a position threat * In the course of the preparation of this paper we asked General Grant , whether the detachment of Longstreet for the attackon Knoxville was not a great mistake on the part of Bragg . He replied in the affirmative ; and when it was further presumed that Bragg doubtless thought his position impregnable , the Victor of Chattanooga answered , with a shrewd look that accented the humor of his words : " Well , it was impregnable. " - EDITOR. * Hooker 's position in Lookout valley was absolutely essential to us so long as Chattanooga was besieged . It was the key to our line for supplying the army . But it was not essential after the enemy was dispersed from our front , or even after the battle for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were designed to get his force past Lookout Mountain and Chattanooga valley , and up to Missionary Ridge . By crossing the north face of Lookout the troops would come into Chattanooga valley , in rear of the line held by the enemy across the valley , and would necessarily force its evacuation . Orders were accordingly given to Hooker to march by this route . But days before the battle began the advantages as well as the disadvantages of this plan of action were all considered . The passage over the mQuntain was a difficult one to make in the face of an enemy . It might consume so much time as to lose us the use of the troops engaged in it at other points where they were more wanted . After reaching Chattanooga valley , the creek of the same name , quite a formidable stream to get an army over , had to be crossed . I was perfectly willing that the enemy should keep Lookout Mountain until we got through with the troops on Missionary Ridge . By marching Hooker to the north side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town , they could be got in position at any named time ; when in this new position they would have Chattanooga Creek behind them ; and the attack on Missionary Ridge would unquestionably have caused the evacuation by the enemy of their line across the valley and on Lookout Mountain . Hooker 's orders were changed accordingly . As explained elsewhere , the original order had to be reverted to because of a flood in the river rendering the bridge at Brown 's Ferry unsafe for the passage of troops at the exact juncture when it was wanted to bring all the troops together against Missionary Ridge . -U . S. G. A bridge was thrown across the South Chickamauga at its mouth and a brigade of cavalry was sent across it . That brigade caused the bridge across the Holston River to be burned by the enemy and thus cut off Longstreet from coming back to Bragg . - EDITOR . VOL . XXXI. - x5. // qwq // effected in full view of the enemy on the top of Lookout Mountain . Once over , the troops soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and would not come to view again , either to watchmen on Lookout or Missionary Ridge , until they emerged between the hills to strike the banks of the river . But when Sherman 's advance reached a point opposite the town of Chattanooga , Howard , who , it will be remembered , had been concealed behind the hills on the north side , took up his line of march to join the troops on the south side . His crossing was in full view both from Missionary Ridge and the top of Lookout , and the enemy , of course , supposed these troops to be Sherman 's , who was thus enabled to get to his assigned position without discovery . On the 20th , when so much was occurring to discourage , rains falling so heavily as to delay the passage of troops over the river at Brown 's Ferry , and threatening the entire breaking of the bridge ; news coming of a battle raging at Knoxville ; of Willcox being threatened by a force from the east ,  --  a letter was received from Bragg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be soi*e non-combatants in Chattanooga , I deem it proper to notify you that prudence would dictate their early withdrawal . " Of course I understood that this was a device intended to deceive ; but I did not know what the intended deception was . On the 22d , however , a deserter came in who informed me that Bragg was leaving our front , and on that day Buckner s division was sent to reinforce Longstreet , at Knoxville , and another division started to follow , but was recalled . The object of Bragg 's letter no doubt was in some way to detain me until Knoxville could be captured , and his troops there be returned to Chattanooga . During the night of the 21st the rest of the pontoon-boats , completed , one hundred and sixteen in all , were carried up and placed in North Chickamauga . The material for the roadway over these was deposited out of view of the enemy within a few hundred yards of the bank of the Tennessee where the north end of the bridge was to rest . Hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Washin*ton on his account , I could no longer defer beginning operations for his relief . I determined therefore to do on the 23d , with the Army of the Cumberland , what had been intended to be done on the 24th . The position occupied by the Army of the Cumberland had been made very strong for defense during the months it had been besieged . The line was about a mile from the town , and extended from Citico Creek , a small stream running near the base of Missionary Ridge and emptying into the Tennessee about two miles below the mouth of the South Chickamauga , on the left , to Chattanooga Creek on the right . All commanding points on the line were well fortified and well equipped . with artillery . The important elevations within the line had all been carefully fortified and supplied with a proper armament . Among the elevations so fortified was one to the east of the town , named Fort Wood . It owed its importance chiefly to the fact that it lay between the town and Missionary Ridge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fort Wood had on it twenty-two pieces of artillery , most of which would reach the nearer points of the enemy 's line . On the morning of the 23d Thomas , according to instructions , moved Granger 's corps of two divisions , Sheridan and T. J. Wood commanding them , to the foot of Fort Wood , and formed them into line as if going on parade ,  --  Sheridan on the right , Wood on the left , extending to or near Citico Creek . Palmer , commanding the Fourteenth Corps , held that part of our line facing south and south-west . He supported Sheridan with one division , Baird 's , while his other division , under Johnson , remained in the trenches , under arms , ready to be moved to any point . Howard 's corps was moved in rear of the center . The picket lines were within a few hundred yards of each other . At two o'clock in the afternoon all were ready to advance . By this time the clouds had lifted so that the enemy could see from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for advance was given by a booming of cannon from Fort Wood and other points on the line . The rebel pickets were soon driven back upon the main guards , which occupied minor and detached heights between the main ridge and our lines . These too were carried before halting , and before the enemy had time to reinforce their advance guards . But it was not without loss on both sides . This movement secured to us a line fully a mile in advance of the one we occupied in the morning , and one the enemy had occupied up to this time . The fortifications were rapidly turned to face the other way . During the following night they were made strong . We lost in this preliminary action about eleven hundred killed and wounded , while the enemy probably lost quite as heavily , including the prisoners that were captured . With the exception of the firing of artillery , kept up from Missionary Ridge and Fort Wood until night closed in , this ended the fighting for the day . The advantage was greatly on our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assured that Burnside could hold out ten days longer I should have rested more easily . But we were doing the best we could for him and the cause . // By the night of the 23d Sherman 's command was in a position to move , though one division , Osterhaus 's , had not yet crossed the river at Brown 's Ferry . The continuous rise in the Tennessee had rendered it impossible to keep the bridge at that point in condition for troops to cross ; but I was determined to move that night , even without this division . Orders were sent to Osterhaus accordingly to report to Hooker , if he could not cross by eight o'clock on the morning of the 24th . Because of the break in the bridge , Hooker 's orders were again changed , but this time only back to those first given to him . General W. F. Smith had been assigned to duty as chief engineer of the military division . To him was given the general direction of moving troops by the boats from North Chickamauga , laying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all the duties pertaining to his office of chief engineer . During the night General Morgan L. Smith 's division was marched to the point where the pontoons were , and the brigade of Giles A. Smith was selected for the delicate duty of manning the boats , and surprising the enemy 's l ) ickets on the south bank of the river . During this night , also , General J. M. Brannan , chief of artillery , moved forty pieces of artillery belonging to the Army of the Cumberland , and placed them on the north side of the river so as to command the ground opposite , to aid in protecting the approach to the point where the south end of the bridge was to rest . He had to use Sherman 's artillery horses for this purpose , Thomas having none . A* two o'clock in the morning , November 24th , Giles A. Smith pushed out from the North Chickamauga with his one hundred and sixteen boats , each loaded with thirty brave and well-armed men . The boats , with their precious freight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention of any one who could convey information to the enemy , until arriving near the mouth of South Chickamauga . Here a few boats were landed , the troops debarked , and a rush was made upon the picket guard known to be at that point . The guard was surprised , and twenty of their number captured . The remainder of the troops effected a landing at the point where the bridge was to *tart , with equally good results . The work of ferrying over Sherman 's command from the north side of the Tennessee was at once commenced , the pontoons being used for that purpose . A steamer was also brought up from the town to assist . The rest of M. L. Smith 's division came first , then the division of J. E. Smith . The troops as they landed were put to work intrenching their position . By daylight the two entire divisions were over , and well covered by the wojks they had built . The work of laying the bridge on which to cross the artillery and cavalry was now begun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steamer and the pontoons , the latter being taken , however , as fast as they were wanted to put in their place in the bridge . By a little past noon the bridge was complete , as well as one over the South Chickamauga , connecting the troops left on that side with their comrades below , and all the infantry and artillery were on the south bank of the Tennessee . Sherman at once formed his troops for assault on Missionary Ridge . By one o'clock he started , with M. L. Smith on his left , keeping nearly the course of Chickamauga River ; J. E. Smith next , to the right and a little in the rear ; then Ewing , still farther to the right , and also a little to the rear of J. E. Smith 's comrnand , in column ready to deploy to the right if an enemy should come from that direction . A good skirmish line preceded each of these columns . Soonthefoot of the hill was reached ; th' skirmishers pushed directly up , followed closely by their supports . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without having sustained much loss . A brigade from each division was now brought up , and artillery was dragged to the top of the hill by hand . The enemy did not seem to have been aware of this movement until the top of the hill was gained . There had been a drizzling rain during the day , and the clouds were so low that Lookout Mountain and the top of Missionary Ridge were obscured from the view of persons in the valley . But now the enemy opened fire upon their assailants , and made several attempts with their skirmishers to drive them away , but without avail . Later in the day a more determined attack was made , hut it too failed , and Sherman was left to fortify what he had gained . Sherman s cavalry took up its line of march soon after the bridge was completed , and by half-past three the whole of it was over both bridges , and on its way to strike the enemy 's communications at Chickamauga station . All of Sherman 's command was now south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was expected of him on the 24th , there was nothing for him to do this day , except to strengthen his position . Howard , however , effected a crossing of Citico Creek and a junction with Sherman , and was directed to report to him . With two or three regiments of his command , he moved in the morning along the banks of the Tennessee and reached the point where the bridge was being laid . He went out on // the bridge as far as it was completed from the south end , and saw Sherman superintending the work from the north side , moving himself south as fast as an additional boat was put in and the roadway put upon it . Howard reported to his new chief across the chasm between them , which was now narrow , and in a fe*v minutes was closed . While these operations were going on to the east of Chattanooga , Hooker was engaged on the west . He had three divisions : Osterhaus 's , of the Fifteenth Corps , Army of the Tennessee ; Geary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Cruft 's , Fourteenth Corps , Army of the Cumberland . Geary was on the right at Wauhatchie , Cruft at the center , and Osterhaus near Brown 's Ferry . These troops were all west of Lookout Creek . The enemy had the east bank of the creek strongly picketed and intrenched , and three brigades of troops in the rear to reinforce them if attacked . These brigades occupied the summit of the mountain . General Carter L. Stevenson was in command of the whole . Why any troops except artillery , with a small infantry guard , were kept on the mountain-top , I do not see . A hundred men could have held the summit  --  a palisade for more than forty feet down - against the assault of any number of men from the position Hooker occupied . The side of Lookout Mountain confronting Hooker 's command was rugged , heavily timbered , and full of chasms , making it difficult to advance with troops , even in the absence of an opposing force . Farther up the ground becomes more even and level , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slope is much more gradual , and a good wagon-road , zigzagging up it , connects the town of Chattanooga with the summit . Early in the morning of the 24th Hooker moved Geary 's division , supported by a brigade of Cruft 's , up Lookout Creek to effect a crossing . The remainder of Cruft 's division was to seize the bridge over the creek , near the crossing of the railroad . Osterhaus was to move up to the bridge and cross it . The bridge was seized by Grose 's brigade after a slight skirmish with the picket guarding it . This attracted the enemy so that Geary 's movement farther up was not observed . A heavy mist obscured him from the view of the troops on the top of the mountain . He crossed the creek almost unobserved , and captured the picket of over forty men on guard near by . He then commenced ascending the mountain directly in his front . By this time the enemy was seen coming down from their camp on the mountain slope , and filing into their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eleven o'clock the bridge was complete ; Osterhaus was up ; and after some sharp skirmishing the enemy was driven away , with considerable loss in killed and captured . While the operations at the bridge were progressing , Geary was pushing up the hill , over great obstacles , resisted by the enemy directly in his front , and in face of the guns on top of the mountain . The enemy , seeing their left flank and rear menaced , gave way and were followed by Cruft and Osterhaus . Soon these were up abreast of Geary , and th' whole command pushed up the hill , driving the enemy in advance . By noon Geary had gained the open ground on the north slope of the mountain with his right close up to the base of the upper palisade , but there were strong fortifications in his front . The rest of the command coming up , a line was formed from the base of the upper palisade to the mouth of Chattanooga Creek . Thomas and I were in person on the top of Orchard Knob . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was in full view , extending from the Tennessee River , where Sherman had crossed , up Chickamauga River to the base of Missionary Ridge , over the top of the north end of the ridge , to Chattanooga valley ; then along parallel to the ridge a mile or more ; across the valley to the mouth of Chattanooga Creek ; thence up the slope of Lookout Mountain to the foot of the upper palisade . The day was hazy , so that Hooker 's operations were not visible to us except at moments when the clouds would rise . But the sound of his artillery and musketry was heard incessantly . The enemy on his front was partially fortified , but was soon driven out of his works . At two o'clock the clouds , which had so obscured the top of Lookout all day as to hide whatever was going on from the view of those below , settled down and made it so dark where Hooker was as to stop operations for the time . At four o'clock Hooker reported his position as impregnable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a brigade of troops was sent from Chattanooga to reimforce him . These troops had to cross Chattanooga Creek , and met with some opposition , but soon oVercame it , and by night the commander , General Carlin , reported to Hooker and was assigned to his left . I now telegraphed to Washington : " The fight to-day progressed favorably . Sherman carried the end of Missionary Ridge , and his right is now at the tunnel , and his left at Chickamauga Creek . Troops from Lookout valley carried the point of the mountain , and now held the eastern slope and point , high up . Hooper reports two // thousand prisoners taken , beside which , a small number have fallen into our hands , from Missionary Ridge . " The next day the President replied : " Your dispatches as to fighting on Monday and Tuesday are here . Well done . Many thanks to all . Remember Burnside . " And Halleck also telegraphed : " I congratulate you on the success thus far of your plans . I fear that Burnside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove fatal . I know you will do all in your power to relieve him . " The division of Jefferson C. Davis , Army of the Cumberland , had been sent to the North Chickamauga to guard the pontoons as they were deposited in the river , and to prevent all ingress or egress by citizens . On the night of the 24th his division , having crossed with Sherman , occupied our extreme left , from the upper bridge over the plain to the north base of Missionary Ridge . Firing continued to a late hour in the night , but it was not connected with an assault at any point . At twelve o'clock at night , when all was quiet , I began to give orders for the next day , and sent a dispatch to Willcox to encourage Burnside . Sherman was directed to attack at daylight ; Hooker was ordered to move at the same hour , and endeavor to intercept the enemy 's retreat , if he still remained ; if he had gone , then to move directly to Rossville and operate against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thomas was not to move until Hooker had reached Missionary Ridge . As I was with him on Orchard Knob he would not move without further orders S from me . The morning of the 25th opened clear and bright , and the whole field was in full view from the top of Orchard Knob . It remained so all day . Bragg 's headquarters were in full view , and officers - presumably staff-officers - could be seen coming and going constantly . The point of ground which Sherman had carried on the 24th was almost disconnected from the main ridge occupied by the enemy . A low pass , over which there is a wagon-road crossing the hill , and near which there is a railroad tunnel , intervenes b*tween the two hills . The problem now was to get to the latter . The enemy was fortified on the point , and back farther , wher&amp; the ground was still higher , was a second fortification commanding the first . Sherman was out as soon as it was light enough to see , and by sunrise his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already gained . Morgan L. Smith moved along the east base of Missionary Ridge ; Loomis along the west base , supported by two brigades of John E. Smith 's division ; and Gorse with his brigade was between the two , moving directly towards the hill to be capture&amp; The ridge is steep and heavily wooded on the east side , where M. L. Smith 's troops were advancing , but cleared and with a more gentle slope on the west side . The troops advanced rapidly and carried the extreme end of the rebel work . Morgan L. Smith advanced to a point which cut the enemy off from the railroad bridge , and the means of bringing up supplies by rail from Chickamauga station , where the main depot was located . The enemy made brave and strenuous efforts to drive our troops from the position we had gained , but without success . The contest lasted for two hours . Gorse , a brave and efficient commander , was badly wounded in this assault . Sherman now threatened both Bragg 's flank and his stores , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his line to strengthen his right . From the position I occupied I could see column after column of Bragg 's forces moving against Sherman ; every rebel gun that could be brought to bear upon the Union forces was concentrated upon him . J. E. Smith , with two brigades , charged up the west side of the ridge to the support of Gorse 's command , over open ground , and in the face of a heavy fire of both artillery and musketry , and reached the very parapet of the enemy . He lay here for a time , but the enemy coming with a heavy force upon his right flank , he was compelled to fall back , followed by the foe . A few hundred yards brought Smith 's troops into a wood , where they were speedily re-formed ; when they charged and drove the attacking party back to his intrenchments . Seeing the advance , repulse , and second advance of J. E. Smith from the position I occupied , I directed Thomas to send a division to ret*nforce him . One was sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had to march a considerable distance , directly under the eyes of the enemy , to reach its position. * Bragg at once commenced massing in the same direction . This was what I wanted . But it had now got to be late in the afternoon , and I had expected before this to see Hooker crossing the ridge in the neighborhood of Rossville , and compelling Bragg to mass in that direction also . The enemy had evacuated Lookout Moun * Concerning this movement General Baird writes as follows : " I was ordered to report to General Sherman to reinforce his command . I marched the distance about two miles to the rear of his position , and sent an officer to report to him , hut I immediately received orders to return and form on the left of the line which was to assault Missionary Ridge . I reached there , got my troops in position , just as the gun was fired directing the assault . A. BAIRD , " Brevet Major-General U. S. A. " - EDITOR . // tam during the night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he burned the bridges over Chattanooga Creek , and did all he could to obstruct the roads behind him . Hooker was off bright and early , with no obstructions in his front but distance and the destruction above named . He was detained four hours in crossing Chattanooga Creek ; and thus was lost the immediate advantages expected from his forces . His reaching Bragg 's flank* and extending across it was to be the signal for Thomas 's assault of the ridge , but Sherman 's condition was getting so critical that the assault for his relief could not be delayed any longer . Sheridan 's and Wood 's divisions had been lying under arms from early in the morning , ready to move the instant the signal was given . I directed Thomas to order the charge at once . I watched eagerly to see the effect , and became impatient , at last , that there was no indication of any charge being made . The center of the line which was to make the charge was near where Thomas and I stood together , but concealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas to inquire what caused the delay , I was surprised to see General Thomas J. Wood , one of the division commanders who was to make the charge , standing talking to him . I spoke to General Wood , asking him why he had not charged , as ordered an hour before . He replied very promptly that this was the first he had heard of it , but that he had been ready all day to move at a moment 's notice . I told him to make the charge at once . He was off.in a moment ; and in an incredibly short time loud cheering was heard , and he and Sheridan were driving the enemy 's advance before them toward Missionary Ridge . The enemy was strongly intrenched on the crest of the ridge in front of us , and had a second line half-way down , and another at the base . Our men drove the troops in front of the lower line of rifle-pits so rapidly , and followed them so closely , that rebel and Union troops went over the first line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were captured and sent to the rear under the fire of their own friends higher up the hill . Those that were not captured retreated , and were pursued . The retreating hordes being I ? etween friends and pursuers , made the fire of the enemy high , to avoid killing their own men . In fact , on that occasion the Union soldier nearest the enemy was in the safest position . Without awaiting further orders or stopping to re-form , on our troops went to the second line of works ; over that , and on for the crest , thus effectually carrying out my orders of the *8th for the battle and the 24th for this charge . I watched their progress with intense interest . The fire along the rebel line was terrific . Cannon and musket balls filled the air ; but the damage done was in small proportion to the ammunition used . The pursuit continued until the crest was reached , and soon our men were seen climbing over the Confederate barrier at different points in front of both Sheridan 's and Wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his line was precipitate , and the panic so great that Bragg and his officers lost all control over their men . Many were captured and thousands threw away their arms in their retreat . Sheridan pushed forward until he reached the Chickamauga River at a point above where the enemy crossed . He met some resistance from troops occupying a second hill in rear of Missionary Ridge , probably to cover the retreat of the main body , and of the artillery and trains . It was now getting dark , but Sheridan , without halting on that account , pushed his men forward up this second hill slowly , and without attracting the attention of the men placed to defend it , while he detached to the right and left to surround the position . The enemy discovered the movement before these dispositions were complete , and beat a hasty retreat , leaving artillery , wagon trains , and many prisoners in our hands . To Sheridan 's prompt movement the Army of the Cumberland and the nation are indebted for the bulk of the capture of prisoners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his prompt pursuit , so much in this way would not have been accomplished . While the advance up Missionary Ridge was going forward , General Thomas , with his staff General Gordon Granger , commander of the corps making the assault , and myself and staW occupied Orchard Knob , from which the entire field could be observed . rhe moment the troops were seen going over the last line of rebel defenses , I ordered Granger to join his command , and mounting my horse I rode to the front . General Thomas left about the same time . Sheridan , on the extreme right , was already in pursuit of the enemy east of the ridge . Wood , who commanded the division to the left of Sheridan , accompanied his men on horseback , but did not join Sheridan in the pursuit . To the left , in Baird 's front , where Bragg 's troops had massed against Sherman , the resistance was more stubborn , and the contest lasted longer . I ordered Granger to follow the enemy with Wood 's division , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a roar of musketry , in the direction the enemy had taken , that by the time I could stop the firing the enemy had got well out of the way . The enemy confronting // Sherman , now seeing everything to their left giving away , fled also . Sherman , however , was not aware of the extent of our success until after nightfall , when he received orders to pursue at daylight in the morning . Hooker , as stated , was detained at Chattanooga Creek by the destruction of the bridges at that point . He got his troops over , with the exception of the artillery , by fording the stream , at a little after three o'clock : Leaving his artillery to follow when the bridges should be completed , he pushed on with the remainder of his command . At Rossville he came upon the flank of a division of the enemy , which soon commenced a retreat along the ridge . This threw them on Palmer . They could make but little resistance in the position they were caught in , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , were captured . Hooker 's position during the night of the 25th was near Rossville , extending east of the ridge . Palmer was on his left , on the road to Graysville . During the night I telegraphed to Wilicox that Bragg had been defeated , and that immediate relief would be sent to Burnside if he could hold out ; to Halleck I sent an announcement of our victory , and informed him that forces would be sent up the valley to relieve Burnside . Before the battle of Chattanooga opened I had taken measures for the relief of Burnside the moment the way should be clear . Thomas was directed to have the little steamer that had been built at Chattanooga loaded to its capacity with rations and ammunition . Gr*nger 's corps was to move by the south bank of the Tennessee River to the mouth of the Holston , and up that to Knoxville , accompanied by the boat . In addition to the supplies transported by boat , the men were to carry forty rounds of ammunition in their cartridge-boxes , and four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chattanooga troops from the Army of the Potomac , from the Army of the Tennessee , and from the Army of the Cumberland participated . In fact the accidents growing out of the heavy rains and the sudden rise in the Tennessee River so mingled the troops that the organizations were not kept together under their respective commanders during the battle . Hooker , on the right , had Geary 's division of the Army of the Potomac ; Osterhaus 's , of the Army of the Tennessee ; and Cruft 's , of the Army of the Cumberland . Sherman had three divisions of his own army , Howard 's corps , from the Army of the Potomac , and Jeff . C. Davis 's division of the Army of the Cumberland . There was no jealousy , hardly rivalry . Indeed I doubt whether , officers or men took any note at the time nf this intermingling of commands . All saw a defiant foe surrounding them , and took it for granted that every move was intended to dislodge him , and it made no difference where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victory at Chattanooga was won against great odds , considering the advantage the enemy had of position ; and was accomplished more easily than was expected by reason of Bragg 's making several grave mistakes ,  - -  first , in sending away his ablest corps commander , with over twenty thousand troops ; second , in sending away a division of troops on the eve of battle ; third , in placing so much of a force on the plain in front of his impregnable position . It was known that Mr. Davis had visited Bragg on Missionary Ridge , a short time before my reaching Chattanooga . It was reported and believed that he had come out to reconcile a serious difference between Bragg and Longstreet , and finding this difficult to do planned the campaign against Knoxville , to be conducted by the latter general . I had known both Bragg and Longstreet before the war , the latter very well . We had been three years at West Point together , and , after my graduation , for a time in the same regiment . Then we served together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and met him occasionally subsequently . I could well understand how there might be an irreconcilable difference between them . Bragg was a remarkably intelligent and well-informed man , professionally and otherwise . He was also thoroughly upright . But he was possessed of an irascible temper , and was naturally disputatious . A man of the highest moral character and the most correct habits , yet in the old army he was in frequent trouble . As a subordinate he was always on the lookout to catch his commanding officer infringing upon his prerogatives ; as a post commander he was equally vigilant to detect the slightest infringement of the most trivial order . I have heard in the old army an anecdote told characteristic of Bragg . On one occasion , when stationed at a post of several companies , commanded by a field-officer , he was himself commanding one of the companies and at the same time acting post quartermaster and commissary . He was a first lieutenant at the time ; but his captain was detached on other duty . As commander of the company he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As quartermaster he declined to fill the requisition , and indorsed on the back of it his reason for so doing . As company commander he responded to this , // but what he was entitled to , and that it was the duty of the quartermasterto fill it . The quartermaster still persisted that he was right . In this condition of affairs Bragg referred the whole matter to the commanding officer . The latter , when he saw the nature of the matter referred , exclaimed : " My God , Mr. Bragg , you have quarreled with every officer in the army , and now you are quarreling with yourself . " Longstreet was an entirely different man . He was brave , honest , intelligent , a very capable soldier , subordinate to his superiors , just and kind to his subordinates , but jealous of his own rights , and with the courage to maintain them . He was never on the lookout to detect a slight , but saw one as quickly as anybody when intentionally given . It may be that Longstreet was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Davis had an exalted opinion of his own military genius , and thought he saw a chance of " killing two birds with one stone . " On several occasions during the war he came to the relief of the Union army by means of his superior military genzus . I speak advisedly when I say Mr. Davis prided himself on his military capacity . Hc says so himself virtually , in his answer to the notice of his nomination to the Confederate Presidency . Some of his generals have said so in their writings since the downfall of the Confederacy . Whatever the cause or whoever is to blame , grave mistakes were made at Chattanooga , which enabled us , with the undaunted courage of the troops engaged , to gain a great victory , *inder the most trying circumstances presented during the war , much more easily than could otherwise have been attained . If Chattanooga had been captured , East Tennessee would have followed without a struggle . It would have been a victory to have got the army away from Chattanooga safely . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ besieging army . In this battle the Union army numbered in 45 round figures about sixty thousand men ; we lost a little over seven hundred killed , and four thousand eight hundred and fifty wounded and missing . The rebel loss was much greater in the aggregate , as we captured , and sent North to be rationed there , over six thousand one hundred prisoners . Forty pieces of artillery , over seven thousand stand of small arms , and many caissons , artillery wagons , and baggage wagons fell into our hands . The probabilities are that our loss in killed was the heavier , as we were the attacking party . The enemy reported his loss in killed at three hundred and sixty-one ; but as he reported his missing at four thousand one hundred and forty-six , while we held over six thousand of them as prisoners , and there must have been hundreds , if not thousands , who deserted , but little reliance can be placed in this report . There was certainly great dissatisfaction with Bragg , on the part of the soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disposition to get away if they could . Then , too , Chattanooga following in the same half-year with Gettysburg in the East , and Vicksburg in the West , there was much the same feeling in the South at this time that there had been in the North the fall and winter before . If the same license had been allowed the people and the press in the South that was allowed in the North , Chattanooga would probably have been the last battle fought for the preservation of the Union . Bragg 's army now being in full retreat , the relief of Burnside 's position at Knoxville was a matter for immediate consideration . Sherman marched with a portion of the Army of the Tennessee , and one corps of the Army of the Cumberland , towards Knoxville ; but his approach caused Longstreet to abandon the siege long before these troops reached their destination . Knoxville was now relieved ; the anxiety of the President was relieved , and the loyal portion of the North rejoiced over the double victory : the raising of the siege of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
