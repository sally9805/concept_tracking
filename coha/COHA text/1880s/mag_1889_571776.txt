ARTICLE 111. - THE COMMONPLACE IN FICTION . No fact strikes more often or more keenly the observer of modern fiction than its tendency toward the commonplace . Both authorship and criticism abound in the signs of its steadily increasing influence . Even so great a lover of marvel as Sir Walter Scott professes to make his exploits and wonders subsidiary to the delineation of manners and customs , and the same feeling has been more or less handed down to later romance . Macaulay , in his essay on Madame d'Arblay , censures her excessive use of oddities , and notes with favor the comparatively every-day types from whom Miss Austen drew her more delicate portraits . George Eliot began her literary career , in her Scenes from Clerical Life , by invoking the interest and sympathy of her readers for the great mass of common people whose joys and sorrows make up everywhere the bulk of life . With courage augmented by success she repeated and emphasized this protest in Adam Bede . In this country Mr. Howelis has based much of his fiction and criticism on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commonplace is just that light , impalpable , aerial essence which they 've never got into their confounded books yet . " " The novelist , " he goes on , " who could interpret the common feelings of common people would have the answer to the riddle of the painful earth ' on his tongue . " The Russian novel , meanwhile , has been giving actuality to ideas which on English and American soil were still largely theoretic . In Count Tolstof 's writings the commonplace is not merely powerful ; it is dominant , and its complete supremacy produces a change from the older fiction which amounts almost to revolution . He describes a common thunder storm in the same spirit that another man would describe a meteoric shower . He paints the routine of life as exactly as others do its crises , He approaches the common influences of his own age and nation , such as , for example , the hunt , the theatre , the ball , in the same temper that other men approach the corresponding influences of foreign nations and // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for treatment grounds its claim for respect on the share which it has in the universal life of man . The commonplace , in his hands , is no longer a theory which the world can afford to slight or smile at ; it is a reality , whose claim to the consideration and judgment of mankind , like that of ali realities , is peremptory and undisputed . When one first meets this idea , one is inclined to think it at war with human nature . It is certainly so far at war with the past that fiction in accepting it disowns and denies the feelings from which its own origin is derived . Under whatever name it has disguised itself , whether as the supernatural , the marvelous , the odd , the rare , or the eminent , it has always been the exceptional , that which violates the ordinary structnre of things or reverses the normal course of events , which has delighted and allured mankind . The Middle Ages , among whose narrations we must grope to find the roots of our modern fiction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eager faces that bent their dilated eyes on the monk or palmer rehearsing his saintly legend prized his narrative only for the marvels it contained . The squires and yeomen who left the wine-glass half drained and the shield half burnished to throng the hall where the wandering harper sang the deeds of chivalry , were moved by no higher feeling than a love of the marvelous . It was the same in the simpler pursuits of life . The host of the wayside inn , delaying with yet one more hurried question the already mounted traveler at his door , craved from him only the rarities which had marked his journey . These good people have transmitted to their modern descendants not a little of their own way of thinking . If in our times the passion is not so great , yet the devices for its gratification have so multiplied as to render it even more conspicuous . The immense majority of the fictions which are poured out from our teeming presses are written , published , and read for no other reason than their capacity to gratify this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its universal ascendancy . The aim of most conversation , as of most letterwriting , is to sift out of the great mass of things the few rarities which have brightened their monotony . The newsboy // sells his journals , the conjurer draws his crowd , the theatrical manager fills his house , by adroit appeals to this master-passion . The cheap museums cater to its grosser forms . Anything that is abnormal , that violates ordinary laws , that shows us nature , as it were , standing on her head , is eagerly caught up and turned into an agency for feeding the avarice of the few and the curiosity of the many . Culture itself is not free from this tendency . It numbers among its unconscious subjects even those men whose intelligence has taught them to find in the commonplace the true source of values . The newspaper which distracts our minds from our morning coffee records , not the regular order of daily activities , but the inversions by which it is broken ; and the books among which we divide our evening leisure are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the face of this feeling so manifold in its aspects and so despotic in sway , comes the quiet assertion of recent thinkers that the commonplace is the great subject for the artist 's contemplation and portrayal . This counter-current in modern life has not flowed exclusively from any one source ; but nothing has contributed more to its formation than the development of science . The direct result of scientific teaching in limiting credulity has done something toward this end ; the contagion of its spirit has done even more . The stronghold of the marvelous has always been the supernatural . No force has ever so mastered the imaginations of men as that which professes to emanate from the unseen world . The great mass of superstitions which thus arose yielded to the new spirit of inquiry . The saintly legend , the ghost story , the fairy tale , the imputations of witchcraft , all disappeared before the same dispersing touch . The old fancy which made the elfin ring vanish at the approach of daybreak was only the exquisite symbol of the host of superstitions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed at first destined to narrow and to despoil . It took away from our ancestors that fabulous world which was to them no less actual a possession than their cattle or their acres ; it fenced in the imagination , and shut up life within the bare round of daily trivialities . Yet out of these very commonplaces , within which it confined the roving fancy of earlier times , science has evoked // new wonders which take rank with those which it supplanted . This is so undeniable that we involuntarily borrow the old terms of magic and enchantment to describe its achievements , and our poets call its revelations fairy tales . It is not so much the greatness of these wonders , however , as their source to which we now wish to point attention . It has been from common surroundings , from the objects of daily contact and vision , from those things which it might have been expected man 's senses would long ago have drained of all interest , that science has drawn its marvels . The rock , the water , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been investigated and forced to yield up its store of prodigies . The operations of nature have afforded the same results as her materials . The ordinary process has been raised into the exalted place formerly held by the anomaly or the catastrophe ; and science , as if resolute to give back to the world all it had taken away , has even in large measure atoned for the iuroads it made on religion , by revealing to us the same divine majesty in the fulfillment of law which our ancestors found in its abrogation . The logical step by which the new tendency passed into fiction was easy . If common objects and forces reward investigation with such splendid results , why not also common feelings and actions ? The change in the aim of fiction , however , sprang not so much from direct inference as from the great revolution in the general mind of which the scientific movement was the earliest and most brilliant outcome . There is a certain period in the lives of men , as in the history of nations , in which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large part of that interest and regard which formerly flowed to their opposites . The commonplace is that which recurs often in space or time , and the man of culture can not help but regard the endless repetition of this or that particular feature throughout the universe as a sort of stress or emphasis laid on it by nature in order to draw to it his earnest and prolonged attention . That which occurs everywhere and always must have occupied no small place in the intelligence that created the world , and deserves for that reason alone no light regard from the contemplating intelligence of man . Men feel that mere extent confers a certain dignity . " A patch of sand , " says Mr. Lowell , // " is unpleasing ; a desert has all the awe of ocean . " An incident which , viewed as the single act of an individual , excites little interest , angments in worth , if looked at as the habit of a lifetime , and even rises almost into impressiveness when we regard it as the custom of an age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin to feel its influence in a gradual decline of our love for rarities . We learn to think , at length , that the anomalies or pranks of nature bear the same relation to the regular and orderly arrangement of things that the levities of a great mind bear to its serious and solemn utterances . We cease to care for eccentricities , and pass by without a glance the tent that exhibits the two-headed woman . An opposite feeling slowly asserts itself , and makes us disdain the interest which we once took , or perhaps in our backsliding moments still take , in things which are simply monstrosities . As the regularity of law becomes more and more pleasing to us , we begin to feel toward all deviations from its symmetry and evenness the same repulsion that we have toward an object placed askew or awry . It is a feeling like this which , having already achieved so much in science , is now extending its supremacy over the domain of fiction . The scientific spirit has been much aided in the accomplishment of its task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit of democracy . The world of ideas is at length feeling the force of that mighty impulse which , under the name of republicanism , has already re-fashioned the world of action . We have transferred to the common man the functions which formerly belonged to the prince ; we are just beginning to transfer to average humanity the interest and reverence which once flowed to the philosopher and the saint . A nobler idea , an idea which makes great men merely the employees of mankind , is gradually replacing the old feeling which made common men as much appendages to the hero as the tassels on his shield , and which afterwards , in a more refined form , centred all values in intellectual and moral pre-eminence . The average man , according to the new gospel , is the heart of things . All things besides are only his court and retinue , and even fiction herself is obliged to leave reluctantly her gods and heroes and to follow in his train . The very neglect with // which all ancient rhymers and story-tellers treat the common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delicate chivalry in lofty natures . The highest claim which anything can have on noble minds is the claim of being neglected and despised . The true loyalist bends a more reverent knee to his deposed and exiled lord than to the same prince encompassed by regal splendors ; the true lover Gf mankind honors it more in the bareness of plain average humanity than when clothed in the rich apparel of striking talents and virtues . We have an interesting confirmation of the truth of this explanation in the fact that an exactly similar process has been working itself out in another great department of human thought . History has undergone the same metamorphosis that is now transforming fiction . The ancient chronicle was as obsequious to eminence as the ancient romance . The hero and the exploit embraced all that was worthy in character or memorable in action . The modern tendency has here as everywhere dethroned the lord and set up the people ; history has become a record of the life of the masses . Common men , their labors , their sufferings , their feelings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern historian 's interest . No one disputes the benefit of this change . If something has been lost , if history has doffed its court livery , if it no longer spangles its pages with those splendid incidents which gave medieval narrative the glitter of a feudal pageant , it has on the other hand gained in moral dignity to a degree that is simply immeasurable . We dwell on this point on account of the singularly close analogy which links it to the processes now going on in fiction . In both the same love of marvel , originally absolute in its sway , has been slowly undermined by the great influences of modern life , and has yielded its place to its great rival , the love of the commonplace . It is the time-honored policy of conquerors to enlist in their own service the agencies of their vanquished opponents . It was , therefore , only natural that the spirit of science and the spirit of democracy , having subdued the old love of marvel , should appropriate and turn to their own uses its two leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciated the nobility of this transformation , and has noted its close accord with the nobler // tendencies of the age , is apt to conclude that he has found in this simple quality of commonness , or universality , a test by which to determine the artistic worth of things . But no sooner has he reached this haven of certainty than he begins to be perplexed by misgivings . Let us suppose for the moment universality to be the standard by which we decide the fitness of subjects for artistic delineation . What occurs , then , on an average , once every year will have a certain value , what happens every month or every week will be worth more ; and the completion of this logical process will at length concentrate the highest value on such simple acts as dining , dressing , or walking , which recur every day or even every few hours . Our novelists of the new school paint weddings and funerals rather than elopements or earthquakes , on the ground that the laP ter events are mere breaks and interruptions in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts ; but would not a strict fidelity to their own principles oblige them to place the daily details of life above either , since these by their regular recurrence make up a round of pursuits in relation to which even weddings and funerals must be looked on as mere breaks and anomalies ? Then , again , how are we to deal with undoubted excellence when it happens to be rare ? Must we really prefer a common brook to Niagara on the ground that every hillside can duplicate the one , while the whole girth of the planet can not furnish a parallel to the other ? One does not ask himself many questions of this kind before he sees that he can not make universality the supreme test of excellence , its part in such cases is to influence , not to control , the judgment . There are other qualities possessed by *objects which not only give equal pleasure , but , what is of far more importance command equal homage . Even when men loved rarity most , they loved beauty also ; and this latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passion for anomalies is slowly crmnbling away . That rarity in itself has ceased to attract will not prevent rare objects from being highiy attractive by virtue of other and nobler qualities which they possess . If universality can lend dignity to what is plain , beauty certainly can do as much for what is unusual . An artist , therefore , can not settle the capabilities of any new // matter by asking merely how common it is ; the claims of beauty , of grandeur of intellectual and moral excellence , must be recognized in the final judgment which establishes its worth . The commonplace does not enter into modern life as a sovereign , but as one of a group of influences whose combined voice must govern the artist 's selection of materials . But even after this very large admission the perplexities of the inquirer are not over . We are to paint the commonplace . But the commonplace or , in other words , that which is always recurring , is unluckily the thing with which men are most familiar . Does our new principle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world what it already knows ? It is evident that no theory could endure the strain of supporting such an inference as this . An author who tells people what they already know is like the donor who presents them with what they already own ; he not only fails to please , but he insults . To interpret the theory in this way , however , is altogether to misunderstand it . The fitness of the term commonplace to describe the new idea lies , not in the fact that it teaches familiar truths , but that it teaches new truths about familiar subjects . The world 's relation to these commonplace scenes to the study of which it is now returning is much like that of a man to a book which he has once casually read and to which he is afterwards recalled by an unexpected revival of interest , He wishes to find out , not the obvious truths which he already knows , but the delicate points which escaped his former careless perusal . Every book on science which treats of common objects like rocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge on these points , and confines its teaching to those truths which elude common observation . Every work of fiction which aims to impart truth about common scenes or incidents must recognize and avoid that large tract of information on these points which is already covered by the teaching of ordinary experience . If any man imagines that the new doctrine supersedes genius , that it opens the door of literary success to every one who carries a note-book and pencil , he misunderstands both the theory and human nature . To say that it is as difficult to find novelty and interest beneath the surface , as beyond the confines , // of the commonplace is to say very little . It is much easier to tell a man something about Arabia which will interest him than to tell him something about his own village which will have the same effect . Every adventurer in this new field of fiction is exposed to the constant peril of becoming trite and wearisome . Even Tolstoi 's genius did not exempt him from this danger . In the throng of facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often failed to discriminate between those which were the common property of the race and those which were peculiar to his own rare insight . The result has cost his readers many weary hours . Our theory has been considerably narrowed by reservations ; but , while admitting the rights of beauty and all its kindred qualities , while acknowledging that the modern novelist no less than his forerunners must respect the reluctance of men to hear stale truths , we still believe that this tendency toward the commonplace involves one of those great and noble principles which both measure and stimulate the progress of the age . We also believe that the real usefulness of the theory can be insured only through a broad and generous interpretation of its precepts . Its judicious application will alter , we think , rather the spirit of treatment than the subjects treated . For example , we do not believe that the most sincere disciple of the commonplace can afford to forego the study and representation of rare events . His very devotion to general traits will often demand the investigation of particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man , we could ascertain them by observing him at ordinary times and places , provided that he kept his face uncovered , but the case would be very different if he habitually wore a mask . We should then have to wait for some abnormal or extraordinary circumstance , something that would break through his regular habits , in order to discover even the most ordinary aspect of his face . The normal course of events conceals from us much of what is most important and most universal both in outward nature and in the intellectual activities of men ; if we wish to understand these things , we must wait for some accident or abnormal situation to . reveal them to us . The material world offers endless illustrations . To break and to upset things necessarily deranges // the regular arrangements of life ; and yet we can not break , we can not overturn an object , without by that action disclosing parts of its structnre which were previously hidden , and which were probably quite as es*ential and as normal as its more obvious features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , accidents , events , crises do for the hidden things in the characters of men and nations . The impulse which leads us to quicken our steps toward any scene of excited talk or action is not wholly a vulgar craving for the unusual ; it is in part a desire to gain that understanding of the real nature of our fellows which is denied to the observer of the purely every-day aspects of life . The student of science recognizes this principle . Nature 's little irregularities which seem to be in revolt against established usage , her outbreaks which subvert all normal relations , are , as it were , her moments of inadvertence or agitation in which she lets slip the great secret which in her calmer moods she jealously guards from view . A trivial anomaly is often the first obscure glimpse which the scientist has of some mighty law governing the succession of diverse and wide-reaching phenomena . The historian of nations , likewise , will often find their inner life most clearly disclosed in those catastrophies by which the routine of custom is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Women in the early days of the French Revolution was one of the most abnormal events in history , and yet every narrator of those terrible scenes will be constrained by his very love of general and universal truths to give them a minute and vivid portrayal . These facts are valuable , not for what they are , but for what they disclose , not because they tell us certain extraordinary things which some thousands of Frenchmen did on one dreary October day in their history , but because they allow us to see those thoughts and feelings which for long periods of time had made part of the daily life of the whole French people . The novelist is subject to the same conditions as the historian , He wishes to read men 's characters in their doings ; but in ordinary circumstances men 's actions express little , consisting generally of a mere mechanical obedience to habit or custom . It is only in those crises which do away with all precedent that man // 343 pours enough of himself into his actions to endow them with true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare as the interpreter of the commonplace . The rare events in which universal truth reveals to us its latent and profound aspects are of no less value to the lover of general laws than the daily routine in which it shows its obvious and superficial features . But we can go even farther than this . An author who fills his pages with marvels need not destroy their value as teachers of every-day truth . If a man whose main object was to instruct , desired at the same time to thrill and startle , we see no reason why he could not gratify both the delicate tastes of his cultured readers and the sensational appetites of his meaner ones . Whenever Tolstoy , or Mr. Howells , or Mr. Henry James portrays some every-day occurrence , as for example , a trial , we confess that , if the scene is really enongh like other trials to deserve the name of commonplace , we never derive much pleasure or instruction from the incidents which make up the framework of the narrative . The reason is clear . The general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious to the rudest as to the most highly developed minds , and , on these points , therefore , high intelligence has nothing to teach . The charm of its work lies in the shrewd observations , the subtle interpretation of tone and expression , the bits of profound analysis , in those points , in short , which , evading the common observer , appeal oniy to rare and trained insight . But there seems to be no reason why work of this kind whose excellence consists in slight and delicate touches should be in any degree dependent on the quality of the main incidents . It is hard to see why these bright observations could not be as easily inserted in a startling as in an ordinary trial , or why in their new situation they should lose either truth or force . We must not imagine that , when we call a thing extraordinary , we imply in that term a complete severance from the ordinary forms . Every event has manifold aspects . When in a few of these aspects or even in one it differs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; while , at the same time , in its other features , which are often more numerous and more important than the eccentric ones , it may be , and usually is , // normal . If a cat , for instance , were to possess a tail of twice the usual length , we should be justified in calling it extraordinary ; but in every other featnre it might coincide exactly with the nsnal form , and , with proper allowance for the anomalous tail , we might study the strnctnre of the species as well in this as in any other individual . The same thing applies to events . The most extraordinary scene that ever took place has so much in common with every other scene of its kind that its careful and exact portrayal would involve a representation of much that was universally true . Our new principle is not then very strict in enjoining us to treat common things ; let us now see how it affects the treatment of common people . The novels have always been full of remarkable men and women . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by their eniiuence were raised above common humanity , or by their oddities stood apart from it , have given to fictitious characters the air of a select circle into which nothing undistinguished might venture to intrude . Are we , having found out a new law which reverses all this , to break up this noble assembly , and to fill the place which it leaves vacant with the commonplace frequenters of the highways and hedges ? We have in one sense already answered this question , so far as eiuinence is concerned , in asserting the inherent right to examination and portrayal which resides in intellectual and moral excellence , but not stopping to defend this position , which is abundantly strong enough to guard itself , let us see if we can not find in the commonplace a sanction for the practice of painting prodigies . In literature , as in politics , the great man has lost his pre-eminence as an individual . But in both politics and literature a compensating tendency has restored to him as representative the influence which he has lost as chief . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martin Luther was , beyond doubt , an extraordinary man , yet no historian of his times can omit a detailed record of his life , not because this man was a little abler or bolder than the people to whom he nodded in his daily walks , but because , taken broadly , the thoughts and acts of countless Germans , otherwise forgotten , are recorded for us in this man 's acts and thoughts . It is the likeness in purpose and feeling far more than the // difference in courage and abilities between Luther and his countrymen that gives him historic value . An instance from Daniel Deronda will show how the law works in fiction . If England were to be canvassed in order to find ont how many Grandconrts there were in it , the result wonld no doubt be an extremely small showing ; but yet , if the prevailing idea that his character is typical be correct , the man who has read and understood George Eliot 's novel knows something more , not of one person merely but of the English people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character itself is rare . Bnt eminence in character is not purely negative in its influence ; it may strongly aid the unfolding of general truths . The conspicnons commands attention . A tall man is always noticed in a crowd . The interest and regard which have to be laboriously drawn out toward the commonplace flow spontaneonsly toward the unusual . This becomes manifest , when authors depict qualities or intellectual processes , both of which exhibit themselves most clearly in their developed , and therefore their extreme , forms ; yet extremes are , by their nature , rarities . Shylock is certainly no ordinary man , but every one will admit that he illustrates the passion of avarice far better than one of those individuals whom their neighbors call " just a little close . " The common man is a compromise between opposing tendencies , and , therefore , fitted to illustrate none . The quality of oddity stands on much lower ground than that of eminence . It has no worth apart from its singularity . But , in spite of the fact that the feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can not help thinking that it may be highly useful if enlisted in the service of better things . It is a curious fact that almost all the odd characters which have made for themselves a real home in men 's hearts , from Sancho Pauza down to Captain Cuttle , have done so not so much through the oddity itself as through the piquant force with which it has brought out a strong innate goodness of heart . The moral worth and the outward eccentricities have promoted each other 's success . It is as certain that the goodness would have lost half its pungency , if enclosed in a less quaintly fashioned shell , as that the oddity would have lost half its worth , // had it enveloped a less wholesome kernel . What a little singillarity has here done for goodness , it may do for common facts The odd may be of inestimable use to the lover of the commonplace as a means of getting truth out of those conventional forms under which it is always hiding its real significance . The delicious piquancy which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relish which all men have for dialect-characters are very obvious instances of its effects . It is not necessary that the change be complete ; a variation in one part will renew our interest in the whole . The most familiar objects , if placed in new surroundings , often borrow the originality of their setting and affect ns like unfamiliar things . There is no need to dwell on the value of a force that can do this . The student of universal truths may look with disdain on the craving which men have for the singular and the anomalous , but he can not deny that a force which can put freshness and novelty into farn.ihiar objects is nowhere so useful as in his own special task of teaching men to stndy common things . The reason why men can learn universal truths from the contemplation of the eminent or the peculiar depends on the oneness of human nature . A great man is only the expansion of a common one ; an odd man is only one whose snbstantial unity with his fellows is broken in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well in the arm of a Hercules as in that of a common laborer , there seems to be no reason why we can not stndy intellectual and moral activities in their loftiest as well as in their commonest manifestations . The practice of authors certainly affirms this truth . George Eliot would doubtless have liked nothing better than to be regarded as the champion of common men and women , but the impulse to paint prodigies of virtue or intellect or ability was too strong for her , and in her later works she receded entirely from those early professions to which she was scarcely tine even in the books of which they formed part . Mr. Ifowells , too , who would like to have us think that he paints common people , has an adroit way of skimming off the cream of humanity for his readers and serving it up with the graceful pretense of its being mere ordinary milk . Even Count Tolstoy would rather have his heroine a pretty girl than otherwise . In // fact the practice is so universal that it is rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , accordingly , to think that there is real excellence in this new principle which we have termed the commonplace , that its present development is the passage into fiction of tendencies which in other lines have wrought out some of the noblest achievements of modern progress . We admit its right to complete ascendency , but at the same time we do not believe that this right necessarily involves any sacrifice of those qualities by which fiction has hitherto won its successes . We believe , on the contrary , that these allurements are never so valuable as at a time when the assumption by the novel of a more and more serious and philosophical attitude is continually demanding a higher and therefore a sterner intellectual effort from its readers . We can not afford , when the way is becoming a little rocky , to throw away the staff which helped us over its easy stages . The aim of the new writers is to induce men to look at life and character in that close and careful way which produces knowledge . But every one knows that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which possesses charm or novelty than at one which is simply commonplace . That arrangement of life by which the rare is only the common modified in a few points is most happily fitted to satisfy the artist 's double need of the commonplace and the novel . He is thus enabled to paint objects which are rare in some of their aspects in such a way that , while employing their universal qualities to make them valuable , he employs at the same time their exceptional ones to make them interesting . We have been greatly strengthened in these conclusions by the fact that they coincide with the practice of the great modern writers . A noble reciprocity of benefit , which exalts the frivolous , while it adorns the serious , parts of the work , has taught the modern novelist how to uplift his readers by the universality of his truth , while he wins them by the rarity of its setting .
