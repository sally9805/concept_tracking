Aldrich , Thomas Bailey , 1836-1907 : THE JEW 'S GIFT . from Mercedes , and later lyrics ( 1884 ) A. D. 1200 . The Abbot willed it , and it was done . They hanged him high in an iron cage For the spiteful wind and the patient sun To bleach him . Faith , ' t was a cruel age ! Just for no crime they hanged him there . When one is a Jew , why , one remains A Jew to the end , though he swing in air From year to year in a suit of chains . ' T was May , and the buds into blossom broke , And the apple-boughs were pink and white : What grewsome fruit was that on the oak , Swaying and swaying day and night ! The miller , urging his piebald mare Over the cross-road , stopped and leered ; But never an urchin ventured there , For fear of the dead-man 's long white beard . A long white beard like carded wool , Reaching down to the very knee  --  Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the gallows-tree ! Piteous women-folk turned away , Having no heart for such a thing ; But the blackbirds on the alder-spray For very joy of it seemed to sing . Whenever a monk went shuffling by To the convent over against the hill , He would lift a pitiless pious eye , And mutter , " The Abbot but did God 's will ! " And the Abbot himself slept no whit less , But rather the more , for this his deed : And the May moon filled , and the loveliness Of springtide flooded upland and mead . Then an odd thing chanced . A certain clown , On a certain morning breaking stone By the hill-side , saw , as he glanced down , That the heretic 's long white beard was gone  --  Shaved as clean and close as you choose , As close and clean as his polished pate ! Like wildfire spread the marvelous news , From the ale-house bench to the convent gate . And the good folk flocked from far and near , And the monks trooped down the rocky height @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear  --  The Devil had shaved the Israelite ! Where is the Abbot ? Quick , go tell ! Summon him , knave , God 's death ! straightway ! The Devil hath sent his barber from hell , Perchance there will be the Devil to pay ! Now a lad that had climbed an alder-tree , The better to overlook the rest , Suddenly gave a shout of glee At finding a wondrous blackbird-nest , Then suddenly flung it from his hand , For lo ! it was woven of human hair , Plaited and braided , strand upon strand  --  No marvel the heretic 's chin was bare ! Silence fell upon priest and clown , Each stood riveted in his place ; The brat that tugged at his mother 's gown Caught the terror that blanched her face . Then one , a patriarch , bent and gray , Wise with the grief of years fourscore , Picked up his staff , and took his way By the mountain-path to the Abbot 's door  --  And bravely told this thing of the nest , How the birds had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fleece from the breast To build a home for their young thereby . " Surely , if they were not afeard ( God 's little choristers , free of guile ! ) To serve themselves of the Hebrew 's beard , It was that he was not wholly vile ! " Perhaps they saw with their keener eyes The grace that we missed , but which God sees : Ah , but He reads all hearts likewise , The good in those , and the guilt in these . Precious is mercy , O my lord ! " Humbly the Abbot bowed his head , And , making a gesture of accord  --  " What would you have ? The knave is dead . " " Certes , the man is dead ! No doubt Deserved to die ; as a Jew , he died ; But now he hath served the sentence out ( With a dole or two thrown in beside ) , Suffered all that he may of men  --  Why not earth him , and no more words ? " The Abbot pondered , and smiled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave his beard to the birds ! " Aldrich , Thomas Bailey , 1836-1907 : INTAGLIOS. from Mercedes , and later lyrics ( 1884 ) By the chance turning of a spade In Roman earth , to view are laid Bits of carnelian , bronze and gold , Laboriously carved of old  --  Sleek Bacchus with his leaves and grapes ; Bow-bending Centaurs ; Gorgon shapes ; Pallas Athene helmeted ; Some grim , forgotten emperor 's head . ... This one , most precious for its make , That other , for the metal 's sake . A touch  --  and lo ! are brought to light Fancies long buried out of sight In hearts of poets ... bits of rhyme Fashioned in some forgotten time And thrown aside , but , found to-day , Have each a value in its way ... This , for the skill with which ' t is wrought , That , for the pathos of its thought . Aldrich , Thomas Bailey , 1836-1907 : A PREACHER . from Mercedes , and later lyrics ( 1884 ) Thus spake the Preacher : " O @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tempting seems the path , With bowers of cooling shade , the end is wrath : Here ' t is unsafe , that ' s dangerous footing there ; But follow me and have no further care ; Make me your guide , for I am one that hath Lived long and gathered in life 's aftermath  --  Experience . I bid you not despair . Reach me your hands and cast away all doubt ; I 'll lead you safe along the glacier 's shelf : You say ' t is dark ? ' T is noon-day , I insist ; Besides , I know each pitfall hereabout , I know each chasm "  --  just then the Preacher 's self Stumbled and plunged into eternal mist .
