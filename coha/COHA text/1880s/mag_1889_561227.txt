THE following pamphlet was written at Oxford , nearly eight years ago , in March , 1881 , by way of a protest , as its title and contents show , against the first of series of Bampton lectures , delivered by Mr. John Wordsworth , then tutor of Brasenose College , now Bishop of Salisbury . It was written in a mood of strong feeling , and printed immediately , by Messrs . Slatter &amp; Rose , the representatives of that firm of booksellers in the Oxford High street by which Shelley 's luckless pamphlet was issued in 1811 . But , moved probably by natural caution , the printers and publishers omitted to insert any printer 's or publisher 's name in the little brochure , an omission which passed unnoticed by the inexperience of the writer . The said writer , waiting a little tremulously for results on the day of publication , was told , first , that the pamphlet was exciting interest , and that copies were being rapidly sold-then , after a few hours ' interval , that the sale had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clergyman , who was at the time vicar of a church in Oxford . This dignitary , it appeared , went into Messrs . Slatter &amp; Rose 's shop , bought the pamphlet , read it , and instantly noticed that it bore no printer 's name . He at once drew the attention of the firm to the circumstance , and to the fact that such an omission is a legal offence . The firm understood that they must either withdraw the pamphlet or suffer for it , and that same evening the whole stock of copies was returned to the author with a letter of regret . The writer of the " protest " felt some natural indignation , and the matter would probably have been carried further , but for the fact that at the same moment a serious accident overtook the Bampton lecturer , and in the sympathy felt by the whole of Oxford , the feeling which had originally dictated the pamphlet and the irritation caused by its summary suppression were both // equally merged . The returned copies were stowed away , and the incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I bring this bygone protest in behalf of a liberal religion once more into the light of day . But " Robert Elsmere " seems to have brought me friends in America , and I have had many cordial requests to write for the American public . It will be best for me in the future to confine myself , wholly or mainly , to that type of writing which has already won a hearing . But meanwhile this " protest " is beside me ; it contains all the leading thoughts of " Robert Elsmere ; " and though seven years of added thought and reading stand between me and it , though the opening is crude , and the whole slight and incomplete , I am not ashamed to-day of its judgments or its aspirations . Both have become more of a commonplace now than they were when these few pages were written . Thought in England is moving fast . The labors and debates of scientific theology , which for half a century have been mainly the occupation and the interest of experts , are now beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done before . To judge from the Manchester Church Congress of this year , and from many recent books on religious subjects , marked by a fresh type and character , we are now fairly in the beginning of an epoch of popularization which may have enormous results for our religious life and institutions . It has taken fifty years of absorbing industry and exhaustive debate-Strauss 's " Leben Jesu " appeared in 1835  --  to form in the mind of the student of to-day a picture of Christian origins , such as the student of half a century ago could not have conceived , and which by its essential and convincing truth is destined to pass , slowly perhaps , but certainly , from the few to the many . The earlier irrational view of the Old Testament is practically broken down . When bishops , deans and divinity professors join with the mass of educated lay opinion in disavowing it , the victory for the liberal side may be regarded as won . Round the New Testament our own English struggle is only beginning . Here the work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very largely affected by those results of criticism which have been gained mainly by foreign students , working under conditions of freedom to which English theology can not and does not wish to pretend , until those results have been assimilated , remolded and reclothed by // the English brain . We still look for an English " Leben Jesu , " or an English " Ureliristenthum " which shall deal with these great subjects freely and scientifically , and at the same time with a tone and accent to which English feeling can respond . Learning has no nation ; the scholar is cosmopolitan ; but each people has its own spiritual language , and the accumulations of the scholar must take shape in their language before they can affect the multitude . To this work of translation , so to speak , and presentation , many of those who ponder the story and the destiny of Christianity will do well to turn themselves in the years that lie before us . The religious harvest of the future is whitening on every side . Faith need fear nothing . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the midst of what we call our age of doubt . But the forms and agencies of faith have their vast importance in our relative world , and it is they which need change and adjustment . The Positivist exclaims against the loss of time and ejtergy which seem to him involved in the process the believer in the life " hid with Christ in God " replies that nothing is or can be wasted which tends to refresh the springs of action in mankind , or to kindle in the individual that force of spiritual affection and desire which alone can keep him constant to the great ideals of the race . A PROTEST . ADDRESSED TO THOSE WHO ATTENDED THE BAMPTON LEC TURE OF SUNDAY , MARCH 6 , 1881 . " OTHERS , I doubt not , if not we , The issue of our toils shall see ; And ( they forgotten and unknown ) Young children gather as their own The harvest that the dead had sown .

Indolence , coldness , recklessness , pride and avarice . " The first Bampton Lecture of the present series had been expected with much interest . The character and attainments of the lecturer attracted to St. Mary 's many beyond the range of // personal friends or official attendants . A syllabus had , indeed , been circulated beforehand , which , while it had rejoiced some by its promise of plain speaking , had repelled and saddened others . But even among those so repelled there were many who went to hear Mr. Wordsworth* last Sunday , believing that behind the narrowness of personal view indicated by the syllabus , there would still be visible in his lectures the learning and the religious power which he is known to possess , learning and power from which even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . To what extent this conviction may be rewarded in later lectures it is , of course , impossible to say . As far as the first lecture was concerned , at any rate , it found but small confirmation . Mr. Woodsworth delivered a sermon to which many among his senior hearers must have listened in almost equal pain and wonderment . Is this all , one asked , that a religious preacher at the centre of English intellectual activity , whose business it is to make a study of religious thought and of the religious life in man , can tell ns about that great movement of the human mind against the traditional Christian theology which is to many of us the most important fact of our day and age ? Does he see no further , does he understand no more than this ? And , if so , whence comes a blindness so absolute and a narrowness so complete ? This must have been the first feeling of many . The second , perhaps , may have been one of willing excuse for the preacher himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last Sunday must have been very great . The strain upon the religious position is nowadays painfully felt by those who are its pledged defenders . The dissent frogi orthodox opinion , amid which so many orthodox people are compelled to live , produces an inevitable irritation , to which the finest natures must at times yield . And to an orthodox clergyman , cut off by the nature of things from understanding the higher forms of what he calls " Unbe *As this " protest was originally called forth by a particular event , the name of an individual remains necessarily connected with it . In republishing it I would have effaced the signs in it of place and circumstance , but that the little piece of writing would so lose what actuality and life it possesses . Naturally the name of the lecturer , who is now the earnest and devoted Bishop of Salisbury , is here only as representing a moral and intellectual position . Still , if I were writ*ng this first paragraph to-day , the expressions in it would be less emphatic . The more personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oneself or of conviction in others ,  --  the years bring no more penetrating lesson with them as they pass . // lief , " and therefore affected by no balancing and modifying considerations , the lower forms of it are often inexpressibly trying and disquieting . If he is moreover an Oxford tutor and living much among young and immature men , he naturally sees a great deal of the purely disadvantageous and disastrous side of the loosening hold of Christian sanctions upon human life . Moral deterioration as the direct res alt , or at least as the marked accompaniment of changed opinions , has come more than once within his personal experience . What such deterioration proves is no more than the natural antagonism as old as humanity , between the " flesh " and the " spirit , " between " the natural man " and the " things of God , " but granted the orthodox standpoint , the orthodox conclusion , with all its insensibility to other aspects of the question , is yet intelligible- " unbelief is sin , and always implies the antecedent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed be remembered that the Bampton Lecturer of last Sunday has had a far wider experience than this open to him had he chosen to use it . This University might have supplied him with types of unorthodox belief of a very different character from the jejune and reckless free-thinking of the selfindulgent undergraduate or young fellow . There are men in our midst , some of whom are probably well known to each one of us , in whom the highest points of Christian character are combined with a slowly-formed and firmly-held conviction of the hollowness of the claims made by the popular Christianity upon the reasonable faith of men . But to the preoccupied controversialist , burning with what he believes to be a supernatural message , and honestly indignant with all that stands in the way of its reception , such lives are either practically unknown for lack of understanding faculty on his side , or if he is in any way able to appreciate them , they represent to him a mystery which like so many other orthodox " mysteries " he does not allow to trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a sermon as this of Mr. Wordsworth 's be understood . On the one hand , a mind in passionate possession of a half-truth entirely convinced , that is to say , of the frequent connection between low standards of character and unorthodox beliefs ; on the other hand a practical incapacity for understanding , or for admitting into the argument , the related and equally demonstrable truth , of the frequent connection between the highest // standards of character and this same order of beliefs ; here are the two factors in this strange result . Such an intellectual temper is obviously not to be reasoned with . It will find the Nemesis which follows upon all sacrifices of the greater truth to the lesser , upon all failures in intelligence and in sympathy . But it is scarcely to be directly argued against-even if such an argument were not , in theological controversy , a slaying of the slain . It will be well , however , while the impression of Mr. Wordsworth 's sermon is still fresh upon us , to endeavor to make plain to ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unbelief and sin professes to explain to us . It is quite evident to the Bampton Lecturer that unorthodox belief is a kind of practical arm-chair philosophy adopted for very sufficient practical reasons . A man finds the exercise of his religion inconvenient and uncomfortable . It asks too much from weak human nature . Not only its ideal demands but the conditions of its every-day maintenance are too hard . The undergraduate or the young fellow , absorbed in the quiet and comfort of college rooms , is apt to find an easy chair and a book more attractive than college chapel . At the same time a clever man finds himself called upon to acknowledge that cleverness is of infinitely less worth than godliness and that there are many things in the world which are not open to him to judge , but which have been judged for him already ; and against concessions of this kind vanity rebels . In Mr. Wordsworth 's eyes it is all so delightfully simple . Self-indulgence , vanity ,  --  in these two words may be summed up the whole great change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human society . Perhaps in the place of the direct argument we have no taste for attempting , it may be permitted to us to place beside the description thus confidently given of the genesis of unbelief , sketches of two types of life . The types may be verified by each one of us who will take the trouble to question his own experience sufficiently closely ; to deny that they exist is only to put the denier out of court . The majority of orthodox people at the present day are in fact prepared to admit , however reluctantly , the existence in ever increasing numbers of the first type . They will be more inclined perhaps to question the accuracy of the second . But as with bodily so with intellectual features  --  the sitter is not always the best // judge of his own likeness . In the first place , however , let us endeavor to define what " unbelief , " on its intellectual side , really means . It means a particular way of judging a series of documents and events , a particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the qualities of historical testimony in given ages of human development . Since the Christian system is a vast historical product depending upon innumerable historical records , " unbelief , " which is a particular mode of judging this system , must , intellectually speaking , be a matter of literary and critical judgment . The Christian problem , as the world is now beginning to understand , is first and foremost a literary problem . A priori , for instance , there is no tenable argument against miracles , but a wider literary and historical experience shows us how they arise , and that in certain states of human development they always do and must arise . To assume a power of judging the popular Christianity from inside , from the standpoint of intuition and " spiritual certainty , " without a knowledge of its relations and conditions as a great literary and historical problem , is to hide one 's head in the sand . It may be desirable that the mass of mankind , who have no gift for unraveling literary problems , should continue to hide their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and can not be seriously disputed . The Christian question is a question of documents , of minute and intricate series of facts , of a long course of historical development , on the one side of doctrine , on the other of organization-matters all of them for the trained literary critic , to be judged in the temper and by the methods now universally applied to similar classes of fact . Here , however , Mr. Wordsworth would join issue with us . The Christian problem , he would say , is indeed to a large extent a literary problem , but it is not to be judged " in the temper and by the methods now universally applied to other classes of fact . " We must in reality address ourselves to it in a spirit wholly unique and peculiar . Reason , indeed , is the only instrument by which we can intellectually apprehend anything . Reason must therefore be our instrument in this case , but in this problem alone of all problems success is impossible unless reason is re-enforced by feeling , unless we hope to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orthodox Christianity true ? " Unless , that is , we enter upon the investigation with our minds // already half made up , and powerfully affected by those passions of love and fear which the philosophies of all ages have endeavored to exclude from the processes of argument , failure , i. e. , a negative answer , is probable , and to this failure moral evil will attach . It is to be accounted for by some form of sin , by pride , by indolence , by selfishness and worldliness of temper , and so on . How does such an assumption fit with the actual processes of intellectual and spiritual development going on around us ? Let us suppose that two young men of similar gifts and position in life are entering upon manhood and taking their places in this University . Both perhaps have been brought up in religious homes , and both are reverent and high - minded , clinging with unquestioning loyalty and fidelity to the ideals and the doctrines they have been trained to accept . In both the inner life is real and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and traditional significance . A , however , has perhaps been rather more subjected to literary influences than C , and he is naturally of a more fearless and positive temper , inclined to liberalism in politics , boyishly ardent for reforms as such , and in love very likely with certain special social and administrative projects within the hearing of which he has been brought up . He has the curiosity to boot , which is the natural accompaniment of youth and untried abilities . Turn him into a library and it is his eager desire to explore these books with their famous titles , and so to gather round the great names which meet his eye and ear perpetually in his new University life , the ideas which belong to them . The world of books , which perhaps throughout a healthy and conscientious school life has been of little comparative importance to him , becomes now absorbingly real and attractive . He learns how to read and he begins to think . If he has the literary , as distinct from the more strictly scientific bias , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by history , by criticism , by poetry . For a long time his reading is a mere matter of curiosity and enjoyment to him . He is too untrained to be able to deduce any general ideas from it , and it has little or no effect upon the body of habits he has inherited from home training . His Sunday is spent as he believes his home people would wish him to spend it , and the religious services of a University town are full of interest and pleasure for him . The world indeed for him , is full of interest and variety , of genius and of goodness , and the moment // for attempting to explain it has not yet come . It is enough merely to explore and to enjoy . But the process of assimilation goes on , and the boy grows into the man . The reading for iResponsions and for Moderations is exchanged for the reading for Greats . Meanwhile , during his leisure time and in vacations , he has been accumulating a great stock of miscellaneous ideas and impressions from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind has been growing and the intellectual faculty hardening . The period of comparison arrives for him , as it arrives for nations and for sciences . His knowledge has to be sifted , to be put in order , to be penetrated with ideas , to take its place in relation to life and in relation to religious belief . The process of this new intellectual operation is slow and often half conscious . But as he follows it he becomes for the first time really alive to a fact which had been up till now a mere shadow to him . It becomes strikingly plain to him that there are large numbers of persons in the present , and that there have been large numbers of persons in the past , of many of whom he knows that he can not pretend to be the equal either in character or ability , who are wholly unprepared to accept the particular explanation of the facts of the world and human life which he has been taught to regard as essential . Once made aware of these fundamental diversities of view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact . They are forced upon him by his Greats reading ; they appear to him in books and subjects , which he had handled of old in light-hearted unconsciousness . And then comes the question , so right , so inevitable , " If there are so many ways of thinking , is it possible , is it probable that my way of thinking is the only right one ? " But he remembers that it is not his way of thinking only . Orthodox Anglicanism has been fortified by much writing , by the energies of many lives , by the growth of a long tradition . Burdened with his first doubts , he betakes himself to the aids of Christian fellowship , to the resources of his home ties , to the supports of Christian worship . And these for a time suffice , his unbelief appears to him a sin to be striven against , and the questions so long preparing , and in reality so irresistible , are for a time driven back . But the force of slowly-matured powers and accumulated circumstances is not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has now reached he might have fled into the mountains with // St. Benedict , and so crushed for ever the perilous questionings . But modern life has to be faced and can not be escaped as could the life of the fifth century . The struggle returns , inevitably returns by the mere progress of life and thought . His intellectual training , this keen and varied instrument he has been for so long unconsciously maturing , begins to work , whether he will or no , upon the whole field of philosophical ideas ; it has perfected itself upon a succession of literary problems-it attacks now , whether he will or no , the great literary problem of Christianity . It matters little whether he gives the process direct encouragement . In all probability he refrains from reading books which he knows would harass his religious belief . But the belief is , notwithstanding , harassed and strained perpetually . In his historical and philosophical reading , in the incidents of every-day life , in newspapers , in periodicals , in sermons above all , the inner disturbance finds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an attempt to sift some half-legendary material , or to estimate the value of a given writer 's testimony , under certain ascertained conditions of time and place , will suddenly lead him direct by the natural transitions of thought , into comparisons , into analogies and inferences , from which , after long pondering , he awakes to find a new , and as it seems to him , bewildering and terrible light breaking upon life . Thenceforward it is of little importance how the change thus initiated is carried on , whether he undertakes an elaborate examination into the claims of orthodox Christianity , or whether the detachment from his early beliefs remain still indirect and gradual in operation . In the end the Time Spirit conquers , and long before his triumph is acknowledged to the soul , the Christian religion is dumbly felt to have been drawn within the circle of scientific inquiry , and to have been there stript of its peculiar pretensions . When full recognition of the altered state of things arrives , it brin'gs with it the no longer avoidable confession that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely and imposing associations , is but one of many systems that human nature has in turn framed for its shelter and support , that like all other theologies the world has seen , it is the product of human needs and human skill . What follows ? Inevitably a time of struggle and of blankness , when all ths landmarks of life and conduct appear to waver , and // the bitterness of lost certainty makes itself abundantly felt . Is the Christian 's happy certainty of an ideal purpose in this life and an ideal justice in the next indeed a delusion ? Is there really no rest in God , no peace in Christ ? Has the gracious figure of Galilee and of Calvary in reality no significance different in kind from that which attaches to the other heroic and tender figures which have illumined human history ? Is there indeed no certainty of our whence , no news of our whither ? Is death the end ? And if so , of what unrelenting power are we the bruised and helpless playthings ? But if the mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear the strain , its history will not end here . With some men less richly dowered by nature with the religious gift , such a crisis would lead to an attitude of pure agnosticism , and life would be to them henceforward confessedly inexplicable . In matters of conduct they would claim to be guided by the aggregate experience of civilized mankind , and according to the relative degrees of moral cultivation or moral sensitiveness in each case , this experience would represent a higher or a lower standard . In poetry , in human relationships , in natural beauty , they would look for the soothing or stimulating forces necessary for the sustenance of moral life at all . But in the case we have been considering we have been dealing throughout with a strongly religious temperament , combined with a keen and honest intellectual faculty . The intellect has now had its satisfaction , but the needs of the inner life become only the more pressing . It is dimly felt that in work , in unselfishness , in charity , may be found the bridge from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intellectual task , helped forward by homely self-denial and varied by some quiet work of charity or public usefulness is accordingly undertaken . Life and thought flow on , blindly and painfully often , but by patient effort , by resolute sincerity , the soul is slowly nearing its appointed goal . Months or years may pass , but the end is not the less sure . To the heart that has been darkened by the eclipse of old ideals , God , the Highest Ideal , at last reveals Himself . In a region far removed from the trains of thought and argument which had broken down for him the claims of received opinions ; far out of reach of all questions of criticism and exegesis , of historical development and historical method , the soul rises to the source of Love , // of Truth , of Beauty , and finds consolation . There are difficulties here , indeed , which the intellect allows and faces . But in the high region of philosophic possibilities , such a nature as we have imagined embraces the possibility which satisfies it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then , at last is rest and permanence . For this is ground which has never been and never can be successfully attacked . God can not be proved from outside , but neither can He be disproved . No perfecting of the historical method , no comparative handling of religions , can cut the ground from under this faith . Other men , he feels , are free to disbelieve it . But he feels also with joy unspeakable that he is free to believe it , and the kernel of the inner life thus saved , he begins to construct its whole anew . And as the reconstruction proceeds he recovers all that is permanent in Christianity . He finds again the Master , no longer disguised from him by the veils whether of ignorant love or of intellectual subtlety , but living , true , intelligible , the man Christ Jesus . He makes the name of Christian his own once more , and will assert his right to it no less passionately than reasonably . In the present and in the future he looks for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education of the world , but as fervent and as high-minded as of old . Meanwhile life is summed up for him in two relations , his relation to God , and his relation to this ideal Christian society . " In Thee , 0 Lord , have I put my trust , " expresses the spirit of the first , while the second , which contains his practical every-day life , with its work , its charities , its tolerances , will be regulated and inspired by words long known to him and now infinitely widened in meaning , " This do in rememlrance of me . " But while the Christian passion in its purest form thus revives in him , it leads him to make no compromise with truth . If miracles , however innocently manufactured , are untrue in fact and misleading in philosophy , if the Creeds , therefore , are a mere collection of propositions , venerable for their antiquity and associations , but in no way binding on the enlightened conscience ; if the Bible represents an important section of the religious life of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and judged like other sections ,  --  he will endeavor to let these truths also , secondary as they are , express themselves in his life . He will // not profess to belong to a Church which , by its accredited officers and accepted formuhe , regards the Creeds and the miracles as the essential basis of Christian belief . The loss of common worship he will feel simply and seriously as a loss and a privation , but it will appear to him his duty to bear it . Only by perfect sincerity , by such consistency as it is in his power to reach , can he advance the future he desires . The development he traces in himself he believes and knows to be progressing in many other hearts . By and by will come the time for union and for action . Meanwhile he will not betray the cause of Truth , which is the cause of every child about him for whom the new world is to be framed , by joining in any dream of compromise or any premature schemes of Church Reform , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differences which seem to him-. at the present moment in the world 's history-vital . The differ .. ences must be felt , must be acknowledged ; the ground must be cleared , then may come the re-building . Now let us put beside this type of character so real , so increasingly frequent among us , another type not less real , and very much more frequent . In the case of C the balance of temperament is perhaps slightly different . The whole man is a little slower and more timid than in the case of A. Instead of a bias toward change , there is a natural bias against it , strengthened , perhaps , by the circumstances of home life , by the politics of his family or of his circle . At the same time he has considerable intellectual power , and his career at school , or at college , will , for a while , be scarcely distinguishable in main outlines from that of A. He has very much the same religious opinions as A , for a time neither more nor less strongly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yoke , has to endure the questioning of the modern spirit which can not now be escaped by any average intelligence . Again , we have disturbance and recoil , but the disturbance is less great , and the recoil , speaking broadly , is permanent . From the beginning those who knew him might have prophesied the worsting of the scientific instinct by the religious in case of conflict . All his natural timidity and conservatism re-enforces the religious side , and the result is never really doubtful . The risks on all hands of free scientific inquiry are felt to be too great , the mind can not face them , and the conscience is soon taught that there is no need to face VOL . CXLVIII. - NO. 387. // them . Orthodox friends are at hand to assure him that the inquiry is itself sinful , and that to make it is merely to waste the forces of his moral and spiritual life . Can he expect to reach a higher and a wider truth than has been reached by those about him whom he has been taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , he has even grasped the elementary conditions of the problem , the young man consciously takes his stand for orthodoxy . Thenceforward nothing is less free to him than thought . Intellectual activity indeed of many kinds , thanks to the vastness of human knowledge , is still open to him , within the strictest limits of orthodoxy . The mind becomes learned in many things having once consented to be ignorant of some , and with the compromise the whole man is more than content . Upon any inquiry into disputed points , if such inqniry is ever forced upon him by the course of his fu* tnre life , he will enter in the spirit inculcated by Mr. Wordsworth , that is to say , in the strong hope , or rather in the practical certainty of finding the particular answer he desires . A soldier might as well go to battle having first deliberately disarmed . With what subtlety and passion , with what delicate ingenuity , the conservative temper whether in religion or politics , once adopted , may be fed from within and without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or vexation , the history of the world can testify . But neither passion nor ingenuity can alter the fact , or stay truth . The man who cherishes it to the stunting and dwarfing of other powers in him than the religious , has his reward , but he has also his punishment . Arrived at maturity , nerhaps landed safely in Holy Orders , he is no longer able to read a critical book with fairness and intelligence , or to understand any but the coarsest aspects of the liberal and scientific school of thought . He is like a man who has lost his sense . In old days it may have been " I will not accept such and such a conclusion , " now it is quite naturally , " I can not . " The power of free judgment and appreciation is gone , and he rejoices in its departure . Such a power is only compatible with " unbelief , " and " unbelief is sin : sin , not only in himself , in the only case of which he truly knows the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men of whom he knows nothing within or without but the one bare fact of their " opinions. ** This is a view which once adopted will often give great personal // relief to a good man sorely troubled by the religious prospects of the present day , and as life goes on , like many other orthodox formula3 it will receive perpetual " confirmation . " The holder of it interprets by its aid the careless and self-indulgent life of a free-thinking friend or pupil . Every moral lapse in the case of such a man has a niche in the orthodox scheme . It proves what it is asked to prove , and of any other kind of proof , in a particular range of subjects , the observer has long trained himself to take no heed . Human nature is happily illogical , and with what sweetness and gentleness of personal character such a view is compatible we all know . The loss of power to translate it into tyrannical action has led in God 's teaching of the world to the loss of desire so to translate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represent a spiritual evil and defect , not the less is it a danger and an obstace to the harmonious growth of human society . To the man holding it , understanding of A 's life is henceforth impossible . He could not understand it if he would . If he is ever brought intimately across him in such a way as to be made to feel his nobility and purity of nature , he will dismiss the problem of his life as one of those mysteries with which a Christian is not bound to meddle . God knows best for what purpose evil is sometimes endowed with such fair outer semblance , but that unorthodox opinions are themselves sin , and spring from sin , is an explanation of the puzzles of the day so interwoven with all his habits of thought that repeated experiences of the kind will make little or no impression upon him . He has darkened his own eyes , and the good he is incapable of perceiving passes him by , to make its due impression in the Divine purpose on other souls less closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the head of A are known to all of us . They are known , indeed , to men of the Bampton Lecturer 's persuasion . But by others they are not only known but understood . Young hearts still open and generous can be fired by their devotion , by their unworldliness , by their width of cultivation and of sympathy . Older men in whom the religions sense properly so called has not been dulled or overlaid by controversy or by dogmatic zeal are drawn to them , and are able to acknowledge the Divine Presence in them , across whatever differences of creed or practice . In the stir of towns , in college rooms , in quiet country houses , an increasing number of such lives are lived amongst // us year by year . Silently , but surely , they are preparing us for a new religions order . Misunderstood on both sides , on the scientific as well as on the religious , they are , nevertheless , children of the new household of faith , first-fruits of that new Garden of the Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their presence betokens the first stirrings of a religious movement , which has given many premonitory , and as it has often seemed abortive , signs , but which is now truly upon us , and of which no one can foresee the results . When shall this stir become visible activity and progression ? When shall we see the rise of that simpler Christian society which will achieve what the present Christian society on the showing of its own defenders is daily failing to achieve , the recovery of the religious spirit in modern life ? The materials are ready , the forces to be employed are daily ranging themselves more clearly . On the one hand the Time Spirit representing whether in the ignorant or in the wise the accumulated labor of generations , the spread of a truer historical sense , the conquests of the critical method-on the other , the eternal and undying need of the human soul for religion , for God .

How to provide it may be said to have become the problem of statesmen . Between Materialism and Ultramontanism , where is the third course which society must find ? Can it be maintained now , as it was in some sense maintained in the sixteenth century , that Protestantism , Anglican , Dissenting or Lutheran , is in a condition to offer this third course to European thought ? We all know , if we will be candid with ourselves and our experience , that it can not . Protestantism is in worse case philosophically , and has infinitely less chance with the modern world than the Catholicism it displaced . No . This via salutis so ardently desired can be reached in one way only-by making just and equal provision for the two guiding forces of human nature , the force of reason and that spiritual force which we call faith . Protestantism in a younger stage of European society professed to make such a provision , and for a time it succeeded admirably . But we now see that the success of the sixteenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journey . We have reached the end of a long and toilsome // stage , and already the disclosures of the next are rising dimly before the imagination of many of us . We see a Christian Church bound together by simple observances , by a rite of entrance such as was the primitive rite of Christian baptism , by a ceremony of membership which will be the Christian breaking of bread , and by such links of religious custom as may best meet the practical needs of our modern life . The creed of such a Church would be practically summed up in the two sayings we have already quoted as guiding the two-fold course of an individual life : In thee , 0 Lord , or In Thee , 0 Eternal , have Iput my trust . And again : This do in remembrance of me . Trust or faith ,  --  memory , or love ,  --  these will be the springs of the future as they have been the springs of the past . But the Church of the future will demand a stronger trust from its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It will demand a trust in God , independent of all " schemes of revealed religion , " independent even of all certainty of an immortal life , a trust absolute , complete , and unreserved . Such a faith will be called upon to meet suffering and death , without any confident assurance-whatever be its inmost hope**of the " many mansions " in the Father 's house , and it will be called upon to meet life and its perplexities without any cut and dried formuhe of explanation . But in life and death it will find God , and God will suffice it . In daily submission to His will as it has been slowly revealed in human history , and written in the human conscience , in daily communion with Him through all that is highest and noblest in human thought , it will find the stay which nothing else can give . But it will not belie its own nature by asking of God a special and artificial instead of a natural and universal Revelation , nor will it attempt to serve Him by ignorance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But what , you ask me , " - said Elsmere once , in a speech to the New Brotherhood , which no biographer has reported ,  --  " is the individual hope under such a system of thought ? Because of the resurrection of christ , the Christian looks forward to a continuance of personality beyond death . He sees the supposed fact undermined with terror , because he imagines that the dearest hope of humanity perishes with it . Not so ! That hope rests on no uncertain testimony of unknown witnesses to a single past fact . It rests for us , like our faith in God , on the whole of the present-on the whole of the past . Look with me into such dying eyes as those I watched yesterday ! The allusion is probably to the speaker 's friend and helper , the little gas-fitter , Charles Richards .

This do , in remembrance of me ,  --  not in mystical non-natural remembrance , but in simple practical remembrance of actual human suffering and actual human words . In the memory of Christ will be summed up the memory of all who have lived or died in his spirit since history began . But for us of the modern European world which has been molded by Christianity , the name of Jesus of Nazareth must always remain the most powerful and effective symbol at once of man 's aspiration to God , and God 's victory in man . To break altogether with the Christian tradition , is , for those who cherish the spiritual life at all , an impossibility . To endeavor to do so in the case of any new organization would show not only spiritual insensibility but ignorance of the main lessons of life and history . The problem is how to replace Christianity of one type by Christianity of another . The Christianity of the future is stirring throughout Europe . It is comparatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is a day of revealing which arrives sooner or later for " the thoughts of many hearts , " and when that revealing comes , it will bring action and energy with it . Of the practical aims of such a Church as we have thus roughly remaining energies of the soul into a thought for another , into gratitude , into a sublime trust . There is your hope ! Millions of years the universe has labored for the evolution of that conquest , that sublimity of trust . All life , all civilization have existed for one end only , the evolution , the perfecting , the training of what we call the soul-of the moral life of man . The making of the soul  --  the self-realization of God-there , for the believer , is the purpose of the world . But a man has no soul till he has grasped and made his own some fragment of the Divine life . Evil has no permanence , no reality . It is one of the incidents of that vast but fugitive process by which the higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is Truth and Love has been made manifest amid the broken shows of the world . As to the future , we can not draw for you the fashion of the City of God ; we can only bid you possess yourselves of a hope which is. the eternal heritage of man . That hope can only grow in you , gradually , as you are worthy of it . Live the life of love , patience and reason ,  --  and suddenly , through your utmost gloom , your extremest doubt , there will penetrate those visitings of God , that incommunicable certainty of life in Him which will be to you what the belief in the material resurrection was to St. Paul . After days of toil , of wholesome effort for yourself and others , of justice towards your neighbor , there will come the moment of vision which will reward , illumine alL " Unsummoned powers the blinding film shall part . And scarce by happy tears made dim , the eyes In recognition start ! " And after that vision , though your actual knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It will inspire you throilgh life ; it will carry you , as it carried Jesus , through death . " // outlined , this is not the place to speak . How strong a force it might be in social progress , in the combat with physical and moral evil , all of us can imagine . On each side of it there would be large sections of men influenced by other ideas , and guided by other faiths . On one side there would always be a certain number of minds disinclined to any positive solution whatever of the religious difficulty ; on the other , there is little prospect of any speedy decline of the principle of authority , which in one shape or another is an essential factor in human history . But for a great intermediate mass of intelligent and craving mankind such a new Christian organization would provide shelter and working ground , and we should see our children spared the waste of spiritual power , the dissipation and wreck of religious feeling , which has too often marked the inevitable struggle of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that delivered by Mr. Wordsworth , should by their mere inadequacy draw attention from time to time to the true nature of some modern " unbelief .
