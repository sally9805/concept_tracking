txt Gov . Hamilton fired off his bomb-shell in the ranks of the Democratic bosses to-day , and it has made a loud noise , though it is impossible yet to tell what its effect will be . It is in the shape of a letter in reply to inquiries of leading citizens , and Is a review of the extravagances and wastp practiced under the boss system in this State . Referring to the extravagances of the last Legislature , he says : " There are 111 members in both houses of the Legislature . At the last session there were 105 officers , employes , and beikeficiaries , exclusive of ministers of the Gospel . The stationery , mileage , and per diem of members for the session was $57,767 . The stationery , mileage , and compensation of the officers ; employes , and beneficiaries of the Senate and House , exclusive of the clergy , was $59,276 . The details of this extraordinary expenditure for the officers , &c.,; is more aggravated than the naked fact itself , though that is certainly as bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the session extra allowances and additional compensation were made to a number of officers and employes ; true , not by the General Assembly , but by the more reprehensible and dangerous practice  --  on separate orders of each house  --  and they were all paid . " One of the leading bosses in Maryland is George Colton , State Printer and Police Com-missioner , and a piece of the bomb hits him where the Governor says the cost . of printing for the last session and for indexing and binding the laws and Journals of the Senate and Houseand for the publication of these laws amounted to $75,000 , the printing alone being $38,000 and for the publication of the laws $33,150 . In this matter alone at least $40 , - 000 could be saved . For the last three sessions , now covering about five years , and for the departmental printing , there has been spent the sum of $260,000 . Under any well-devised system guarding the interests of the . State , and still liberal and just to all , an immense saving could be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is required to secure a fair vote , and a more thorough and efficient law against bribing and corrupt practices at elections to secure , as far as can be , a pure vote . " And then , in addition , primary meetings , which now have so prominent a relation to our elections , should be put under legal protection against fraud and violence . " Bills to these ends were submitted during the last session , but failed to pass .
