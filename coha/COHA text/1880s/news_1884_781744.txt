txt The Tribune announces that Mr. BIGELOW has just arrived in this city from London , and , recalling its discovery made some weeks ago that Mr. BIGELOW had gone to England in order to bring back a cargo of British gold for the use of the Democratic managers , our partially esteemed contemporary is very anxious to know just how much gold Mr. BIGELOW has brought with him . As concealment is no longer possible in regard to Mr. BIGELOW 'S mission , no harm will be done by satisfying the Tribune 's curiosity . As is now well known , Mr. BIGELOW has for years been employed to bring secretly into the country the gold contributed by the Cobden Club in furtherance of its atrocious free trade designs . As a rule , Mr. BIGELOW has brought in $22,000 on each trip , and it was fully expected that he would bring in. his usual cargo in time to be of use in buying votes for Gov . CLEVELAND . It so happened , however , . that on arriving in London last September Mr. BIGELOW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That nefarious association had nearly exhausted its treasury by hiring men to poison the opponents of free trade in the United States . ? The two hundred assassins , , at $5,000 each , whom the club had sent to this country had proved faithless . They had pocketed their pay and then refused to spend a cent of it in poison . This drain upon the treasury made it difficult for the Cobden Club to respond to Mr. BIGELOW 'S appeal , and it was not until the individual members of the club , by burglary , highway robbery , and sneak-thieving , had made a special collection of some thirty thousand dollars and paid it into the treasury that the Treasurer of the club felt justified in ? acceding to Mr. BIGELOW 'S request . Meanwhile Mr. BIGELOW , finding himself in ill-health , was ; surveyed by a physician , who ordered repairs to be made upon him . One of the first acts of this physician was . to reduce Mr. BIGELOW's. carrying capacity . Our ' ifellow-country- ' man was informed that it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in gold , and al . Plimsoll 's mark was placed upon . him , and he was strictly forbidden to permit himself to be loaded below , that mark . This is the way it came to pass that Mr. BIGELOW did not arrive here two weeks ago , and that . when he did arrive he brought with him only $12,000 . Strictly speaking , he brought with him ' $12,150 , for in spite of the Liverpool inspectors he ventured to carry a small deckload of $150 in his vest pockets . Had he brought his usual cargo of $22,000 and landed it here two weeks . ago a vast deal of good might have been done with the money in ' the way of bribing college Professors and other notoriously corrupt men to pretend to believe in free trade ; but it is now too late to accomplish any effective work with the $12,000 which reached here on Friday . The Tribune need give itself no uneasiness , for if Mr. BLAINE was sure of his election last Friday morning his chances have not been lessened by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
