txt The Sny levee , which has just given way , has a somewhat notable history . It was constructed under a general law of Illinois , passed April 24 , 1871 , providing for the construction of drains and levees ; and another act , passed April 9 , 1872 , provided for registration of bonds issued under the prior act . In substance , those acts proposed to assess lands which might be judged likely to be benefited by the improvement , and pay damages . to the owners of land to be injured . The State Constitution expressly provided that taxation for corporate purposes should be uniform in respect to persons and property , and restricted the aggregate municipal debts to 5 per cent . on the valuation ; these laws , on the contrary , allowed indefinite , loose , and unlimited taxa-. tion . The Sny bonds , however contrary the laws were to the spirit of the Constitution in this respect , were an anomaly , being neither State , municipal , nor corporate ; they were mere association bonds , issued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value . The registration act provided that when it was shown to the satisfaction of any court before which proceedings were taken under the prior act that any drain or levee was of public benefit . , " the same shall be deemed a public work , " but the act carefully disavowed any State liability , making the State merely the custodian of any taxes actually collected for the , bonds . There was neither machinery for enforcement nor penalty for non-payment provided ; at most , the bonds were a lien on the lands , assuming that the legality of the whole matter was not upset ; hence , obviously , , the bondholders were really silent partners in the success of the scheme , and had nothing to look to beyond a share in conjectural profits from the reclaimed lands . The rosiest anticipations were indulged , however . Thus , the St. Louis Democrat of June 7 , 1873 , said that the citizens of Missouri , on account of the large tracts ( 1,500 , - 000 acres estimated ) of land in that State liable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations ; that several hundred acres which prior to beginning the levee could have been had for " six bits " an acre , had recently been sold at $17 cash ; that for land formerly held at $10 an acre , $75 was already asked ; that the increased value of the Suy plot of 100,000 acres alone , by reason of the levee , could not be less than from $5,000,000 to $8,000,000 . As the levee cost only $500,000 , " the immense profit that will accrue to the State is at once apparent . " Accordingly , the jealous writer proceeded to raise a cry for a Missouri copy of this work of semi-creation , thus : " Under these circumstances , it will be the grossest kind of negligence for our Legislature to omit to make preparation for such a work within our own boundaries next Winter . There are , within 75 miles of St. Louis , hundreds of acres that , like the Sny Island land . formerly , can not be cultivated more than one year out of five . Twenty-five thousand dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their worth and make them the very best garden-spots within reach of us . Down in the south-eastern part of the State are thousands of acres of the same kind , and which are susceptible of the same reclamation . It is both the State 's duty and to the State 's interest to see that they are made productive . " A circular , issued Dec. 4 , 1875 , by a Detroit lawyer to holders of the Sny bonds , cites some interesting facts regarding the position of the matter at that time . For example , conflicting interests had already arisen ; the owners of a large flouring mill at Rockport had sued the Levee Commissioners in the Federal courts , desiring to open " the head of Sny Caste " by a cut through ' the levee and let in the Mississippi water , which would destroy the whole work , unless some compromise method of using locks or pipes could . be arranged ; the Commissioners did not assess with a view to litigation , and had no funds for such purpose , but " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there is no limit in the laws but the necessities of the levee and its support . " The letter proceeded to remind the bondholders that the suits involved the legal question of the constitutionality of the whole matter , and with it the validity of the assessments which constituted the sole security , also the practical question whether the firm of millers could cut the levee for their own benefit , and thus destroy it for all others ; also , that the Levee Commissioners , having no money for contesting these questions , must look to the bondholders , and that it was of the greatest importance to the latter to come forward promptly , &c.; As an encouragement to them to submit to assessments . upon which they never had reckoned , the letter added that the levee had . been substantially built ; that " its capacity for resistance was last year tested by the greatest strain of high water ; " that " it fulfills all the expectations of the land-owners , to whom the enjoyment of its benefits seems now permanently secured ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submerged during a , large part of every , season , have been transformed into the best agricultural . lands in the State ; " and ( to complete the lights in the picture ) that " the public health in the surrounding country has been vastly . bene.fited .. and the increased value of these lands . resulting solely from this work , is estimated at many times its cost . " Alas for human nature , however ! The shadows had to be added to the picture . The letter was obliged to add , with regret , that the last July interest was largely defaulted , because the land-owners , also , although thus magnified , developed a " capacity for resistance . " As the letter mildly put it , " Many of the land-owners refused to pay their assessments , and there is among them a large local popular sentiment favoring repudiation . " Having got all the benefit derivable from the bondholders ' money , they discovered , as usual , that the law was unconstitutional , and that , as they ; therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not repay it . The work was originally called the Sny Island levee , but was extended to about 40 miles in length . The bonds defaulted ; they were duly and regularly repudiated ; the law was declared unconstitutional ; the levee went into custody of the courts , and , therefore , it has not been kept in good repair . So now the break is extensivd , destroying thousands ' of acres of growing grain , and it may possibly appear , before the end , that honesty would have been the best policy . The bonds did not get a foothold in this market , but were quite largely taken in NewEngland . They were put out during the same inflation spell , in 1872-3 , which in Ohio rushed out nearly $6,000,000 of local railroad-aid bonds , under the " Boesal law , " during the year ending May 1 , 1873 . Under ordinary circumstances , such bonds as the Sny , being merely assessment bonds , " secured " only by a lien on potential property virtually to be created by the success of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice at them ; the purchasers really became special partners in a scheme to reclaim Mississippi lowlands , with no liability beyond their investment , to be sure , but with distant and unknown parties to manage the business and pay over their share of the proceeds , provided disposition and ability both existed . This was the fact of the case ; the apparent case was simply buying a gilt bond , " sure " to be solid and safe , and under the craze of those years men put their savings in them , without knowledge or even inquiry , just as they did into railroad bonds , and as they are now doing with mining stocks . It seems to be not in vain , after all , to spread the net in sight of some birds , if only a thin sprinkling of meal is on it .
