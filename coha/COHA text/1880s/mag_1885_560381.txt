OXE afternoon in June , 1843 , while I was at West Point , a candidate for admission to the Military Academy , I wandered into the riding hail , where the members of the graduating class were going through their final mounted exercises before Major Richard Delafield , the distinguished engineer , then superintendent , the Academic Board , and a large assemblage of spectators . When the regular services were completed , the class , still mounted , was formed in line through the center of the hall , the riding-master placed the leaping-bar higher than a man 's head , and called out " Cadet Grant ! " A clean-faced , slender , blue-eyed young fellow , weighing about 120 pounds , dashed from the ranks on a powerfully built chestnut-sorrel horse , and galloped down the opposite side of the hall . As he turned at the farther end and came into the straight stretch across which the bar was placed , the horse increased his pace , and , measuring his strides for the great leap before him , bounded into the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man and beast had been welded together . The spectators were breathless ! " Very well done , sir ! " growled " old Hershberger , " the riding-master , and the class was dismissed and disappeared ; but " Cadet Grant " remained a living image in my memory . A few months before graduation , one of Grant 's classmates , James A. ilardie , said to his friend and instructor , " Well , sir , if a great emergency arises in this country during our life-time , Sam . Grant will be the man to meet it . " * If I had heard ilardie 's prediction I doubt not I should have believed in it , for I thought the young man who could perform the feat of horsemanship I had witnessed , and wore a sword , could do anything . * In the summer of 1845 , only two years after Grant 's graduation , his classmate and room-mate , George Deshon , now a Catholic priest in New York City , said at West Point , in presence of Professor Kendrick and Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day prove to the Academic Board that he was the strongest man in his class . // I was in General Grant 's room in New York City on the 25th of May , 1885 . Forty years had elapsed since ilardie 's prediction was made , and it had been amply fulfilled . But , alas ! the hand of death was upon the hero of it . Though brave and cheerful , he was almost voiceless . Before him were sheets of his forthcoming book , and a few artist 's proofs of a steel engraving of himself made from a daguerreotype taken soon after his graduation . He wrote my name and his own upon one of the engravings and handed it to me . I said , " General , this looks as you did the first time I ever saw you . It was when you made the great jump in the riding exercises of your graduation . " " Yes , " he whispered , " I remember that very well . York was a wonderful horse . I could feel him gathering under me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you heard anything lately of Hershberger ? " I replied , " No , I never heard of him after he left West Point years ago . " " Oh , " said the general , " I have heard of him since the war . He was in Carlisle , old and poor , and I sent him a check for fifty dollars . " This early friendship had lived for forty years , and the old master was enabled to say near the close of his pupil 's career , as he had said at the beginning of it , " Very well done , sir1 " During the period of Grant 's official authority , I saw but little of him . I was not one of the so-called " Grant men " of the army . It was not until we were near neighbors in New York City , in 1881-5 , that I became well acquainted with him . At that time he was out of office , and the third term movement to restore him to the Presidency had failed . My acquaintance began with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not disturbed by partiality or interest . Grant was always free from arrogance of office , but in the little I had seen of him , prior to 1881 , I had not been able to get through the crust of his natural reserve or diffidence , and I was behind those who knew him well , in my estimate of his character and ability . By constant and free personal relations with him for the last three or four years of his life , and a fuller study of his career , I caught up and perceived the soundness of the exalted public judgment of this remarkable man . It may be said , without detracting from his merits , that perhaps a knowledge of his many good and great deeds has tended to make it somewhat the fashion , since Grant 's death , to try and lift him above all the imperfections of men . The sounder view is that he // was not free from human frailties , but was great in spite of them . He was what military men call " unsoldierly " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great general , and the most essential trait of soldiership , obedience , was next to a religion with him . He knew the value of discipline in an army , but he had neither taste nor aptitude for establishing or enforcing it , and instinctively relied more upon the man than upon the soldier . He loved and cherished his army associations above all others , but did , not like the profession of arms . In an interview with him last winter , I alluded to his lack of fondness for purely military affairs , whereupon he selected a sheet from the proofs which lay before him , and as evidence of his taste , pointed to a statement therein , to the effect that soon after he entered the army , in 1843 , he reviewed his West Point studies , in order to prepare himself for a professorship in some institution of learning and leave the military service . In disposition , Grant was patient , kind , and considerate . In manner , he was natural , quiet , and unassuming , somewhat diffident , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in showing off his acquiremeuts ; on the contrary , his acquirements did not appear until forced to the front , and then they showed him off without his knowing it . He was well educated , but it is probably true that the first impression he made upon strangers was that he was a plain man without elements of greatness . A closer acquaintance , however , hardly ever failed to create firm belief in his extraordinary reserve power . While truth , courage , tenacity , and self-reliance were his ruling traits , he had but little pride of opinion . He did not hesitate in choosing the best course , no matter who proposed it ; and in military affairs he would execute a plan prescribed by higher authority with as much vigor and fidelity as if it had been his own . He did not trouble himself about the past or the future , but concentrated all his faculties upon the matter he was at the moment called upon by his duty to deal with . Neither responsibility , nor turmoil , nor danger , nor pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or interrupted the steady flow of his intellect . The war is full of illustrations of his bravery and determination of character , and of his self-reliance and self-possession under trying circumstances . History does not record a more heroic personal effort than the one he made in writing a book , when he was in agony and on the verge of the grave , to rescue his family from the misfortunes that had befallen them . // Grant possessed some humor , and occasionally told a story , but rarely indulged in figures of speech , and did not exaggerate or emphasize even for the purpose of illustration . If he had any imagination it was kept under by his habit of literal truth . He nuia*1e 110 use of expletives and but little of adjectives . He would not have indulged in profane language even if he had possessed no religious scruples on the subject . Though he was not without temper and resentment , he was so patient and matter-of-fact , that he never felt inclined to damn things , as men , when sorely tried , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fluency , but he felt no obligation to talk for the mere purpose of entertaining the persons iu his presence . He spoke only because he had something to tell . Having no regard for forms of expression , he never , in writing or speaking , turned sentences for effect , nor could he dissemble or use words to mislead . If he did not wish to express his thoughts he was silent , and left people to draw their own inferences . He had unlimited faith in those whom he once took to his heart . His friendship was accompanied by the fullest confidence , and , when his choice was not wisely made , it served to facilitate and to shield evil practices , which it is the duty of that high sentiment to restrain ; and thus Grant 's friendship sometimes injured him who gave and him who received it . It was a principle with him never to abaudon a comrade " under fire ; " and a friend in disgrace , as well as a friend in trouble , could depend upon him until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Sunday evening , May 4 , 1883 , the day that he borrowed the hundred and fifty thousand dollars from Vanderbilt . He was very cheerful , and said to me , " I expect to have a game of cards on Tuesday night , and would be glad to have you come . " As I was taking my leave he repeated the invitation , but thinking the meeting might depend upon further arrangements , as sometimes happened , I thanked him , and said I would hold myself subject to his call . " No , " he replied , " do n't wait for further notice . Ward is certainly coming , and the party is made . " On Tuesday morning , about 11 o'clock , I met Grant by chance in a car going down-town . He was upon crutches on account of the accident he had met with some time before . He talked about persons and events of the war , without restraint , and was so much intereste din conversa // tion that he failed to get out at the station he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I shall expect you to-night . " By a singular coincidence we fell into the same car going up-town about 3 i. ii. , and I again seated myself by his side . After a few minutes of gloomy silence on his part , he said , " We will not have the meetlug I fixed for to-night ; I have bad news . " I replied , " Why , general , I hope it is nothing serious . " " Yes , " he continued , " the Marine Bank has failed or is about to fail . It owes our firm a large amount , and I suppose we are ruined . When I went downtown this morning I thought I was worth a great deal of money , now I do n't know that I have a dollar ; and probably my sons , too , have lost everything . " I had heard nothing of the financial crash which had occurred during the day . I said , " General , do you suspect Ward ? " He replied , " You know I expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the office any time to-day and assured me all was right , I should have believed him and gone home contented . But I waited until nearly 3 o'clock , and he did not appear . I do not know what to think . " He was not willing even then to accuse the knave in whom he had confided , and prior to that time , notwithstanding warnings which would have aroused a dishonest man , had no suspicion that villainy had been practiced . After he became aware of the truth , three or four days passed before the enormity of the disaster made its full impression upon him , but he never recovered from the shock of the deception and wrong practiced upon him by one of the basest creatures of the age . Grant 's self-reliance and integrity were so deeply seated and highly developed that it was difficult for him to make the wishes and opinions of others the basis of his own action in public affairs . Hence , though long a controlling factor in politics , he never was a politician . Destitute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recourse when urged to action he did not approve . Hence he was called silent , and sometimes even stolid . Prior to 1867 , Grant was nothing but a soldier . He regarded his election to the chief magistracy of the nation as a promotion , and did not at first realize that while the scope of his authority had been enlarged its nature had been changed , and that he could not govern the country as he had governed the army . He soon discovered that his forces , now political instead of military , could not be concentrated upon the line of operations he had laid down ; // and he promptly changed base to the party that elected him , and then advanced upon the new line with as much confidence and fidelity as if it had been his first choice . That movement consolidated his military prestige , his personal power , and the political strength of the Republican Party into a public force , of whichcontrary to the fated powerlessness of ex-Presidents generally-he was the real head to the day of his death , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equaled , in this country . When the change of base just mentioned became known , many of Grant 's old friends thought he had surrendered to the politicians , but he had not ; nor was his new course inconsistent with his self-reliance and stern sense of duty . He had become sensible of the fact that to enforce " no policy against the will of the people , " a part of public affairs had to be conducted according to the principles and dogmas of the dominant party ; and as far as he could clearly identify that part he let those whom he regarded as party leaders have it to themselves . But in all other matters-in fact , upon special occasions in these-he relied upon himself and acted up to his own sense of duty , and demanded " unconditional surrender " from all who opposed him . He not only crushed Charles Sumner , who ventured into revolt , but probably would have succeeded in preventing his return to the United States Senate , if that distinguished leader had not died before the time came for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war papers are not only his own composition , but many of them are in his own handwriting . His article in the NORTH AMERTCAYT REVIEW of November , 1882 , is an example of the rapidity with which he could write what he had to say , as well as of the clearness and force with which he expressed his meaning . It was commenced on the 24th of October , and was in the editor 's hands on the 25th . He said of it at the time : " It does not appear to me worthy of a place in a magazine of the standing of the NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW . It was dictated from notes prepared hastily . The subject , however , has become so famiJiar to me , that I think I have corn . mitted no error in the statement of facts . " Grant showed but little interest in abstruse subjects , and rarely took part in the discussion of them . His conversation was always marked by simplicity , and freedom from vanity , vainglory , and mock-modesty . His excellent memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting reminiscences which formed the staple of his conversation . He was wise , but , having no gifts as a debater , he could not shine in council . It was his nature or his habit , as heretofore stated , to concentrate his mind upon subjects which required his own action , or for which he was responsible . The prominence of these affairs , the precedence of the practical and personal over the theoretical and general , sometimes misled the public judgment as to his real power and ability . Like many great men , he required the pressure of necessity to bring out his strength . He could not dwell upon theories , or appear to advantage in hypothetical cases , and even in practical matters his mental processes were carried on beneath the surface . Until he was ready to act he gave no sign by word or expression of his own train of thought or the impression made upon him by others , though they might make him change his mind and induce action different from what he had intended . He generally adhered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinions . When he changed he went over without qualification or regard for consequences , and was not disturbed by lingering doubts or regrets . The Fitz-John Porter case served to exhibit one of Grant 's best traits-devotion to his own deliberate sense of duty , despite the temptations of interest , ease , and expediency . " Consistency is a jewel , " but so is truth , and to Grant the latter was more precious than the former . Porter 's claim that he had been wronged by the court-martial which convicted him in 1863 , and that new evidence to prove it would be presented if a hearing could be granted , was laid before Grant as early as 1867 , but the appeal was refused or neglected . As long as Grant was General-in-Chief of the army and President of the United States , with power to act effectively in redressing the alleged wrong , he accepted the verdict of the court-martial without understanding the record of that tribunal and the new evidence which Porter offered to produce . But in September , 1881 , when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York City , Porter asked an interview . To this Grant replied in writing , September 27 , 1881 " I will hear what you have to say , and will endeavor to listen without prejudice ; and if convinced that I was wrong in former opinions , entertained and possibly expressed , I would be willing to correct them . " // The result was that Grant agreed to study the whole case , including the record of the court-martial , and state his conclusions . The investigation , which was prolonged till December 19 , convinced him that a great wrong had been done , and he became deeply distressed that he had not mastered the subject while he was in power . Then , regardless of the inconsistent attitude in which his change of mind placed him , and the antagonisms it created , he devoted all of his ability and influence to procure for Porter the justice he thought due him . In a letter dated November 3 , 1883 , which was given to the public , he said to Porter " I did believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the East , that a cordial support was not given him by them . . . I supposed you had shared in this feeling . . . . Until 1881 , when I re-examined for myself , my belief was that on the 29th of August , 1862 , a great battle was fought between General Pope commanding the Union forces , and General Jackson commanding the Confederate forces ; and that you with a corps of twelve or more thousand men stood in a position across the right flank of Jackson , and where you could easily get into his rear ; that you received an order to do so about 5 or 5.30 o'clock , which you refused to obey because of clouds of dust in your front , which you contended indicated an enemy in superior force to you ; that you allowed Pope to get beaten while you stood idly looking on without raising an arm to help him . With this understanding , and without a doubt as to the correctness of it , I condemned you . " Then he proceeded to give the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his regret that he had not made the investigation while he was in office , and added " As long as I have a voice it shall be raised in your support , without any reference to its effect upon me or others . " On the 30th of December , 1881 , he replied as follows to a letter from Senator Logan : " My DEAR GENERAL : " I have your letter of yesterday . It is true that I have re-examined the proceedings of the court-martial and court of inquiry in Fitz-John Porter 's case , and believe sincerely that I have done him an injustice , and have so written to the President . When I gave General Porter the letter , I requested him to send you a copy . If he has not done so he will , or I will . That letter will explain all I would otherwise write you on this subject . I reluctantly came to the conclusion I did , but was convinced beyond all preconceived notions , and felt it due to an accused man to say so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dated February 4 , 1882 , he said : " My whole object now is to benefit you ; and to this end I am willing to do anything that is truthful . " Grant was slow to take offense , was not malicious , and did not hastily resent wrongs ; but animosity sometimes found its way to his heart , and when rooted there it was as hardy as his friendship , though it did not assert itself in action unless specially invited by circumstances . His course towards his old associates of the regular army , while he was in power , affords many illustrations of his friendship , and possibly a few of the other kind . One of the bulletins which he issued during his last sickness announced that he desired the good-will of all ; and he closed a letter from Mt . McGregor , dated June 22 , 1885 , with the words : " I am not willing to do any one an injustice , and if convinced that I have done one , I am always willing to make the fullest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but was no doubt the whole truth ; and was quite as far as he was disposed to go . He had to be " convinced " that he had done injustice before he was willing to advance towards reconcilations . Some of his opinions of men were founded in error or misunderstanding , and some of his feelings possibly in prejudice ; but as he believed they were right , i1 was not in the power of approaching death to make him surrender them . Mr. U. W. Childs has said : " General Grant always felt that he was badly treated by Halleck . During my long friendship with him I never heard him more than two or three times speak unkindly of Halleck . " Grant was unjustly accused after the capture of Donelson , and was dissatisfied with the treatment he received ; but his animosity towards Halleck , born at IDonelson , got its growth afterwards . The lapse of time and the whirl of events probably disqualified him for fixing the exact course of it , and confused him as to the time when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Shiloh article , after it had appeared in print , one of the persons present asked me whether it was true , as reported , that Buell was going to answer General Grant . I replied " I do not understand that he is going to answer General Grant , but he will write an article giving an account of the battle . " // I then said to Grant : " General , you and Buell will never agree about the battle of Shioli , but in a recent letter to me , Buell spoke most kindly of you , saying , among other things , that when you and he were young together in the army you had , as he expressed it , attractive , even endearing qualities . ' " I waited for response , but in vain . Grant remained silent . I construed his action upon this and a subsequcnt occasion to mean that the remarks commendatory of Buell 's character and ability , made in the Shiloh article , conveyed all he chose to express upon that subject as it then stood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt bestowed upon Sherman , McPherson , and Sheridan . The day before he started from Nashville to Washington , in March , 1864 , to receive his commission as lieutenant-general , Grant wrote a letter to Sherman expressing a full sense of his obligations to subordinates , and saying : " I want to express my thanks to you and McPherson as the men to whom , above all others , I feel indebted for whatever I have had of success . . . . I feel all the gratitude this letter would express , giving it the most flattering construction . The word you , I use in the plural , intending it for McPherson also . " Grant had antipathies as well as attachments . His relations to his generals would form a striking chapter of history ; and an interesting part of it would be the story of the estrangement between him and Hancock . In his account of the battle of Shiloh published in the " Century Magazine , " Grant said : " The enemy had hardly started in retreat from his last position , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a division of troops coming up in beautiful order as if going on parade or review . The commander was at the head of the column , and the staff seemed to be bestowed about as they would have been had they been going on parade . When the head of the column came near where I was standing , it was halted , and the commanding officer , General A. MeD . MeCook , rode up to where I was , and appealed to me not to send his division any farther , saying that they were worn out with marching and fighting . . . . It was not , however , the rank and file or the junior officers who asked to be excused , but the division commander . " This was a remarkable error , and did great injustice to MeCook . Grant , soon after the publication of the foregoing statement , and // subsequently in the " Century Magazine , " admitted the injustice of it , but said nothing as to how he happened to make the mistake . Not long after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general I thought he had fallen into it by merging two occasions into one through a lapse of memory-that McCook 's division did march in column and in dress parade order , from the river to the line of battle , and it made a fine spectacle , but it was quite early in the morning of the second day 's fight . That , no doubt , was the spectacle which impressed itself upon the general 's memory . But at that time the enemy had not " started in retreat from his last position . " Indeed , the only question , then , was whether we conid beat him , not whether we would pursue him . McCook 's division , after marching up in column in dress parade order , formed line , attacked , and was actively engaged the rest of the day , and it was not until evening , when the enemy had been defeated , that the question of pursuit arose . " Then , " I said to Grant , " you probably saw McCook a second time , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He admitted the probability that the explanation was correct . When the second session of the last Congress began , a bill for the retirement of Grant as general of the army had passed the Senate , and was before the House , the Fitz-John Porter bill had been vetoed , and Grant , though a wreck financially and physically , had written to Porter , July 4 " You can scarcely conceive the pain it caused me to read the veto of your bill by the President yesterday . I was not prepared for it . This message is the merest sophistry . it is , no doubt , a great disappointment to you and your family , but I believe it will result ultimately in doing you full justice . You were dismissed unjustly , and you are entitled to restoration . Be of good cheer , and pray that justice may yet be done you and yours . " This letter , of course , was not known to the President , but in the condition of affairs just set forth , President Arthur , in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in recognition of the eminent services of Ulysses S. Grant , late general of the armies of the United States , and twice President of this nation , the Congress confer upon him a suitable pension . " // President did not favor a bill to place Grant on the retired list of the army . Grant , in a letter to Senator Mitchell , dated December 5 , 1884 , requested that the pension bill be withdrawn , and said he would not accept a pension if the bill should pass and be approved . This ended the pension movement . The well-deserved boon of retirement came at last , and with a unanimity and public approval that made it welcome , and the dying hero received it gratefully . The time has not come for final judgment of Grant . He had great abilities and great opportunities . Chance is undoubtedly an important factor in the race of glory , and perhaps it favored Grant in the war of rebellion . General Sherman goes so far as to have said since Grant 's death , that , " had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history after Donelson ; " but that is conjecture . Grant was one of the " singular few 's who possessed qualities which probably would have gained for him a high place in history , no matter who had lived to compete with him in our great war . No man was known by reputation , and personally , to so many men of his time as Grant . The nations of the earth read of him , saw him , and judged him . After the fame of his great deeds had spread over the world , he traveled through both hemispheres , and received the willing and unstinted homage of men high and low in various climes and countries . The record of what he has said and what he has done must place him high in the roll of the world 's great men . Posterity will see to that . We who knew him face to face may bear witness to what he was in himself . We need not inquire to what extent he imbibed and assimilated the wisdom , the knowledge , or the morality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and staff officers , such as McPherson , and Rawlins , and Wilson , and Bowers . Undoubtedly with him , as with other men , the surrounding influences of his life had much to do with making him what he was . lie endured disappointment , humiliation , and poverty ; he was tempted by military success and glory , and encountered the rivalries , the jealousies , the intrigues of ambitions and aspiring generals ; he floated for years upon the high tide of popular favor and good fortune , and then fell through the evil of others , and was wrongfully and cruelly dashed against the rocks of financial discredit and ruin ; and finally , while tried by prolonged and excruciating physical torture , he made an effort , // unsurpassed in its heroism , to restore the fortunes of his family by the work of his own brain and hand . What did the duties , the obligations , the temptations , the sorrows , the struggles of life , make of this man ? One of the truest , strongest , bravest , human entities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
