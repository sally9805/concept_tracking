txt A good degree of success is reported by the Commissioners who have charge of the negotiations designed to open for settlement the surplus lands of the Minnesota Chippewas . There are ten bands of this tribe , exclusive of those in Wisconsin and Dakota , whom it is hoped to include in the proposed arrangement . The plan is to concentrate them on two reservations , one at White Earth and one at Red Lake , where they will take farms in severalty , while the surplus lands will be sold and the net proceeds be deposited in the Treasury to the credit of the tribe . Five per cent . interest will be paid on this fund , to be expended annually in agricultural , mechanical , and educational improvements , and after half a century the principal is to be paid . over to the tribe . Taking the many small agency reservations given up and the reduction of the larger ones , the greater part of the present Chippewa lands would thus be thrown open to sale and settlement . The Indians would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average under the homestead laws , and with their increased annuities they could relieve themselves from the poverty and distress which since the disappearance of game in their neighborhood have afflicted several of the bands . The legislation for this purpose began under President CLEVELAND . with the appointment of the Northwest Indian Commission , the first part of whose enumerated duties was to treat with the Minnesota Chippewas for their concentration and for the purchase of their surplus lands . Judge WRIGHT , Bishop WHIPPLE , and Mr. C. F. LARRABEE of the Indian Office were the Commissioners , and found at the outset several untoward circumstances . The Government was bound to further indemnify some of the bands whom it had already partly compensated for having several years before authorized the construction of dams or storage reservoirs at the headwaters of the Mississippi , which by their overflows had ruined the growing crops of sundry Indians , had practically taken possession of large tracts , and had also injured the fish ponds from which a large part of the food supply was derived . Then the whites were accused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possess themselves of the valuable timber . Some of the Chippewas thought there was malice in these encroachments , and the Commissioners suspected that certain destructive forest fires between Cass Lake and Red Lake were set by the Indians out of anger and revenge , although the red man charged them upon the white , and the probability is that they were the result of carelessness or accident . The upshot was that the Commissioners made liberal provisions for compensating the Indians for the overflow of their lands , and then executed two agreements for concentration and purchase . But the Fiftieth Congress did . not exactly like these agreements . To begin with , several bands , notably the Mille Lacs , Bois Fort . and Grand.Portage , . had positively refused to remove from their homes to White Earth , so that the plan had not been perfectly carried out , although seven bands had consented to it . Accordingly a new scheme was drawn up for further negotiations which should be more comprehensive . Under this plan , last Spring , ex-Senator RICE , Bishop MARTY , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check at the outset from the hostilities between the Swedes at Mora and the Mille Lacs band , which was one of those that had refused to remove before , although its condition was deplorable . However , the Commissioners soon afterward went to Red Lake ; and there , after encountering a preliminary refusal , seem to have been entirely successful . They procured the consent of that band to sell:about two-thirds of its reservation , including large tracts of valuable pine lands . The news of this preliminary step was greeted with bonfires and rejoicings by the people of Red Lake Falls . The Commissioners , however , have still a Summer 's work before them with the other bands whose consent is required for the plan . If all goes well , about two thousand square miles of Chippewa land will be open to settlement , while the various bands will get a far better annual supply of cattle , seeds , and farm and household utensils and other property than they have now .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
