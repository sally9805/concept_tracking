txt The amendments to the rules of the Assembly submitted yesterday by the Speaker and adopted by that body do not go so far as Mr. MISTED 'S speech of the day before would have led one to expect . Brief as that speech was , the programme laid down . in it was sufficiently ambitious . Mr. RUSTED suggested the addition to the standing committees of the Assembly of Committees upon Taxation , Labor , and Excise . The suggestion was based upon the importance of these subjects . Their importance can not be disputed , but it by no means follows that it should be recognized in the manner proposed by the Speaker . The Legislature is not a suitable body for contributing to discussions of the principles upon which taxation should be levied . It is true that the burdens of taxation are imposed unequally . This city is made to pay more than its share of the taxes of the State under color of a system of appraisal for assessment devised and applied by a body in which the city is not represented . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct by the appointment of a committee or otherwise . Even if it were in the power , it would not be in the will , of a body of which the representatives of the aggrieved city constituted so small a part , to relieve the city of its burdens , seeing that the city can be relieved only . by the transfer of part of its burdens to the country districts , now too lightly taxed . The representatives of these districts , comprising an overwhelming majority of the Legislature , will not agree to any- system , however scientific it may seem or however equitable it may be , which promises to relieve the city at the expense of the country . The question of excise is , in a manner , upon the same footing with the question of taxation . That is to say , the needs and interests of the people in urban and rural communities respectively differ so widely that a committee fairly representative of both descriptions of communities ' would be hopelessly divided against itself . It is only in this city that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nine men out of ten who have paid any attention to the subject , and whose opinions are not warped by the special interest of liquor dealers , are agreed upon the kind of excise law that the city requires . But such an excise law would be entirely unsuitable to the rural parts of the State , and perhaps to its other cities , with the exception of Brooklyn ; and a committee fairly representative of the State at large would be hopelessly divided against itself upon the question of a general excise law . A committee on labor in the Assembly could lay the nature of the case , con- tribute nothing of value to the settlement either of the labor problem in general : ox of Ally individual labor problem in particular . That fact has been well enough demonstrated in the course of the Legislature with reference , for example , to prison labor . The temptation to make demagogical bids for the support of " the laboring classes , " without regard to fact or justice , would be , as it has been , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New-York . It is thus unlikely that ' any one of the three committees recommended by Mr. MISTED would be of any considerable public value , interesting and important as the subject matter proposed to be committed to them no doubt is . It is gratifying to remark that the actual proposals of the Speaker are much more modest in scope , and that they commended themselves to the . judgment of the Assembly . They include provision for a committee on excise , indeed , but this , if it can do little good , is not likely to do much harm . They include also a Committee on Appropriations , which is useful , as it is in Congress , as tending to concentrate the responsibility for the expenditure of public money , and thus operating as a check upon extravagance . The most important , however , of the new committees authorized is that on the Revision of Bills . It is discreditable to the Legislature that there should be a necessity for such a committee , but of the necessity there is unfortunately no doubt . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least , has found it necessary to veto bills on account of the slovenliness with which they were drawn or the ignorance of existing laws which they betrayed . It has often happened that a Governor has been forced by such defects to veto bills with the objects of which he was in sympathy . Why the Democrats in the Assembly should have objected to so proper and necessary a provision is not clear , unless their reason was that the sending of bills to the Governor in a decent shape would deprive a Democratic Governor of the opportunity of making political capital out of the shortcomings of a Republican Legislature . But this motive is too factious and discreditable to be avowed , one would imagine , even in the State Legislature . The Committee on Revision ought by all means to be appointed as soon as possible , and composed of the best material the Legislature affords . The minor changes in the rules seem all to be in the direction of a more punctual and orderly dispatch of the public business .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
