" NEW ENGLAND IN THE COLONIAL PERIOD . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his departure from the infant colony of Virginia . By a curious destiny the fame of this gallant though garrulous hero is associated with the beginnings of both the southern and the northern portions of the United States . To Virginia Smith gave its very existence as a colony ; to New England he gave a name . In 1614 he came over with two ships to what was then sometimes known as " North Virginia , " explored its coast minutely from the mouth of the Penobscot to Cape Cod , and thinking it a sufficiently extensive country to be worthy of a name of its own , rechristened it New England . On his return home he engaged in the service of the Plymouth Company , and again set sail for the New World in 1615 , but was taken prisoner by a French fleet , and carried about on a long cruise , and finally set on shore at Rochelle , whence , without a penny in his pocket , he contrived to make his way back to England . Perhaps Smith 's life of extreme excitement and hardship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varied experience he was now only in his thirty-seventh year , but he does not seem to have gone on any more voyages . The remaining sixteen years of his life were spent quietly in England in writing books , publishing maps , and otherwise stimulating the public interest in the colonization of the New World . But as for the rocky coast of New England , which he had explored and named , he tells us that he is not " so simple as to think that any other motive than wealth will ever erect there a commonwealth , or draw company from their ease and humors at home , to stay in New England . " But in this opinion the bold explorer was altogether mistaken . There were forces at work in the English world the value of which a man of Smith 's peculiar character and training could in no wise* properly estimate . During the first two decades of the seventeenth century several trading parties undertook to make a settlement in New England , but all failed disastrously . Of all migrations of peoples , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the almighty dollar ' played the smallest part , however important it may since have become as a motive power . It was left for religious enthusiasm to achieve what commercial enterprise had failed to accomplish . The democratic civilization of New England is the greatest legacy which Puritanism has left to the world . In the general movement toward Puritanism which characterized the reign of Elizabeth there had sprung up a peculiar sect of Christians , which , along with the theology of Calvin and the adop // tion of many quaint notions of Jewish coloring , had come nearer than any other sect had yet done toward carrying Protestant principles consistently into practice . In ecclesiastical polity they had carried the English plan of local self-government so far as to give each congregation full control of its own affairs , leaving the unity of the Church to be maintained only through common allegiance to Christ and - common acceptance of the Bible as the rule of faith . The persecution of these so-called Independents was begun in Elizabeth 's time , and under James was carried on so vigorously as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land of religious liberty . In 1608 an Independent congregation from Scrooby , in Nottinghamshire , fled to Leyden , and staid there ten years , - growing steadily through fresh accessions , until it occurred to them that if they could be allowed to settle on the lands of the Virginia Company in America they might make the beginnings of a great Christian community . The king refused them a charter , but made no objections to their going , herein showing himself less of a bigot than Louis XIV. , who would not suffer a Huguenot to set foot in Canada , though the land was teeming with Huguenots who would have been only too glad to go . The first detachment of these Independents came over in 1620 in the Mayflower , and founded the colony of Plymouth . They aimed at the coast of New Jersey , but by fortunate accidents reached a point where they were much less likely to be molested , either by the natives or by rival colonists . Their grant from the old Virginia Company was useless , as they - settled beyond its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year from the North Virginia , or Plymouth Company . This grant was not made to them directly , but to a small corporation of London merchants , to which the Plymouth Company gave up all its rights in the territory settled by the new colonists . For a few years this London corporation took charge of the colonization of the new Plymouth ; but in 1627 the settlers , wishing to be entirely independent , bought up all the - stock of the London corporation , and paid for it by installments from the fruits of their own labor . By 1633 they had paid everything up , and become the undisputed - owners of the country they had occupied , so that there was nothing now to hinder their prosperity . For many years their history was entirely peaceful . If they had landed in New Jersey , they would probably have been molested on the one hand by the Dutch settlers of New Netherlands , and on the other hand by the Delaware Indians , who had not yet been tamed by the terrible Iroquois . But in the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rivals , and the Indian population about them was very scanty , having been nearly extirpated a few years before by a frightful pestilence . Under these favorable circumstancesfreed alike from all neighboring hostility , from the joint-stock company which they had paid up , and from the king who ignored their existence  --  the Plymouth colony throve apace , until by 1643 it numbered more than three thousand inhabitants . Fortunate as these colonists were , however , their progress was in no way able to compete with that of the neighboring settlement of Massachusetts . In 1627 , encouraged by the success of the Plymouth settlers , the project of colonizing New England was taken up afresh by a remarkable body of men of wealth , culture , and high social position , including many leaders of the Puritan party . They purchased a large tract of land of the Plymouth Company , and got a charter from Charles I. , incorporating them as the Company of Massachusetts Bay . The affairs of this new company were to be managed by a governor , deputy-governor , and eighteen assistants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could make any laws they liked for their settlers , provided they did not contravene the laws of England . But the place where the company was to hold its meetings was not mentioned in the charter . Accordingly , in 1630 , the company decided to take its charter over to New England and hold its meetings there . This was a step of the very greatest importance , because the men who founded Massachusetts were highly educated and wealthy men , bent upon putting into practice a grand political idea ; and it was a great thing for them to have obtained a charter which ( albeit through negligence ) enabled them to come away to New England , and found a colony in accordance with their own enlightened views , making such political and ecclesiastical arrangements as they liked , without fear of let or hinderance from the home government . As a recent English historian observes : " By looking at the // colony of Massachusetts , we can see what sort of a commonwealth was constructed by the best men of the Puritan party , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of England if they could have had their way unchecked . " * Some twenty years ago we used to hear a great deal about " mudsills " and " F. F. V. s " - slang terms implying that the people of Virginia , or of the Southern States in general , were of more aristocratic origin than the people of New England , and were accordingly entitled to look down upon them . " We are the gentlemen of this country , " said Robert Toombs in 1860 . This assumption was thoroughly baseless . In point of fact the English ancestors of the Washingtons , the Randolphs , the Fairfaxes , and the Talbots were no higher in social position than the families of the Winthrops , the Dudleys , the Eatons , and the Saltonstalls . The foremost families which came to New England were of precisely the same rank with the foremost families which came to Virginia , and in many instances there was relationship between the former and the latter . So far as mere names go , this is well illustrated in Bishop Meade 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names as Allen , Baldwin , Bradley , Bowdoin , Carrington , Cooper , Dabney , Davenport , Farley , Gibbon , Holmes , Hubbard , Lee , Morton , Meade , Nelson , Newton , Parker , Russell , Selden , Spencer , Talbot , Tyler , Vaughan , Walton , Ward , Wilcox , and Wythe -- every one of which is a name of frequent occurrence in New England . Two-thirds of the names in Bishop Meade 's list occur also in Savage 's Dictionary of the Settlers of New England . Most of the leaders of the Massachusetts colonists were country gentlemen of good fortune ; several of them were either related or connected by marriage with the nobility ; the greater part of them had taken degrees at Cambridge , and accordingly one of the first things that naturally occurred to them was to found a new Cambridge in the New World . If they had remained in England , many of them would have gone into Parliament with Hampden and Cromwell , and would have risen to distinction under the Commonwealth . So much for the leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass of the settlers in Massachusetts and Connecticut * Doyle , llustory of the United States , p. 73. with the mass of the settlers in Virginia , the advantage is altogether on the side of the northern colonies . The settlement of Virginia , like that of most colonies at all times , was determined mainly by straitened circumstances at home . While the leaders were thinking of molesting the Spaniards , or opening new avenues of trade , their followers were thinking of getting something to put into their mouths . The settlement of Virginia , especially , was determined by the prospects of sudden wealth which attended the cultivation of tobacco . For economical reasons the beginning of the seventeenth century in England was a time that was ripe for emigration . During the faurteenth and fifteenth centuries the Black Death and other epidemics had kept down the population of England ; but during the Tudor period the population had increased very rapidly , until at the death of Elizabeth it numbered nearly five millions . At the present day that little island can find employment and food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufactures and its bountiful mines , and because through its policy of free trade it commands the markets of the whole world . But in the sixteenth century England for the most part fed itself , and just at that . time , when population was increasing so rapidly , the supply of food and the supply of work were both diminishing . The wool trade at that time began to be found so profitable that great tracts of land which had formerly been subject to tillage were year by year turned into pastures for sheep . This process not only raised the price of food , but it deprived many people of employment , as sheepfarming requires fewer hands than tilling the soil . Hence pauperism increased rapidly during the latter half of the sixteenth century ; and as Henry VIII . had destroyed all the monasteries and confiscated their revenues , the poor people could no longer find a refuge there , and get a scanty support out of the vast wealth of the Church ; so that , naturally enough , we find the English poor-laws beginning in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seventeenth century there were a great many men in England who were quite disheartened by poverty and demoralized by idleness . Under such circumstances men who remain struggling with the conditions of life in a complex community that has // ceased to have any need of their labor usually descend to recruit the ranks of the criminal class . Their best chance of salvation lies in migration to a new colony , where there is a great demand for labor , and where past circumstances are forgotten , so that life may be in a measure begun anew . The immense development of the English commercial and naval marine during the seventeenth century , due principally to intercourse with the thriving American colonies , greatly increased the opportunities of employment , and went far toward diminishing the numbers of the needy and idle class . Many of the sons of the men who had been driven from their farms by the wool trade made their home upon the ocean , and helped secure for their nation the dominion over the watery pathways . Many of them , all through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as landed proprietors became even more independent and thrifty than they could have been as tenant-farmers in England . While search for the physical means of subsistence is thus in most cases the principal motive for emigration , and was a principal motive in the case of most of the American colonies , the settlement of Massachusetts does not seem to have been determined to any appreciable extent by such a cause . Neither would it be quite correct to describe the founders of Massa chusetts as driven from England by persecution , like the men who settled Plymouth . The men who came over in 1630 with Winthrop were mostly well-to-do farmers from Lincolnshire , Norfolk , and Suffolk-men who were making a good living at home ; and they came at a time when Puritanism was waxing strong and militant , when it was nearly ready to try conclusions with the king and the bishops , when , if they had remained at home , they might indeed have been persecuted , but not with impunity . They came for the purpose of realizing a noble though incomplete ideal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time characterized them-an exclusiveness which had both its good and its bad side . They attached such great importance to regular industry and sedate and decorous behavior that for a long time the needy and shiftless people who usually make trouble in new colonies were not tolerated among them . Hence the early history of Massachusetts is remarkably free from those scenes of violence and disorder which have so often made hideous the first years of new communities . On the other hand , the strictness with which the Puritan colonists sought to realize their theocratic ideal of society resulted sometimes in reprehensible intolerance . In their restriction of the rights of citizenship to church members , in their prohibition of episcopal forms of worship , and in their rough treatment of the Quakers , the Puritans of Massachusetts showed that they had not yet fully comprehended the principles of Protestantism-just as in their prosecution of the Salem witches they showed how long it takes for civilized Christians to divest themselves of the mental habits of pagans and savages . All things considered , then , the character of the emigration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respectability . Like the best part of the emigration to Virginia , it consisted of country squires and yeomen , but with this difference in its favor , that a principle of selection had been at work whereby the squires and yeomen who followed Winthrop had approved themselves men of exceptionally serious and lofty characters , with minds that had been purified through steadfast devotion to a noble and unselfish ideal . On the other hand , the lower orders of society that we have contemplated in Virginia never had any existence in the New England colonies . Of negro slaves there were very few , and these were employed wholly in domestic service ; there were not enough of them to be worth mentioning as a class in New England society . Neither were there any convicted felons , such as were shipped in such abundance to the southern colonies , to become the progenitors of the " white trash . " Massachusetts and Connecticut would not admit such people on any terms . There were a few indented white servants usually of the class known as " redemptioners , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves to service for a stated time in order to defray the cost of their voyage from Europe . There were many of these " redemptioners " in the middle colonies , but very few in New England ; and as they had come to a land where no sort of disgrace was attached to manual labor , they usually became thrifty farmers as soon as their terms of service had expired , and thus ceased to be recognizable as a distinct class of society . Thus , // as regards their social derivation , the people of New England were homogeneous in character to an unparalleled degree , and they were drawn from the very sturdiest part of the English stock . In all history there has been no other instance of a colony so exclusively peopled by picked and chosen men . The colonists knew this , and were proud of it , as well they might be . It was the simple truth that was spoken by William Stoughton when he said , in his election sermon in 1688 : " God sifted a whole nation that He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population of New England was as homogeneous in blood as it was in social condition . The Puritan migration we are here considering was purely and exclusively English ; there was nothing in it at first that was either Irish , Scotch , or Welsh , nothing that came from the continent of Europe . It began in 1620 with the founding of Plymouth . It reached its maximum between 1630 and 1640 , when the first settlements were made in Massachusetts , Connecticut , Rhode Island , and New Hampshire . After the meeting of the Long Parliament in 1640 , the Puritans found so much work cut out for them at home that the emigration to New England suddenly ceased . By this time 21,000 Englishmen had settled in New England , and this population " thenceforward multiplied on its own soil in remarkable seclusion from other communities for nearly a century and a half . " * During the whole of this period New England received but few immigrants , and " it was not till the last quarter of the eighteenth century that those swarms began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a portion of the territory of the Unit- ed States . " Three times between the meeting of the Long Parliament and the meeting of the First Continental Congress did the New England colonies receive a slight infusion of non-English blood . In 1652 , after his victories at Dunbar and Worcester , Cromwell sent 270 of his Scottish prisoners to Boston , where the descendants of some of them still dwell . After the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685 , 150 families of Huguenots came to Massachusetts . And finally , in 1719 , 120 families ef Scotch Presbyterians came over from the north of Ireland , and settled in Lon * Paifrey , New England* Introduction . voL . LXvI. - No . S91. -8 donderry in New Hampshire , and elsewhere . In view of these facts it may be said that there is not a county in England of which the population is more thoroughly English than was the population of New England at the end of the eighteenth century . From long and careful research , Mr. Savage , the highest authority on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the New England people at that time could trace their origin to England in the strictest sense , excluding even Wales . Every English county from Northumberland to Cornwall , from Cumberland to Kent , contributed to the emigration ; but the great majority came from Lincolnshire , Norfolk , Suffolk , and Essex in the east , and from Devonshire and Dorset in the southwest . The counties first settled in Massachusetts were named Norfolk , Suffolk , Essex , and Middlesex , while Boston , or " St. Botolph 's town , " in Lincoinshire , gave its name to the greatest of the Puritan cities . I have dwelt somewhat explicitly upon this question of the origin of the men of New England , because it is really a matter of great interest for us , both as citizens of the United States and as students of history . These 21,000 English Puritans , who came over to New England before the meeting of the Long Parliament , have now increased to nearly 13,000,000 . According to the most careful estimates , at least one-fourth of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is descended from these men . Striking as this fact may seem , it is perhaps less striking than the fact of the original migration when we stop to contemplate it in its full meaning . In these times , when great steamers are sailing every day from European ports , bringing hundreds of emigrants to a country which is at least as far advanced in material civilization as the country which they leave , the arrival of a thousand new citizens each day has come to be a commonplace event . But in the seventeenth century the transfer of 21,000 well-to-do people within twenty years from their comfortable homes in England to the American wilderness was by no means a commonplace event . It assumed somewhat the character of the migration of a whole people . In the quaint thought of some of our forefathers themselves it was aptly likened to the exodus of Israel from the Egyptian house of bondage . I have said that in this great exodus a // principle of selection was at work which insured an extraordinary uniformity of character and of purpose among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete homogeneity of race , is due the preponderance early acquired and ever since maintained by New England in the history of the American people . In view of this , it is worth while to inquire what were the real aims of the settlers of New England . What was the common purpose which brought these men together in their resolve to create for themselves new homes in the wilder-ness ? This is a point concerning which there has been a great deal of popular misapprehension , and there has been a great deal of nonsense talked about it . It has been customary first to assume that the Puritan migration was undertaken in the interests of religious liberty , and then to upbraid the Puritans for forgetting all about religious liberty as soon as people came among them who disagreed with their opinions . But this view of the case is not supported by history . It is quite true that the Puritans were to a certain extent chargeable with intolerance ; but it is not true that in this they were guilty of any inconsistency . The notion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establishing religious liberty , in any sense in which we should understand such a phrase , is entirely incorrect . It is neither more nor less than a bit of popular legend . If we mean by the phrase " religious liberty " a state of things in which opposite or contradictory opinions on questions of religion shall exist side by side in the same community , and in which everybody shall decide for himself how far he will conform to the customary religious observances , nothing could have been further from their thoughts . There is nothing they would have regarded with more genuine abhorrence . If they could have been forewarned by a prophetic voice of the general freedom-or , as they would have termed it , license-of thought and behavior which prevails in this country to-day , I think it not unlikely that they would have abandoned their enterprise in despair , and would have remained in England . The philosophic student of history often has occasion to see how God is wiser than man . In other words , he is often brought to realize how fortunate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not foresee the remote results of the labors to which they have zealously consecrated their lives . It is part of the irony of human destiny that the end we really accomplish by striving with might and main is apt to be something quite different from the end we dreamed of as we started on our arduous labor . So it was with the Puritan settlers of New England . The religious liberty that we enjoy to-day is largely the consequence of their work ; but it is a consequence that was unforeseen , while the direct and conscious aim of their labors was something that has never been realized , and probably never will be . There is no better way of finding out what Winthrop and his friends had in mind when they came to Massachusetts than to consult their own written words . And when we do this we see at once that their aim was the construction of a theocratic state which should be to Christians , under the New Testament dispensation , all that the theocracy of Moses and Joshua and Samuel had been to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all intents and purposes freed from the jurisdiction of the Stuart king , and so far as possible the text of the Holy Scriptures should be their guide both in weighty matters of general legislation and in the shaping of the smallest details of daily life . In such a scheme there was no room for religious liberty as we understand it . No doubt the text of the Scriptures may be interpreted in many ways , but among all these men there was a substantial agreement as to all important points , and nothing could have been further from their thoughts than to found a colony which should afford a field for new experiments in the art of right living . The state they were to found was to consist of a united body of believers ; citizenship itself was to be co-extensive with church membership ; and in such a state there was apparently no more room for heretics than there was in Rome or Madrid . This was the idea which drew Winthrop and his followers from England at a time when they might have staid there and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross the ocean and found a new state . Such an ideal as this , considered by itself and apart from the concrete acts in which it was historically manifested , may seem like the merest fanaticism . But we can not dismiss in this summary way a // movement which has been at the source of all that is greatest in American history : mere fanaticism has never produced such substantial results . Mere fanaticism is sure to aim at changing the constitution of human society in some essential point , to undo the work of evolution , and offer in some indistinctly apprehended fashion to remake human life . But in these respects the Puritans were intensely conservative . The impulse by which they were animated was a profoundly ethical impulse  --  the desire to lead godly lives , and to drive out sin from the community-the same ethical impulse which animates the glowing pages of Hebrew poets and prophets , and which has given to the history and literature of Israel their commanding influence in the world . The Greek , says Matthew Arnold , held that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mark ; but the Hebrew held that it was to serve the Lord day and night . It was a touch of this inspiration that the Puritan caught from his earnest and reverent study of the sacred text , and that served to justify and intensify his yearning for a better life , and to give it the character of a grand and holy ideal . Yet , with all this religious enthusiasm , the Puritan was in every fibre a practical Englishman , with his full share of plain common-sense . He avoided the error of medieval anchorites and mystics in setting an exaggerated value upon otherworldliness . In his desire to win a crown of glory hereafter he did not forget that the present life has its simple duties , in the exact performance of which the welfare of society mainly consists . He equally avoided the error of modern radical reformers who would remodel the fundamental institutions of property and of the family , and would thus disturb the very groundwork of our ethical ideals . The Puritan 's ethical conception of society was simply that which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and which in its essential points is therefore intelligible to all men , and approved by the commonsense of men , however various may be the terminology - whether theological , metaphysical , or scientific-in which it is expounded . For these reasons there was nothing essentially fanatical or impracticable in the Puritan scheme : in substance it was something that great bodies of men could at once put into practice , while its quaint and peculiar form was something that could be easily and naturally outgrown and set aside . Yet another point in which the Puritan scheme of a theocratic society was rational and not fanatical was its method of interpreting the Scriptures . That method was essentially rationalistic in two ways . First , the Puritan laid no claim to the possession of any peculiar inspiration or divine light whereby he might be aided in ascertaining the meaning of the sacred text ; but he used his reason just as he would in any matter of business , and he sought to convince , and expected to be convinced , by rational argument , and by nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any peculiar inspiration that there was no room in the Puritan commonwealth for anything like a priestly class , and that every individual must hold his own opinions at his own personal risk . The consequences of this rationalistic spirit have been very far-reaching , and in order to understand the work of the Puritans we must point out some of these consequences . In the first place , we can now see what it was that made the Puritans so intolerant of the Quakers . The followers of George Fox did lay claim to the possession of some sort of peculiar or personal inspiration . They claimed the right to speak and act as " the spirit moved them , " and they sometimes sought to exercise this alleged right to an extent that , in the eyes of the Puritans , threatened the dissolution of all human society . Nor were these obnoxious claims confined to the decorum of written or spoken discussion . The Quakers who so roused the wrath of Boston in the seventeenth century were not at all like the quiet and respectable Quakers whom one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them were very turbulent and ill-mannered , to say the least . They were in the habit of denouncing all earthly magistrates and princes , and would hoot at the governor as he passed along the street . They would allude to the Bible as the " Word of the Devil , " and would rush into church on Sundays and interrupt the sermon with untimely and unseemly remarks . A certain Thomas Newhouse once came into one of the meeting-houses in Boston with a glass bottle in each hand , and , holding them up before the congregation , knocked them together and smashed them , with the discourteous remark , " Thus will the Lord // break you all in pieces I " At another time a woman named Brewster came to church with her face smeared with lamp-black . And Hutchinson and Cotton Mather relate several instances of Quaker women running about the streets and coming into town-meeting in the primitive costume of Eve before the fall . Such proceedings were called " testifying before the Lord " ; but one can well imagine how they must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who could not have forgotten , moreover , the odious scenes enacted at Miinster by the German Anabaptists of the preceeding century . It is not strange that the Puritans of Boston should have made up their minds that such things should not be permitted in the new community which they had endured so much to establish . Several of the Quakers were publicly whipped , or stood in the pillory . They were forbidden to enter the colony under penalty of death ; and at last three of their number , who had twice been dismissed from the colony with words of warning , and had twice been " moved by the spirit " to return and " testify , " were hanged on Boston Common . What might have been the treatment of these singular agitators , if they had confined themselves to preaching the doctrine of private inspiration without shocking the general sense of decorum , may best be seen from the case of Roger Williams . Within five years from the settlement of Massachusetts this young preacher had announced the true principles of religious liberty with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Williams had been aided in securing a education by the great lawyer Sir Edward Coke , and had lately taken his degree at Oxford ; but the boldness with which he declared his opinions had aroused the implacable hostility of Archbishop Laud , and in 1631 he had come over to Plymouth , whence he removed two years later to Salem , and became pastor of a church there . The views of Williams , if logically carried out , involved the entire separation of church from state , the equal protection of all forms of religious faith , the repeal of all laws compelling attendance on public worship , the abolition of tithes and of all forced contributions to the support of religion . Such views are to-day quite genei'ally adopted by the more civilized portions of the Protestant world ; but it is needless to say that they were not the views of the seventeenth century , in Massachusetts or elsewhere . For declaring such opinions as these on the continent of Europe , anywhere except in Holland , a man like Williams would in that age have run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England , under the energetic misgovernment of Laud , he would very likely have had to stand in the pillory with his ears cropped , or perhaps , like Bunyan and Baxter , would have been sent to jail . Iii Massachusetts it is not clear that he would have been subjected to any kind of persecution had he not written a pamphlet in which he denied the right of the colonists to the lands which they held in New England under the king 's grant . This , it was thought , would have a tendency to weaken the confidence of the settlers " in the validity of the charter in which all their legal rights as a plantation were bound up , " i ' and therefore " tended directly and inevitably toward anarchy . " Accordingly , in January , 1636 , Williams was ordered by the General Court to come to Boston and embark in a ship that was about to set sail for England . But he escaped into the forest , and made his way through the snow to the wigwam of Massasoit . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fluently in the language of the Indians , and now he passed a pleasant winter in trying to instill into their ferocious hearts something of the gentleness of Christianity . In the spring he was privately notified by Winthrop that if he were to steer his course to Narragansett Bay he would be secure from molestation . Though the Puritans of Massachusetts were determined that Williams should not preach in the midst of their own community , they made no objection to his moving a few miles away and founding a new community of such people as might approve of his views ; and such was the first beginning of Rhode Island . It was a curious and noteworthy consequence of the circumstances under which this little colony was founded that for a long time it became the refuge of all the fanatical and turbulent people who could not submit to the strict and orderly governments of Massachusetts and Connecticut . People of extreme views , for whom the theocracy of the great majority of the Puntans was not theocratic enough ; people who fancied themselves favored with di- // rect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep the seventh day of the week as a Sabbath instead of the first day ; people who cherished a special predilection for the Apocalypse and the Book of Daniel ; people with queer views about property and government ; people who advocated either too little marriage or too much marriage-all the eccentric people , in short , such as are apt to come into the foreground in periods of religious excitement , found in Rhode Island a favored spot where they could prophesy without let or hinderance . But the result of so much discordance in opinion was the impossibility of founding a strong and well-ordered government . Throughout the colonial period political affairs in Rhode Island were much more turbulent than in Connecticut and Massachusetts , and the general progress was slower . Rhode Island took no part in the old confederacy of the New England colonies , and after the war of independence it was the last of all the thirteen States to adopt the Federal Constitution . In view of all these facts , I think we can see that at the bottom of the Puritan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tolerate indiscriminately all sorts of theological opinions , there lay a grain of shrewd political sense which was not ill adapted to the social condition of the seventeenth century . But in his further conviction that religious opinion must be consoaant with reason , and that religious truth must be brought home to each individual by rational argument , we may find one of the chief causes of that peculiarly conservative yet flexible intelligence which has enabled the Puritan countries to take the lead in the civilized world of to-day . Free discussion of theological questions , when conducted with earnestness and reverence , and within certain generally acknowledged limits , was never discountenanced in New England . On the contrary , there has never been a society in the world in which theological problems have been so seriously and persistently discussed as in New England in the colonial period . The long sermons of the clergymen were usually learned and elaborate arguments of doctrinal points , bristling with quotations from the Bible , or from famous books of controversial divinity , and in the long winter evenings the questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ household . The clergy were , as a rule , men of great learning , able to read both Old and New Testaments in the original languages , and familiar with the best that had been talked and written , among Protestants at least , on theological subjects . They were also , for the most part , men of lofty character , and they were held in high social esteem on account of their character and scholarship , as well as on account of their clerical position . But in spite of the reverence in which they were commonly held , it would have been a thing absolutely unheard-of for one of these pastors to urge an opinion from the pulpit on the sole ground of his personal authority or his superior knowledge of Scriptural exegesis . The hearers , too , were quick to detect novelties or variations in doctrine ; and while there was perhaps no more than the ordinary human unwillingness to listen to a new thought merely because of its newness , it was above all things needful that the orthodox soundness of every new suggestion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in doctrinal theology was part and parcel of the whole theory of New England life ; because , as I have said , it was taken for granted that each individual must hold his opinions at his own personal risk in the world to come . Such perpetual discussion , conducted under such a stimulus , afforded in itself no mean school of intellectual training . Viewed in relation to the subsequent mental activity of New England , it may be said to have occupied a position somewhat similar to that which the polemics of the medkeval schoolmen occupied in relation to .. the European thought of the Renaissance , and of the age of Hobbes and Descartes . At the same time the Puritan theory of life lay at the bottom of the whole system of popular education in New England . According to that theory , it was absolutely essential that every one should be taught from early childhood how to read and understand the Bible . So much instruction as this was assumed to be a sacred duty which the community owed to every child born within its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principal strength of popery in religion as well as of despotism in politics ; and so , to the best of their lights , they cultivated knowledge with might and main . But in this energetic diffusion of knowledge they were unwittingly prepar // ing the complete and irreparable destruction of the theocratic ideal of society which they had sought to realize by crossing the ocean and settling in New England . This universal education , and this perpetual discussion of theological questions , were no more compatible with rigid adherence to the Calvinistic system than with submission to the tyranny of Rome . The inevitable result was the liberal and enlightened Protestantism which is characteristic of American society at the present day , and which is continually growing more liberal as it grows more enlightened-a Protestantism which , in the natural course of development , is coming to realize the noble ideal of Roger Williams , but from the very thoua*ht of which such men an Winthrop and Cotton and Endicott would have shrunk with dismay . In this connection it is interesting to note the similarity between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with respect to the influence of their religious theory of life upon general education . Nowhere has Puritanism , with its keen intelligence and its iron tenacity of purpose , played a greater part than it has played in the history of Scotland . And it is a perfectly patent fact that no other people in modern times , in proportion to their numbers , have achieved so much in all departments of human activity as the people of Scotland have achieved . It would be superfluous to mention the pre-eminence of Scotland in the industrial arts since the days of James Watt , or to recount the glorious names in philosophy , in history , in poetry and romance , and in every department of science , which since the middle of the eighteenth century have made the country of Burns and Scott , of Hume and Adam Smith , of Black and Hunter and Hutton and Lyell , illustrious for all future time . Now this period of magnificent intellectual fruition in Scotland was preceded by a period of Calvinistic orthodoxy as rigorous as that of New England at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Scotch Kirk in the seventeenth century cherished a theocratic ideal of society very like that which the colonists of New England aimed at realizing , and the outward aspect of society in the two countries was in these respects very similar . There was the same austerity , the same intolerance , the same narrowness of interests , in Scotland that there was in New England . Mr. Buckle gave us a very graphic picture of this state of society , and the only thing which he could find to say about it , as the result of his elaborate survey , was that the spirit of the Scotch Kirk was as thoroughly hostile to human progress as the spirit of the Spanish Inquisition ! If this were really so , it would be difficult indeed to account for the period of brilliant mental activity which immediately followed . But in reality the Puritan theory of life led at once to universal education in Scotland as it did in New England , and for precisely the same reasons . Popular education was begun in Scotland earlier than anywhere else in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very high level , while the effects of theological discussion in breaking down the old Calvinistic exclusiveness have been illustrated in the history of Edinburgh as well as in the history of Boston . In no respect has the vital energy of New England ideas shown itself more strikingly than in the unquestioning readiness with which the New England common-school system has been adopted as one of the fundamental institutions of society throughout the greater part of the American Union . This is not the place to discuss the question whether that svstem is really the best adapted to a complex society in which the greatest and most insidious of dangers lies in the tendency of the government to usurp functions that should properly be discharged by private enterprise . We have now only to observe what were the actual effects wrought in the simple society of colonial New England by the spirit that founded the common schools . By the year 1649 education had been made compulsory throughout Massachusetts and Connecticut . The school-house and the meeting-house were among the first buildings to be raised in each newly founded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moderate size these rudimentary schools were supplemented by high schools , and in some instances by Latin schools . More remarkable still was the foundation of a university at Cambridge in 1636 , before the colony of Massachusetts was seven years old . Founded as it was in a spirit of genuine popular enthusiasm , Harvard College soon attained an eminent position , with able professors , an excellent library and apparatus for those times , and solid and comfortabh* // buildings withal . In the eighteenth century the education that could be obtained there in Latin , Greek , and Hebrew , and in theology and metaphysics , was probably as good in quality as the English universities could furnish . In 1700 Connecticut followed the example of the older colony in establishing Yale College , which soon became the worthy rival of Harvard ; in 1765 Brown was founded in Rhode Island ; and five years later Dartmouth began its career amid the wilds of New Hampshire , with a humble log-house for its first college hall . Under such circumstances as these , illiteracy had been quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was almost impossible to find anybody , young or old , rich or poor , who could not read , write , and cipher ; in the most sequestered nooks of the mountains newspapers were regularly taken ; and no small proportion of the people was in the habit of reading Bunyan and Milton and books of controversial theology , while in the larger towns the best contemporary English literature found eager purchasers . From the beginning , too , New England had a literature of its own , always characterized by erudition , sometimes by elegance of expression . The first printing-press on the American continent began its work in 1639 in Cambridge ; the first newspaper was issued in Boston after the overthrow of Andros in 1690 ; and almanacs , the forerunners of the modern magazine , were published from the outset . Medicine and the physical sciences received no special encouragement at first , though Winthrop of Connecticut was a fellow of the Royal Society . Poetry was attempted by the clergy , though with indifferent success , but history and philosophy as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is enough to mention the works of Samuel Willard , of Increase and Cotton iMiather , of Jeremiah Durumer , and Jonathan Mayhew . But far above all these towers the name of Jonathan Edwards , the greatest thinker that America has ever produced  --  a man who for subtlety and force , though not for breadth of intelligence , was the equal of Locke or Hume , and whose contributions to psychology , in his masterly treatise on the Freedom of the Will , can not soon be superseded , and will never be forgotten . In surveying the society of Virginia in the colonial period we had occasion to observe how the development of schools and printing-presses was hindered by the absence of towns and the extreme diffusion of the people over the face of the country . And we saw how this diffusion of the people was a direct result of the cultivation of tobacco in enormous quantities by the employment of servile labor , which favored the growth of large isolated estates . In New England , on the other hand , a totally different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who made up the great body of the population , continued , as they had done in England , to raise the articles necessary for their own immediate support . They raised wheat , rye , and Indian corn , garden vegetables , cows , pigs , and poultry ; and this kind of agriculture was not favorable to the employment of slave labor or to the production of very large crops . The soil and climate of New England , indeed , did not admit of any othe*r kind of agriculture than this . Moreover , the Puritan theory of life made it absolutely necessary that the people should meet together every Sunday for religious worship ; and this necessity co-operated in keeping them from getting very widely scattered . Accordingly one of the most prominent features of New England life , from the very outset , has been its concentration . In Massachusetts and Connecticut , and still more in New Hampshire , there were great stretches of unbroken forest , just as there were in Virginia . But in Virginia the cultivated spot in the midst of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lordly manor-house surrounded by hovels in which dwelt an ignorant and servile class . The master and his family lived in isolation , with the nearest white neighbors perhaps miles removed . In New England the cultivated spot in the midst of the wilderness was a village , with its church , town-house , school-house , inn , blacksmith shop , and variety store in the centre , surrounded by from fifty to a hundred neat and comfortable farm-houses , each one the dwelling of an independent landed pr6prietor . It is obvious at once that this compactness of life must have been highly favorable both to the education of the people and to their general social and political progress . All New England , so far as it was then settled at all , was dotted over with these little towns , sometimes perched on bleak hilltops with the outline of the white church // spire gleaming against the sky , sometimes cozily nestled in beautiful valleys . When a village was felt to have become too populous , a portion of the inhabitants-perhaps twenty or thirty families-would move away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village , with a new meeting-house and a new school-house . From this method of settling the country followed the necessity of making good roads . In Massachusetts and Connecticut the roads were more numerous and in better condition than in any of the other colonies , though until after the middle of the eighteenth century there were few wheeled vehicles drawn by horses , except in the neighbors hood of the large towns . In the interior of the country there were the ox-cart for summer and the ox-sled for winter , while men , women , and children all rode about on horseback . After the cessation of Indian attacks the roads were perfectly safe , as the colonies contained no unthrifty or criminal class : there were neither tramps , beggars , nor highwaymen , and crimes of violence were very much more rare than in any other part of the world . More mails from Europe were received in New England than in the middle and southern colonies , partly because of its comparative nearness to England , partly because of its greater number of sea-port towns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whereas in New England there were Falmouth ( now Portland ) , Portsmouth , Newburyport , Salem , Boston , Plymouth , New Bedford , Newport , New London , Saybrook , and New Haven , at all of which points English vessels frequently touched . Through these busy coast towns , and as far south as Philadelphia , the mails ran regularly , whereas they were only sent south of Delaware Bay at irregular intervals , whenever enough letters and papers had accumulated to make it worth while to send them . The rapid growth of these coast towns illustrates another point of difference between the northern and southern colonies which was of great importance . The settlers of New England were a maritime race , and early began to amass wealth from the whale and cod fisheries . This led to extensive ship-building , and to a steady export of dried fish , whale-oil , and cut timber , in return for which the NewEnglanders received wine and sugar and manufactured goods , brought from Europe or from the West Indies in their own vessels . In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the colonies , besides obtaining a considerable share in that which went on between England and the West Indies . Before the time of the Revolution this carrying trade had reached great dimensions , and had wrought very remarkable effects upon British commerce , as I shall show hereafter . It had not , indeed , begun to diminish in importance until within the memory of men now living ; and in the early years of the present century it furnished that hardy and skillful race of seamen who won a dozen or more astounding victories over England at the very moment when England 's naval power had touched its greatest height . But what we have now to note is the early effect of this carrying trade in stimulating the growth of town life in New England , and saving the country from the barbarizing influences of isolation . Rhode Island so throve upon this trade that , in spitc of the untoward circumstances of its early history , it at last caught up with the neighboring colonies , and since the Revolution has exerted an influence in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this trade Boston became and remained the most populous of American cities until , shortly before the Revolution , it was passed by Philadelphia . Through the closer connection thus kept up between Boston and the mother country came the pre-eminent importance of the part played by the Puritan capital in the beginnings of the struggle against the usurpations of Parliament . As the New England villages along the coast and on the navigable rivers increased in population , they did not wholly throw off their rural character , but developed into pleasant towns , with wide and shady streets running between handsome villa-houses with flower gardens or wellkept lawns . Such cities as New Haven and Portland , both famous for their beauty , have succeeded in preserving something of this appearance to the present day . These houses were usually built of wood , but with timbers so stout and hard as to endure almost like stone . In the coast towns of Massachusetts especially they were often very spacious and elegant , with broad staircases and twisted oak halusters , with carved chimney - pieces , on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with the principal rooms wainscoted in panels and hung with tap- // estry . The best houses were commonly built with lipped or gambrel roofs . In the villages of the interior the houses , though solidly built , were usually smaller in size and simpler in design , a favorite style of roof being what was known as the " lean - to , " from the shingled surface of which the snow could easily slide off . The inner wood-work was of pine rather than oak , and the floors were often bare , but everything was scrupulously neat . There were no cottages of one or two rooms , such as are found in English villages : the poorer houses had four or five rooms on the ground-floor , with an attic overhead ; the better houses had a second story with chambers . In front of the house stood a row of maple-trees , or one or two enormous elms , while in the rear stretched an endless succession of sheds and wood-houses , leading at last to the ample barn , from the wide back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undulating pasture and woodland to the horizon of blue mountains which , in the Algonquin language , gave to the country the name of Massachusetts . I have often been struck with the general resemblance between some of the best of these New England farm-houses and some of the manor - houses still to be seen in the East Anglian counties , if not in other parts of England . The style of dress was rude , and the manner of living in these houses was plain and frugal . Dishes were of wood or pewter , though most families possessed a service of china and a few pieces of silver plate , which were treasured as heirlooms , and only used on occasion of a wedding or a funeral . But in the coast towns , and especially in Boston , the dress and the general style of living were the same as among country gentlemen or prosperous merchants in England . Contrary to what we have observed in Virginia , the conditions of life were such as to favor economy and insure financial solvency . From first to last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England may have been , financial heresies have never found a congenial soil there . The rural Yankee , like the Scotchman , had the reputation of looking sharply after the pennies , and of being canny and shrewd at a bargain ; but the liberality and generous public spirit displayed in the large towns were always as conspicuous as the strict commerial integrity . In this New England society the chil dren of rich and poor alike were brought up to work and support themselves , and no sort of stigma was attached to useful labor of any kind . But distinctions of birth were clearly recognized , and with absolute political equality there was an aristocracy of personal consideration , the traces of which have not even yet been obliterated . The possession of land carried with it no title to distinction or power in a community where every one was a landed proprietor . Yet good birth , high intellectual power , or distinguished services to the state formed the basis of an aristocracy which was not the less influential and respected because it was not labelled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " who was very likely to serve year after year in some local magistracy , and to serve with honor . Only men and women of aristocratic birth were addressed as " Mr. " and " Mrs. " For other people , including the majority of the farmers and tradesmen , the style of address was simply the Christian name , or else " Goodwife Smith " or " Neighbor Brown . " Seats were graded according to rank in the churches , and the same distinctions were preserved in the catalogues of students at Yale and Harvard until just before the Revolution , when the alphabetical arrangement was first adopted . But in spite of this well-marked social aristocracy , the political structure of the community was absolutely democratic . It was the most complete democracy that has ever been seen in the world . All local government was conducted by the town - meeting , or primary assembly , at which every adult male was expected to be present , to speak if he liked , and to vote . Even in the largest towns , until after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representative by mayors and councils , but primary by the town - meeting . Even Boston had its municipal concerns regulated in town-meeting until the population had come to exceed forty thousand . The only representative government was that of the General Assembly of the colony . In Connecticut and Rhode Island the governor was elected by the people , and it was so in Massachusetts until 1684 , when the old charter was annulled , and , in view of the haughty and rebellious spirit of the province , the crown took it upon itself to appoint the governor . So strong // was the popular government resting upon these town - meetings , that whether the state had any head or not , all the wants of practical administration could be supplied by the towns . It is needless to point out how admirable was the political training which was furnished by this system . But it may not be superfluous to observe how strongly the principle of federation was suggested by this union of independent towns under the general direction of a representative Assembly at the provincial capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal system of the United States . From step to step the ascent was easy and logical . First , the formation of a State government by a representative federation of towns ; then an attempted union of States in the short-lived New England Confederacy of the seventeenth century ; and finally , when the minds of men had become ripe for so bold an undertaking , the successful union of all the liberated States under the glorious Constitution of 1789 . Tandem fit sureulus arbor : from these small beginnings and through these stages of natural development has come at last the nation which more completely than any other has solved the difficult problem of political civilization , in securing permanent co - operation among vast bodies of men without curtailing their individual and local liberties  --  the strongest , the freest , the most pacific nation the world has ever seen .
