txt The Republican State Convention will meet here to-morrow and most of the delegates have arrived in the city to-night . The leading candidate for Governor is Gen. L. F. Hubbard , of Redwing , whose friends claim he has about 200 delegates out of 308 in the convention , and that he will be nominated on the first ballot . The anti-Hubbard men concede him 60 or 70 votes , and insist that he will be beaten . The opposition is still unable , since Pillsbury 's refusal to be a candidate for re-election , to concentrate their strength upon a single candidate . They are divided between Pillsbury , who is supported by a great many delegates in spite of his refusal to permit the use of his name , Clark , Thompson , T. B. Clement , A. R. McGill , C. A. Gillman , and others . Great effort is making to-night fora concentration of all these elements against Hubbard , and it has succeeded so far as to settle the choice upon J. B. Wakefield . A. Thompson is named for Chairman of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first caused by his letter of declination , is increased by his act in calling an extra session of the Legislature to take steps for the payment of old State bonds . This has been vigorously condemned in repudiation sections , and some counties have passed resolutions denouncing Pillsbury . It is said to-night that Pillsbury will only accept a nomination upon the apparently impossible condition that the convention approves ? his action in taking steps for the payment of the bonds . Probably a majority of the delegates will wish to help the troublesome bond question out of the convention , though some aggressive repudiation man may spring a resolution denouncing the settlement . Besides the Governor , the only contest will be upon the Attorney-General , for which the incumbent , H. J. Halen , and Fayette Marsh , of Stillwater , are candidates , and the Auditorship , which is contested by W. W. Broden , of Preston ; E. W. Trask , of Houston , and A. ' P , Whitcomb , the incumbent . Then Supreme Judges Clark , Dickinson , and Mitchell are candidates for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minneapolis , against Clark .
