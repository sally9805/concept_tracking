txt Senator William Mahone is apparently alarmed about the outlook in Virginia . He has made an attack through the columns of a Philadelphia paper upon Gov . William E. Cameron . which is regarded by the friends of Cameron in this city as only a preliminary saueal to the explanatory howl he will send up in November In case he finds that John S. Wise is beaten for Governor and that the Legislature is largely Democratic . The attack upon Gov . Cameron , who is charged with treachery to the Republicans because he expressed the opinion in a letter which he wrote that the election of last Fall was a fair one in Virginia , is dated at Richmond , but it is asserted that It was written in Petersburg and ; : in the house of Gen. Mahone . Gov . Cameron and Senator Mahone are both Republicans , but one seeks a re-election to the United States Senate and the other does not conceal his opinion that the aspirant is unfit to represent the State , and that he should be defeated . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everybody in Virginia knows of this estrangement ' in the two men , and an attack upon Cameron in Mahone 's interest will be quickly traced in Virginia to its source . Exactly what good can be done for the Republican cause at this time by an assault upon Cameron it is not easy to discover . If by attacking him a break in the Republican Party is produced the result will be fatal to Mahone 's aspirations . Gov . Cameron is friendly to Mr. Wise , assisted him in securing the nomination for Governor , advised him about the construction of the platform , which Mr. Wise prepared , and which was adopted after it had been elaborated by Mr. Elam , of the iirh to . and he has at all times been outspoken in his hope that Wise may be elected . No former Democrat more frankly accepts the name of Republican . But he is determined that Mahone shall not return to the United States Senate or longer " boss " the Republican Party in the State . Mahone khows that it is Cameron 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and " bossism , " and it is the anger of " Boss " Mahone that speaks through the charge of treachery upon Cameron . The Governor has many warm personal friends in the State . They knew that he desires to see a Legislature chosen that will not elect Mahone . Under favorable circumstances the Republicans could not expect to get a large majority . With Cameron at work seeking to elect a few Republicans opposed to Mahono the chances for the latter become small . It would not be surprising to hear that Cameron 's friends will bring a counter-charge against Mahone of attempting to secure the election of members of the Senate and Assembly at the expense of the candidate for Governor . This charge would make the contest in Virginia appear interesting to those outsiders who have alreaay heard that the Democrats are willing to swap votes for Fitzhugh Lee for Governor for votes for State Senators in all the close districts in order to ? make Mahone 's defeat certain . This is a very critical time for Mahone to choose to make an attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no hope of winning , and that it wo n't make much difference in the end whether Cameron is attacked or not .
