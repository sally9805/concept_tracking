txt The meeting at Cooper Institute last evening was a remarkable and significant one in many regards . The audience which crowded the great hall was thoroughly representative of the community , and included a large number of those usually known as the working classes . It was in harmony with the purposes of the meeting , and the hearty applause was given with judgment and sense . It was by no means the wit alone , nor the palpable hits in which the speakers indulged , that received response from the hearers , but the arguments as well . The occasion of the meeting was novel . It was not only not a partisan meeting , but it was not in the usual sense of the term a reform meeting . The city has been aroused by no exposure of gigantic and scandalous robbery like that of the Tweed Ring . Its attention has not'been awakened by any group of conspicuous jobbers . There has been no such general and flagrant nuisance or abuse as the dirty streets of a few years since to fix the mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation at Albany . The interest which is now so strikingly manifested is caused by the reflection of all intelligent citizens upon the palpably mistaken principle on which the ordinary administration of the city proceeds , and the sentiment to which the meeting gives expression is one of determination to change that principle for a better . And the emphasis and energy of the expression are the more noteworthy from the fact that no election is pending and nothing but the meeting of the Legislature , with this question before it , calls for popular action . Obviously the sentiment which leads to such a manifestation at this time is far stronger and more deep-seated even than would appear from this extraordinary evidence of it . If it were possible to submit the question discussed last evening to a direct vote of the people of New-York , the majority for the principle of the Roosevelt bill would be overwhelming . It only needs an occasion when the people can give an explicit and effective expression of their will to prove to the dullest or the most interested opponent of the policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy and are quite capable of putting it into practical operation . This was shown by the character of the men who took part in the meeting , and who are without exception among the very best men of both parties . Mr. EvAras and ex-Mayor GRACE , Judge NOAH DAVIS and Mr. COUDERT , Mr. COOPER and Mr. OTTENDORFER , Mr. CHOATE and Mr. BABCOCK , Judge RUSSELL and Mr. FREDERICK P. OLcoTr , these are names prominent in different parties and highly respected in each . When they take the lead in a movement which brings out such an audience as that of last evening we may be sure that they have the convictions of the general mass of citizens behind them . A force is thus manifested which once set on foot may be checked or delayed , or even for the time being betrayed , but which can not be prevented front finally having its way . It is because the politicians by trade understand this that they will leave nothing undone by which they can postpone the reform which puts an end to their business . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known and most trusted citizens to present the case of the city at Albany . The committee will speak with a voice which the Legislature can not afford to ignore , and which no conscientious and faithful member of the Legislature will fail to respect . It is not the voice of party , or of a faction , or of a class , or of any special interest ; it is the voice of New York . Our people ask for the simple right to manage their own affairs . They are tired and sick of what Mr. COUDERT very justly and wittily described as " elections in the third degree . " They are weary of choosing a Mayor who will choose city officers at the dictation of a Board of Alderman governed by JOHN KELLY : and the O'Brien machine . They want to get at their own government . If they are to have a boss they want one that they can see and know and call to account . They want their votes to mean something , and if they can have that they will take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have it . There is no doubt about that . The meeting of last night is only the beginning of the end .
