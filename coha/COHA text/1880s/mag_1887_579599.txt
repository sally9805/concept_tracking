AN OLD KENTUCKY HOME . THIRTY years ago there stood in the heart of the Blue Grass Country an old stone homestead , nominally occupied only by a rich planter , his wife , and son , but usually overrun , especially during the summer vacations , by all the children in the connection . I say , instinctively , stood , though the truth is , the house still exists , and is so substantially built that it is likely to outlast many more changes than those which it has already experienced ; but these have been so great that the place seems now but an empty shell . Its glory has departed , its whule outlook is dreary and decayed . But in those prosperous years just before // the war , it was the Mecca toward which many youthful hearts turned during the long school year , and most of all in those enchanting , exasperating spring days , when to the young human animal , as to all others , comes a return of the savage instinct , a wild desire to break all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blood like sap in the frees , which later makes the young fancy " lightly turn to thoughts of love . " When the first leaves came on the frees , making the streets beautiful with a tender green haze , there came also visions of the delights of a summer at Uncle Doctor 's ; visions which often obtruded themselves between our eyes and the dingy school-books , and yet were a spur to our flagging efforts . Finally the last lessons were said , the trunk was packed with a good supply of strong , partly worn garments , and the sweet freshness of some early June morning found us rolling away on the cars toward the capital of the State . Every station along the railway was a wellknown landmark , for which we watched with absorbing interest ; and when we reached our destination there was something delightful even in the noise and dirt and confusion of the crowded depot . There was a little feeling of uneasiness for fear no one had come to meet us , and then a thrill of perfect pleasure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uncle Doctor , his sunburned face smiling a hearty welcome . He was a genuine Kentuckian , over six feet in height , with a frame that must have been very powerful in youth , but now , at sixty , was somewhat burdened with flesh . His face was clean-shaven , showing wellcut , vigorous features ; thick iron-gray hair hung over his forehead , below a broad-brimmed straw hat ; and his keen blue eyes could beam with hospitality and fun , or flash with sudden anger . A suit of light jeans , no vest , but a broad expanse of purest linen , relieved only by a loose black tie under the rumpled , rolling collar , - this was a summer costume perfectly suited to his age and occupations . We were promptly stowed away : some squeezed into the rockaway along with baskets and bundles which excited our liveliest curiosity , one or two favored ones taken into the buggy , with an enviable prospect of holding the reins part of the way , and off we started for an eight-mile drive out to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the streets ; then the houses became fewer and meaner ; we passed some scattered negro cabins on the outskirts , and soon were fairly on " the pike , " making our way over the bulwark of hills that shut in the town . The ride was full of interest : we knew every farmhouse , every turning ; we watched for the bridge , that had been for years in exactly the same shattered condition , and necessitated careful driving to one side through the water ; we watched even more eagerly for the mill at Elkhorn Forks , where we should stop , perhaps , to take up a bag of meal which had been left in the morning to be ground . Before long we escaped from the white glare of the turnpike , and the wheels rolled smoothly over the soft brown clay of shaded lanes ; the last one bordered our uncle 's fields , and as he stopped now and then to ask some question of the farm hands at work there , we received many an enthusiastic " Howdy " and welcoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrance to the farm , our excitement knew no bounds . A dozen little negroes were perched there on the watch . When we came in sight they made a wild rush at the gate , tumbling over each other in their zeal to open it . These were our chosen playfellows , and no one without experience can realize the fascination that the little darkies then had for white children ; the most attractive companion of their own color was tame in comparison . They ran along beside us with // beaming faces , but their answers to our fire of questions were more reserved than we could wish , restrained by the awe felt for " Ole Marsa , " at whom they stole furtive glances . From the gate to the house was a distance of at least half a mile . The road , noticeably better than the one we had just left , ran through rolling , richly wooded , and well-watered lands : on one side , broad corn and wheat fields ; on the other , gentle slopes where sheep were grazing , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " sugar-camp , " its stately maples bringmug delightful memories of great crackling fires where we had seen the kettles of boiling sap , and afterwards , when they were emptied , tasted the crisp , delicious compound , half candy , hail sugar , that had hardened along their edges . From the top of a hill just beyond the sugarcamp we had a first glimpse of the house ; soon another gate was entered , and we had arrived . Passing the " lot , " with its great whitewashed barn and stable , we reached the stile which led to the house-yard , and quickly scrambled up the three outside steps and down the three inside ones , eager for the first greeting from Aunt Sis . We loved the Doctor , but we adored his wife , and had we not done so we should have been the most ungrateful of mortals , for she was untiring in her love and care for us . She had married late , and had no children of her own , but if ever a motherly heart beat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often from six to a dozen children under her roof , at all the trying ages between five and fifteen . She was watchful of us , and restrictions , even punishments , were not uncommon , but no one ever heard from her an impatient word . She always had many questions to ask about the school year , was proud of our progress , and could shame for a moment the most inveterate laggard . All the long summer days we llved out-of-doors , and found ample amusement for ourselves ; but when there came an occasional rain , we turned to Aunt Sis to furnish us entertainment in-doors . There was a battered backgammon board , and a dingy pack of cards with which we learned to play Old Maid and Smut ; as the evenings grew long and cool , we roasted apples , popped corn , or made candy on the big wood fire . When all else palled upon our restless spirits , an unfailing source of delight remained in the stories she could tell of Indian fights , and of her adventures in early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this wholesome , cheery woman as our property , our natural prey , in those days , but some of us look back now and wonder at her patience . There was one delicate child who could not join iii the rougher sports , and who sometimes sat watching them with wistful eyes , or limped into the house when the ruuning games began . For her Aunt Sis could always find some new amusement , or , what is better still to an intelligent child , some useful occupation ; and soon the little cripple excelled all the others at quieter gaines , and had some private accomplishments as well in the way of sewing and knitting . No one could know how her heart swelled with dellght when one day a way was contrived for her to ride without hurting the tender ankle ; after that , when Black Mary or Old Maria was brought up , with the side-saddle on , for the children to ride around the circle , she had her turn with the rest . One of our favorite haunts was a broad , gentle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call of the house . It was bare except at the top ; here grew a magnificent walnut-tree , and under its ample shade we spent many a happy hour . We had no regular toys , but there were smooth , polished buckeyes , fairy cups of acorn shells , velvetlined chestnut burs , and the spicy walnuts , with which we once stained our // hands and faces in order to act a favorite Indian story . We made hickory whistles in endless succession , collected shining pebbles from the " branch " and gay feathers from the poultry-yard , and dressed our corn-cob babies with as much pleasure as if they had been Paris dolls . Every child who does not know something of country life is deprived of its natural birthright , - a birthright which , once enjoyed , can never be wholly lost . Town-bred children , who are kept unnaturally clean and well dressed , and taken decorously to walk once a day , are pitifully ignorant of the rapture of old clothes , bare feet , and absolute freedom of action in investigating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know the country only by an occasional drive beyond the city limits , where they gaze longingly at the dusty , wayside flowers , and at stray blackberries hanging here and there . No knights in search of adventure ever knew more eagerness than they at the entrance to a wood ; the great trees towering above the denser undergrowth , a study in cool browns and grays and greens , with little patches of sunlight dotting it here and there like bright , watchful eyes . They long to explore those distant shadowy recesses , to push their way through brier and brake , deeper , deeper into the woods , until its secret charm , its mystery , is discovered , sleeping like Dornrt*schen in the tangled depths . An Indian jungle does not appeal to an adult mind more strongly than does an ordinary wood to an imaginative child . The delightful quiver of mingled hope and fear , the breathiess interest of reading the unknown by what we have seen , the confident pride of doing something great simply because it is something new , - all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we knew in perfection . No city pleasures could ever have given us half the delight that we found in feeding the poultry , seeing the milking , visiting a new-born call or lamb , carrying salt to the cattle , or wandering about the fields looking for a turkey 's nest among the brush in the fence corners , or seeking some stray turkey-hen with her quaint , wild-eyed brood . Sometimes we would brave the intense heat of an August noon to watch the harvesters , and ride home in the cool of the evening on a load of fragrant clover . Sometimes Aunt Sis would take us all , black and white , for a walk in the " big woods , " and drop by the way many a bit of homely information about bird and tree and flower . We always begged to come home by way of the spring , ostensibly to get some mint for the Doctor , or for a drink of the cool , delicious water from the large gourd dipper that always lay close by on a flat rock ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the " branch , " which took its rippling way hence to water the lower meadows . We envied the train of little negroes with whom this was no unusual privilege . There was one place which we often visited with Aunt Sis . Down below the garden , within sound of the brook 's " friendly brawl , " was a little plot of ground where the grass grew long and rank , and was so choked with weeds and briers that it was not easy at first to distinguish the low mounds that lay here and there . At head and foot stood dilapidated slabs of marble or granite , which told , often in quaint type with the long Old English j of those who rested here in their last quiet asleep . The tombstones were mouldy and weather-stained ; some had sunk deep in the rain-softened soil , others slanted forward over the graves , and a few lay quite flat and helpless on the ground . The only element of beauty about this spot was a wild-rose bush filled with open-hearted pink blooms ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we heard of aunts and uncles and cousins who were shades bef ore our young lives began . Here lay the mother of our grandmother , herself a stately , straight-backed , keen-eyed old // lady , with whom it was difficult to associate the idea of youth . These family burying-grounds , which may be often seen scattered through Kentucky , are peculiar to this State , and to her neighbor and parent , Virginia . The custom doubtless was brought from England , growing out of church-yard burials there , and continuing here on account of the extent of the plantations , and consequent difficulty of finding a convenient meeting-place , even in death . There were no ghastly removals ; where the dead were first laid by the hands of faithful slaves , there they remained ; so that the great-grandmother of a present generation rests to-day within sound of the rippling water , as she did thirty years ago . It may be that the headstones are all gone now , and the mounds leveled by the indifferent plough of a stranger . The homestead was of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built before the days of professional architects by a former Governor of the State , who was a stone-mason in early life , and worked honestly at his trade until the people called him into another sphere of action . The house was at once thoroughiy comfortable and extremely inconvenient ; additions had been made to the main building at different times , with no idea of general effect . From the broad front porch one entered at once a large , high room , which was parlor , library , and sitting-room all in one ; and very attractive it was with cheerful paper and carpet , comfortable rocking-chairs and sofas , and big open fireplace with great brass-knobbed andirons . Opposite the front door and leading to the back porch was a hail , from which a door opened directly upon some steps leading to what was called the " big up-stairs . " This room , which was of necessity entered head-foremost as one ascended the stairs , took in the main body of the house , and held always three double beds , with ample space for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedrooms July , opened from the parlor below , and from the back one another flight of stairs ascended to rooms above , known as the " little up-stairs . " The characteristic feature of the building was the entire lack of any means of communication between the two parts of the upper floor . In the large room over the parlor one might hear plainly the voices of the occupants of an adjacent room , but to reach them it was necessary to descend one stairway , traverse the whole length of the house , and ascend another flight . Above the " little up-stairs " was the attic : here hung festoons of okra , red peppers , onions , *nd garden herbs for seasoning ; in the corners were bags of nuts and bunches of pop-corn , and apples and peaches were spread on deal boards to dry ; there were bits of old harness , a ragged side-saddle that was to be re-covered some day , a shot-gun or two , and some hunting-coats ; and in a dark , shelving recess were some relics of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physician , - some bones which Mr. Venus would have classified as " human warious . " These were a source of infinite terror to every child and negro on the place , and made a visit to the attic after dusk a perilous expedition , necessitating ample companionship and subject to sudden panics . From the front bedroom down-stairs - for it was impossible to go anywhere about the house without passing through somebody 's private apartment - three or four steps led down to a large porch , open only on two sides , and these so trellised and covered with vines that it was the most delightful of summer dining-rooms . From this porch opened capacious storerooms , and just around the corner was the kitchen , large , disorderly , often crowded , but clean in the main , and the source of most toothsome and abundant fare . At one corner of the porch stood an iron - bound hogshead , which caught and stored the rain-water from the roof . We used to llsten in a // summer storm to the raindrops on the shingles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to this old receptacle ; and when the rain was over , when the fresh , sweet , earthy odor was abroad , and the sun was hanging glistening jewels on every flower and shrub , we would climb upon the balustrade of the porch and peer eagerly into the depths of the old hogshead , looking for the real diamonds that the negroes said were sometimes brought down by the ram . After breakfast there was always a group of negroes about the porch , each one armed with a tin cup or plate , and waiting for the daily aliowance of molasses , sugar , and coffee to be given out from the storeroom , hoping also for some special tidbit from the remains of the meal . Walks made of flat , irregular stones led from the kitchen door to various points in the yard : to the lot where the milking was done ; to the smoke-house , the duck-pond and poultry-yard , and the line of orderly cabins known as " the quarters ; " to the garden , with its picturesque mingling of fruit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to whose water the limestone rock gave the same tonic quality that it imparts to the blue grass , making this the finest grazing country in the world . Near the garden was the circular ice-house , a most seductive building , whose slanting roof began about two feet above the ground , and was delightfully mossy and slippery . There we would slide by the hour , and many were the rents - not only in our clothes , but in our small persons as well - which were due to its ragged shingles and bent nails . We knew also the delicious coolness and dimness of the interior on a hot summer day , and enjoyed tossing aside the damp straw and sawdust , and dragging out the great crystal blocks , especially if there was ice-cream in prospect . About the yard , as indeed about the whole farm , everything was neat and orderly . The fields were carefully and to a certain extent scientifically cultivated ; the woods were free from weeds and harmful undergrowth ; the outhouses and stable ( the word " barn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) were kept whitewashed and in good repair ; and if there was one thing more than another about the place in which its owner took pride and pleasure , it was the line of " stone fence " that formed nearly the whole boundary of the farm . Whenever there was a slack time and suitable weather , the whole force of field hands was put to work to extend this structure ; and so well were the rocks selected and fitted that there were few better stone fences than the Doctor 's in the whole Blue Grass Country . The negroes were a good-natured , careless , happy set , full of impulsive , if shallow , devotion to those who were kind to them , and with imaginations quick to seize upon and magnify any beauty of person or richness of dress in a favorite . Slavery had its shadowed side in Kentucky as elsewhere , but what we saw of it here was bright and sunny . This was not an immense plantation , but only a very fertile and valuable farm of five hundred acres , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarters . These were eight or ten well-built log huts , whitewashed within and without , the floors scrubbed clean and spread with bits of rag carpet . They were full , but not crowded beyond the limits of health and decency . Most of the men were married , and the family relations were recognized and respected . The clothing of the negroes was extremely good ; this was in our aunt 's department , and under her direction two trained seamstresses were almost always at work . In one storeroom were piles of unbleached cotton shirts , jeans pantaloons , and other articles , which were distributed as they were needed . Stout boots and brogan shoes were bought by the box , and wives // and daughters were constantly knitting gray yarn socks and stockings ; this was the earliest lesson taught to a negro girl , except nursing , which began as soon as she left the cradle , to make way for a new occupant . The negroes were cared for and treated very much as children : scolded for neglect of duty or of themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dosed from a brass-mounted cherry medicine chest , of which they stood in wholesome dread . Quinine , calomel , rhubarb , and similar drugs were dealt out in alarming quantities ; for their master was a doctor of the old school , and his treatment was sometimes heroic . There was little or no waste labor about the farm . One woman cooked both for the family and the field hands ; another was laundress , and attended also to the milking and churning . In the house there were several maids , but they did rather more than the average , and were all taught to sew . They always flocked into the room of a newly arrived guest , one or two with some small duty to perform , the others without even this semblance of an excuse , all eager to see the trunks opened . They watched every article as it was taken out , with admiration not loud but deep , and occasionally their enthusiasm would break out into some such expression as , " Law ' , Mistis , am t you gwine to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " - for they begged with the same frankness and freedom from shame which we consider part of the general picturesqueness of the Italians , and were content with quite as little . We children delighted in their simple ways , and sympathized with their little hopes and enjoyments , as they with ours . They were the best and most patient of nurses , always gentle and affectionate , and sang quaint songs and told odd stories to our hearts ' content . One of the latter was recalled by those of Uncle Remus , for its hero was Brer Rabbit . It told of his stealing a jar of butter from a dairy , and agreeing with his partner , IMister B'ar , to keep it for a Christmas feast . They hide the jar in a hollow tree ; but Brer Rabbit is haunted by the thought of its sweetness , so he leaves home after a while , under pretense of going to a christening where he must be godfather , eats part of the butter , and on his return tells Mister B'ar that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the same errand , with the same excuse , and each time the alleged name of a mythical child tells the state of the jar : " Halfdone , " " Mos ' - gone , " and " Lickedclean . " Were these fables dispersed through the South by that saddest of all mediums , the slave-trade ? Or did the negroes , as a nation , once have an animal epic with the rabbit for its hero , like Reynard the fox , and Isengrim the wolf , in France and Germany ? The negro men all had general and particular duties , and even the youngsters were spasmodically put to use in keeping order about the yard , cutting weeds in the woods , or , in the autumn , in gathering apples for the cider-press and cutting corn-stalks for winter fodder . The men had an air of steadiness and self-respect , and seemed to work cheerfully and intelligently . One of them , Joe , was a man of fine bearing and good ability . He was the carpenter , and had built most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Doctor always spoke to him kindly , and indeed with an undercurrent of respect , though he was sometimes severe to the others , doubtless with good reason . He was not a hard master , although , perhaps , not a particularly indulgent one . A practical farmer , he insisted that the work should be properly done , and to keep the indolent , careless negroes up to the mark required an immense amount of oversight . His horse was saddled before breakfast , and he was mounted and about the farm early and late , knowing the old maxim that the eye of the master will do more work than both his hands . He went to // bed as soon as it was dark , usually rose at three o'clock in the morning , and smoked a meditative pipe on the back porch before any one else was about ; and then at " sun-up " his stentorian voice would be heard " starting the hands . " His constant companion was a corn-cob pipe filled with Kentucky tobacco , which was always lighted by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the place was his call to one of the little darkies , " Bring me a coal of fire , Polly , " or Lizzie , or Tom , as the case might be . The piece of glowing wood was carried in a pair of short tongs from the kitchen fire , and as he blew away the ashes and applied it to his pipe , he put good-natured , teasing questions to the little negro who had brought it . These colloquies were the source of infinite enjoyment to him and of embarrassment to his victim , who stood uneasily on one foot , twisting the other about and boring into the ground with one bare toe , until the tongs were handed back with some extravagant compliment , and the interview ended . In the evening came from the quarters the enticing sounds of the banjo and of " pattin ' Juba , " when nothing short of explicit commands kept the white children from seeking their cherished companions . Not only at night , but often during the day , were heard those sudden , inconsequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday was a time of abundant leisure with them , but one in which we were rarely allowed to share . Memory always brings back that day as clear and hot , when it was something of a trial to get into clothes as disagreeable in their stiffly starched propriety as some prim spinster , and go to church . This involved a start soon after breakfast , and a drive of several miles along the glaring white pike , with the sun beati*ng unsparingly down and being mercilessly reflected from below , while the unusual number of vehicles bound for the same point raised the fine limestone dust in clouds . The church , a bare white building with green shutters , stood just off the road , surrounded by a well-trodden grassplot . On one side was a row of hitching-posts , with rude troughs for corn ; also a large shed for shelter in case of rain . About these points the farmers grouped , discussing crops and neighborhood news , comparing , and occasionally , it must be confessed , trading horses ; while the women exchanged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no uncommon thing to see a belle dismount with that f earlessness and consequent grace in horsemanship which seems to be a birthright with most Kentucky women , and then , stepping out of an alpaca riding skirt , appear miraculously in all the crisp freshness of white draperies and blue ribbons . Such an arrival caused a flutter of excitement , which was only allayed , or turned into another channel , when some young fellow dashed up on a local celebrity in horse-flesh . The social features of meeting continued until the minister came in sight , ambling along on his wellknown mare , whose sides , as he rode , he continually kicked , more from force of habit than from any hope of quickening its conservative pace . Behind him came his worthy helpmeet , with a delegation of their offspring ; the lady seated well forward in the buggy , her arms extended at full length , holding the reins very far apart , and flapping them up and down on the horse 's back after the manner of her sex . The minister led the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old-fashioned , drowsy sermon ; after which everybody started for home , with that cheerful alacrity born of a duty fulfilled and a pleasure in prospect in the way of a good dinner . Several times during the season there were family gatherings at the farm , in honor of the summer visitors . The guests - all relatives - arrived early in // July , the day . The ladies , in gala costume of black glcw6 silk , with a bit of real lace at the neck pinned with a round miniature brooch , sat in state in the parlor , busy with sewing and knitting , or solemnly waving to and fro a turkey-tail fan , with the firm conviction of being suitably dressed for any occasion , from a wedding to a funeral . The men walked about looking at the stock , and admiring the fine points of some " likely " colt , coming into the house just in time for a generous mint julep before dinner . It was apropo&amp; of these juleps that the lines were quoted with regard to the special products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maple-sugar , and fair women - " The first is strong , the second are fleet , The third and fourth are exceedingly sweet , And all are uncommonly hard to beat . " Dinner was the event of the day , and was worthy to be so . First came the rich gumbo soup , which can not be properly made in less than three days ; then at one end of the table juicy lamb ; at the other a great dish of fried chicken , flanked by hams , spiced and baked in a way peculiar to Kentucky ; every vegetable possible at the season , headed by that dish for the gods , a corn pudding ; jellies , amber and crimson ; pickles whose fame descended from generation to generation ; milk that was like cream , and cream that might almost be cut with a knife . Aunt Sis knew what was due the honor of her house ; every woman there was a connoisseur , whose opinions and receipts were worth having . There were wonderful cakes , and ices , and puddings for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buried for days in the ice , and were as good to look upon as to taste . The children were served at a separate table , and afterwards played with added freedom on account of the preoccupation of their elders , and with added zest from the presence of unusual companions . Our choicest possessions were displayed , our favorite haunts visited , and when the sweet , cool twilight came on we had glorious games of hide-and-seek , from one end of the yard to the other ; the cabins , smoke-house , and great locust and beech trees affording every opportunity of adding vigor and variety to the game . At last the happy day was over ; we saw our aunts and uncles and cousins depart , and then crept off to bed , too tired to live over our pleasures again even in dreams . The halo which childish enthusiasm - and later , the glamour of tender recollection - wreathes about the life on the farm bursts into a blaze of glory at the thought of an event which took place during the last untroubled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married to a pretty girl in an adjoining county . The wedding was to take place at her father 's house , and the younger members of the family heard , to their sorrow , that they were not expected ; but the following day our cousin was to bring his bride home , and that evening there was to be a certain solemnity known as an " infair . " We were on the spot , and we meant to stay . Our notions with regard to the said solemnity were somewhat vague : we had general ideas of a procession with brassband accompaniments , resembling a circus parade , but at the same time were humbly conscious that this was an occasion to which neither our experience nor imagination could do justice . For a week beforehand the whole place was in a state of profound excitement . The spring wagon made daily journeys to town , and returned laden with a profusion of eatables that savored of barbaric magnificence : barrels oF oranges and boxes of lemons , - the fruit wrapped in tissue-paper , which eager little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of brown sugar and bluecovered cones of white ; melon-shaped citrons and all the spices of Araby ; squat bluefigured jars of preserved ginger ; fancy // cheeses ; cases of wine ; and at the last moment a box from the confectioner of a distant city that was positively bewildering . Several experienced cooks in the neighborhood were loaned for the occasion , and their mistresses came too , with grave advice and practical assistance . Everybody wanted to take part in preparing for the feast ; even the hens seemed to strut about with an important , sell-conscious cluck ! cluck ! as if they realized that more than usual was expected of them in the matter of fresh eggs , and were anxious as to the result . Some one was always ordering the children away , and they as persistently returned to help after their fashion . Now and then a little black face , looking all eyes and teeth , would peer around a corner of the porch , and a ragged excuse for a hat would be held out , with the information that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fer Ole Miss . " A choice sheep was killed ; a young pig that had been fed for weeks on cream was another victim of the festive spirit ; and all the cooks , white and black , went in solemn conclave to the smoke-house to select the best hams . The day of the wedding came at last , and in the early twilight all the vehicles on the place drove away from our envious eyes . Quiet settled down on the old home ; twilight gave way to starlight , and soon the young moon rose . The air was damp and heavy with the breath of the sweet honeysuckle near the porch where we sat ; bats and nightbirds began to fly , and the tree-toads to chant their monotonous , sleepy song , and soon we were glad to go to bed . There was some flavor of festivity even in this every night occurrence , for we were to sleep on pallets in the big room up-stairs , as the beds were reserved for relatives who were to come after the wedding . About midnight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the voices of the guests who had invaded our quarters , but everybody was tired , and soon all was quiet again . Next day we were early astir , for there was still much to be done : ices and cream to be frozen , cakes iced , fruit candied , pitchers of lemonade and claretcup to be made , and a priceless Japanese bowl filled with such punch as only the Doctor knew bow to brew ; it combined the mildness of the dove with the guile of the serpent . Perhaps it was a sip , a very moderate one , of this deceptive compound that makes the recollection of the " inf air " itself a delicious blur of ices , cakes , jellies ; pyramids of black faces looking in at the doors and windows ; white - jacketed waiters so impressed with a sense of their own importance that they were utterly useless ; fair , happy faces , and graceful figures moving about to the music of a trio of negro fiddlers , who called the figures vigorously , and sometimes sang the inspiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gallant fellows , who rode , shot , and danced well , boasted a good deal of their horses and their sweethearts , quoted Byron and Tom Moore , and approached all women with instinctive reverence ; altogether they were favorable specimens of the much-sneeredat Southern chivalry . Their costume of white linen trousers , low-cut vest , and dark body-coat may not have been fashionable , but it was appropriate and becoming . The belles were frank , cheery girls , with more than the average amount of beauty , fearless horsewomen and tireless dancers , but with a fund of romance and true womanliness in their hearts that gave promise of loving wives and tender mothers . Already that summer of the wedding there was a cloud in the sky , of which we were dimly aware from hearing bits of somewhat animated talk concerning " Southern rights " and the probability and consequences of Lincoln 's election . During the following summer , that of 1861 , the family gatherings were marred 1887. 41 // by violent debates and bitter words ; for the members represented all parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , the advocate of strict neutrality , the " Southern sympathizer , " and the fiery youth who was chafing under restraint , and eager to be off " beyond the lines . " The women , of course , had most to say , and said it most uncompromisingly . One day in August , after the state elections , we children slipped away from dinner , - which was prolonged beyond our patience by the violent political discussions , - and took refuge under our favorite walnut-tree , whose ample , catholic branches sheltered us all alike , no matter how much our parents differed . That day marked the beginning of a breach which was long in healing : two brothers separated without a word of farewell , and for years did not cross each other 's threshold . That night there were high words in the old house between father and son ; they parted angrily ; the latter went to his room with flushed face and resolute lips , and when they met next morning he was in traveling suit , and his saddle-bags were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakfast in grave silence , looking now and then at the tear-stained face of his wife , and speaking to her with more than usual gentleness . After a leavetaking that all tried to make like an ordinary one , he went to the stile to mount his horse , but there at the hitching-post , arching her beautiful neck , was Nelly Gray , the pride of the place , a magnificent iron-gray mare which he had broken and ridden , but never called his own . He looked inquiringly at his father ; the stern old face melted , their hands joined silently but closely , and the next moment the mare and her new master were moving toward the big gate . Before long everybody knew that he had gone to Humphrey Marshall*s camp in Owen County . Poor Nelly Gray was shot under him in the first battle . During the war the house harbored parties from both sides . It was searched more than once , and not in the most con* siderate fashion , by the Union soldiers , for suspected persons .

Sometimes about dusk a group of horsemen would be seen coming down the hill beneath the drooping branches of the beech-trees ; but before morning they were far away again . Often , as the Doctor and his wife sat at night by the wood fire , they would hear a long , low whistle , answer the signal cautiously from the open door , and a figure would emerge from the darkness , - the son on a visit to his young wife , or perhaps one of his comrades with a letter . Once they were roused at midnight by a troop , under orders of the provost marshal to look for arms and their bearers , only a few hours after a rebel soldier had left them to make his cautious way beyond the lines ; and during another search a wounded man , who had been in the house for weeks , was hidden in the slanting recess of the attic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the terror of our childish dreams .

Some of the negroes , with the feeling common to all of them that they could never be quite free so long as they stayed with their former owners , went away , not openly but secretly , and , as it seemed , ungratefully . Others who remained were not perfectly obedient , and the Doctor , though never a harsh master , had been too long an absolute one to brook the slightest check . At the beginning of the war he was a firm advocate of the Union and of the neutral policy first attempted by the State ; its end found his opinions and sympathy entirely on the side of the South . The emancipation was to him " legalized robbery ; " // he had no respect for " a government that would forcibly take property without compensation , " and thenceforward he never cast a vote .
