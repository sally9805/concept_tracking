txt Mr. Rusted was on his feet in the Assembly to-day from about 11 o'clock until 3:30 fighting with members of the majority , who seemed disposed to reduce the proportions of the supply bill . The bill was partly considered last night . Mr. Crapser objected . to spending $4,000 for Charles D. Wolcott 's collection of trilobites , but Mr. Busted made a warm speech , setting forth the value of the collection for scientific purposes , and Mr. Crapser was voted down . The item providing $5,000 for the bronze statue of Robert R. Livingston , by the sculptor Palmer , was Questioned by Mr. Slingerland , of Albany , and Mr. Husted was provoked into making a really eloquent speech , full of reminisce nces of Livingston , and not devoid of praise for the sculptor , who heard the speech from behind one of the great granite pillars at the rear of the Assembly . A motion to strike out the item of $30,595 for the Superintendent of the Onondaga Salt Springs gave Mr. Alvord an opportunity to tell a graphic story . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than five years had filled his office with great satisfaction , was removed by Gov . Robinson , on the pretext that the Superintendent was running the springs for his own private benefit . Sixty thousand dollars had been appropriated to carry on the works , and $58,000 of it remained unexpended . Mr , Hinckley came in , and it was expected that the amount would be sufficient to carry him through the year . as the appropriation had never been exceeded . When Gov . Cornell came in he became aware of certain facts which led to the removal of Hinckley and the appointment , early in February , of his successor . The work of the Salt Springs was done between April and November , but during the " dead months , " from December to February , Mr. Hinckley , Gov . Robinson 's Superintendent , was discovered to have spent $43,000 of the $60,000 , leaving but $17,000 with which to pay the salaries of the Superintendent and employes for the remainder of the year . The money , it was asserted , had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire disregard of the well-known necessities of the works . Mr. Wren , of Sings , chose to question the propriety of this appropriation , and was severely punished by Mr. Busted , who , with unusual severity , blurted out that the member of Sings was " too fresh " in legislative matters , and when , later , he returned to the attack , complaining the second time of the appropriation for Frank Swift , he was mercilessly lashed by the Rockland member , and compelled to retire with a rebuke , and without any success whatever . Several attempts were made by Democratic members to defend Gov . Robinson 's vetoes of the three previous years , whereupon Mr. Husted seized the opportunity to set forth the unreasonableness of the vetoes referred to , and to denounce Gov . Robinson 's and Gov . Tilden 's pretensions to superior economy , and to show their sham reform methods in a very interesting and convincing light . Mr. Skinner , when the $50,000 appropriation for the Catholic Protectory was reached , moved to strike it out , and recalled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , as an argument for continuing this gift , that it would not appear again . Mr. Husted 's explanation of its reappearance was that Mr. Hoguet , when he appeared before the committee last year , had " intended " to say that the $50,000 then asked for was the least that would be asked for extension purposes . The $50,000 now asked for was for maintenance . The motion to strike it out was lost . Without being reduced in any particular , the bill was ordered to a third reading . Mr. George B. Sloan has written to Mr. D. Ogden Bradley , of the Tax and Assessment Committee , in regard to the tax bills which have been submitted by that body . He says : " It is gratifying to know that this subject is at last in the hands of men who are walking over the course at such a swinging pace . I observe that Mr. George H. Andrews rises to explain in THE ** TIMES of yesterday . Ha sees terrible injustice in what is thus far proposed , but I fail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do better . Mr. Andrews I suppose to - be a man who knows a heap ' about taxation , but so far as I can learn his efforts are always in the direction of hindering rather than helping . " Mr. D. 0 . Bradley introduced a bill to prevent malicious annoyance . It provides that every person who shall knowingly send or deliver , or shall make , and , for the purpose of being delivered or sent , shall part with the possession of any letter or writing with or without a name subscribed thereto , or signed with a fictitious name , or with any letter , mark , or other designation , with " intent thereby to cause annoyance to any person , or with a view or intent to extort or gain any money or property of any description belonging to another , shall , upon conviction , be adjudged guilty of a misdemeanor , and shall be punished by imprisonment in a county jail or penitentiary not exceeding one year , or by a fine not exceeding $200 , or by both such fine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no enecial interest . Among the new bills introduced was one by Mr. Forster , extending the time in which the Tax Commissioners of New-York may make assessments until June 30 .

Mr. Bixby introduced a bill for the erection of a new market-building on . the site of the old Washington Market It makes the Controller , Commissioner of Public Works ? and President of the Board of Aldermen a commission to supervise the erection , and authorizes an appropriation of $300 , - 000 .
