txt The lawyers for James Malley , Jr. , and Walter E. Malley complain that they have been treated unfairly by the members of the jury of inquest and the lawyers who assume to instruct that body . The jurors conduct themselves , according to the defense , as though they were the regularly retained counsel for the State , and as though it was their duty to prosecute the prisoners and not to bring out any facts that might establish their innocence and prove Jennie Cramer 's death to have been suicide or an accident . Mr. T. J. Fox , who is associated with ex-Judge Blydenburgh , in looking after the interests of the young Malleys , spoke to TEE TIMES 'S reporter to-day of the " manifest unfairness of the mode of procedure adopted by the State in this case . The lawyers who conduct the examination , " he said , " have not asked for a list of witnesses from the counsel for the defense , and will not defer to us at all upon any point . Those employes in Edward Malley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the State , and were treated as though the fact that they were employed in that store made them ready to tell untruths concerning their knowledge of the movements of the Malley boys during the first week in this month . " Mr. Fox said that be and ex-Judge Blydenburgh were anxious to shed all the light they could upon the mysterious death of the girl , and that it was to the ' Interests of their clients that her death should , if possible , be explained . The manner of her death was a mystery to the defense , and while he was positive that Walter and James were in no way connected with her murder , if she was murdered , they were determined to use their best endeavors to show how she died . It was probably true that Jennie Cramer was at the Railroad Grove at Sevin Rock on Friday afternoon and evening , but that either James or Walter Malley was with her was not the fact . She had doubtless gone out alone to the grove , feeling that she would not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blanche Douglass nor James and Walter Malley desired her company . Mr. Fox explained that , as Jennie 's mother had begun a campaign against the Douglass woman and the Malley boys for taking her daughter with them on their excursions , they desired to bring about a cessation of hostilities by not permitting her to accompany them . Therefore , Mr. Fox says , if Jennie Cramer was at the grove on Friday afternoon or evening , and was in the company of any one , that person was not James or Walter Malley or Blanche Douglass . As to how Jennie came to her death Mr. Fox declined to express an opinion . Ho proposed to await developments . He and ex-Judge Blydenburgh were willing now and had been anxious from the first to aid the authorities in any way in their power to get at the bottom facts , but there wag an evident unwillingness upon the part of those officers to accept their services . Mr. Fox said that , with his associate in the case , he had talked over the advisability of procuring a writ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be argued in a court of record . But they had not fully made up their minds to ask for such a writ . They had faith that a Judge of the Court of Common Pleas or the Superior Court would see the injustice of detaining the prisoners without bail unless the State 's officers should present a prima facie case against them . In all likelihood the application for a writ will be made . The counsel referred to the conflict of testimony . The manager of Redcliffe 's restaurant and the colored waiter of that place had testified that two women , one of whom was supposed to have been Blanche Douglass and the other Jennie Cramer , were there with Walter Walley and had lamb chops and milk between 10 and 11 o'clock on the evening of Thursday , Aug. 4 . Walter and James Malley , Jr. , say that they were in the same restaurant between those hours on that evening ; that they were accompanied only by Blanche Douglass , and that Jennie Cramer was not with them . Other witnesses were prepared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accompanied by two women that evening while in Redcliffe 's . Mr. Fox thought that the woman Douglass had tried to tell the truth in her latest confession to the jury of inquest . He said that she had every inducement to make out a strong case against the Malleys in order to gain her own freedom , and he did not believe that her chief statement , upon which it was assumed that the jury had placed so much reliance , at all implicated the young men . She had insisted from the first that the last time she sass Jennie alive was about noon of Thursday , and that Jennie was in a car bound for West Haven and Sevin Rock . James and . Walter Malley did not account for Jennie 's movements after Wednesday night , and Jennie was at her home on Thursday morning , where she was severely reprimanded by her mother for remaining away from home on the previous night . Thus the fact that she was alive on Thursday morning is established . Whether Blanche Douglass saw Jennie at noon on her way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that young woman . No one else had appeared to corroborate the story that Jennie was going in that direction . A wagonload of queer-looking witnesses for the Railroad Grove had testified that Jennie was at the grove on Friday evening , and that she was accompanied by a man who looked . like James Malley , Jr . James had testified that he was at home on that night , and his sister Louisa and his father yesterday declared before the jury of inquest that James returned home early Eriday evening , and after supper , a bath and a shave , retired for the night and arose about 7 o'clock on Saturday morning . The testimony of the accused man , his sister , and his father toward proving an alibi for James was all that had . so far been offered on that point . Blanche Douglass and Walter Malley , whom the wagon-load of witnesses , and especially " Happy Jack " Gilchrist , were almost positive were at the grove on Friday evening with James Malley , Jr. , and Jennie Cramer , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like James . will rely upon proving an alibi . He has said that , accompanied by a young lady , he drove to Branford Point , about eight miles east of this city , on Friday evening , and returned between 10 and 11 o'clock . Ho does not say who the " young lady " was , but it is presumed that she was Blanche Douglass . Edward Malley , Walter 's father , said to THE Trans 's reporter this afternoon that he went to Branford Point to ascertain about this alleged . visit by Walter and the young lady , and found it true that they were there on that Friday evening . la hile it is possible , as some persons believe , that Jennie Cramer came to her death on Thursday night , and while there is no testimony showing where she was on that night , what is to become of the testimony of the wagon-load of witnesses who have testified that they saw her in the Railroad . Grove on Friday night ? Blanche Douglass is the only witness who had sworn that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after she received a scolding from her mother that morning , and Blanche said that Jennie was on her way to West Haven or Savin Rock . No one swore that they saw her or either of the Malleys there on Thursday night . But the manager of Redcliffe 's restaurant and the colored waiter testified that , to the best or their belief , the two young women with Walter Malley in the restaurant on Thursday evening were the same who were there in the morning , and it is adnitted that the ttvo young women of the morning were Blanche Douglass and Jennie Cramer . James 's father testified yesterday that James was not home on Thursday night , but no testimony has yet been give , to show where James andWalter Malley were on Thursday night . While so many inquiries have been made by the jury of inquest and the Police officers about the movements of all concerned on Friday night . the day andlnight previous have Fieen almost neglected , and that Jennie Cramer might have been murdered , if murdered at all , on Thursday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have attracted the attention of the Hawkshaws of the city or the rustic Vidocqs of West Haven . The physicians who examined the body on Saturday morning decided that Jennie had been dead but a few hours . and the Hawkshaws and the Vidocqs at once agreed unanimously that Jennie was murdered on Friday night , and then bent all their energies to prove that it was on that night her life was taken . When the wagon-load:of witnesses arrived from Railroad Grove , and the testimony was given that Jennie , and possibly James and Walter , wore seen very much alive at the grove on Friday evening , the Hawkshaws and Vidocqs rejoiced . Now comes the attempts to prove alibis for James and Walter , and the showmen and clam-diggers of the grove are beginning to be less positive than they were about whom they saw there on Friday night . Several persons visited the County Jail today in the hope of seeing Walter and James , but few were permitted to speak to them . James was in cell No. 13 , and attached to she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cash girls employed in his uncle 's store . A bouquet was also tied to the door of cell No. 15 , where Walter was confined . Both of the prisoners are almost constantly locked up and have had only a few minutes , on two occasions , for exercise in the corridor since they were arrested . The visitors remarked that this close confinement was entirely unnecessary , and asked Jailer Stevens why he did not give the boys a chance to shake the wrinkles out of their limbs in the corridor . The jailer said that , owing to the small force of keepers , there being only two of them for over 150 prisoners , they could not permit the prisoners such privileges frequently . Both Walter and James said to the THE TIMES 'S reporter that they were in good spirits yesterday because they thought they would be admitted to bail . They were much disappointed . Their counsel was with them , and Mr. Malley , the merchant , was also there . The members of the jury of inquest were walking about NewHaven the greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention as the drummajor of a regimental band in full feathers . Dr. Painter , one of them , visited . Mrs. Cramer , Jennie 's mother , at the cigar store kept by Mr. Cramer in Grand-street , and had a long talk with her . The indefatigable Deputy Sheriff Peck left Blanche Douglass in the care of his wife and daughter to-day and attended a picnic at West Haven . He was engaged the greater part of the afternoon and evening in acting as usher in a restaurant at that place .
