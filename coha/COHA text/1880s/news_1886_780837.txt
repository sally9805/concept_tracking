txt The re-election of T. J. Vail as Secretary of the National Trotting Association was a surprise to many Chicago turfmen . Whether there will be an immediate break in the National Association as the result of his re-election is a question involved in considerable doubt . There is every probability of the organization of a Western association , but it is an open question whether the clubs that will form it will withdraw from or retain their membership iu the National Association . The old association contains a considerable amount of money , and any member that withdraws forfeits all claim to that money . A desire to cut loose from Mr. Vail and his friends is expressed by a majority of the persons identified with trotting tracks of the West.bnt they have no desire to give their interest in the National Association 's funds to the Vail side . It is claimed that St. Louis and Detroit will at once join hands to organize a new association . If this is true a Western association will be in existence inside of 60 days . The St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will come pretty near making a success of any project they embark in . If the telegraphic reports from NewYork are correct , Judge Grant in an interview last night denounced as an unmitigated lie a statement that he had misrepresented his position toward Vail to H. V. Bemis , proprietor of the Horseman . Ho also said he went to the meeting of the board intending to sustain Vail . Mr. Bemis 's reference to Judge Grant 's position was made on information imparted by Messrs . Abercrombie , Hall , and Davis . Speaking of the Judge 's remarks , Mr. Abercrombie said to-day : " I have sacredly withheld his expressions to me from the public , but now that he has seen fit to make such a furious and abusive denial of Mr. Bemis 's statement I have nothing further to withhold . Judge Grant must now abide the consequences of his declarations and his rash denial . His action is beyond comprehension . "
