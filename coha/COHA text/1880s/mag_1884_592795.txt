GEORGE FULLER . B* SIDNEY DICKINSON . THE death of George Fuller has removed a strong and original figure from the activity of American art , and added a weighty name to its history . To speak of him now , while his work is fresh in the public mind , is a labor of some peril ; so easy is it , when the sense of loss is keen , to make mistakes in judgment , and to allow the friendly spirit to prevail over the judicial , in an estimation of him as a man and a painter . Yet he has gone in and out before us long enough to make a study of him profitable , and to give us , even now , some occasion for an opinion as to the place he is likely to occupy in the annals of our native art . Mr. Fuller held a peculiar position in American painting , and one which seems likely to remain hereafter unfilled . He followed no one , and had no followers ; his art was the outgrowth of personal temperament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and although he studied others , he was himself his only master . In other men whose names are prominent in our art , we seem to see the direction of an outside influence . Stuart and Copley confessed to the teaching of the English school of their day - a school brilliant but formal , and holding close guidingreins over its disciples ; Benjamin West became denationalized , so far as his art was concerned ; Allston showed the impression of England , Italy , and Flanders , all at once , in his refined and thoughtful style , and Hunt manifested in every stroke of his brilliant brush the learned and facile methods that are in vogue in the leading ateliers of modern Paris . In these men , and in the followers whom their preeminent ability drew after them , we perceive the dominant impulse to be of alien origin ; Fuller alone , of all the great ones in our art , was in thought and action purely and simply American . The influence that led others into the error of imitation , seems to have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vainly if we look elsewhere than within himself for the suggestions upon which his art was established . Superficial resemblances to other painters are sometimes to be noted in his works , but in governing principle and habit of thought he was serenely and grandly alone . // 368 George Fuller . We must regard him thus if we would study him understandingly , and gain from our observation a correct estimate of his power . We think of our other painters as in the crowd , and amid the affairs of men , and detect in their art a certain uneasiness which the bustle about them necessarily caused . We perceive this most in Hunt , who was emphatically a man of the world , and in Stuart , who shows in some of his later work that his position as the court painter of America , while it aided his purse and reputation , harmed his repose ; least in Allston , whose tastes were literary , whose love was in retirement , and who would have been a poet had not circumstances first placed a brush and palette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was courted by the best society of his time , and was not permitted , although he doubtless longed for it , to indulge to its full extent his chaste and dreamy fancy . It may be said without disrespect to his undoubted powers , that he would have been less esteemed in his own day if his art had not been largely conventional , and thus easily understood by those who had studied the accepted masters of painting . He lacked positive force of idea , as his works clearly show , - that quality which was among the most characteristic traits of Fuller 's method , and made him at once the greatest genius , and the man most misunderstood , among contemporary American painters . Although men who have not had " advantages " in life are naturally prone to regret their deprivation , they frequently owe their success to this seeming bar against opportunity . We have often seen illustrated in our art the fact that favorable circumstances do not necessarily insure success , and now from the life of Fuller we gain the still more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in the face of obstacles . Few men endured more for art than he ; none have waited more uncomplainingly for a recognition that was sure to come by-and-by , or received with greater serenity the approbation which the dull world came at last to bestow . His history is most wholesome in its record of steadfast resting upon conviction , and teaches quite as strongly as his pictures do , the value of absorption in a lofty idea . If the saying that those nations are the happiest that have no history is true of men , Mr. Fuller 's life must be regarded as exceptionally fortunate . Considered by itself , it was quiet and uneventful , and had little to excite general interest ; but when viewed in its relation to the practice of his art , it is found to be full of eloquent suggestions to all who , like him , have been appointed to win success through suffering . The narrative of his experience comprises two great periods - the preparation , which covered thirty-four years , and the achievement , to the enjoyment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first period is subdivided into two , of which one embraces eighteen years , from the time when , at the age of twenty , he entered upon the study of his art , to his retirement from the world to the exile of his Deerfield farm ; the other including sixteen years of seclusion , until , at the age of fifty-four , he came forth again to proclaim a new revelation . The first part of his career may be dismissed without any extended consideration . Its record consists of an almost unrelieved account of struggle , indifferent success , and lack of appreciation and encouragement , in the cities of Boston // *nd New York . In Boston he appeared as the student , rather than the producer of works , and laid the foundation of his style in observation of the paintings of Stuart , Copley , Allston , and Alexander , - all excellent models upon which to base a practice , although destined to show little of their influence upon the pictures which he painted in the maturity of his power . It is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and particularly Stuart , made an impression upon him which he was never afterward wholly able to conceal . We may see even in some of his latest works , under his own peculiar manner , suggestions of Stuart , particularly in portraits of women , which in pose and expression , and to a considerable degree in color , show much of that dignity and composure which so distinguish the female heads of our greatest portrait-painter . He always admired Stuart , and in his later years spoke much of him , with strong appreciation for his skill in describing character , and the refined taste which is such a marked feature of his best manner . His work in Boston made no particular impression upon the public mind , and after five years ' trial of it he removed to New York , where he joined that brilliant circle of painters and sculptors which , with its followers , has made one of the strongest impressions , if not the most valuable or permanent , upon the art of America . During his residenc* in that city he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed a manner more distinguished for conventional excellence than any particular individuality . It was remarked of him , however , that he was disposed , even at this time , to seek to present the thought and disposition of his subjects more strongly than their merely physical features , and among his principal associates excited no little appreciative comment upon this tendency . In some of his portraits of women of that period , wherein he evidently attempted to present the superior fineness and sensibility of the feminine nature , this effort toward ideality is quite strongly indicated ; they are painted with a more hesitating and lingering touch than his portraits of men , and with a certain seeming lack of confidence , which throws about them a thin fold of that veil of etherialism and mystery which so enwraps nearly all his pictures of the last eight years . This treatment , however , seems to have been at that time more the result of experiment than conviction ; later in life he wrought its suggestions into a system , the principles of which we may study further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was chiefly confined to portrait-painting , although it is a significant fact that among his pictures of that time are two which show that the feeling for poetical and imaginative effort was working in him . At a comparatively early age he painted an impression of Coleridge 's Genevieve , which showed marked evidence of power , and later , after seeing a picture of the school of Rubens , which was owned by one of his artist friends , produced a study which he afterward seems to have developed into his well-known Boy and Bird ; a Cupid-like figure , holding a bird closely against its breast . These exercises , however , seem to have been , as it were , accidental , and had little or no effect in leading him to the practice in which he afterward became absorbed . His life in New York , which was // interrupted only by three winter trips to the South , whither he went in the hope of securing some commissions for portraits , was an uneventful experience of very modest pecuniary success and brought him as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the National Academy of Design . Lie then went to Europe , where , for eight . months , he ' carefully studied the old masters in the principal galleries of England and the Continent . This visit to the Old World was of incalculable value to him in the method of painting which he afterward made his own , and , in point of fact , gave him his first decided inclination toward it . Its best influence , however , was in giving him confidence in himself , and assurance of the reasonableness of the views which he had already begun to entertain . He had been led before to regard the old masters as superior to rivalry and incapable of weakness , superhuman characters , indeed , whose works should discourage effort . Instead of this , however , he found them to be men like himself , with their share of defect and error , yet made grand by inspiration and idea , and this knowledge greatly encouraged him , a man who of all painters was at once the most modest and devoted . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find theie one or two men whose works make the strongest appeals to their liking , and , devoting their attention chiefly to these , they show ever after the marks of an influence that is easily traced to its source ; . Fuller , however , observed with broader and more penetrating view , and , as his works show , seems to have studied men less than principles , and to have been filled with admiration , not so much for parlofty spirit in which the greatest of the world 's painters labored . The colorists and chiaroscurists , such as Titian on the one hand and Rembrandt on the other , seem to have impressed him particularly , and of all men Titian the most strongly , as many of his pictures . testify , and as such glowing works as the Arethusa and the Boy and Bird . unmistakably show . Yet it was not in matter or in manner , but in the expression of a great truth , that the old masters most strongly affected him . He felt at once , and grew to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and undisturbed temper , and drew from them the important principle that true genius may be known by its confessing neither pride nor selfdistrust . The serenity of their style he sought at once to appropriate , and . thereafter worked as much as possible in imitation of their evident purpose , . striving simply to do his best , without . any question of whether the result : would please , or another 's effort be reckoned as greater than his own . It became a governing principle with him never to seek to outdo any one , or to feel anything but pleasure at another 's success , for he was not a man who could fail to recognize the truth that envy is fatal to a fine mood in any labor . Few artists , we may well believe , study the great art of the world in this spirit , or derive from it such a lesson . On his return to America , he betook. himself to his native town of *eerfield , to assume for a time the care of the ancestral farm , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had returned from Europe full of inspired ideas , and was apparently ready to go on at once in new paths of labor ; ticular practices as for the common and but the voice of duty seemed to him to // call him away from his chosen life , and he obeyed its summons without hesitation . Moreover , he loved the country and the family homestead , and may have perceived , also , that the condition of art in Boston and New York was not such as to encourage an original purpose , and that , if he was ever to gain success , he must develop himself in quiet , and aloof from the distracting influences of other methods and men . It is easy to perceive , with the complete record of his life before us , that this experience of labor and thought upon the Deerfield farm , although at first sight forming an hiatus in his career , was really its most pregnant period , and that without it the Fuller who is now so much admired might have been lost to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never have been awakened . It is , indeed , a spirit that can find no congenial dwelling-place in towns , but makes its home in the fields and on the hillsides , to which the poet-painter , depressed but not cast down by his experience of life , repaired to work and dream . For sixteen years , in the midst of the fairest pastoral valley of New England , he lived in the contemplation of the ideas that had passed across his mind in the quiet of European galleries , and now became more definite impressions . The secret of those years , with their deep , slow current of refined and melancholy thought , is now sealed with him in eternal sleep ; but from the works that remain to us as the matured fruits of his life , we may gain some hint of his experiences . It is not to be questioned that he drew from the New-England soil that he tilled , and the air that he breathed , an inspiration which never failed him . Th&amp; flavor of the quiet valley fills all his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meadows , the inviting slope of its low hills , the calm grandeur of its encircling mountains , the mysterious gloom and wholesome brightness of its changing skies , the atfnosphere of history and romance which is its breath and life . Song and story have found many incidents for treatment in this locality . Not far from the farm where Fuller 's daily work was done , the tragedy of Bloody Brook was enacted ; the fields which he tilled have their legend of Indian ambuscade and massacre ; the soil is sown , as with dragon 's teeth , with the arrow-heads and battle-axes of many bitter conflicts ; even to the ancient house where , in recent years , the painter 's summer easel was set up , a former owner was brought home with the red man 's bullet in his breast . The menace of midnight attack seems even now to the wanderer in the darkness to burden the air of these mournful meadows , and tradition shows that here were felt the ripples of that tide of superstitious frenzy which flowed from Salem through all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potent suggestions to the art-idealist than this , and although it did not lead him to paint its tragic history ( for no man had less liking for violence and passion than he ) , it impressed him deeply with its concurrent records of endurance and devotion . Nor did it invite him , as it might have done in the case of a weaker man , into mere description , but having aroused his thought , it submitted itself wholly to the treatment of his strong and original genius . He approached his task with a broad and comprehensive vision , and a loving and inquiring soul . He was not satisfied with the revelation of his eyes alone , but sought earnestly for the secret of // nature 's life , and of its influence upon the sensitive mind of man . He perceived the truth that nature without man is naught , even as there is no color without light , and strove earnestly to show in his art the relations that they sustain to each other . He saw , also , that the material in each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and thus he painted not places , but the influence of places , even as he painted not persons merely , but their natures and minds . It is for this reason that , although we see in all his pictures where landscape finds a place the meadows , trees , and skies of Deerfield , we also see much more , - the general and unlocated spirit of NewEngland scenery . This is the true impressionism - a system to which Fuller was always constant in later life , and which he developed grandly . He was , however , as far removed as possible from that cheap , shallow , and idealess school of French painters whose wrongful appropriation of the name " Impressionist " has prejudiced us against the principle that it involves . The inherent difference between them and Fuller lies in this - he exercised a choice , and thought the beautiful alone to be worthy of description , while they selected nothing , but painted indiscriminately all things , with whatever preference they indicated lying in the direction of the strong and ugly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fuller 's subjects were always sweet and noble , and it followed as a matter of course that his treatment of them was refined and strong . His idea was also broad ; he sought for the typical in nature and life , and grew inevitably into a continually widening and more comprehensive style . He taught himself to lose the sense of detail , and to strike at once to the centre , presenting the vital idea with decision , and departing from it with increasing vagueness of treatment , until the whole area of his work was filled with a harmonious and carefully graduated sense of suggestion . He arrived at his method by an original way of studying the natural world . He did not , as most artists do , take his paint-box and easel and devote himself to description , and from his studies work out the finished picture . Instead , he disencumbered himself of all materials for making memoranda , and merely stood before the scene that impressed him , looking upon it for hours at a time . Then he betook himself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mind had formed under the guiding-hand of his fancy , the result being that nature and human thought appeared together upon the canvas , giving a double grace and power . The process was subtle , and not to be described clearly even by the painter himself , who found his work so largely a matter of inspiration that he was never able to make copies of his pictures . They grew out of his consciousness in a strange way whose secret he could not grasp ; to the end of his life he was an inquirer , always hesitating , and never confident in anything except that art was truth , and that he who followed it must walk in modesty and humbleness of spirit before the greatness of its mystery . A man of ideas and sentiment , remote from the clamor of schools and the complaints of critics , with recollections of the grandest art of the world in his mind , and beautiful aspects of nature continually before his eyes , he could hardly fail to work out a style of marked originality . The effort* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the instant the impressions that // eighteen years of study and practice have made , and Fuller found his life at Deerfield none too long to rid him of his respect fc*r formulas . His experience there was a continuous round of study . He completed little , although he painted much , inexorably blotting out , no matter after what expenditure of labor , the work that failed to respond to his idea , and striving constantly to be simple , straightforward , and impressive , without being vapid , arrogant , or dogmatic . He possessed in large measure that rarest of gifts to genius - modesty - and approached the secrets of nature and life more tremblingly as he passed from their outer to their inner circles . It was a necessity of his peculiar feeling and manner of study that he should develop a lingering , hesitating , halfuncertain style of painting , which , however variously it may be viewed by different minds , is undoubtedly of the utmost effectiveness in describing the principles , rather than the facts , of nature and life . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " mannerism , " - a term that has wrongly come to have a suggestion of contempt attached to it , - was with him a principle , and employed by him as the one in which he could best express truth . Art may justly claim great latitude in this endeavor , and schools and systems arrogate too much when they seek to define its limitations . Absolute truth to nature is impossible in art , which is constrained to lie to the eye in order to satisfy the mind , and continually transposes the harmonies of earth and sky into the minor key . Fuller offended the senses often , but he touched that nerve-centre in the heart , without which impressions are not truly recognized . He won liking , rather than startled men into it , and his art , instead of approaching , retired and beckoned . His figures never " came out of the frame at you , " as is the common expression of admiration nowadays . He put everything at a distance , made it reposeful , and drew about figure and landscape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established a strange and reciprocal mood of sentiment between them . He alone of all American painters filled the whole of his canvas with air ; others place a barrier to atmosphere in their middle distance , and it comes no farther , but he brought it over to the nearest inch of foreground . This treatment , while it aided the quietness and restful mystery of his pictures , also strengthened his constant effort to avoid marked contrasts . He sought always a general impression , and ruthlessly sacrificed everything that called attention to itself at the expense of the whole . Yet he was not a man of swift insight in comprehensive matters , nor one who could be called clever . Weighty in thought as in figure , he moved slowly and in long waves , and although of marked quickness in intuition , he seemed to distrust this quality in himself until he had proved it by reason . He received his motive as by a spark quicker than the lightning 's , and when he began a work saw its intention clearly , although its form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of darkness he saw a face shine dimly with some light of joy or sorrow that was in it , and at the moment caught its suggestion upon the waiting canvas . Then came inquiry , explanation , reasoning , the exercise of a manly and poetic sensibility , and endless experiment with lines and forms , of which the greater part were meaningless , until by // unwearied searching , and constant trial and correction , the complete idea was expressed at last . When a painter produces works in this strange fashion , an involved and confused manner of technical treatment becomes inevitable . The schools , which glorify manual skill and the swift and exhilarating production of effects , can not appreciate it , for all their teaching is opposed to the principle that makes technique subordinate to idea , and they can not look with favor upon a man who boldly reverses everything . The perfect art undoubtedly rests upon a combination of sublime thought and entire command of resources , but while we wait for this we shall not make mistake if we consider the effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a facility that has become cheap from hundreds mastering it yearly . We can not close our eyes to Fuller 's technical faults and weaknesses , but his pictures would undeniably be a less precious heritage to American art than they now are , if he had not been great enough to perceive that academic skill becomes weak by just so much as it is magnified , and is strong only when viewed in its just relation , as the means to an end . We perplex and confuse ourselves in studying his work , and are naturally a little irritated that he keeps his secret of power so well ; yet we can not help feeling that his style is wonderfully adapted to the end in view , and perhaps the only appropriate medium for the expression of a habit of thought that is as peculiar as itself . Schools will insist , and with reason , upon working by rule ; yet in art , as in other discipline of teaching , genius does not develop itsdf until it escapes from its instructors . Mr. Fuller 's life was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was impelled to steps which he might never have taken of his own accord . He was drawn by influences that he could not control into his fruitful course of study and experience at Deerfield , where his farm gave him support , and permitted him to indulge in an Unembarrassed practice of his art ; then , when his time was ripe , he was driven by the sharp lash of financial embarrassment into the world again . Eight years ago he reappeared in Boston , with about a dozen paintings of landscapes , ideal heads , and small figures , which were exhibited and promptly sold amid every expression of interest and favor . Confirmed and strengthened in his belief by this success , he again established his studio here , and began that series of remarkable works which have given him a place among the greatest of American painters . The touch of popular favor quickened him into a lofty and quiet enthusiasm , and stimulated both his imagination and his descriptive powers . During all his experience at Deerfield a certain lack of self-confidence seems to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his convictions endorsed by the public , he attempted at once to labor on a more ambitious scale . He broadened his canvases , and increased the size of his figures and landscapes , and where he was before sweet and inviting , became strong and impressive , yet still holding all his former qualities . The first year of his new residence in Boston saw the production of The Dandelion Girl , a light-hearted , careless creature , full of a life that had no touch of responsibility , and descriptive of a joyous and ephemeral mood . A long step forward was taken in The Romany Girl , which immediately fol // lowed ,  --  a work full of fire and freedom , strongly personal in suggestion , and marked by a wild aud impatient individuality which revealed in the girl the impression of a lawless ancestry , that somehow and somewhere had felt the action of a finer strain of blood . The next year Fuller reached the highest point of his inspiration and power in The Quadroon , a work which is likely to be held for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength of idea , importance of motive , and vivid force of description are concerned . Without violence , even without expression of action , but simply by a pair of haunting eyes , a beautiful , despairing face , and a form confessing utter weariness and abandonment of hope , he revealed all the national shame of slavery , and its degradation of body and soul . Every American can not but blush to look upon it , so simple and dignified is its rebuke of the nation 's long perversity and guilt . The artist 's next important effort was the famous Winifred Dysart , as far removed in purpose from The Quadroon as it could well be , yet akin to it by its added testimony to the painter 's constant sympathy with weak and beseeching things , and worthy to stand at an equal height with the picture of the slave by virtue of its beauty of conception , loveliness of character , and pathetic appeal to the interest . It was in all respects as typical and comprehensive as The Quadroon itself , holding within its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - England girlhood , yet with the shadow of an uncongenial experience brooding over it , and perhaps of inherited weakness and early death . And the wonder of it all was that the girl had no sign about herself of longing or discontent ; she was not of a nature to anticipate or dream , and the spectator 's interest was intensified at seeing in her and before her what she herself did not perceive . That art can give such power of suggestion to its creations is a marvel and a delight . Following these two works - and at some distance , although near enough to confirm and even increase the painter 's fame - came the Priscilla , Evening ; Lorette , Nydia , Boy and Bird , Hannah , Psyche , and others , ending this year with the Arethusa , whose glowing and chastened loveliness makes it his strongest purely artistic work , and confirms the technical value of his method as completely as The Quadroon and Winifred Dysart do his habit of thought . He painted innumerable landscapes , portraits , and ideal heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two works of great and permanent value , the And She Was a Witch , and The Gatherer of Simples , to whose absorbing interest all who have studied them closely will confess . The latter , particularly , is of importance as showing how carefully Fuller studied into the secret of expression , and of nature 's sympathy with human moods . This poor , worn , sad , old face , in which beauty and hope shone once , and where resignation and memory now dwell ; this trembling figure , to whose decrepitude the bending staff confesses as she totters down the hill ; the gathering gloom of the sky , in which one ray of promise for a bright to-morrow shines from the setting sun ; the mute witnessing of the trees upon the hill , which have seen her pass and repass from joyful youth to lonely age , and even her eager grasp upon the poor treasure of herbs that she bears , - all these items of the scene impress // one with a sympathy whose keenness is even bitter , and excite a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with so much simplicity and power . It is not strange that when the news of his death became known , many who had never seen him , but had studied the pictures in his latest exhibition , should have come , with tears in their eyes , to the studios which neighbored his , to learn something of his history . Such works are not struck out in a heat , but grow and develop like human lives , and it will not surprise many to know that most of them were labored on for years . With Fuller , a picture was never completed . His idea was constantly in advance of his work , and persisted in new suggestions , so that the Winifred Dysart was two years in the painting , the Arethusa five , and The Gatherer of Simples and the Witch , after an even longer course of labor , were held by him at his death as not yet satisfactory . The figures in the two works last mentioned have suffered almost no change since first put upon the canvas , but they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different landscapes , and would doubtless have been placed in as many more before he had satisfied his fastidious and exacting taste . The artist found as much difficulty in naming his pictures when they were done as he did in painting them . It is a prevalent , but quite erroneous , i mpression that his habit was to select a subject from some literary work , and then attempt to paint it in the light of the author 's ideas . His practice exactly reversed this method : he painted his picture first , and then tried to evolve or find a name that would fit it . The name Winifred Dysart , which is without literary origin or meaning , and yet in some strange way seems the only proper title for the work to which it is attached , came out of the artist 's own mind . His Priscilla was started as an Elsie Venner , but he found it impossible to work upon the lines another had laid down without too much cramping his own fancy ; when half done he thought of calling it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name by chance of having taken up The Blithedale Romance , and noting with pleased surprise how closely Hawthorne 's account of his heroine fitted his own creation . The Nydia was started with the idea of presenting the helplessness of blindness , with a hint of the exaltation of the other senses that is consequent upon the loss of sight , and showed at first merely a girl groping along a wall in search of a door ; and the Arethusa was the outgrowth of a general inspiration caused by a reading of Spenser 's Fa*irie Queen , and did not receive its present very appropriate name until its exhibition made some designation necessary . I have devoted this study on of Mr. Fuller to his quality as an artist rather than to his character as a man , but shall have written in vain if some hint has not been given of the loveliness of his disposition , the modesty of his spirit , the chaste force of his mind . A man inevitably paints as he himself is , and shows his nature in his works : Fuller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painted with dignity and single-heartedness , and the grace of his life dwells in them . GEORGE FULLER was born in Deerfield , Massachusetts , in 1822 . He was descended from old Puritan stock , and his ancesters were among the early // settlers of the Connecticut River valley . He inherited a taste for art , as an uncle and several other relatives of the previous generation were painters , although none of them attained any particular reputation . He began painting by himself at the age of about sixteen years , and at the age of twenty entered the studio of Henry K. Brown , of Albany , New York , where he received his first and only direct instruction . His work , until the age of about forty years , was almost entirely devoted to  |p9rtraits  ; but he is best known , and will be longest remembered , for his ideal work in figure and landscape painting , which he entered upon about i86o , but did not make his distinctive field until 1876 . From the latter date , to the time of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pecuniarily successful . He received probably the largest prices ever paid to an American artist for single figures : $3,000 for the Winifred Dysart , and $4,000 each for the Priscilla and Evening ; Lorette . He died in Boston on the twenty-first of March , 1884 , leaving a widow , four sons , and a daughter . During May , a memorial exhibition of his works was held at the Museum of Fine Arts . - EDITOR. @
