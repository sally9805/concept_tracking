They enjoy the scene without interfering with that of Percy and Mary . Percy . Percy Seward Really , Miss Mary , I think it quite unreasonable , to say the least , to laugh at my protestations of lo  --  Mary . Mary Miller Laughing and holding up her finger Ah ! Ah ! Percy . Percy Seward Respect , I 'm sure I see nothing in my infatuation to laugh at . I do lo  --  She looks at him , he checks himself  --  admire you , and why not ? Everyone here loves you . Mary . Mary Miller Seriously And that is the very reason you should not . I am an orphan  --  poor  --  ignorant  --  Percy . Percy Seward Interrupting No ! Not ignorant . Mary . Mary Miller Well , unlearned , except for such learning as one gets from these rough , honest people , among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You say you are rich  --  I have been taught that the rich are proud  --  are you proud ? Percy . Percy Seward Yes  --  in the just pride that always accompanies wealth when tempered with refinement and good breeding  --  there are different kinds of pride . Mary . Mary Miller Well , I too am proud ! You say you have a dear mother  --  who loves you and whom you love . Taking his hand I honor you for that  --  I can only love the memory of mine  --  her I have never known  --  neither father nor mother ; my father they say was lost at sea . The shock killed my mother  --  and I was launched  --  as I may say tempest tossed , upon the sea of life  --  an orphan . The fisher folks cared for me , first one and then the other  --  I was known as " the fishermen 's child " ; at the age of three years Mrs. Hepburne took me as her own . I have lived here Points to cabin with her and Blushes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have heard that story and will confess that it was that that first awakened a feeling of lo  --  She looks at him I see nothing in it to prevent your listening to me . Mary . Mary Miller Everything  --  the fact of my being what I am and your being what Hesitates you say you are  --  prevents  --  say that you are honest and would make me your wife , which  --  Hesitates Percy . Percy Seward You have no right to doubt . Mary . Mary Miller Avoiding that Would it not break the heart of that mother you love  --  to see you married to the " fishermen 's child "  --  would she be willing to receive me as a daughter ? Percy . Percy Seward Well  --  Hesitates she might not at first  --  but eventually her love for me  --  Mary . Mary Miller There  --  you see that with all your learning I am wiser than you , in that wisdom born of instinct , and which none possess to such a degree as the child of nature  --  granting even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that holy mother love  --  before which all other love palls as the dew melts before the sun 's hot rays , should cast aside all pride of birth , all thought of station and for her " boy 's " sake clasp me to her breast in loving welcome  --  how would it be with you after the first flush of fancied bliss had passed ? Would you not tire of your fisher bride  --  would you not shame to present her to your fashionable friends  --  blush at her awkward ways and country manners  --  would you not soon learn to draw comparisons between her and the proud and cultured ladies of your class ? Percy . Percy Seward No ! Never  --  I swe  --  Mary . Mary Miller Hush ! Yes  --  In spite of yourself would come the doubt as to the wisdom of your choice  --  you would learn to ponder on what might have been  --  the caresses you once so eagerly sought would gradually grow irksome  --  following this would come coldness  --  neglect  --  and finally abandonment  --  for you perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! No , best leave the daisy of the field in the field , where the hand of God hath sown it ! Transplant it to the hothouse  --  it will wither  --  fade , fall and die . Percy . Percy Seward You have painted a gloomy picture . Mary . Mary Miller Let us say a true one . There , let us be friends , you know but little of me  --  I nothing of you save that you have flattered me with your attentions  --  that you are a gentleman I feel  --  and as such there is my hand  --  go back to your city friends , choose from among them one more worthy to share your life than I  --  and you will one day thank me for having saved you from a step you would have regretted to your dying day . Hangs her head silently , brushes away a tear , looks up smilingly , laughs Besides , do you not know I am not free , that I am already promised to another ? Percy . Percy Seward Yes  --  to Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary . Mary Miller Yes , my name is Mary . Percy . Percy Seward Is he worthy of you  --  you have drawn a picture of your fancied life with me  --  have you ever drawn one of your life with him ? Mary . Mary Miller Yes  --  to live always here , among the rough , kind hearts that have known me from birth  --  to be the staff of his aged mother 's declining years and perhaps to close her gentle eyes in sleep at last  --  to be a fisherman 's wife , true and loyal , to make his home bright and happy with my smiles and cheer him with my love  --  to bid him godspeed on his departure and welcome home on his return . Perhaps one day to place within his arms a fragile image of himself , to kneel with him and thank the giver of all good for the boon of his bestowal  --  the greatest in his gifts , the blessing of motherhood . Percy . Percy Seward But do you not fear that he  --  Mary . Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have thought of that , not with fear , however , for we fisher folks are not much given to fear  --  but with a sort of dread  --  but we are a pious people here  --  the fisherman 's life is a hazardous one at best , and we are taught that " He that giveth also taketh away , " and to say " Thy will be done . " There are worse things than death in this world . Percy . Percy Seward I do not mean sea faring dangers , I mean , pardon me  --  his love for  --  Mary . Mary Miller What he calls a social glass ? Percy . Percy Seward Yes , I have seen  --  Mary . Mary Miller So have I. All our people here drink more or less , they seem to inherit it from their cradles . It is as natural for a fisherman to drink as it is for the fish they risk their lives to catch  --  Percy . Percy Seward Have you then no fears that this pernicious habit may grow upon him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even that of the unborn babe of which you just now spoke ? Mary . Mary Miller Hush  --  please  --  do n't , please do n't . I dare not look so far as that . Jack is young , and thoughtless , he is rough , but he is honest as he is rough , he loves me Hastily that I know , and he has promised me that on the day I become his wife  --  he will give up drink forever . I believe him , I trust him . I must do so , for do I not love him ? But , Drying her eyes there , there , here I stand chatting with you while his vessel lies in the offing waiting only for the breeze to freshen to bring her safely to anchor , and him to his mother 's arms . I must in and help prepare his welcome , so good-bye for the present . Gives her hand Forget all that has passed between us , and please do not refer to it again . Believe me you will find your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , respectfully , and with deep feeling I can never forget , I accept the sacred title of friend . Let me think of you in my own odd way , I believe I 'm better for having known you , and I hope  --  Corrects himself I know Jack will be , must be nobler for becoming your husband . And now let me exact one promise , and that is , should the day ever come  --  which God forbid  --  that you need a friend , you will seek , as you will surely find , that friend , in Percy Seward . Mary . Mary Miller Deeply affected I promise . He raises her hand respectfully to his lips ; she blushes , bows her head and exits into cottage ; he raises his hat ; as she is off , he turns away with a sigh Percy . Percy Seward Heigho ! Percy , old fellow , you had best order the Sybil to weigh anchor and resume her cruise . I 'm afraid this is a bad case . You 've met pretty girls before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fisher girl has unwittingly meshed you in her net . By George ! what a brainy creature she is , and what wisdom for one who knows nothing of this bright , beautiful world , save what is found here in this fishiest of fishing villages . She is a gem , and only needs proper setting to be of great price . After all she may be right . You might tire of her ; in trying to polish the diamond we might destroy its lustre . She is happy here , she loves this Jack , and I daresay he loves her in his rough way . Far be it from you , Percy Seward , to cast one shadow across her path . No ! No ! You are her friend , let that content you , and the province of a friend is to stand by when danger threatens , and that you 'll do Percy , for you 're a pretty good sort of a fellow , although a bit sentimental . During this speech Nick and Josh have finished their story and gone off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has gone with them as far as the entrance , then returning comes R. of Percy who has crossed L. in meditation ; she gets in front of him , stoops , looks up into his face He s . Hester Barton A penny for your thoughts ! Percy . Percy Seward Laughs I do n't know that they are worth a penny . He s . Hester Barton Not worth a penny ! Of who ever could you he thinking then ?

He hangs his head Jack Hepburne  --  I loved you from the first hour in which I learned to lisp your name  --  I clambered upon your knees in childhood  --  walked hand in hand with you to church in girlhood , in maidenhood , watched , with tear dimmed eyes , each departing vessel as it bore you from me , and every night upon my knees sent forth the orphan 's prayer to the God of the fatherless for your speedy and safe return . At last what had been a seed  --  a blade  --  a leaf  --  a bud burst forth in blossom  --  and became a peerless flower  --  a priceless gem  --  a woman 's pure and holy love  --  and still ' t was all your own  --  what did you with it ? note : this speech with all the firm decisive pathos possible , quiet but intensely strong Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Mary Miller For still another year I bore it  --  I hoped against hope  --  I strove by every means in human power to save you  --  to reclaim you  --  to bring you hack to manhood  --  and to self  --  in vain . Where I looked for loving words  --  I found neglect  --  where I sought happiness , I found poverty and despair . At last with my arms clasped fast about your neck in woman 's weak endeavor to shield you from your demon  --  you struck me to your feet and fled  --  I who had loved you so  --  who became your wife  --  the mother of your child  --  Jack .
