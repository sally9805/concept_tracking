txt There are two men in this city who are willing to take oath that the building at Andalusia known as " Old Andalusia College " is haunted . One of these men is Horace W. Eshback , a member of the Philadelphia Bar , having an office at No. 509 Walnut-street , and the other is Frank Tygh , cigar manufacturer , at Locust and Sixth streets . A short time ago these two gentlemen passed the night with a friend , John Endicott , in the old college , and since that time they have been startling their acquaiutunces with frightful stories of a ghost seen there . As proof of his statement , Mr. Eshback exhibits a badlooking upper lip , which , he says , was swollen up by coming in contact with a bona fide ghost . Old Andalusia College is a three-story wooden building , with a mansard roof , and is nearly 50 years old . It is situated at the junction of two roads , about 10 minutes ' walk from the Pennsylvania Railroad station . The structure presents a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cedar trees , is not a place where any citizen would wish to pass a dark night alone . It has been said for ninny years that the house was haunted . When the college was in a flourishing condition under Dr. Chapman , 20 years ago , Mrs. Chapman and a young man named Minor became enamored of each other . Feeling that the doctor was an obstruction to the free enjoyment of their love , they accomplished his death by the aid of arsenic . In trying to obliterate traces of the clime some of the arsenic was thrown into the yard , where some ducks ate it and died . The death of the ducks in such a manner led to an investigation , resulting in the arrest of both Mrs. Chapman and young Minor . Minor was hanged , but Mrs. Chapman escaped the law . Since that time the house has had the repute , ton of being haunted . Persons in that neighborhood say they saw lights in the house for years , and few of them would pass it after dark . After the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be found willing to occupy the building . The owner of the premises had a portion of the building torn down , and the remainder fitted up as a boarding house , but the unsavory reports concerning it prevented him from getting a tenant . Mr. Endicott finally offered to occupy the place , and has been living there , for some months . Horace W. Eshback said to-day : " A friend of mine  --  John F. Endicott  --  resides in the old Andalusia College . and the other day he invited me over to pay him a visit . Of course I accepted the iuvitation , taking with me Frank Togh . The weather was none of the best in the morning , and by afternoon a wind and rain storm arose which lasted until early the next morning . We had intended to return to the city on one of the late afternoon trains , but as the storm raged without promise of early abatement we decided to remain over . It must have been near midnight when we went to bed . We were shown to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with three deep windows , two doors , and a fireplace . The old college has about 20 rooms , the larger number of which are unoccupied , and Tygh , who was a short , fleshy man , and much given to the subhall of spooks , shuddered as we walked down the hall and muttered something about it being an elegant night for ghosts to May footeall . We entered the room , and Tygli thought some one was yelling , but he grew snore composed when I told him it was only the wind . The wind . was really howling as if the very imps of iniquity were frenzied in the delights of a free night . With the wind whistling through the tall cedar trees , it was almost impossible to sleep ; anyhow , I could not compose myself to sleep , and laid listening to the noises outside , and to the storing of my roommate . Suddenly a light spread through the room , a light like that produced by a candle . In the surprise , or rather astonishment , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tell you what I saw made Hi0 feel eiek and wish I was almost anywhere else . Before rue was what appeared to be the bust of a man perhaps 45 years of age , the shoulders covered with a mantle . The face had a perfectly natural appearance , only it lacked mobility , and the whole seemed to be resting on a cloud of snow . The terrible apparition was moving about the room , and I thought it might be a rubber , but I noticed that there were no lower limbs and that it glided around like a balloon . " Now , f am not a believer in spirits , but I was frightened . What do you want I asked , hardly aware of what I was sayiug . The sound of my voice awakened Tygh . He sat bolt upright in bed , essve cue glance , and tumbled over on the ti-our and began to pray . Tygh is not a religious man . The answer I received from the ghost was something unlooked for , being in the form of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stretching me at full length on the bed . Almeat eimultaneously with the blow the figure noiselessly exploded and seemed to go straight up through the wall . " The light did not go out fur some time . hut gradually died away , leaving us in darkness , I Jumped up and lighted a lamp and fount ' Tygh doubled up in a heap on tee door , almost insensible . I looked around the room au4 found the windows closed , the doors locked . and . everything in the condition it was when we retired . I will admit that I was frightened , and the quickness with which I dressed ulyseit and hustled Tygh down stairs was something wonderful . It is , perhaps , unnecessary to say that we spent the remainder of the night before a glowing fire in the sitting room . " When Endicott saw me in the morning he laughed and wanted to know where I got my thick lips . I did not care to tell him the truth . so I replied that I had struck it on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said before , I do not believe in ghosts or anything of the sort , but I 'm going to investigate that matter and capture whatever it is  --  that is , provided it is anything human . " Mr. Tygh solemnly swears that he saw the whole business , and relates a story exactly similar to that of Mr. Eshback . He says he knows there is a ghost in the old building , and many could not hire him to pass another night there .
