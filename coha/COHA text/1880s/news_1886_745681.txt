txt The Senate Committee on Railroads held its first meeting in this city yesterday and laid a part of the foundation for its investigation of the manner in which the franchise of the Broadway Surface Road was procured . The most significant point brought out was the fact that Mr. JACOB SHARP bad testified before the Supreme Court Commissioners that the construction of the road , with its connections , would probably not cost more than $100,000 , and that subsequently two mortgages amounting to $2,500,000 were put upon the property . To find out what became of all these bonds or the money raised upon them will be one of the objects of the committee 's inquiry . The Trustee of the first mortgage of $1,500 , - 000 professed entire ignorance on the subject . He signed the bonds merely as . an act of accommodation after being informed that he ran no financial risk on his own account . He seems to have felt no responsibility in acting as a Trustee in so important a matter , but this appears to be his way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seventh-Avenue Railroad Company he did not make it his business to know anything about its affairs . The committee will probably encounter a good deal of ignorance of this kind . Mr. SHARP 'S testimony was not begun yesterday , but he ought to prove an interesting witness . He undoubtedly does know all about the purpose of the mortgages and what was done with the proceeds . His knowledge about the means taken to get the consent of the Aldermen to the Broadway franchise is undoubtedly complete . Being an avowed friend of the public and a champion of the cause of virtue and morality he must feel it to be his duty to aid the committee and give it the benefit of his knowledge . Should he prove unwilling , a gentle but very firm pressure should be applied . The committee has engaged Mr. CONSLING and Mr. CLARENCE A. SEWARD as their counsel . These men are above all suspicion of allowing themselves to be connected with an investigation which is not intended to disclose all the facts and bring wrongdoing to light , and they have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. They doubtless understand the available sources of information and the means necessary to get it before the committee . It is well understood that the difficulty of the investigation will lie in the political complications in which the facts are involved . They doubtless extend beyond the immediate connections of the Aldermen or ex-Aldermen who have been charged with corruption , and their lines are not within the limits of any one faction . It is possible that they extend beyond the maze of purely local politics . But the committee and its counsel can not afford to drop any clue , no matter where it may lead . The committee has declared its determination to make thorough work of the investigation regardless of Whom or what it may involve , and the character and standing of the counsel give assurance that they will not countenance any halfway work . The proceedings will be watched very closely and with great interest , and if it is possible to unearth offi- cial corruption in any case it ought to bi done in this . Failure would utterly dis credit legislative inquiries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nothing but honesty , earnest ness , and good management is necessar : to avoid failure .
