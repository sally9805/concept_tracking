txt THE HORSE SHOW . The crowd that filled Madison-Square Garden last night , in spite of the universal interest in the election , gave an impressive demonstration of the enlightened curiosity of the public concerning horses . This it terest is not only a manifestly growing but a continually diversifying interest . Fifteen years ago a horse show in New-York would have been mainly an exhibition of trotters , and trotters are by no means the most impressive class of horses when in repose . There would at that time have been a few handsome matched teams , and perhaps a few heavy draught horses . But none of the classes produced by an admixture of the blood of the thoroughbred . would have been filled . On the other hand these classes , including hunters , hacks , and carriage horses , form perhaps the majority of the animals now on exhibition in MadisonSquare Garden , and the performances of the hunters over hurdles constitute the most popular feature of the show . All these classes have been developed , one may say , since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jerome Park , not much more than twenty years ago . Until that time the thoroughbred horse had in the Northern States been considered exclusively as a thing to bet money upon . As there were no saddle horses , or so few as not to be worth reckoning , and . as no demand existed for them which it would pay breeders to supply , they devoted their energies to the production of horses of all work , and those of them who undertook to raise " fancy " horses addicted themselves exclusively to trotters . Meanwhile the breeding of trotters has wonderfully advanced . in fact , in the days of Flora Temple it can not be said that there was any scientific breeding of trotters , for the pedigree of the fastest animals was unknown and unregarded . The development of the roadster , which is to the trotter what the half-bred hunter is to the thoroughbred . race horse , has gone on quite as rapidly . It would scarcely have been profitable twenty-five years ago to collect from the whole country so magnificent a group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring last night in the class of roadsters . While the only horses to the breeding of which any attention was given at that period have been thus improved , the horse show of 1888 would be a very interesting and attractive exhibition if these classes were not represented in it at all . The importation of Clydesdale and . Norman horses is improving the American horse of all work so that he is already amuch larger , stouter and more useful animal than the draught horse of 1868 , and in horses in which speed , lightness , and grace are sought the infusion of thoroughbred blood has done wonders . It has been shown by such horses as Iroquois and Foxhall that the English thoroughbred does not deteriorate , but , on the contrary , improves by being transplanted to American soil . There is no reason why our breeders should not return to Europe with interest the benefit which they have derived from it , nor why the United States should not within the next twenty years become the chief exporter among the nations of horses of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been the chief importer .
