txt It is understood that the supplementary report of the Gun Foundry Board , which was sent to Congress just before the holiday adjournment , will be at once considered by the Subcommittee on Fortifications . The subject involved is serious , and one upon which contradictory conclusions might honestly be reached by experts of admitted ability . That a liberal appropriation should be made by Congress for high-powered steel guns every intelligent judgment concedes . But ought these guns to be produced in factories established by the Government for the purpose , or should private works be relied upon ? The new report of Admiral SIMPSON 'S board , which , as will be remembered , consists of three army and three navy officers , emphatically reiterates its conclusions of last February , not only in favor of Government manufacture , but of the establishment of two separate gun factories , one for the army and the other for the navy . These factories would cost a million each . The material for the guns , however , would be in all cases furnished , cast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturers of steel , and the board thinks that it would be necessary to set apart fifteen millions for the purchase of such steel , in order to induce responsible men to erect a plant suitable for making it . Here would be an outlay of seventeen millions , exclusive of the annual cost of operating the proposed Government factories , which would vary from one to two millions , according to the number of guns made and their calibres . Great as is this expense , now , if ever , is the time for establishing such factories , since a very large supply of guns is needed , both for our fleets and our forts . Nearly all our heavy ordnance is behind the age , so that if it is advisable for the Government to go into the business of gun making at all its present needs would justify the expense of the plant . This is the fundamental strength of the board 's case , which is further supported by the existing lack of great private gun factories in this country and the pecuniary misfortunes which have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is a further argument for Government factories that they can control and vary the manufacture , and that there is no allowance to be made for the profit of the contracting firm . In our own case the Government would save the duty on imported materials and tools , while the cry of not stimulating private enterprise could not fairly be raised , since out of the first seventeen millions fifteen would go to the private foundries furnishing the steel . On the other hand , there are objections , no doubt , to the establishment of national ordnance works . When a Government goes into a business enterprise its work is proverbially costly , and in the United States it is apt to be specially so . Political considerations often govern the selection of some workmen ; there are often incompetent employes and sinecure positions ; the Government is overcharged for what it buys , if possible , and even the legislation of Congress is invoked to see that it does not receive too many hours of labor for the full rate of wages . The Krupp guns are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experimenting should fall on our Government , which would have no foreign customers from whom to recoup its losses , its guns would also be far from cheap . It is an admitted drawback to depending on private sources of gun supply that the Government is subjected to the caprice of individuals , or may be forced to wait to have its orders filled until previous engagements made with foreign Governments shall have been completed . The French Government , however , has at least found means to bring private contractors up to their agreements when once made . We repeat , then , that there are arguments on both sides of this question for the committee to weigh . After all , it is the question of ' Woolwich against Essen ; or perhaps it may be fairer to say that it is the later French system against the German . A manufacturing partnership between the Government and a private firm is the one thing not to be thought of , since the former always shoulders the losses , as the experience of Russia with the Aboukhoff Steel Works and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
