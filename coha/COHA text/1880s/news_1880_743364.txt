txt Senator ** bill to establish national savings banks is neither wise nor timely . In one of its aspects it is a hothouse method of sustaining the national credit . In another it offers a form of investment for the savings of the people which will be safe . undoubtedly . but unprofitable and with littte to recommend it . There is a third feature of the bill which wo suspect has escaped the attention even of its author . With genuine , though unintentional , philanthropy , it will provide snug berths and a comfortable livelihood to a large number of amiable old gentlemen and young men of good habits who might otherwise find this a hard world . This bill was suggested , of course , by the method so successfully employed to float our war loans . The National Banking act was not only of great service to the Government at a time when it was sorely pressed for money , and the deadly peril of a great rebellion justified a resort to extraordinary methods , but its indirect and incidental benefits in supplying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government itself and nowhere subject to discount , have been incalculable . A comparison of the motives which underlie the two measures , and of the work already done by the one , with that which the other proposes to effect , is not to the advantage of Senator ** scheme . Its adoption would be a confession of weakness , and would actually tend to lower the credit of the Government . It is equivalent to saying that while it is desirable that our outstanding obligations should be refunded at a lower rate of interest , Congress has no confidence that bonds bearing only 3 or 312 per cent , interest would be salable unless a special market were created for them . If the bill is of doubtful wisdom as a feature of Government financial policy , its popular side still less commends it to favor . It provides that all deposits received by the National Savings Bank Association , " except the amount needed for actual expenses and payments , shall be wholly and promptly invested in United States bonds or securities paying interest , the net income or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such association ; but no interest shall be received by the depositors until 30 days from the time when their deposits are made , after which depositors shall receive interest at the rate of 3 per cent . per annum . " Such is the language of section 14 , as transmitted from Washington by telegraph . There is reason to suppose that the declaration concerning the rate of interest has been incorrectly reported , as section 19 declares that the " income or profit , " amount unspecified , after deducting all expenses , " shall be divided semi-annually among the depositors . " This is a more:reasonable provision , and more merciful to the Trustees of our future national savings banks , who would be sorely perplexed by a mandatory statute compelling them to pay their depositors 3 per eent , interest from the income of bonds bearing 3 , 312 , or even 4 per cent. , for it must be remembered that something must be deducted for expenses . The expenses of these banks would doubtless be less , in proportion to deposits , than those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average annual expenses would be as great only as the rate of the least expensive of our City savings banks , that is that the per cent . of expenses to deposits would be but .00289 . Add . to this the sum which the Trustees are allowed to set apart for a reserve fund , amounting to not more than .0025 of the aggregate deposits semi-annually , or .0050 Per cent . yearly . and we have an average of .00789 as the total expense charge . Were the banks based on 3 per cent . bonds , this , would leave for the depositors a fraction over 2 2-10 per cent . interest , and 2 7-10 per cent. , if 312 per cent . bonds were the basis . We must toucla lower depths of business prostration than we have ever yet seen before these rates will be satisfactory to people who have savings to invest . The savings banks we now have manage , most of them , to pay 5 per cent . interest . They hold large amounts of State , county , city , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and others , together with mortgages on real estate , which pay 6 per cent . These are the ruling rates of their investments , and their supply of these securities is not likely to diminish very rapidly . We do not imagine i that it is proposed to tax these savings banks out of existence , as was done with the State banks ; there is nothing in our condition or prospects to justify such an outrageously unjust act . These institutions , then , will be able to go on paying 4 or 5 per cent . interest to depositors . What sort of headway will Senator War noy 's 212 per cent . national savings banks be able to make against them ? The argument that the security of this form of investment would offset the disadvantage of the lower rate of interest falls with the rest . Those who maintain this proposition would make our savings-bank depositors pay an enormous sum annually to insure the safety of their money . Under this law they would receive a rate of interest at least 2 per cent . lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the $319,266 , - 020 93 now in the savings banks in this State is $6,385,320 40 , while the total loss to depositors in this State , by failure of savings banks , for the eight years ending Dec. 31 , 1878 , was only $5,400,000 . Moreover , if the people want to put their money out at such a rate of interest , why not let them receive the full income of the bonds by dealing directly with the Government f It is in the highest degree ridiculous to set up such a cumbrous and costly go-between as a national savings bank .
