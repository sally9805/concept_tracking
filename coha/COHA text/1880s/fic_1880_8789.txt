HOW TO READ . When you read a letter , or other written , or printed message , it is wise to first look at the signature , so  --  you will the better understand the contents , by at once knowing who is talking to you . In all other compositions , the reverse is the rule . Begin at the beginning , and never look at the ending , until you arrive there by having read , carefully , every preceding line , in its order . Also , ( and especially ) ignore the author . If you fail to do this , you are liable to one of two prejudices . If the writer be an old acquaintance , your familiarity with him may cause you to doubt ( in advance ) his ability to create a good work . Or  --  on the other hand , your kindly regard for him , personally , may cause you to overvalue his effort . The first prejudice would be unjust to him ; the second , would lead you into amiable error . Old Essay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was evolved the story told in this play , took its rise in a circumstance which really occurred many years ago ; the salient points of which were briefly these : A pure and noble wife , had been wrongfully accused and was deserted by her husband . This unsettled her reason . A brief time elapsed when she wandered from her home , to a rocky precipice , overlooking a " Falls " and there , either fell or leaped into the chasm below , where her body was found . It was for a time , suspected that her husband had met , and enticed her to the cliff , and thrust her off . This , however , was afterwards proved to be totally unfounded . The wife 's entire purity became fully established ( but too late , ) and her husband soon followed her to the grave , dying of sheer broken heart . This was during my boyhood , but the memory of it remained , as a deep impression . When I arrived at man 's estate , I became an actor , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mapped " out , and some of the scenes were , ( though very crudely ) sketched . Becoming , however , more and more occupied by the active duties of my glorious profession , these " Fragments " were suffered to lie unfinished , with other of my " Jottings by the way . " After a few years of profitable service and experience ( sometimes laborious , but never irksome ) the Sun of a brighter fortune broke upon me , and I became ( in theatrical parlance ) , A " Star . " Fairly launched upon this new and pleasanter sea , and wafted onward by the genial breath of public favor , I came to feel a sort of new ambition . I bethought me of those long neglected ( well nigh forgotten ) sketches . I exhumed the " Fragments , " and applying the results of a solid experience to the task , completed what had been so long left unfinished and re-wrote my play , as it now stands and called it " HAROLDE . " It would hardly become me , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its every production . It suffices that my ambition was fully satisfied . My play brought me goodly reward in money and much added reputation . Among many other pleasant memories , may be properly noted this one . When it was acted at Albany , N. Y. March 12th , 1852 . A formal delegation FROM and REPRESENTING THE NEW YORK STATE LEGISLATURE , made from one of its " Nights " a special occasion , and in an eloquent address made by one of the Senators , presented me with a splendid copy of Shakespeare elegantly inscribed to me . Part of my purpose in penning these prefatory lines , is to explain how it comes and why I have marked out the " stage directions . " Let it be reflected , that this play is the mature work of a practical actor , who has learned by experience and therefore may presume to know what engines to employ in order to produce certain desired results ; And , I have thought that such a course would materially help my readers the better to realize the whole panorama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass in review .

His bold words Impierc 'd mine ear like to a thunderclap : I kindled at the insult , Valmonde . Valmonde Hear me , then ; Partly in vindication of myself  --  In that , to her , I late did make renewal Of my rejected suit . Harolde . Harolde No more on that . Thy grounds were broad . Valmonde . Valmonde That I , like to the rest , Believed thee dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have done , was to preserve thine honor Against the machinations of this villain , Who seems to hold allegiance with the devil , And thence derives the witchery of his tongue , Which charms but to destroy . Harolde . Harolde Talk not in clouds , But deal in plainer phrase . Valmonde . Valmonde Even at thy word , For he shall have no screening . This vile knave , Some two months since , while in a drunken rouse , Made boast to me , that for these three years past , His pockets , emptied at the hazard table , Still found replenishment and full resource Even in thine ample means , and that thy wife Was the fair key that opened at his will Thy treasures to his purpose . Harolde . Harolde Do I hear ? What more ? Withhold not . Speak the sum at once , That I may know my course . Valmonde . Valmonde This much beyond Was added to his boast : That he had gain 'd , Ere then , the mastery of her heart 's fond love And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blister 'd villain  --  The shameless , fiend like liar ! Show me him , That I may tear his heart , forth from his breast And show the world how foul a thing it is . Valmonde . Valmonde Nay , calm thyself . From then until the present , I closely have observ 'd them , and to save Her and thy fortunes , did renew my suit : Delaying its fulfillment  --  time to time , Attending thy return . Harolde . Harolde Yet speak . I pray you , You noted her demeanor : Did she wear The port of entertainment to his love  --  Or did she spurn it ? Valmonde . Valmonde Be thyself the judge . If he hath slander 'd her , and she be true ; His falsehood even swells beyond this point . His further boast was , that with nightly visits , It was her wont to seek him . Do you know , If since your coming she hath left her home , About this present hour , upon pretence Of charity , or any like excuse ? Harolde @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such errand . But what of that ? Valmonde . Valmonde Such was the holy plea , By which , he vouches , she hath cast a veil Around their amorous meetings . Harolde . Harolde May this be ' t Oh ! Heart , most poor , that but an hour ago Did boast a mine of love , and strong in pride Defind the storms of fate , bidding its billows To spend their fiercest rage upon the rock He deem 'd could never yield ; but now it shivers As like to fall to sand . Come  --  speak the rest ; For now , the mist of faith hath fled mine eyes , And I have caught a glimpse of the intrigue , That draws me to look further . Valmonde . Valmonde ( Gives dagger . ) Bear you this : That if I do not prove him , to thy sight , More black than I have said , rip ope my breast And throw my heart to dogs . Go with me now , Beyond the hall and ear-shot of the house , E'en @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voyage : there at full  --  Both eyes and ears shall be so well convinc 'd , To doubt were shame to sense .
