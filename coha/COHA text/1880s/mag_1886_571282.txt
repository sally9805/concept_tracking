ARTICLE 111. - RATES OF WAGES . IN an article in the New Engla'nder for June , 1886 , I tried to show that under our system of production wages are always advanced to the laborer out of capital , that to furnish this advance is the only function of capital , and that the average rate of wages was the quotient of the total capital of the country plus the amount of wealth devoted to the support of unproductive laborers divided by the number of laborers  --  the total capital , as there explained , not being a fixed fund accumulated beforehand , but a tolerably steady percentage of the average product of the community 's labor , so that practically the laws of wages are laws of distribution which determine what proportion of the whole wealth produced by the application of labor and capital to land goes to the laborer . The subject of the present article will be the causes that bring about inequality in wages . By wages is here meant not money wages , the nominal amount of which is of little importance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things really and in themselves useful which the laborers get for their services . This part of the law of wages is closely connected with the laws of value , because it is largely through adjustments of the relative values of the things which the workmen produce , that comparative rates of wages are fixed . Most economists recognize two kinds of value , market or actual value , and what is called normal value . The former depends upon supply and demand ; exactly how , has been matter of much debate , but for our present purpose it will be sufficient to say , what all admit , that an increase of the supply of an article tends to lower its value and an increased demand to raise it . Normal value-which exists only for such articles as can be produced in any quantity desired-is a certain supposed value to which the actual value always tends to conform , though it may never exactly coincide with it . It is usually said to depend upon the cost of production . The relation between the two kinds of value and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the formula that the suppiy always tends to adjust itself to the demand at the normal value . If the market price falls below the normal one and there is a pros . pect that it will continue so for some time , some of the producers will stop producing or will produce less till under the influence of the diminished supply and of the increased demand caused by the low price the value rises again to the normal limit ; and a converse effect will show itself if the market value rises for some time above the normal The above statements are somewhat rough and general , but will do for our present purpose . Their substantial truthfulness it is hoped will manifest itself to those readers who are not familiar with the subject in the course of the following argument . The articles that have no normal value because they can not be produced to meet a demand , such as paintings by the old masters , are of small economical importance and can be passed over here . The value of land depends upon the laws of rent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industrial process is spoken of it must be understood to be the net product , after rent , taxes , and compensation for risk have been deducted . Compensation for risk includes all portions of the product given to landlord , laborer or capitalist to pay him for any chance which he takes of failing to get any reward for his services or of being delayed in getting it . In all industrial processes there is some risk of this kind which has to be assumed by some one , most often by the capitalist , in which case the compensation takes the form of what is usually called a*higher rate of profits , though in an economical sense it is not profits at all , but in the nature of premiums for insurance . The average rate of true profits is generally about the same as that of interest on investments regarded as perfectly safe , though special causes , for example , laws regulating the investments of trust funds , and the funds of savings banks and insurance companies , may make it vary from this . If any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be transferred from one sort of work to another without loss , it is evident that they would all get the same wages . If wages were higher than the average in any particular employment laborers would seek it , or if wages were lower they would quit it , so that competition would bring equality . Also the various // products of labor would regularly be exchanged at values pro portional to the amount of labor spent upon them . If to produce a silk dress took ten times as much labor as to produce a barrel of flour , the dress would be worth ten barrels of flour ; otherwise the wages of the workmeu and the profits of the capitalist would not be equal in the two trades . Everything sold in the market must sell in the long run , and generally , for just enough to pay the wages of the workmen who produce it , and the profit on the capital invested . In other words , average or normal value would be proportional to the cost of production - using the expression cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of labor and capital-though temporary and accidental causes , which we can not stop here to take account of , might cause occasional deviations from those average values . But now suppose that the laborers were divided into two groups , A and B , no workman being able to do the work of the other group , but his labor being freely transferable as before within the limits of his own group . Plainly all the products of either group would still exchange among themselves at values proportionate to their respective costs of production , and wages would be equal among the members of the same group . If each group consumed its own products exclusively , there would be no exchange between the two and so no relative values of their respective productions . But suppose that each group consumes the products of both , each keeping a portion of its own for its own use and exchanging a portion for the other 's wares . In the first place each person would decide for himself at his own mere pleasure how he would dis . tribute his consumption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each group would have available to trade off for those of the other . The important point here is that the whole of its surplus must be got rid of by each group , and by no other means than by exchange for the surplus of the other . Plainly then , if one group , say A , preferred to keep a large proportion of its product for its own use and only wanted a little of B 's , while B wanted a great deal of A 's and only a little of its own , we should see the members of B competing with each other and offering more and more of their own products // to get those of A. Under this competition the value of of B 's wares , relative to those of A , would fall , while A 's would rise . The natural effect would be that the A workmen , finding the B products cheaper , would to a greater or less extent substitute them for their own in use , and thus set free more of their own for exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get along with things of their own make and so have less to sell at the same time that they bought less . All this would tend to lower the value of the A products , and raise that of the B products . In fact it is a case of supply and demand , or what Prof. Cairnes , who , so far as I know , first clearly worked out this part of the theory of value , calls reciprocal demand . At last an equilibrium would be reached at which each side would settle down into a certain ratio of consumption , and the relative values of the products of the two groups would be such that each would be just able to get rid of its surplus in exchange for that of the other . It is very improbable that the two surpluses would represent the same amount of labor-not one chance in a million ; so that as between the groups cost of production would have nothing directly to do with values , and a thing belonging to one group might exchange for a thing from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make . If a and a ' are two products of the A group , and b and b ' of the B group , and the first of each pair takes twice as much labor to make it as the second , then a will be worth two a " s and b two b " s . If a is worth $1 , a ' will be worth 50c. ; but if the amount of labor required to produce a is the same as that required to produce b , it does not follow that one a will be worth the same as one b . A b may be worth  |p1.50  , in which case 13 ' will be worth of course The. , or b may be worth less than a and 6 ' than a ' . We may compare the values of the commodities in the two groups to the marks on a pair of yardsticks set side by side and then slid up and down along each other ; the marks on each stick keep the same positions relatively to each other , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but their position relatively to the corresponding marks on the other stick varies as we move it up or down , just as values between the groups vary with fluctuations in the reciprocal demand . // If a commodity were produced by the joint labor of both groups , then its total value should be conceived of as the sum of two values , one for the work of each group fixed as above described . If instead of two groups there were many , the complication would be increased , but the principle would be the same . It is plain also that the relative wages of the laborers in the two groups will follow the same course as the relative values of their products . If for example the reciprocal demand was such that the product a was worth half again as much as 6 , though made with the same amount of labor , then the wages of the workmen who made a must be correspondingly higher than the wages of those who made 6 . If the wages of the laborer were the same in both groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a larger profit than those who employed the B laborers . Capital , which is freely transferable , would flow to the A group , and by its competition raise wages there while wages in B would be lowered . If capital could not be freely changed from one group to the other , then the difference between the two groups might be wholly or partly in the profits realized by the employers instead of in wages . If the laborers in A could be transferred to B , that is , were capable of doing the work of B , but those in B could not be transfered to A , then whenever the reciprocal demand was such as to give an advantage to A it would have its proper effect and the A workmen would get higher wages . But if the balance were the other way , the B workmen could never get higher wages than the others , because enough of the latter would transfer themselves to the B group to make the wages of both equal . Besides the advantage from the course of the reciprocal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other . For example if it is located on better soil or in a more favorable situation , where nature yields a more bounteous return to human labor , its labor may be actually more productive , may produce a larger amount of wealth and not merely a greater value , in proportion to the number of laborers . This is supposing the groups to be separated geographically . Or it may be that while two groups of laborers are capable of producing // the same commodity , one can do it more efficiently than the other , that is produce more with the same labor or the same amount with less labor . In that case the more efficient group may be able to supply enough of the commodity to more than meet the whole demand existing at the value at which it would have to be sold if made by the less efficient group of laborers in order to give the latter the average wages of their group . If so , it would be profitable to the employers to hire the more efficient laborers , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage would be left wholly to them . The value of that commodity Would necessarily be less than the value at which it could be made by the less efficient laborers , since ex hypotheca the supply of it is greater than is demanded at the last named value , but yet the wages of the workmen who make it may be higher than the others ' . For instance , if the laborers of group A were twice as efficient as those of group B in producing a certain commodity , and that commodity if made by members of B would have to have a certain value in order to afiord to those makers the average wages of their group , if made by workmen belonging to A it could be sold for three-quarters of the former price and yet pay the workmen who made it half as much again as the workmen in B would get , because three-quarters of the price would go for half the work . The workmen getting the higher wages could undersell those working for lower wages in the open market . The competition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force wages up to as high a point as the value of the product would stand . If the value , as fixed by reciprocal demand , was more than enough to pay the usual profits on capital , more capital would crowd in and wages rise till the margin was absorbed . On the other hand it might be , if there was only one or only a few products in which one group had any advantage over the other , that concentrating its attention upon these and leaving the commodities as to which it had no advantage to be made by the other group , it would turn out so much of its peculiar product that the value would fall low enough to reduce its wages to a level with the others ' , though , as we have seen before , they could never fall lower than those . But if the // superior group could not produce enough of the commodity to supply the demand at the value at which the lower group could also produce it , then both groups must be producers . Since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices in the same market , the whole must have a high enough value to properly remunerate the less efficient laborers , to afford them the same wages that their group earn in other lines of industry . If so , the more efficient laborers will secure the same wages as the less efficient plus the whole value of the additional wealth produced by them through their superior efficiency . If the article must be sold at $10 to pay a laborer in B $2.00 per day wages , at the same price a laborer in A will get $4.00 per day , since he produces twice as much by a day 's work , and the competition of capital will give him all the difference . What has been already said will supply the proof of this . A division of labors into non-competing groups actually exists . IDifferent nations constitute such groups very largely as to labor and to a considerable extent as to capital , though capital goes from one country to another much more easily than laborers . International values therefore have little to do with cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profits vary greatly in different countries . Within our own country capital passes now a days pretty freely from one part to another , but not yet with entire freedom , so that rates of profits , though tending to become uniform have not yet entirely become so . Labor also , although we are a very migratory people , is more abundant in some parts of the country than in others , and various obstacles prevent a perfectly unrestricted movement of workers to where they are most needed . The different sections of this country therefore present some of the features of non.competing industrial groups geographically separated . But the ii*ore important divisions are not geographical but exist among neighbors . Within certain limits every man may choose his occupation . It is true that having once chosen it is hard for him to change , and therefore there is always a certain immobility to labor . But for the purposes of effective competition it is not necessary that all the laborers should be able to turn themselves to any occupation , any more than to cause a // change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one party should go over to the other . It is enough if a comparatively few do so , who hold the balance of power . This is generally accomplished within the limits of an industrial . group by the dying off of the older members and the choice made by boys and girls as they grow up of the lines that then seem most promising , together with occasional changes of occupation of adult laborers . The separations between the groups are due to various causes . Age and sex are important . Children can not do the work of adults , and generally women can not do men 's , though men can do women 's and children 's . Hence reciprocal demand can and does make men 's wages higher than women 's and children 's , but can never have the converse effect . Social position makes another dividing line . Men and women who are not willing to become mechanics , manual laborers , or domestic servants , and yet have not the education or special aptitude or ability to rise to a higher industrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the one side by their own choice and on the other by lack of natural or acquired capacity from competing with other groups , the demand for whose services is relatively small and whose wages are therefore low . Female teachers , who often receive much lower wages than chambermaids and waitresses , form a large portion of one group of this kind , and a little below them saleswomen , sewing girls , and the more respectable sort of factory and shop hands another . Ordinary clerks , salesmen , and bookkeepers occupy a very similar position among men . Very often laborers are determined to one group by the difficulty of getting the education or training needed for a higher one . The son of a poor and ignorant man may have no chance to become anything but an unskilled laborer , one of the lowest group of adult males . All kinds of mere unskilled labor are open to him , he may compete with all others of his kind . But he can not become a carpenter or a watchmaker or a locomotive engineer . Again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three last mentioned trades might equally well have chosen any of fifty or a hundred others , but could not without great difficulty have fitted himself for journalism or one of the learned professions . // The various industrial groups , especially in a country like ours , are not separated by any hard and fast lines . They overlap each other to some extent , they shade off into each other by imperceptible gradations , and passage from one to the other is not impossible . Energetic , able , and lucky persons are continually pushing up higher . But there is separation enough to allow the law of reciprocal demand to come into play to a large extent both as to values and wages . Special aptitude for certain kinds of work is another very important determining cause in the formation of non-competing groups . This is one principal cause of the very high wages obtained by the managers of large masses of capital , either their own or others*. * Labor and capital in large masses , if skillfully and honestly handled , are proportionally more productive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men who have the peculiar qualities necessary to successfully conduct large enterprises . When one is found his labor is immensely productive . The manager of a great and profitable manufacturing business produces more by his labor than a common hand in the factory . The difference between the income of the factory under his management and what it would be under that of an incompetent man , often the difference between a handsome profit and an actual loss , is the amount which the former produces by his labor more than the latter . It is not merely a difference in the distribution of wealth , by which the factory owner gets into his hands what would otherwise have remained in the hands of other persons , which would be no gain to the community as a whole ; it is an actual difference in production . Under good management a given amount of labor actually produces more wealth , wealth which would not otherwise have existed at all . The labor of a good manager may be a hundred times as productive as that of some of his workmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on large business operations we have the most striking * Wages in political economy means the reward of labor , whether the laborer is hired or works on his own account . It therefore includes a good deal of income that is more often called profits in common speech ; for instance a large portion of the income of a successful merchant or manufacturer , using his own capital in his business , is usually in the economical sense wages rather than profits . // and important case of two or more industrial groups able to do the same work but one able to do it much better than the other . Thousands of men can run a great railroad after some sort of a fashion , but only a few can run it well . Such a successful manager earns his large salary just as fairly and in the same way as the man who works hard with his hands ; he receives the fruit of his own labor . It is true that the high wages of a managing man may sometimes be otherwise accounted for . For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his case , and a part of what he gets may be a gain of the same kind which an insurance company makes when it insures a selected risk at the same rate at which ordinary risks are carried . Men who can thus work at a less risk form a special industrial group , and may be able to take to themselves all the iucreased gain or only a part of it , according as there are fewer or more of them than are needed to do all of that sort of work . Also there are cases where the officers of a corporation manage to get control of a majority of the stock and use the power thus obtained to keep themselves in office at higher salaries than their labor is worth . This does not come under any economical law of wages , but is a kind of theft .
