THE daily bread of the world is the chief subject of Political Economy . If men were purely material , physical nourishment would suffice for them ; but spiritual natures require spiritual nutriment . If what furnishes this nutriment were a purely immaterial thing , it would , as such , be removed from the domain of wealth , and thus from the field of economic science ; but it is not so . It has , in fact , a material basis , and falls within the limits of the economist 's studies ; the students of this science have other than literal loaves to consider . Not only is the consideration of forms of wealth which minister to spiritual wants necessary in order to properly complete the science of Political Economy , but it is more imperatively necessary in the interest of religion . Certain modern religious phenomena are inexplicable except in the light of economic principles ; it is the economist who can , if he will , point out the chief danger that threatens the church . In an earlier essay we have called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wealth must have if consistently adhered to . While wealth always has a material basis , that basis is not necessarily solid or durable . Vibrations of air may be shaped into artistic form by the violin or // the voice , and become commodities as truly as the stone which is shaped by the sculptor 's chisel . Such products as musical notes , perishable as they are , produce lasting effects on the mind , and are valuable accordingly in the market . Concert tickets convey a title to them , and these are not to be had without money . The delicate material commodities which diffuse themselves , for a time , through the concert hall , are essential to the spiritual effects which follow from their use ; there could be none of the mental effects of music without the material undulations . As long as tremulous air thus holds within itself the power to impress the soul of man , it is subject for the economist ; it is his business to investigate its laws as wealth . When these effects exist only as impressions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the metaphysician ; they are commodities no longer . Bread is a commodity only while on its way from the oven to the organ of digestion ; after that it is subject for the physiologist ; and that form of bread for the mind which we term music is , in like manner , a commodity only while in transitu . Musical forms are not the only ones that can be impressed on vibrations of air . Marble may be chiselled into letters as well as images ; and air vibrations may be shaped into forms of intelligence as well as into those of beauty . Spoken words may be commodities in the market , as well as musical notes . They are recognized as such ; lecture tickets sometimes convey a title to them , and these are property , sold and paid for . A preacher 's spoken word has , in like manner , its place on the inventory of social wealth ; sermons , as delivered , are property . The hymn and the sermon are to be regarded as forms of nutriment for the soul , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the organ of spiritual digestion . Regarded in the prosaic light of economy , church edifices become places where spiritual nutriment is disbursed . Forms of wealth which minister to spiritual wants are produced , distributed , exchanged , and consumed according to the same principles as ordinary products . Economic laws are general , and apply to higher as well as lower forms of wealth . Spiritually , we dine in commons , on the co√∂perative principle , once a week , with occasional lunches between whiles . The clergyman is a // minister , in that he provides and distributes food . In former years the meals were prepared with Spartan simplicity ; but of late they have been greatly elaborated . In spiritual as in physical meals , it is the appetizing element that is expensive ; reduced to simple nutriment a meal of either kind could be had very cheaply . By the term Spiritual Economics , we mean , not a discussion of things purely spirituM , but a department of science which considers forms of material wealth that minister to spiritual wants . We now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rich and poor are alike in the lower and the higher departments of activity ; the great question of general Political Economy is also the great question of Spiritual Economics . The highest forms of wealth have their laws of distribution ; and , in the course of social development , large classes are deprived of them . The laws of spiritual poor-relief are impor. tant for the scientist , as well as for the Christian . The kind of spiritual poor-relief to be discussed here does not fall under the head of charity . Place a dozen men , each in his own boat , on the open sea , and start them for the nearest land . They are on an equality and completely independent . If any will not row , his destruction is on his own head . If any try *o row and fail , it is the great law of charity , and that only , which constrains another to help him . If any venture to burden himself by towing a weaker brother to the shore , he is cornpelled to do so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law of love . But that is no picture of actual society . No man can paddle his own canoe as a member of that great social organism in which each individual labors , not for himself , but for the whole , and is dependent on the whole for employment and for pay . Independence is the law of isolation ; interdependence is the law of society . Again and again , in actual history , society ceases to desire the product of a particular man 's labor . The organic whole is in the position of employer to the mil . lions who work , and it can not always keep them busy ; but it is not at liberty to starve them . It may take away their comforts ; but , if it take their lives , it is murder . Civilization has placed us all in one boat ; by mutual help we are sailing the // homeward-bound ship of humanity . He who will not help may be thrown overboard , possibly ; but he who , by force of circumstances , can not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in nature of the social organism that the great principle of English law which asserts the ultimate right of every man to a maintenance finds its philosophical ground . That is an evil teaching which ventures to question this principle , and it would fare ill with a State which should attempt to follow such teaching in practice . Such action would surrender to the communists the championship of a great truth ; it would place society in the wrong , and revolutionists in the right . When a man who has had no hand in getting his neighbor into trouble , lends his aid in getting him out , that is charity . When an organized society relieves suffering which the society as a whole has caused , that is justice . Whatever part of the poor-tax goes to relieve sufferings resulting from general social causes , is paid , not given ; the claim to it is as eq nitable as that of any officer to his salary . We may assume as a premise the principle asserted in the poor-law of Queen Elizabeth , which established the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed , but to be kept , while willing to work , from absolutely starving . Now , long before the days of Elizabeth , a principle was authoritatively announced which was in advance of her celebrated statute , and far in advance of the average tone of modern Political Economy ; that , namely , of the ultimate claim of every man to a spiritual maintenance . The soul may starve , as well as the body , and it was Christ who first announced the duty of preventing such starvation . Not merely on the ground of charity , but on that of justice , on precisely the same ground on which man claims relief from literal hunger , does he claim to be relieved from the starving of the spirit . The soul of man is not independent ; the organic union of mankind includes mind as well as matter . When that organism is simply working for its own maintenance , we may term it an industrial society ; when it is governing itself , we may term it a state ; when it is reverently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term it a church ; but in every relation it is essentially // identical , an organic unity the nature of which is to absorb and to subordinate the individual lives which are its molecules or monads . He who is born into such a society is never independent in body or mind . The healthy life of the soul of individual man is practically dependent on material aids ; the soul life of the social organism is absolutely so dependent . An exceptional saint may live as a hermit ; but society of hermits would be a contradiction of terms . Intercommnnication is necessary to the religions life of society , and that is dependent on material aids . Sometimes by impressing forms of intelligence on insubstantial air , sometimes by printing them on more durable paper , an interchange of thought and feeling is established which unites the religious life of individuals into an organic whole ; it gives a soul life to society . When this religious organism is once established the spiritual life of individuals becomes dependent on it , and exclusion from it means starvation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the wilderness subsists , for a time , on roots and bark , and soon perishes , so he who is excluded from spiritual society subsists religiously , for a time , on roots and bark , and then starves . It is literal destruction to be banished from industrial society ; and it is spiritual destruction to be excluded from that universal society which , without any reference to particular sects , we term the church . The church , as a religious organism embracing all men who communicate religiously with each other , controls the material aids to religious life , as industrial society controls the literal bread of the world . Two causes may exclude men from this society , one pecuniary , the other social , in a narrow sense . They may not have money enough to buy spiritual food ; or they may not be respectable enough to dine at the spiritual table . In both cases they are compelled to do without the material aids on which , in society , spiritual life is practically dependent . We do not need to raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on material aids for its religious life ; actual society is sufficiently so , and these aids are forms of wealth . The place of worship with its furnishings , the Bibles and bookg of song , much of the music and // most of the spoken words are property , bought and paid for . Spiritual Economics stops at nothing in asserting its jurisdiction over what really belongs to it . It claims , even to the farthest echo , the sound of the chimes that call the worshipers together , when the paid organist rings them . It ventures to claim the material instrument , air vibrations still , by which the prayers of the assembled multitude are held in unison and made to become the prayer of an organic whole . There , how . ever , its audacious foot halts . The prayer itself is none of its property ; only the strictly material instrument that expresses it . We have penetrated , in our scientific temple , to the Gentiles ' court , where buying and selling are admissible ; within is the holy of holies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their God . Living not by literal bread alone , but by soul impulses , footpounds of spiritual dynamic force , which proceed originally from God , but reach his creatures by material means , man may starve spiritually in consequence of material privation . A wide*spread famine of this kind is the great religious fact of the present day . It will be convenient to show the causes of this famine by means of a dry but useful economic formula . The wants of men arrange themselves in a scale in the order of their intensity , and every man spends the money at his disposal for that which satisfies the most intense desire . If each successive article in the scale costs a single unit of value he will begin at the bottom of the list and purchase as many things as he has units of free income . The point in the scale where purchases cease for want of available funds is the purchase limit . What articles different men will actually buy depends on the nature of their individual wants , and the man who hungers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessaries of life the things which satisfy that desire . Others will place them among luxuries , and still others , among superfluities . With the original spiritual condition of men Political Economy has nothing to do , except to assume it among the data of its reasoning ; nor has it any more to do with modifications in that condition which result from other than economic causes . There are , however , changes of transcendent importance which result from causes within the // domain of Political Economy ; and religious philosophy , to properly understand these changes , must step upon common earth , and lean upon its despised economic sister . Continued deprivation of any thing above the bare necessities of life tends to render the desire for it quiescent . The man who has always lived in a cottage has no active desire for a palace . This principle is the more effective the higher we ascend in the scale of wants . Continued physical privation blunts the desire for physical comforts ; but it does so less completely than mental and spiritual privation extinguish the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , which places religious commodities above the purchase-limit of a class of persons is respotisible for the destruction of their desire for them . Exclude a man from church , and you are responsible for the fact that , in after years , he and his children have no desire to return . There is difficulty inherent in the plan of maintaining different social classes at the same table , literal or spiritual . Under a regime of Spartan simplicity a community may be conceived of as dining literally in commons ; but it is Spartan broth that they would get . Repeal the wise laws of Lycurgus against luxury , and the rich will soon have a table to themselves ; and the manner in which this will come about illustrates what is occurring at our spiritual dining table . With gold in his pocket , instead of corroded iron , a Spartan communist would want something better than barley soup . Under such circumstances the quality of the food would be likely to be improved . Under the influence of strong fraternal feeling the poor might remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be burdensome , and to remain as beneficiaries would be irksome . They would gradually withdraw , and each withdrawal would facilitate the process of improving the quality of the meal and increasing its expense . The process would naturally continue until the wealthy should be left alone in the enjoyment of an elegant and costly entertainment . Such a case is ideal ; but it becomes actual when we consider not physical but spiritual living . The Puritan church of America lived in voluntary commons , in extreme simplicity . Its spiritual diet was nourishing , but the opposite of luxuri // Gus . Two centuries have seen the growth of differences of wealth , the adoption of a more luxurious spiritual table and the withdrawal of a majority of the poor . If increasing costliness of church attendance were the only motive for the withdrawal of the poorer class , the evil could be partially remedied by a graded tax . Such is the real nature of the measure frequently adopted , under the name of free sittings with voluntary contribution for the maintenance of worship . There comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a motive which is social , in the narrow sense . The similarity of taste which existed in Puritan times , the Spartan period of our spiritual commune , has been disturbed by growing differences of wealth . This would be of little consequence if the bond which held the church together were purely religious ; all classes can come together in a church , if they come only to worship . It is a beautiful effect of devotional feeling to unite rich and poor by the deepest ties . On the floor of a Roman Catholic cathedral the richest of the rich and the poorest of the poor kneel together . The bond that unites them is religious , not social ; they go their several ways when the worship is over ; but within the cathedral walls , and during the moments of their impressive service , this most monarchial of churches is the most republican . There are times in the life of Protestant churches when similar effects are realized . In revival periods , when , in the social prayer-meeting , all feelings are subordinated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could the feeling be maintained , would survive all the influences of growing wealth and caste , and preserve the Christian church in its primitive unity . " Blest be the tie that binds- " when that tie is simple " Christian love . " Such a bond is the leveller of castes , the remover of jealousies , the permanent peace-maker of humanity . Change that sacred tie into a common friendship , and you break the charm ; rich and poor , cultured and ignorant can never associate on this basis . Substitute a social tie for a religious one in the church , and you make it repellant in its attitude toward the world ; you destroy its leavening principle , and make it a lump which , though it be manna itself , can not leaven a measure of meal , though it be hid in it forever . // In so far as the inability of the rich and the poor to associate results from pride alone , it is an evil and should be combated . If the wealthy merely felt above the poor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mingle more readily and frequently with their less fortunate brethren . But the real difficulty is more serious than this ; it is a difference , not of station , but of mental habit ; it is their thoughts , not their respective ranks , that are too diverse to admit of much social intercourse . There ought to be social life in a church . Where all classes are represented in its membership , only that kind of social life is practicable which results from the influence of one powerful sentiment , that of religion . It becomes therefore a vital ques. tion how far social life of an ordinary sort should be sought for . It is an open question whether it is best to superinduce a friendly tie upon the religious one , and make a church in any degree a club for social intercourse . There is no question as to the evil of allowing the lower tie to supplant the higher , making the organization a club instead of a church of the Most High . Let us therefore consult our actual experience , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ semi - social religious meetings are benefits , instead of evils , and in how far it is beneficial to abolish the English principle of church etiquette which forbids conversation after service , and subordinates all exercises in the house of God to the solemn purpose for which it is designed . How much are the poor and the ignorant in the church benefited , in fact , by the diligent efforts which churches often make for social assimilation ? Are they made really comfortable ? Do they feel quite at home in the church parlor among their wealthier brethren ? Moreover , it is the poor outside of the church who are the chief consideration ; if these come into it the more readily for its sociables and its religious meetings which are quasi-sociables , let such things continue ; but if they are repelled by them , if their consciousness of social inferiority is , by this means , made to keep them out altogether , then the day for such efforts is definitely past . No church could avowedly sacrifice to its own pleasure the millions whom Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibility that the social relation now maintained among fellow // church-members is keeping out the world , crowding out the poor of the church , and bolting the door against their return . A religious organization requires religious homogeneity of membership ; an ordinary social organization demands social homogeneity , similarity of taste , interest and wealth . All these conditions existed in colonial times ; there was an equality approximating the apostolic commune , and the church might without danger be social , as well as religious . Yet was not , in fact , the social bond , even then , more completely subordinated to the religious bond than it is now ? What kind and quantity , then , of social culture should churches seek ? No one should venture an opinion on this subject without grave consideration ; we submit it as a question . From that early day until now we believe that the effects which we have indicated as theoretically probable , have been actually realized . Increasing wealth has caused increasing costliness of religious services , and crowded out the poor ; and increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and barred them out more completely . In accordance with the psychological law above cited , religious privation among the poor has blunted their desire for religious things ; the poor man who could not well go to church ceased to want to go ; he lost his religious craving-starved , as the majority of the world are starving to-day . It is to be noticed , as a point in Spiritual Economies , that a part of the increase in the cost of church attendance has been owing to an increased fastidiousness on points of polity and creed , resulting in the multiplicity of sects , and the consequent uneconomical conduct of church affairs . Large dining halls are more economical than small ones , and the expense of our spiritual commons has been increased , not only by increasing luxury , but by the capriciousness of appetites that not only require to be served with food that comes up to a certain qualitative standard , but demand food of exactly this or that minute variety , served according to this or that particular method . The wheat must come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste may dictate . The effect may not be ill for those who are able to pay for such minute conformity to varying appetite ; but it is bad for the multitude without , who are // hungering for bread of any kind . The multiplying of sects for the minute gratification of those within the church is starving those without . Churches , therefore , in insisting selfishly on minuti2e of polity and creed , are in the attitude of sacrificing the world for their own benefit ; and the worst feature of it is that they claim to be serving the Lord in it all . Individual pharisaism may not be common now , but a kind of organized pharisaism is the sin of the times . Such is the condition of any religions body which assumes the attitude of the Jewish hypocrites of old , tithing mint , and complacently rendering tbanks for its own superiority , careless for the nonconforming world , and utterly neglecting , in its selfishness and conceit , the Christian spirit which buries the interest of self in the welfare of mankind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is always a sin on the part of the body , when a church drifts into this condition . Paraphrasing Madame Roland 's apostrophe to liberty , the economist may express his thought concerning the multiplying of sects : " 0 Religion , what blunders are committed in thy name Society , as a whole , is responsible for the life of its members , spiritual as well as physical . The principle of English law is in force here ; society must preserve the life which society endangers . It is a work , not of charity , but of justice . Principles of individual responsibility are discussed in works on Ethics ; this is a principle of organic , responsibility , a subject too broad to have received adequate consideration in any philosophy . Organic units are taking the places under the moral law formerly occupied by individual units , and laws and enactments that formerly applied to men , now apply to social aggregates of men . What , then , is the position under moral law of a church , however saintly its individual members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a world which , by its general course , it declares that it does not want converted , unless it will go elsewhere to worship ? The kindest and best of men may compose just such a church ; such are the laws of organic bodies ; and the most unfortunate of errors is to treat these effects as though they resulted from individual sins , and implied bad individual character . It is the head and the heart of // the organic whole which is to be reached , if the evil is to be remedied ; and social science must teach us where that head and heart are located . Of course the placing of the responsibility where it properly belongs , on the church as a whole , leaves each individual responsible for his own influence on the whole ; and some individuals have more than that to answer for . Great is the sin of one who is himself indifferent to the welfare of his fellowmen . Woe to the individual scribe or pharisee who , realizing the absence from church of the classes uncongenial to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fact . If the severest denunciations of Christ , directed in his own time , not against sinners out of the church , but against complacent hypocrites in it , have any application to-day , it is against the church-member who reclines in his comfortable pew and partakes of his elegant spiritual meal rejoicing in the fact that everything is made so extremely congenial through the absence of the poor . Such cases are doubtless rare ; the usual attitude is one of helpless regret with unconsciousness of responsibility . The poor are supposed to be out of the church because they wish to be so , and the good man regrets it , though knowing in his heart that his own position is made a little pleasanter by the fact . Thus , every week assemblies of saintly men and women take sweet counsel together concerning the Lord their , God , and the land of Canaan whither they are going , while the great world without has neither part nor lot in the matter . The atmosphere of such meetings would be stifling to them if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and realized where the responsibility for their absence rests In an economic view , the religious phenomena of the past have been the increasing cost of the spiritual table , the loss of religious appetite on the part of those excluded , the growth of social rather than religious relations between church members , and the ultimate differentiation of taste , which threatens to make the church forevermore a world by itself , with limits increasingly narrow and exclusive . What is the remedy ? It would take a volume to discuss it , and this essay aims to be a diagnosis rather than a prescrip // tion ; vet the general character of the remedy is indicated by the nature and cause of the evil ; it is economic and it is general . The conditions of successful cooperative house-keeping , of ordinary communal living , are the conditions of successful church life among men differing in wealth and culture . One plan , indifferent , but better than nothing , is to vary the meal to accord with differing tastes and purses ; to provide first and second-class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humanity have its French cooking for the cabin , and its plain bread and meat for the steerage . This means , of course , the differentiating of churches on the basis of wealth , a process already beginning , spontaneously , to take place . It means costly churches , chorne music and brilliant preaching for the wealthy , and plain buildings , voluntary singing and unadorned preaching for the poor . At best this is unrepublican , and hostile to the spirit of Christ 's teaching ; but it is less odious than to turn the poor out altogether . Considering how many of them are at present excluded by the general causes which we have indicated , no practical work is nobler than the establishing of inexpensive churches for the spiritually destitute . It is to be noticed also , that , at the spiritual as at the literal table , the plainer provision is the healthier . The adornments of the costly service are delicacies for the palate , rather than nourishment ; and sometimes , like wines and desserts , they are slow poisons . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and for the development of the Christian spirit in the church , let us have the second table rather than the first . There is another way more republican and more Christianthe establishment of a single table which all can attend . The food provided should be simpler , cheaper , and more nourishing than what is now provided , and the buildings larger and less luxurious . Men should attend church for sustenance , not for society . The tie that binds should be Christian love , not friendship based on similarity of taste and station . The Roman Catholic church fulfils the last of these conditions ; having little social life , and holding its members together by a purely religious tie , it is able to unite rich and poor in its membership as few Protestant churches can do . To allege that the Roman Catholic religion is a poor one , is to strengthen the argument ; // if so much is accomplished by a poor religion , a better one , under equally favorable conditions , ought to accomplish still more . " Xa*e2ra ra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hard things . This plan is better than the former , and therefore more difficult ; for that very reason its adoption is ultimately probable . On the general optimistic principle that the world is improving , and that the ideal of the present will be the reality of the future , we are willing to believe that the church will one day possess something of the devotional spirit which led the d*sciples at Jerusalem not only to forget differences of wealth , but to annihilate them , and which is said to have led the refugees of the Roman Catacombs to organize a commune beneath the ground above which a despotism was established . There will be social intercourse indeed , but founded on religion . Struggling attempts at sociables may cease , but prayer-meetings will flourish ; elements uncongenial in a drawing-room , will become congenial in a house of worship . The church will lose not only in the elegance of its furnishings , but also in the average refinement of its members ; but for every step which it shall take downward , according to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upward , according to the standard of its founder , till , attaining again the ideal which it realized , for a brief season in the past , it shall gather the few rich , and the many poor , into a company in which the flippant ties of polite society will be utterly impossible , but in which the deep bond of spiritual brotherhood will be forever assured .
