txt The spiders of Wall-street have for more than a year been lamenting that the flies , whom they call " the public , " will not " come in " to the meshes carefully prepared far them . The suicide and disgrace of a Cashier in New-Brunswick who did " come in , " and who , if he had staid out , might have led a long , prosperous and honored life , ought to weigh more with the public than the invitations of the stock jobbers . The disgrace and death of Mr. HILL are clearly attributable to the fact that gambling in corporate securities is absurdly regarded as somehow on a different footing from gambling with cards or dice . There is no reason to believe that he would have died a disgraced and ruined gambler if only the allurements of roulette and faro had appealed to him . He would probably have disdained to enter an avowed gambling den , though he had no scruple about visiting a stock broker 's office . In fact , this unfounded distinction between two forms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increment " is precisely what makes the Stock Exchange a more mischievous institution than a faro bank . There is in the one case a nucleus of real and legitimate business , for no business can be more legitimate than that of providing a market for investment in corporate enterprises . In the other case there is no such nucleus . The nucleus of real business constitutes a very trifling proportion of the total business of the Stock Exchange even in dull times like the present , while in " good times " it dwindles almost into imperceptibility . And yet it suffices to take off the social disrepute of gambling , so that a man who is staking his money on the price of stocks in Wall-street may persuade himself and other people that he is doing " business , " whereas he would find it impossible to cherish or to inspire that delusion if he were frankly speculating upon the chances of turning up the ten of clubs or of filling a bobtail flush . The case of HILL is one of the most surprising of all that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had an adequate , indeed a handsome , income from positions in which he was secure , an income more than equal to his apparent scale of living , and , so far as appears or has been intimated , he had no secret or vicious modes of expenditure . To no man , apparently , could the temptation to gain money by gambling appeal with less force . And yet , urged by some inscrutable impulse , perhaps the same imbecile vanity of proving that he could foresee the fall of the cards better than the men who had packed them , which has ruined so many of " the public , " he risked and lost his own money , and then went on to risk and lose the money of other people which he held in trust , until there was no escape from exposure but in death . A more wanton waste of what should have been a happy and useful life it is impossible to imagine . Whatever is done to remedy the state of things which has produced this wretched result can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure of social opinion . When it becomes as disreputable to buy or sell stocks on a margin as it now is to bet money in a faro bank people in respectable positions will be as little addicted to the one form of vice as they now are to the other . The law can not and should not interfere with the parting of a fool and his money by methods which may be the methods of doing needful business . What the law can and should prevent is the parting of a fool and other people 's meney . Any stock broker who accepts the account of a man occupying the position of a trustee tempts the man to embezzle in order to pay his losses or to renew his risks . It should be made a criminal offense for any stock broker to take such an account , or even to receive an application to take such an account , without at once disclosing the application to the persons for whose money the trustee is responsible . The instinct of self-preservation could then be trusted to keep trust money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
