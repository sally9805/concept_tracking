txt About Christmas it was discovered by the officials of the First National Bank that $22,000 in securities , belonging to James Milwain of this city , had been abstracted from a box that contained $100,000 . The matter was kept a profound secret among the bank people and the police , and it only leaked out when a telegram was abut out from Montreal yesterday stating that $9,000 of the - stolen securities had been traced and secured . The stolen property is : District of Columbia water bonds for $1,000 each , due Oct. 1 , 1901 , with coupons of January , 1888 , and thereafter , NOR . 13 , 44 , 45 , 46 , and 47 ; first mortgage bonds of the Northwestern Grand Trunk Railroad of Michigan , payable Jan. 1 , 1910 , for $1,000 each , with coupons of January , 1888 , and thereafter , Nos. 670 , 671 , 867 , 868 , - 869 , 870 , and 871 ; water bonds of the city of Albany , N. Y .. due Feb. 1 , 1893 , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thereafter , Nos. 51 , 52 , 53 , 54 , 55 , 56 , 57 , 58 , 59 , and 00 . It is supposed that while looking over his securities Mr. Milwain 's attention was divarted for a moment , and In that interval the sneak thief grabbed what he could from the box . This theory is supported by the fact that there were 17 of the Northwestern Grand Trunk bonds , of which only 7 were stolen . It was inconceivable that a sneak thief could have gone to the rear of the bank , passed through the President 's room , even if that were unoccupied , and then passed to the rear of a dozen clerks and into the vault . Even if he had gone so far as this the boxes in use were all locked , and the rack of boxes hangs in such a way that if any are left unlocked the door is slightly opened . Mr. Milwain 's box was closed . The key was different from any other key used . In the ; absence of Cashier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Van Allen has been in the President 's office during banking hours almost constantly . This room is at the rear of the bank and opposite the vault . From this desk Mr. Van Allen has an unobstructed view of all parts of the bank . Mr. Milwain thinks the securities were stolen in November , but he is probably mistaken , for it has been discovered that as early as October last some of the Grand Trunk bonds were sold in Chicago . Some of them have been recently traced to Montreal , and some of the District of Columbia bonds have been sold in Boston , The thief evidently divided his spoils , or else made a rapid circuit of the leading cities to dispose of ins plunder . Mr. Milwain , though ho thinks the vault was rifled , does not blame the bank people . The police and bank folks feel that it was the work of a sneak thief .
