PART I. M* early recollections of General Grant extend from the time he was six or seven years of age , in 1828 , or one year later , to the autumn of 1836 . During that time we lived within three hundred yards of each other in the small village of Georgetown , the county seat of Brown County , Ohio . From proximity , and perhaps from other causes , our association was intimate . When we were so small that we had the belief that in a much-swollen stream there must be a superabundance of fish , we were engaged with hook and line in an attempt to catch them . He ventured out on a barked poplar log , very slippery from the rain ; in an instant his feet were in the air , and he disappeared in the turbulent , muddy water . I rushed down the stream some thirty feet , where it narrowed , and willows partly nudermined bent over the stream nearly to the surface of the water . Out upon one of these willows I clambered quickly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the swift current , helped him to reach the bank . It is not unlikely that this incident would have been entirely forgotten by me had he not worn at that time a Marseilles upper garment with red stripes , buttoning on the nether garment , as worn by children . It seemed to me so superb , that I was filled with regret that it should thus be irretrievably ruined . In the following pages a letter from General Grant , when at Nice , will be quoted , which alludes to this incident . His mother at that time was perhaps thirty years of age , above medium height , graceful in manner , gracious to children , neat in person , and kept her children neatly clothed , which was rather unusual in that part of the world at that time . In after years the General told me that he had never seen his mother shed a tear ; she had a cheerful countenance , a kind word to all , and in my eyes was very handsome , and , in reality , certainly was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy , General Grant was never aggressive nor given to profanity , a vice that was not unusual with many of his companions . If provoked or insulted he would fight it out manfully . He never entered into a fight without it being clearly the fault of the other boy . He was fond of horses ; we rode usually without a saddle , a blanket being strapped on the back of the horse , and without stirnips . In childhood he was a sturdy little fellow , never boisterous . Without being slothful or inert , he had not that superabundant flow of animal spirits which impels many boys to " stand on their heads , " yell vociferously , and do many disagreeable things from thoughtlessness , apparently arising from great vitality . A small brick school-house stood on a hill some three hundred yards from the court-house , near which we lived . It had two rooms , the one for the girls , the other for the boys . Writing from Pau , France , General Grant says of this period of our lives " PAu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DEAR ADMIRAL : " On my arrival here last night I found a very large mail , and in it two letters from you . This is the first mail since leaving Gibraltar , from whence I wrote you . At that time I had fully determined not to go by India , China , and Japan , and so wrote the Secretary of the Navy-saying , however , that if I determined otherwise before the departure of the Richmond ' from America , I would cable him . This morning I sent him a dispatch that I would accept his offer of a passage on that steamer. 1 could not say much in a dispatch , but I hope we will be able to join the steamer on the north side of the Mediterranean , somewhere between Marseilles and Palermo . This will extend my trip and make my arrival in America some months later than I had expected , probably extending the time into late fall . Of course , going by San Francisco , I shall want to spend at least a month going over old ground with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That quarter of a century does not seem half so long as the one which preceded it , and passed since you and I first received instruction under John D. White and a long beech switch cut generally by the boys for their own chastisement . " Mrs. Grant wants me to say now that she regrets your retirement , because you might otherwise accompany us , and she has every confidence in you on your native element . I believe you are a first-class farmer besides . " I have not yet received your paper on the interoceanic canal , ' but will read it with great interest when it reaches me . " I had preserved with great care a letter you wrote me as much as nine months ago , giving the route and places to visit on naval vessels after leaving the Red Sea , until since leaving Gibraltar ; but I destroyed it a few days ago . I would be very glad to get a repetition of it now . " I am very sorry , with Mrs. Grant , that you can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Ammen is not to be with us. . . . " // I left that locality in November , 1836 , and did not meet my old companion again until June , 1843 . He had just graduated at the Military Academy , and , passing through Philadelphia , had kindly arranged a meeting at Jones ' Hotel , near Seventh , on Chestnut street , Philadelphia . He was then a stoutly built , round-faced youth , twenty-one years of age on the 27th of the preceding ApriL Our next meeting was at Culpepper Court House , Virginia , where I went on the 1st of May , 1864 , just as he was on the point of crossing the Rapidan . He had been at Hampton Roads some weeks before , and , speaking with Admiral Lee , expressed a desire to see me at head-quarters . I was then at Norfolk on a court of inquiry . Previous to this I had shown the admiral a letter which I had received in reply to one of my own . It has never appeared in print , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , February 16 , 1864 . " DEAR AMMEN : " Your letter was duly received and advice fully appreciated , particularly as it is the same I would give any friend ; i. e. , to avoid all political entanglements . I have always thought the most slavish life any man could lead was that of a politician . Besides , I do not believe any man can be successful as a soldier whilst he has an anchor ahead for other advancement . I know of no circumstances likely to arise which could induce me to accept of any political office whatever . My only desire will be , as it has been , to whip out the rebellion in the shortest way possible , and to retain as high a position in the army afterward as the Administration then in power may think me suitable for . " I was truly glad to bear from you . I was once on leave of absence at the same time you were , and went from Clermont County to Cincinnati more to see you than for any other purpose . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by river . I believe the last time we met was in Philadelphia , in 1843 . We have both grown older since , though time sets very lightly with me . I am neither gray nor bald , nor do I feel any different from what I did at twenty-five . I have often wished you had been selected to command the Mississippi flotilla . I have no fault to find , however , with the naval officers who have co-operated with me . I think Porter , Phelps , and some of the younger officers , as clever men as I ever fell in with . I can not complain of them , certainly , for I believe I never made a request of them they did not comply with , no matter what the danger . I know I caused Porter to lose one gunboat against his judgment , and he never found fault . " Remember me to Mrs. Vandyke 's family , and any other friends of mine in Cincinnati . I will be very glad to hear from you again . " Yours truly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grant occurred on being detached from the temporary command of a vessel . A note stating // my desire to pay him a visit , if it suited his convenience , was followed by the receipt of the requisite military pass . On my arrival at Culpepper the General received me very kindly , reminded me that it was nearly twenty-one years since we had met at Philadelphia , and turned me over to Colonel Badean , who was an old acquaintance , and suggested that we should take a ride . We were soon mounted , and , accompanied by several other officers , rode to the summit of Pony Hill , some three miles distant to the southwest , from whence we could see the field-works of the enemy across the Rapidan . About ten o'clock , the hour the General informed me he would be at leisure , he sent for me . We were alone until some time after midnight . He spoke of our boyhood , of the persons whom we knew in common , and , later , concerning army movements . Not an inconsiderable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was to assure an effective co-operation of our naval forces . I had been authorized by Admiral Lee to say to the General that , apart from the force requisite for the maintenance of the blockade on the coast of North Carolina , all other vessels under his command would be subordinated , as far as desired , to support army movements in any manner suggested . Breakfasting with the General and his staff the following morning , he proposed a ride with me . We were accompanied by one orderly . The course chosen was first to the north-east , and after some miles passed over , turning to the right . The country was an undulating plain , almost denuded of wood and wholly destitute of fences . Here and there were encamped the different army corps that composed a principal part of the force that was about to cross the IRapidan . The General rode the finest horse , as he told me then and afterwards , that he had ever mounted  --  a large , powerful bay , with a free , easy stride of great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lexington , " and was named " Cincinnati . " The General spoke of his intended movement , that our army in the valley was already on the march , and told me that on the following day , as I returned to Washington , I would meet Burnside 's corps . He did not feel at liberty to give the number of troops that would move on Richmond . The force , however , was as large as he thought himself able to command , bearing in mind the difficulties of the country for transportation . Were the troops with their supply trains to be placed along the line of road to Richmond , which I // think he gave as seventy miles , the head of the army would be at Richmond before the rear had crossed the Ilapidan . He added humorously that he did not expect to reach Richmond in that order . In reply to my inquiry , he said that he supposed that he had very reliable information of the forces of General Lee . As I remember , he reckoned them at 120,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Petersburg . He did not regard General Lee as the ablest general of the South ; he , however , possessed the entire confidence , respect , and indeed affection of every one under his command , and such a man could not be an indifferent commander to meet . He considered General Joseph E. Johnston as a superior and very able commander , and Bragg , if regarded simply in the light of a soldier , he thought very able ; he was , however , so thoroughly detested by the people of the South that he would never prove a formidable adversary . After a ride of some two hours or more , passing over probably twelve or fifteen miles , we approached Culpepper from the general direction of Pony Hill . As we passed another army corps , the General remarked , with something in manner akin to enthusiasm , that there was the most thoroughly equipped army for field-work that he thought could be found on the globe . He would do the best he could with it . Newspapers state that officers have said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would do this or that ; but he could only promise to do his best . He said , further , that some of our officers , after an engagement , thought it impossible to move on until they were again thoroughly prepared , apparently forgetful that the enemy was making the best use of his time also . The result of an engagement was often only a question of relative exhaustion of resources ; if the enemy 's forces were worse off than his own , as the result of a battle , he saw no reason why the enemy should not be pressed at once , notwithstanding actual deficiencies of his own preparation . Two or three days after ' I left the General he crossed the Rapidan , and I had not the pleasure of meeting him again until the evening of the day of the review of General Sherman 's army in Washington , after the close of the war . He wrote me from City Point , August 18th , 1864 , principally in relation to the explosion of the mine of Petersburg . Shortly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some one else very similar in import , and indeed // in some parts almost identical in words . The following extracts will probably interest the reader : " Several times we have had decisive victories within our grasp , but let them , through accident or fault , slip through our hands . Our movement from Cold Harbor to the south side of the James was made with such celerity , that before the enemy got a single regiment across the river our forces had carried the fortifications east of Petersburg . There was nothing , not even a military force , to prevent our walking in and taking possessrnn . The officer charged with this work , for some unaccountable reason , stopped at the works he had captured , and gave the enemy time to get in a garrison and to intreuch it . On the 30th of July , again by a feint north of the James , we drew most of the enemy to that side of the river , and whilst he was there ( with my troops quietly withdrawn during the night ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a battery and some three hundred of the enemy , and making a breach in his works into which our men marched without opposition . The enemy was completely surprised , and commenced running in all directions . There was nothing to prevent our men from marching directly to the high ground in front of them , to which they had been directed to go . Once there , all the enemy 's fortifications would have been taken in reverse , and no stand would have been made . It is clear that without a loss of five hundred men we could have had Petersburg with all its artillery and many of the garrison . But our troops stopped in the crater made by the explosion . The enemy was given time to rally and re-occupy his line . Then we found , true enough , that we had the wolf by the ears . He was hard to hold , and more dangerous to let go . This was so outrageous that I have obtained a court of inquiry to sift the matter . We will peg away , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will but be true to themselves . If they would but reflect , everything looks favorable . . " The hope of a counter-revolution over the draft or the Presidential election keeps them together . Then , too , they hope for the election of a peace candidate , ' who would let them go . A peace at any price ' is fearful to contemplate . It would be but the beginning of war . The demands of the South would know no limits . They would demand indemnity for expenses incurred in carrying on the war . They would demand the return of all their // slaves set free in consequence of war . They would demand a treaty looking to the rendition of all fugitive slaves escaping into the Northern States , and they would keep on demanding until it would be better to be dead than to submit longer . During the winter of 1865-66 General Grant was domiciled in Washington . My duties at that time were at that navy-yard , in command of a vessel of war . I saw him there almost daily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American continent should be sufficiently examined to ascertain the practicability of a ship canal from sea to sea , or the reverse . Rear-Admiral Davis , then Superintendent of the Naval Observatory , had an old Spanish map of that region enlarged , with coast lines put in with the best geographical determinations . After many examinations of this and such other information as was readily obtainable , General Grant paid a visit to the Secretary of State several times , on one occasion taking me with him . Finally , he told me that he would not go to see Mr. Seward again in relation to this matter ; he felt satisfied , should he do so , that he would hate Mr. Seward , and he was not disposed to put himself into a position to make him hate any man . After taking . leave of Washington , in April , I did not see General Grant until the famous " swinging around the circle " of President Johnson , accompanied by himself and Admiral Farragut , passing through York , Pennsylvania , where I then lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him on the car , when he expressed to me very freely his disgust at this tour , which was no less distasteful to Admiral Farragut than to himself . In the summer and autumn of 1867 my duties again took me to Washington for short periods , at which times I was usually an inmate of General Grant 's house . On one of these occasions , not long after the forced resignation or dismissal of Mr. Stanton from the position of Secretary of War , General Grant informed mc that , much against his inclination , he had consented to accept the position of Acting Secretary of War , a controlling reason being , that he feared the President might otherwise appoint some unscrupulous person , whose approval , under existing laws , of fraudulent cotton claims , might rob the treasury of *2OO , 000,000 , or even more . Perhaps the following morning , certainly within a day or so , General Sherman , then stationed at St. Louis , made his appearance in General Grant 's house at a very early hour . As soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a humorous way said : " Why , Sherman , what on earth are you doing here ? You know very well that , under existing laws , you can not leave St. Louis without my order . " " Oh , yes , " said Sherman , with a merry twinkle in his eye , " I know that very well ; but the President sent me a telegram to come on , and I am here to see you to know what is up . I rely greatly on your clemency in violating the law . " I have never made inquiry since then , of General Grant or of General Sherman , of what " was up " at that time . Later in the season , when from time to time I was in Washington , General Grant kindly invited me to a drive with him in his buggy , and expressed at times great distrust of the intentions or rather designs of Mr. Johnson . In the autumn , on one of these drives , he said he felt sure that nothing but the cowardice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had become aware of a secret military organization in Maryland , and had accurate information at that time of its ramifications , through General - . The Governor of Maryland had made requisitions on the War Department for field artillery to which , under existing laws , the State was entitled ; but knowing as he did the intended revolutionary purpose , he had simply pigeon.holed the requisitions . For a time he thought of writing the Governor that he had his eye on him , but on the whole he concluded not to do so . In Virginia , too , there were signs of a support , but so far no organization existed ; the intention was inchoate in development . Farther south there were no indications of disturbance . Early in December my duties brought me again to Washington for a day . Meeting General Grant near the War Department , he invited me to his room . Seeing that he had a careworn look , I asked him how matters were progressing . He said , " Badly enough ; I will not be surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President paid me a visit of an hour or more , speaking on indifferent subjects , and , just before leaving , said : General , there is one point upon which I feel a deep interest , and that is , in the event of an open rupture between Congress and myself , where will you be found 1 " The reply was , " said the General to me with great earnestness : " That will depend entirely upon which was the revolutionary party . ' " I dined with the General that day , and he was good enough to drive me to the railroad depot when I was leaving the city . Before // we parted he expressed his regret that thus far he had not been able to forward the examination of the isthmuses , for the purpose of ascertaining the practicability of a ship canal . I replied , " That makes little difference , General ; I feel assured that sooner or later you will be able to bring this about . " In a few days I was at sea for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April , 1869 . The General was good enough to request that I should be ordered home , after his election to the Presidency in November , 1868 . I find in my package only two letters from him during my absence . One , dated November 23 , contains the following : " DEAR ARISEN : " Your welcome and very interesting letters up to September have been received . . . . Appearances now are about what they were in 65 . I would write you a long letter on public and home affairs but that I hope you will be on your way home soon after the receipt of this , if you are not before Upon my arrival in Washington 1 was assigned to duty , and remained in that city during the two Presidential terms of General Grant . My residence being in the country , General Grant was good enough to give me a general iuvitation to dine with him on Sunday when it suited my convenience . This I did monthly , more frequently twice a mouth , and usually before dinner took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in length , and rarely less than half that distance . He spoke freely on many matters upon which he is supposed to have been silent . In all my intercourse with him I have no recollection of his uttering what seemed an ill-digested expression ; he was a man essentially of ideas . With me and with others by whom he would not be misunderstood , or his language repeated and afterwards perverted , he was not at all a " silent man . " Although I have no recollection of his ever saying to me that he did not wish publicity to be given to what he had said , yet on many occasions I felt that I would have betrayed an implied confidence , as in the case of what has been stated above in regard to the Governor of Maryland , and of his conversation with President Johnson . In the White House , Johnson was spoken of on one occasion . I expressed some surprise that it had not found its way into the newspapers preceding the Presidential election . He said it did not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Coinstock and myself . // Soon after he became President I asked what he thought was the political effect of the assassination of President Lincoln . He replied , with great feeling , that it was the greatest possible calamity to the country , and especially to the people of the South . Had Mr. Lincoln lived , his great ability and tact would , he thought , have very soon reconciled and adjusted all possible differences , and the country would have been spared long years ef mismanagement and misunderstanding . On one of our Sunday walks we met two gentlemen , one of whom introduced the other to the General . The one introduced told the General that he knew him when he kept Knight 's Ferry , near Stockton , in California . The General smiled , and replied that he had met a great number of people who told him they knew him when he kept that ferry . We passed on , and our conversation was resumed without any comment in relation to these gentlemen or what had been said . Had any one asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly would have replied affirmatively . On the return of General Grant , after his tour around the world , he visited Stockton in the autumn of 1879 , and in a short , humorous address said that he had met hundreds , perhaps thousands , of people who had told him they knew him when he kept the ferry near that city . There must be some mistake about it , nevertheless , he said , as he had never visited that locality but once before , and on that occasion had staid over night only . The Presidency gave him great annoyance . On one occasion he said to me that if he knew capable , honest men in Louisiana , who would accept office , he would appoint them , whether Republicans or Democrats . Being Democrats did not in his belief make them honest , and therefore he had not gone out of his party . I said that a native of Louisiana , and at that time a resident , had told me that he did not think there was any political honesty in that State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grant would have felt greatly relieved had he never been proposed for the Presidency . After his election for a second term he said that he felt gratified at a renomination , as it indicated an approval of his first term . During his army service , nor at any other time , had he ever solicited , directly or indirectly , military or civil preferment . I feel warranted in expressing the belief that at the period when his political friends insisted upon his candidacy for a third term he would have felt // grateful to them had they proposed any other person who would have been generally acceptable . During his Presidency he took great personal interest in the progress of all of the surveys touching the practicability of an interoceanic canal across this continent , and when these surveys eliminated from commercial consideration the different proposed routes other than Nicaragua and Panama , he directed a close instrumental survey of the latter when informed by the Canal Commission , appointed by him under a Congressional resolution , that this survey was essential to a relative consideration of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completed he carefully examined the results , and fully agreed with the Commission that the Nicaragua route so far surpassed the Panama in economic conditions of construction and in other commercial advantages as to settle beyond a doubt the question of where the canal should and ultimately will be , as extracts from letters written by him abroad will show in the pages following . During all the years of his Presidency I was most kindly , I may say affectionately , received at the White House , and was there at such times as he had his recreations . His table was supplied with the wines usual with persons of position . During the earlier years of his administration he partook , but not at all freely , of what he furnished his guests . The winter preceding the expiration of his last term he was actually abstinent at his own table , and , I have every reason to believe , entirely so . Yet during that period one or more of the Washington Sunday newspapers , and other vile l ) rints , informed the people of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was to be seen daily reeling through the streets ! During all of these years I never saw General Grant in a condition that would give rise even to a suspicion that he had indulged too freely in liquors , and only on one occasion have I ever had a glass of liquor in the White House . On one of the many Sundays that General Grant invited me to walk before dinner , the weather was raw and the wind high . On coming into the house the General proposed a glass of liquor , and , going into the diningroom , we were waited on by the steward . Many of the friends and admirers of General Grant will read this statement with gratification , and the more if they know me personally . They will at least feel assured that I would not present even a specious statement , much less an untruth , however much I might feel interested // in the good name of any one . May not the gentlemen of the press well consider whether it would not be far better to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adulation then can not recompense the wronged , nor can " flattery soothe the dull , cold ear of death . " Soon after the expiration of his last term , in April , 1877 , General Grant kindly asked me to accompany him to Ohio , to visit the home of our childhood . At Cincinnati we were the guests of Washington McLean , Esq. , a gentleman properly known far and wide . From thence the General drove to Georgetown , a distance of forty miles . We were received in the kindest manner by all of the inhabitants , more especially by those who knew us as children . We then took leave , as it were , of the past scenes of childhood-dear as they must be to every honest heart  --  and of those who knew us as boys , however humble they might be , as well as of those with whom our association had been more intimate . Before General Grant went abroad , which was one month later , he told me that he had called on the President and urged upon him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . During his absence he was good enough to write me from time to time . Quotations from these letters may interest the reader , even though he has read the charming book of John iRussell Young , who accompanied him during the greater part of his travels . From London , August 26th , 1877 , he writes : " 1 arrived here from the continent yesterday , after a most pleasant visit of about seven weeks there , most of the time in Switzerland . There is no more beautiful scenery or climate for summer travel than Switzerland presents . The people are industrious and honest , simple and frugal in their habits , and would be very poor for all this if it were not for the travel through their country . I wish their surplus population would emigrate to the United States . . " For the past eight weeks I have seen but few American papers , and am consequently behind the home news . The foreign papers , however , have been full of the great railroad strike , no doubt exaggerated , as bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared to put down such demonstrations promptly , and with severe consequences to the guilty . I hope good may come out of this in pointing out the necessity for having the proper remedy at hand in case of need . An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure . " ' From Nice , France , December 10th , he writes : " Mv DEAR ADMIRAL : // make our excursion of the Mediterranean . How much I wish you were in command , to unfurl for the first time your admiral 's flag . . Writing of meeting the officers on board , he continues : " Of course I told I owed you an old grudge as being responsible for the many trials and difficulties I had passed through in the last half century , for nearly that length of time ago you had rescued me from a watery grave . I am of a forgiving nature , however , and forgive you  --  but is the feeling universal ? If the Democrats get into full power , may they not hold you responsible ! But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will come to you for any act of kindness done to me . Our trip thus far has been most agreeable . The weather in Paris was most atrocious , but I got to see much of the people . My opinion of their capacity for self-government has materially changed since seeing for myself . Before coming here I did not believe the French people capable of selfgovernment . Now I believe them perfectly capable , and that they will be satisfied with nothing less . They are patient , and of long-suffering , ' but there will not be entire peace and quiet until a form of government is established in which all the people have a full voice . It will be more republican than anything they have had under the name of a Republic . " DANIEL AMMEN.
