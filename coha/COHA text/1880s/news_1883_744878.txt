txt The first day of enrollment under the plan for reorganizing the Republican Party of this City resulted in the registration of less than 6,000 names . This is somewhat more than one-half the number of the membership of the present Republican associations , and a majority of the persons enrolled were drawn from those associations . Many others were brought in. by those men , and will presumably work with them . In some districts efforts were made by certain " leaders " to rally their own forces and so direct the enrollment as to secure support for their own pretensions as managers . Unless the enrollment on the two remaining days shall exhibit a better result , considerably less than one-third of the Republican voters of the City will be placed on the lists and a majority of those enrolled will be the same persons who have been accustomed to act in the district associations . While the organization thus formed will be more difficult to manage than the old " machine , " there is danger that the same set of managers will succeed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Members of the City Central , Committee under the old organization have been largely instrumental in concocting and . preparing to carry out the-plan of reorganization . It secured a preponderating influence in the Committee of Eighteen , and has shaped its action in some important respects , and we have no doubt that the " machine " leaders have calculated on retaining their power . They have presumed on the general apathy and indifference of Republicans in regard to preliminary party action and have probably had little faith in a large enrollment of the voters . But the door is open , nevertheless , and the voters can , if they choose , succeed in placing the management of their interests in new hands . If they do , it will doubtless be a disappointment to the old managers , but it can not be prevented if Republicans enough will come forward and put their names upon the rolls . Some objection is made to the pledge which must be signed by those who wish to be enrolled . This is simply that the applicant will not during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part in the primaries or caucuses of any other political organization . " Many people dislike to submit to any pledge whatever in regard to their future action . Independent voters are numerous in the Republican ranks , and they are disposed to hold themselves free . to " bolt " and to take part in independent movements whenever the action of the regular organization does not suit them . It is claimed that this pledge would prevent any person signing it from taking part in a citizens ' movement or any non-partisan organization having for its object the election of candidates for municipal office . If it is to be construed in that way it is a serious drawback , and it should be distinctly understood before the enrollment proceeds any further whether that is the construction to be put upon it . It is our own opinion that the choice of officers to administer the corporate interests of the City should not be regarded as a political matter in the ordi , nary sense of the term , and that persons engaged in efforts to secure the best officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be regarded as forming a political organization . But the intent of this pledge should be distinctly understood . If this enrollment is to be successful it must have a broad basis . It should admit the name of every voter who can sustain his claim to be a ' Republican . The line of restriction should be drawn only with a view to ? excluding those who are really hostile to the party . It should be clearly understood that any Republican is entitled to enroll himself as such and to act in the primary meetings of his party . If he furnishes evidence that he is a Republican and intends to.act with the party , that should be enough . If- the pledge is intended merely to exclude those who are not Republicans or who intend to act with some party hostile to the Republicans , it should be made to convey that meaning explicitly . Let the Committee of Eighteen interpret it or give it a wording that can not be misunderstood .                @ @ @ @ @
