txt The managers of the World 's Industrial and Cotton Centennial Exposition , which is to be held in New-Orleans , have asked Congress to loan them $1,000,000 out of the National Treasury . The people of New-Orleans have taken $500,000 of the capital stock , and are now engaged in increasing the amount subscribed to $1,000 , - 000 . The city in its corporate capacity has appropriated $100,000 , and has given the use of a park containing 247 acres . So many applications for space have been made that the main building , which covers 32 acres , will not afford sufficient room . More money is needed , the managers say , and in their opinion the National Government ought to supply it . The history of the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition shows that it is very difficult for the National Government to secure repayment of a loan of this kind , even when the exhibition is one which attracts people of all nations , and when there is a surplus large enough to satisfy such a debt . The loan made to the Directors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount subscribed by stockholders was about $2,400,000 . At the close of that exposition there remained in the treasury about $2,000,000 . The stockholders held that this sum ought to be given to them , and the representatives of the United States maintained that the Government loan of $1,500,000 should first be repaid . The words of the act by which the loan was made  --  which have been repeated in the bill introduced by the NewOrleans managers  --  were that " in the distribution of any moneys that may remain in the treasury of the Centennial Board of Finance after the payment of its debts , the appropriation hereinbefore made shall be paid in full into the Treasury of the United States before any dividend or percentage of the profits shall be paid to the holders of said stock . " The stockholders , who at best could get only SO cents on a dollar , appealed to the courts . A decision in their favor was made by the United States Circuit Court , which held that the sum remaining in the treasury was not " profits . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the Board of Finance was forced to repay the sum loaned . The stockholders were given a dividend of 23 1-2 per cent. , and they have recently asked Congress to make their losses good . It is plain , therefore , that under the proposed bill the Government could regain its money , if the assets should be sufficient in amount . There were assets at Philadelphia . Will there be any at New-Orleans ? This is a question for which members of Congress ought to find a reasonably sure answer before they vote for the New-Orleans bill . The exhibition at Philadelphia was national and international . Circumstances combined to make it exceptionally attractive and profitable , but in one sense it did not " pay , " although it was of great benefit to the country . At the close of the Atlanta exposition the cash in hand amounted to $4,000 , against which there were stock subscriptions amounting to $105,000 . If it could be shown that the loan would surely be repaid ; that the ' New-Orleans exposition is really national in its character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deserve the financial support of tax-payers in every State and Territory , it might be difficult to find sound grounds upon which to oppose the passage of this loan bill . The enterprise deserves the encouragement of citizens . It will hasten the development of a rich country and tend to establish good feeling between the people of the North and the people of the far South . It must not be forgotten , however , that the tax-payers of the whole country are asked to support it by a loan of $1,000,000 , which the Directors may be unable to repay . If the loan is to be made at all , and especially if it is to be in fact a gift , it should be conclusively shown that the exhibition will be national in its scope , like the Exhibition of 1876 , and that it will be of service to all who pay national taxes .
