txt At Renovo , a town a short distance from here , quite a sensation was created this afternoon , growing out of a heavy defalcation in the Post Office . It involves a popular and prominent young man , married only a few days ago . Every possible effort has been made to withhold the particulars from the public , and the local papers have been induced not to publish the facts . The disclosures connected with the defalcation were whispered about since Tuesday , but it was difficult to determine anything definitely . It is now discovered that the shortage was in the accounts of the Postmaster to the extent of over $2,000. and the evidence goes to show that Decatur Wells , the chief clerk and son of the Postmaster , is the man who is responsible for the deficit . The abstraction of moneys has been in progress for a year or more , but by clever manipulation of the accounts Wells managed to keep his father in ignorance of the deficit until C. W. Spuce , Agent of the Post Office Department from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the office shortage . The Postmaster never suspected any crookedness in his office . The Government Agent at once served notice of the deficit upon the bondsmen , William Stout , Mather Dean , Joseph Whitby . and John Ward , each of whom was required to pay $500 . The money ' order business of the office has been large , and it is stated that young Wells 's deficit arose by withholding the money received through that source and appropriating it to his private use . Wells is about 26 years of age , and about a week ago was married . He has always inclined to be something of a " sport , " and has the reputation of being a reckless betting man . Rumor has it that he had $500 or more placed on the losing side in the last national election . The deepest sympathy is expressed for his wife and father . Young Wells will be prosecuted and his father removed .
