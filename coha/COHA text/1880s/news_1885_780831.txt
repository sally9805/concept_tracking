txt Gov . Hill 's friends have always understood that the relations between him and Samuel J. Tilden in the Assems bly of 1872 were far from being cordial . Mr. Hill had been an aggressive member of the previous Legislature . He had been in full sympathy , as the Legislature records show , with Tweed and his schemes for robbing the city of NewYork . He had been a conspicuous figure in the group of able debaters who advocated the bills of the " boss " and of parliamentarians who helped push them through " without delay , debate , or amendment . " All these things were known to Mr. Tilden , and he naturally regarded the young member from Chemung with distrust . The reforms which the committee of New-York 's citizens urged , and which Mr. Tilden did all in his power to promote , demanded a considerable share of the attention of the Legislature of which Messrs . Tilden and Hill were members .

" The session of March 14 , 1872 , was memorable for the debate over the bill to repeal the Classification act . Mr. Hill defended Jay Gould and the other thieves who composed the Erie Railroad ring , and attacked the stockholders , who were trying to wrest the road from the ring Mr. Tilden replied to the tool of Jay Gould , and administered a rebuke which cut the cuticle of the young man from Chemung to the very quick . The latter neither forgot it nor forgave it .

They condemn it In no measured terms . It is not what the leaders in the work of overturning the municipal affairs of New-York and placing the politics of the State in the hands of the Radical Party intended it should be , and the expression of their dissatisfaction is both loud and earnest .
