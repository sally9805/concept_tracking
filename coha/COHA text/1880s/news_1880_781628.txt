txt It is certain that the Greenbackers and the Democrats of Maine are badly demoralized . Naturally , the trouble arises from a fusion which fuses nothing . The Greenbackers nominated for Governor Mr. HARRIS M. PLAISTED , an old-time Republican , who had left his party with a sore head , and who was subsequently " Independent ) ! and then Greenbacker , not from any conscientious motive , but because he felt that he had no prospect of advancement in his own party . He was hastily indorsed by the Democrats , whose convention was held on ; the same day and in the same city as that of the Greenbackers . Latterly , bickerings have arisen between the Greenbackers and . the Democrats . Fusion will be an accomplished fact in Maine only when both parties vote for the Greenback candidate , who is an old Republican . The nomination of HAageocz electrified the Democratic Party all over the country . In Maine there was a sudden conviction , on the part of the Democrats , that their party was bound to win . Gen. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that he will carry Vermont , is shared to some extent by the rank and file of the Democracy . Beguiled by this rosy vision , the Maine Democrats turned to the fusion which had been effected in their own State , only to repine at the large concession made to the Greenbackers , who had put up for Gubernatorial candidate a man who has never been a Democrat . If HANCOCK should be elected , who would deal out the Post Offices , Custom-house appointments , and official spoils ? Considerations like these moved the Democrats to mutiny against supporting a Green backer , who is a renegade Republican , for Governor . A Greenback-Democrat they might have endured . But a Greenback-Republican ? Never ! It does seem a little late for the Maine Democrats to repudiate their candidate , no matter how he was nominated . The two conventions assembled on June 1 , and PLAISTED was put in nomination by both parties . Then the Democrats were humble , diffident , and willing to accept any man put forward by their old allies , the Greenbackers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . They think that HANCOCK may be elected , and they have rashly agreed to be the tail of the Greenbackers ' kite . In sporting parlance , they demand a new deal . The upshot of all the business is that it has been agreed that the Democrats shall call another convention , that PLAISTED shall decline the Democratic nomination of June 1 , or shall withdraw , to use the convenient phrase in politics , and that the Democrats shall put up a straight-out candidate of their own . PLAISTED is to be left in the field as the Greenback candidate for Governor , but his followers are to drop him quietly and vote the Democratic ticket . This would be a fusion on the candidate for Governor , with PLAISTED 'S defeat assured . Next , the fusion on the Electoral ticket is to be assured by dividing the Electors . WEAVER intends to run an Electoral ticket in Maine , and , with his characteristic hopefulness , he is certain of a large plurality in the State . If PLAISTED surrenders the Democratic nomination , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , fusion will be yet further perfected by a division of the Electoral ticket . Maine has seven Electoral votes , four of which will be given to HANCOCK , and three to WEAVER , if the present plan of the Fusionists is carried out . MOSES W. FIELD , the leader of the Greenback forces in Michigan , lately said to a reporter that the Maine Democrats had agreed to give WEAVER four of the seven Electors , the other three being reserved for the Democrats . This is another version of the same story . It is evident that the new fusion in Maine contemplates a union on a Democratic Gubernatorial candidate of the old fusion elements , and a division of the Electoral ticket betwixt the two parties . The details of this bargain can not be fully known to anybody outside of the managers of the two parties . All this is sordid and base . But it is thoroughly in keeping with the character of the party which endeavored to steal the political machinery of the State of Maine . The Garcelon fraud was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgery , falsehood , and corruption . It was engaged in cheerfully by the men who are now dickering for the withdrawal of PLAISTED and a trade on the Electoral ticket . These men , indeed , do not hesitate to say that poor GARCELON sold them out for $8,000 when he agreed to submit to the State Supreme Court the questions which arose out of the complication caused by a fraudulent manipulation of the election returns . It was not long ago that Democrats and Greenbackers throughout the United States were hailing GARCELON as a " second Jackson ; " and now they are swift to accuse him of selling out the whole fusion concern for the specific sum of : $8,000 . There fore , the miserable GARCELON cuts no figure in the case . It was a fusion conspiracy which ruined him , and the managers hope to succeed under a new name , and with a general denial of all connection with last year 's swindle . This will not deceive the hard-headed voters of Maine . The men who are now trading for a straight-out Democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same thieves and plotters who falsified returns , forged documents , and circulated the most mendacious statements , last ' Winter , in the Garcelon interest . Their contrivances will be as a spider 's web before the march of the honest and stalwart men of Maine .
