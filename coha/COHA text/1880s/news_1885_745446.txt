txt Judge Davis , upon application of Charles Bliss , of New York , has appointed J. E. Somes , of this city , Receiver of the United Order of Foresters . The liabilities are $40,000 , of which $37,000 is from death losses . The assets are very small . The insolvency is due to loss of membership . and not to any shortage of the officers . Mr. Bliss , who is Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Foresters , said last evening that the order was first organized in this city by A. B. Caldwell under the name of the Independent Order of Foresters on the mutual insurance plan . The members were divided into three classes , with policies of from $500 to $3,000 . Instead of having a reserve fund there was an assessment upon the death of a member . The failure to establish a reserve fund Mr. Bliss believed to be the cause of the virtual dissolution of the order . At first the membership increased rapidly : lodges were established in various cities throughout the country , and soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were many respectable citizens , and the total assessments then averaged only $1 50 to $2 per month . As the order grew older , new members did ' ? not come in so rapidly , while the death rate increased . In 1881 the debt amounted to $74,000 , and was growing larger every month . It was then decided to reorganize the association on a better basis , and the name United Order of Foresters was adopted . The $74,000 due to the beneficiaries of deceased members was assumed by the new organization , and extra assessments were levied upon the members to clear the debt , but many refused to pay , and entire lodges dropped out . However , the debt was successfully wiped out , and for some time it seemed as though the order would again prosper , but people were afraid to Join , and last August there was another debt of $25,000 due to beneficiaries . The death claims for January and February of the present year alone amounted to $24,000 , while the membership had:dwindied down to 1,800 . In April the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the members and the officers came to the conclusion that it would be best to wind up the affairs of the order . The Executive Committee held a meeting in this city the latter part of last month , Mr. Bliss said , and decided to ask for the appointment of a Receiver . Many of the best members had resigned , while the bad ones remained , and this fact also determined the course of action . As J. E. Somes , the Supreme Treasurer , resided in Terre Haute , and was thoroughly acquainted with the affairs of the order , Mr. Bliss was authorized to ask for his appointment as Receiver . Mr. Somes , it was said , would make a strong appeal to the different courts of the order on behalf of the beneficiaries of deceased members , and it was thought that he would thus be enabled to pay at least 25 per cent . of the indebtedness.
