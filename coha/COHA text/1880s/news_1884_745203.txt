txt The disturbances in Ohio will reawaken general interest in the question of the respective rights of organized and unorganized labor , and at a time when there is so much sophistry and vague generalization dealt out to the working men by those who are seeking their votes it can not be amiss to refer to a few plain principles that should be clearly recognized in our country , of all others . Of these the most important is that all citizens of the United States are entitled to entire freedom of personal action that does not interfere with the rights of others . It is a direct conclusion from this principle that men engaged in any occupation have the right to accept or to refuse any terms of employment that may be offered to them . They have the right to combine for the purpose of securing better terms , either as to wages , or hours of work , or the use of machinery , or any like matter . They have the right to refuse to work where those not in union with them are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything of their employer which he is at liberty to grant . Even though their demands be unreasonable , injurious in the long run to themselves and unjust to others who are seeking employment , their right to make such demands and to enforce them by refusing to work , where no contract is broken , is clear . Their labor is their own . They are as free to sell it or refuse to sell it as a trader is to sell or keep his goods . But they have not the right , by force , direct or indirect , to interfere with others who wish to sell their labor on any terms whatever any more than traders could prevent one of their number from selling his goods at a low price ' because they . wanted a higher one . The right to sell labor freely is a common one . It can not , with safety or justice , be granted to some and denied to others . It is the basis of the trades union ; the trades unions can not refuse it to those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enforce the demands of one body of laborers and to prevent the employment of others is a wrong all around . It is not a wrong to the non-union men or to their employers alone ; it is full of the greatest danger to all men in the community , and not the least to those who are organized in trades . Their greatest safety lies in the law . The law protects their persons and their property . If it be broken down , it is the sober , industrious workmen who will suffer most . There can not be steady employment at fair wages unless there be order . If disputes are to be settled by force , capital will withdraw from the employment of labor , and there is no power on earth , organized or unorganized , that can compel its return . The State is bound by every obligation of duty and by every consideration of justice and of safety for its citizens to prevent , suppress , and punish violence . If it did not do so honest labor at living wages would become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the most cruel and the most dangerous kind of tyranny , and under tyranny it is those who depend on daily wages for support who suffer first , suffer most and suffer longest .
