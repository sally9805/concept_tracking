txt A controversy has arisen between the Auditor of Pacific Railroad Accounts and the officers of the Central Pacific Railroad , in relation to the dividends declared by the Directors of that company for the last six months . The Thurman act requires that before any dividends are paid to the stockholders of the Pacific Railroad Companies , there shall be paid into the Trdasury of the United States a sum eaual to 25 per cent . of the net earnings for the year . The report of Auditor of Pacific Railroad Accounts for the fiscal year ending June 3 , 1880 , shows that the deficit of the Central Pacific Company for that year was over $1,600,000 , atter deducting the dividend of 3 per cent . declared and paid in the period named . Since the 1st of last July the Central Pacific Company has declared two dividends of 3 per cent . each . and the question raised by the Government officers is whether provision has been made for the payment to the United States of the 25 oer cent . of net earnings required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this subject is very plain and stringent . Section 6 of the act of May 7 , 1878 , prbvides " That no dividend shall be voted , made , or paid , for or to any stockholders or shareholders , at any time when the said company shall be in default in respect of the payment of either of the sums required as aforesaid to be paid into said sinking fund , * and any officer or person who shall vote , declare , make , or pay , and any stockholder of any of said companies who shall receive any such dividend , contrary to the provisions of this act , shall be liable to the United States for the amount thereof , which , when received , shall be paid into the said sinking fund ; and every such officer , person , or stockholder who shall knowingly vote , declare , make , or pay any such dividend contrary to the provisions of this act shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor. and on : conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $10,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be seen from this provision of law that the United States teas full power to protect its interests in the event that the Central Pacific Railroad Company has declared dividends for stockholders without making full provision for the payment to the Government of the 25 per cent . of the , net earnings required by the Sinking Fund act . Auditor French , accompanied by an Assistant Attorney-General of the United States , will visit New-York tomorrow for the purpose of examining into this matter .
