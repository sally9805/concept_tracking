txt In accordance with a general expectation that the work of the Convention can not be finished in three days , the National Committee to-day passed a resolution making the tickets issued for Friday good for Saturday also . Some members of the committee are not sure that the work of the Convention will be completed this week . There are indications that the supporters of Senator Blaine are using large sums of money for the purpose of inducing delegates to cast their votes for him . One delegate , who had at all times announced his allegiance to Secretary Sherman , and who had been regarded by that candidate 's supporters as beyond the reach of argument , appeared this morning with a costly gold watch and chain and plenty of loose money . At the same time he declared that no one but Blaine could save the country , and that he should vote for him first , last , and all the time . So confident did the Blaine men become after the demonstration in Blaine 's favor in the Convention , that their leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eager for the balloting to begin , as victory was within their grasp . In the Michigan head-quarters the feeling was very intense , finding expression in the most extravagant declarations . In the long hall of the Grand Pacific , men from the New-Jersey head-quarters and from Wisconsin were gathered in a group , listening to Col. " Bob " Ingersoll , who spoke most energetically and buoyantly about the chances of Blaine . " The fight is almost over , " said he . " One ballot will demonstrate the impossibility of nominating Gen. Grant . Blaine will be chosen the candidate for President on the second ballot . " The possibility of both Grant 's and Blaine 's defeat was discussed in the head-quarters of the Western and Southern delegations as a matter of course this evening . The Indiana men are not now and never have been henchmen of Blaine . They will take " anybody except Grant , " and promise to support Grant if he is nominated . One hears the name of Edmunds suggested very frequently , and after Edmunds that of Sherman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a very wise longing among the Indiana men that some man can be selected who will surely carry Indiana and New-York . Two or three of the Sherman men from theIndiana delegation started off this afternoon on a mission to the States . Coming to the Illinois head-quarters , the spokesman , a substantial ; looking business man , addressed the 40 or 50 men who were present . He wanted them to be looking around for a candidate in case Grant and Blaine failed to secure the necessary vote to nominate . Then he added that he would vote for Blaine , as it was the determination of the Indiana delegation to do so , but that he was a Sherman man and believed Sherman was the best man to nominate . So firm was he in his opinien that he offered to bet any man in the room $1,000 that , if nominated , Sherman would carry Indiana by 25,000 majority . " Could n't Grant carry it ? " asked an Illinoisan , who sat near by . I believe he could , but I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With this reply and a cheer from all in the room for the candidate of the Convention , the meeting broke up . While visitors from distant parts of the country have been making . the greatest efforts to obtain tickets of admission from delegates from their districts , , and large numbers of prominent men have been disappointed , it seems that the immense number of tickets have . fallen into the hands of those who are mercenary . To-day the halls of the hotels and : the streets near the Convention hall werer thickly sprinkled with men who offered single ; tickets , tickets for the remaining days of the Convention , : stage tickets , or tickets for the , alternates and delegates , at prices vary- ! ing from $2 for a single admissionf to $15 for the seast5n . Among those who : offered choice places were several colored ' delegates who wore the red badge which dis- , tinguishes the friends of " Old Prosperity " : Sherman . They declared that it had cost them ; so much to come to the Convention that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not . care particularly whether they had seats in the Convention or not . Dealers in tickets at the hotels were young men with a dissipated look , who were ready to part with their treasures at very reasonable prices , considering the demand ; made for them upon the persons authorized to , distribute them . The Philadelphia Grant Club marched to the Palmer House this evening through the principal thoroughfares , preceded by a fine band , which accompanied them from their homes : and serenaded Gen. Logan and Senator Cameron . They afterward extended their march to the Grand Pacific , the band and club tramping up into the parlors of the New-York delegation , where another serenade was given to the Empire State delegates . The city is filled with rumors to-night concerning various possible combinations between supporters of the various candidates . It is stated the test vote this evening in the Convention was forced in order to show some doubters that Grant had a smaller following than had been claimed , and was the result of a conference between the Iowa delegation and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in which the Iowans promised to prove that Grant could not show a following of over 284 in the Convention , as at present organized . Logan , Conkling , and New , learning of the scheme , exerted their full strength to secure a larger vote than the one named for them by their opponents , and point to 318 as a marked victory in the preliminary skirmish . It is also reported to-night that many o f Sherman 's followers would rather see tfieir chief beaten by Grant than by any other name before the Convention , and that there have been numerous conferences of representatives from Connecticut , Massachusetts , and Ohio with the Grant managers this evening . ; , Conkling was serenaded to-night at the Grand Pacific by the Union Club of Philadelphia , and made a speech , in which he professed the utmost confidence in Grant finally being the nominee of the Convention . He based his claim on the fact that Grant had 300 votes which intended to stand by him from the first until the last ballot , while the majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any one to defeat him . He said it was saw euouzh to vase a bill through Congress to remove the Ns , tional Capitol from Washington , bull when it came to naming a place foi the new seat of Government it was found that Washington remained the capital ; so it Wal with the opposition to Grant .
