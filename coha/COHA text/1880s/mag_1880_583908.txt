AN AUGUST MORNING WITH FARRAGUT . IN the Department of the Gulf , as it was called , the year 1864 had passed with very few rays of sunshine for the Union cause . The only important military event had been the unfortunate attempt of General Banks to penetrate the Red River country to Shreveport , by the novel tactics of using his baggage-wagons as an advance guard . As a matter of course he was badly whipped , and the unhappy army wearily retraced its steps , while the soldier boys amused themselves with the refrain : " In 1864 We all skedaddled from Grand Ecore . " The incidents of the advance and of the Tetreat , especially the latter , are worthy the pen , of a " modern Froude or Macaulay , " and he will probably yet be found among some of the young , well-trained soldiers from New England , or in some Joaquin Mjller or Bret Harte who was with the lessdisciplined western men . After the army reached the Mississippi it went into permanent camp , a large portion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the department became unusually dull and quiet . The only commander who had done anything worthy of special honor in that department , at any time , was Farragut , who had passed the forts below New Orleans , captured the city , and afterward had assisted General Grant to open the Mississippi . The soldiers in the department had endured hard and dangerous service , as difficult and as deadly as that of any army in the field , but , owing to incompetent leadership , they had accomplished little in such results as would count in helping to suppress the rebellion . In important matters , like the taking of New Orleans , they had merely followed in Farragut 's wake , and garrisoned the places which the navy had captured . This , however , included nearly every southern sea-port , and , at the time in question , the only important point along the Gulf coast still held by the rebels was Mobile . It was just after the Red River failure that I was detached from my regiment and ordered on duty with the Signal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new branch of service was connected with the successful entrance into Mobile Bay . On the morning of August 3d , a steamtug left New Orleans , having on board a // dozen or more United States army signal officers and sergeants , with their detachments of two or three men each . They started with sealed orders from him who was lately known as " Old Probabilities , " the lamented General Albert J. Myer , then in New Orleans as chief signal officer on the staff of Major-General Canby , commanding the department . The orders , when opened , were found to contain instructions to rel ) ort to the fleet tinder Admiral Farragut , then blockading the entrance to Mobile Bay . The command was in charge of Major F. W. Marston , senior officer , by whom assignments were made to special service . On the morning of the 4th , the fleet was reached , the command reported to the Admiral , and was at once distributed among the vessels of the fleet , as follows Major Marston and Lieutenant Kinney to the flag-ship Hartford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lackawanna , Lieutenant Dane to the Rickmond , Lieutenant Jerome to the Bienville . Instructed non-commissioned officers were placed on the monitors and on the Lesser wooden vessels . The situation at that time was as follows : The Union fleet was riding at anchor in the Gulf : , the wooden vessels being several miles from the forts at the entrance of the harbor . Mobile Bay is shaped somewhat like a funnel , gradually widening from the city to the Gulg a distance of some thirty miles . The entrance is protected by a long , narrow arm of sand , extending from the main-land westerly , and having Fort Morgan on the extreme western point . Across the channel from Fort Morgan , and perhaps three miles distant , is Dauphin Island , a narrow strip of sand having Fort Gaines on its eastern end , directly opl ) osite Morgan . A little further to the west is Shell Island , upon which stood little Fort Powell , commanding a narrow channel through which light draught vessels could enter the bay . A short distance out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in front of the main entrance to the bay , is Sand Island , a barren slot , under the lee of which three of our monitors were lying . At the rear of Fort Gaines , General Granger had effected a landing , and had begun the work of laying siege to the fort . The army signal officers were sent on board the fleet , not with any intention of having their services used in passing the forts , but in order to establish communication afterward between the fleet and the army , for the purpose of co-operating in the capture of the forts . The primary objects of Admiral Farragut in entering the bay were , the moral effect of a victory , the complete closing of Mobile to the outside world , and the capture or destruction of the Tennessee he also wished to cut off all possible means of escape from the garrisons of the forts ; and to give his fleet , which had been tossed on the uneasy waters of the Gulf for many months , a safe and quiet anchorage . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was safe . by reason of a solid row of piles and torpedoes across the river , three miles from the city . Moreover , the larger vessels of the fleet could not approach within a dozen miles of the city , on account of shallow water . But the lower bay offered a charming resting-place for the fleet , with the additional attraction of plenty of fish and oysters , and an occasional chance to forage on shore . It was the good fortune of the writer to be assigned to duty on the flag-ship , and his story will necessarily be chiefly of his own personal observations and experiences . On the afternoon of the day of our arrival , Admiral Farragut , with the commanding officers of the different vessels , made a reconnaissance on the steam-tender Gows/z* , running inside of Sand Island , where the monitors were anchored , and near enough to get a good view of both forts . On the left , some two miles distant , was Fort Gaines , a small brick and earth work , mounting a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ channel to cause much uneasiness to the fleet . Fort Morgan was on the right , one of the strongest of the old stone forts , and greatly strengthened by immense piles of sand-bags , covering every portion of the exposed front . The fort was well equipped with three tiers of heavy guns , some of them of the best English make , imported by the Confederates . In addition , there was in front a battery of eleven powerful guns , at the water 's edge on the beach . All the guns , of both fort and water-battery , were within point-blank range of the only channel through which the fleet could pass . The rebels considered the works impregnable , but they did not depend solely upon them . Just around the point of lend , behi ; *d Fort Morgan , we could see that afternoon three saucy-I ookin g gun-b oats and the famous ram Tennessee . The latter was then considered the strongest and most powerful iron-clad ever put afloat ; looking like a great turtle , with sloping sides covered // with iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and having a formidable iron beak projecting under the water . Her armament consisted of six heavy guns of English make , sending a solid shot weighing one hundred and ten poundsa small affair compared with the heavy guns of the present time , but irresistible then against everything but the turrets of the monitors . In addition to these means of resistance , the narrow channel in front of the fort had been lined with torpedoes . These were under the water , anchored to the bottom , and were chiefly in the shape of beer-kegs filled with powder , from the sides of which projected numerous little tubes containing fulminate , which it was expected would be exploded by contact with the passing vessels . Except for what Farragut had already accomplished on the Mississippi , it would have been considered a fool-hardy experiment for wooden vessels to attempt to pass so close to one of the strongest forts on the coast ; but when to the forts were added the knowledge of the strength of the ram and the supposed deadly character of the torpedoes , it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his first glimpse of naval warfare as decidedly hazardous and unpleasant . So daring an attempt was never made in any country but this , and was never successfully made by any commander except Farragut , who , in this , as in his previous exploits in passing the forts of the Mississippi , proved himself the greatest naval commander the world has ever seen . It was the confidence reposed in him , the recollection that he had never failed in any of his attempts , and his manifest faith in the success of the projected movement , that inspired all around him . The scene on the Cowsbjp that afternoon was a notable one , as she steamed along within range of the rebel forts . The central figure was the grand old Admiral , his plans all completed , affable and jolly with all , evidently not thinking of failure as among the possibilities of the morrow , and filling every one with his enthusiasm . He was sixty-three years old , of medium height , stoutly built , with a finely proportioned head and smoothly shaven face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and invincible determination , and with eyes that in repose were full of sweetness and light , but , on emergency , could flash fire and fury . Next in prominence to the Admiral was the tall , commanding form of Fleet-Captain Percival Drayton , the man of all men to be Farragut 's chief-of-staff ; gentlemanly and courteous to all , but thoughtful and reserved , a man of marked intellect and power , in whose death , a few years later , our navy lost one of its very brightest stars , and the cause of liberty and human rights a most devoted friend . When the State of South Carolina comes into full possession of its reason as a member of the Union , as it will some day , it will honor the memory of Percival Drayton as one of its most illustrious sons . While he was always proud of his distinguished ancestry , he was a true patriot , who , in his love for his country , recognized no State lines and was swerved by no ties of kinship . There were also the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his character ; Marchand , of excellent fighting memory ; Stevens , fond of Shakspere and with a Shaksperian fondness for good things as well as for hard knocks ; Mullany , soon to be robbed of an arm ; Le Roy , Donaldson , Nicholson , Greene , and the younger but no less impetuous Jouett , Gherardi , McCann , Perkins and Watson . As we steamed slowly along inside Sand Island , inspecting every hostile point , a rebel transport landed at Fort Gaines , and began discharging cargo . At a signal from the Admiral , one of the monitors , by way of practice , opened fire at long range , and , as the huge fifteen-inch shell dropped uncomfortably near , the work of unloading was stopped , and the transport suddenly leftthe last rebel transport that ever crossed the bay . After completing the reconnaissance , and reviewing the monitors , the party retired to the flag-ship , where the final council of war was held . This was only noteworthy from the fact that it was here that Admiral Farragut was over-persuaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave up his original determination of taking the lead . This was very much against his own judgment , and the events of the next day proved that he was right . The Brooklyn , Captain Alden , was selected to lead , she being provided with an extemporized torpedo-catcher , projecting from her bow . The Admiral , in his official report , referred to the decision of the council , which was given because it was thought the flag-ship ought not to be too much exposed . He says : " This I believe to be an error ; for , apart from the fact that exposure is one of the penalties of rank // in the navy , it will always be the aim of the enemy to destroy the flag-ship , and such attempt was very persistently made , but Providence did not permit it to be successful . " After the council , and just before sunset , the Richmond , Captain Jenkins , arrived from Pensacola , escorting the ill-fated monitor Tecumseh , Captain Craven , arriving last at the field to be the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been issued . Every commanding officer knew his duty , and unusual quiet prevailed in the fleet . The waters of the Gulf rested , for a time , from their customary tumult , a gentle breeze relieved the midsummer heat , and the evening closed upon us as peacefully as if we had been on board a yachting squadron at Newport . During the early part of the night , the stillness was almost oppressive . The officers of the Hartford gathered around the capacious ward-room table , writing what they knew might be their last letters to loved ones far away , or giving to friends messages and instructions in case of death . There were no signs of fear , but , like brave and intelligent men , they recognized the stern possibilities of the morrow and acted accordingly . But this occupied but little time , and then , business over , there followed an hour of unrestrained jollity . Many an old story was retold and ancient conundrum repeated . Old officers forgot , for the moment , their customary dignity , and it was evident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coming struggle . Captain Heywood , of the marines , proposed a final " walk-around " ; Tyson solemnly requested information as to " Which would you rather do or go by Fort Morgan ? " and all agreed they would prefer to " do . " LaRue Adams repeated the benediction with which the French instructor at the naval academy was wont to greet his boys , as they were going into examination : " Vell , fellows , I hope ye vill do as yell as I hope ye vill do . " Finally Chief Engineer Williamson suggested an adjournment to the forecastle , for a last smoke , and the smoking club went forward ; but , somehow , smoke had lost its customary flavor , and , after a few whiffs , all hands turned in , to enjoy what sleep would come . The gray glimmer of dawn was just beginning to struggle through a dense fog when we were roused , at three o'clock next morning , and the work of forming line was begun . A hasty lunch of sandwiches and coffee was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bay at the regular hour . The precautions necessary for maneuvering through the fog made an unavoidable delay , for it was the Admiral 's intention to have the fleet close to the fort before sunrise . It was a weird sight as the big ships " balanced to partners , " the dim outlines slowly emerging like phantoms in the fog . The vessels were lashed together in pairs , fastened side by side by huge cables ; the Brooklyn and Octorora leading , the flag-ship Hartford and the Metacomet following . The remaining vessels were paired as follows , the one named first in each instance being on the starboard and most exposed side : - Rich ; nond and Port Royal ; Lackawanna and Seminole ; Monongahela and Kennebec ; Oss*ee and Itasca ; Oneida and Galena . All the vessels had been stripped for the fight , the top-hamper being left at Pensacola , and the starboard boats being either left behind or towed on the port side . The Admiral 's steam launch , the Loyal , named after his son , steamed alongside the flag-ship on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wooden vessels , there were four monitors , the Tecumseh and Manhattan , single turreted , with two fifteen-inch guns each ; the Winnebago and Chichasaw , of lighter draught , with double turrets , and with eleven-inch guns . The monitors , being very slow-gaited , were started in advance , the intention being to have them on the right flank of the line , in front , to partially shield the fleet from fort and ram . It was fifteen minutes of six o'clock before the whole fleet got under way , and it was just one hour later when the first gun was fired . About sunrise , while the line was being formed , a light breeze sprang up and scattered the fog , leaving us a bright and beautiful day , which on land must have been extremely hot . Indeed , it was found uncomfortably warm at sea before breakfast was served . The fleet presented a magnificent sight as the stately ships moved on , each with the stars and stripes flying from every mast-head , and the men gathered at their guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story of the fight as witnessed by himself , he has to refer here to an interval of twenty minutes , just as the fight opened , during which he was absent from the deck . On the previous night the Admiral had issued orders that the army signal officers were not to be allowed on deck during the fight , // but were to go into the cock-pit on the lower deck and assist the surgeons . The reason assigned was that these officers would not be needed during the passage of the forts , but would be wanted afterward to open communication with the army , and that therefore it would be a misfortune to have any of them disabled . The two officers on the Hartford disrelished this order exceedingly , and , after consulting together , decided that in the confusion of the occasion their presence on deck would probably not be noticed , and that they would evade the command if possible . In this they were successful until shortly before passing Sand Island and coming within range of Fort Morgan . Then the lynx-eyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterward discovered , never allowed anything to escape his attention , came to them very quietly and politely , and told them the Admiral 's order must be obeyed . XVe were satisfied from his manner that the surgeons had need of us , and , without endeavoring to argue the matter , made our way to the stifling hold , where Surgeon Lansdale and Assistant-Surgeon Commons , with their helpers , were quietly sitting , with their implements , bandages , and other paraphernalia spread out ready for use . Nearly every man had his watch in his hand and waited for the first shot . To us , ignorant of everything going on above , every minute seemed an hour , and there was a feeling of great relief when the boom of the first gun was heard . This was from the monitor Tecumseh , at forty-seven minutes past six o'clock . Presently one or two of our forward guns opened , and we could hear the distant sound of the guns of the fort in reply . Soon the cannon-balls began to crash through the deck above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of twelve Dahlgren guns kept the vessel in a quiver . But as yet no wounded were sent down , and we knew we were still at comparatively long range . In the intense excitement of the occasion it seemed that hours had passed , but it was just twenty minutes from the time we went below , when an officer shouted down the hatchway : " Send up an army signal officer immediately : the Brooklyn is signaling . " In a moment the writer was on deck , where he found the situation as follows : The Brooklyn , directly in front of us , had stopped , and was backing and signaling ; the tide was with us , setting strongly through the channel , and the stopping of the Brooklyn threatened to bring the whole fleet into collis ion and confusion ; the advance vessels of the line were trying to back to prevent a catastrophe , but were apparently not able to overcome the force of the current , and there was danger not only of collision , but of being drifted on shore . Meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the fort and for the four rebel vessels , all of which were doing their utmost , giving us a terrible raking , making ci7uel havoc among the men , and ugly holes in the sides of the ships . Running to the forecastle , I took the message of Captain Alden of the Brooklyn , which was : " The monitors are right ahead ; we can not go on without passing them . " Transmitting the message to the Admiral by an aid , he replied at once : " Order the monitors ahead , and go on . " As the message was sent , the starboard bow-gun of the Hartford  --  a one-hundred-pound Parrott rifle , in charge of Ensign Whiting-opened fire on the ram Tennessee , and the great volume of smoke following each discharge hid the Brooklyn from view , and made it impossible to receive or transmit messages from that part of the ship , while the smoke from the other guns made it equally difficult from any other part of the deck . What the writer ought to have done , probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silenced until the signaling was over , but this did not occur to him at the time . Instead , as the smoke hung low in the air , he thought it best to try and get above it , and accordingly ran up the rigging to the foretop . But the Hartford had a howitzer in her foretop , which was hard at work , under the management of half a dozen sailors , throwing grape and canister into the waterbattery in front of the fort , and making it as difficult to signal here as it was on deck . So , not knowing what else to do , the officer kept on up the rigging to the top-gallant cross-trees , where there was just room to sit , holding on with the left arm around the peak of the top-mast . From this point , above all smoke , the scene was indescribably grand and terrific . The fight was at its hottest . The Union fleet had reached the line , the crossing of which meant victory , and the result depended on the next few minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all , the monitor Tecumsek , a few hundred yards in the advance , seemed to stagger for a moment , then suddenly careened , and almost instantly disappeared beneath the water , carrying with her her noble commander , Captain // Craven , and one hundred and twenty officers and men , hopelessly imprisoned in their iron coffin . It has always been believed that she was sunk by a torpedo , although the rebels claimed that a shot from one of their heavy guns penetrated her armor at the water 's edge and caused the disaster ; the suddenness of her disappearance , however , can hardly be accounted for , except as the result of a torpedo explosion . The pilot leaped from the pilothouse , and some half-dozen men in the turret managed to jump through the ports , and were drawn down into the whirlpool made by the sinking ship . They were rescued by a cutter from the Metacornet . This boat , flying the Union flag , put out in charge of a little ensign ( now LieutenantCommander Nields ) , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up under the guns of the fort , coolly picked up the drowning men , and rowed back to the lee of one of the following ships . It seems , perhaps , an incident of little moment now , but in that day of brave deeds it was not excelled as an act of conspicuous individual bravery in obedience to orders . During all this time the Brooklyn had failed to move ahead , and now she delayed to signal back the fact already too well known : " Our best monitor is sunk . " The message was sent to the admiral by an aid , Lieutenant Yates , and the brief answer was returned , " Go on ! " But still , for some mysterious reason , perhaps fear of the torpedoes , perhaps misapprehension of orders , the Brookyn halted , and the delay was every instant more threatening and dangerous . It was the decisive moment of the day . Owing to our position , only our few bowguns could be used , while a deadly rain of shot and shell was falling on us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unable to make reply . The sight on the deck of the liar/ford was sickening beyond the power of words to portray . Shot after shot came through the side , mowing down the men , deluging the decks with blood , and scattering mangled fragments of humanity so thickly that it was difficult to stand on the deck , so slippery was it . The old expressions of the " scuppers running blood , " " the slippery deck , " etc. , give but the faintest idea of the spectacle on the Hartford . The bodies of the dead were placed in a long row on the port side , while the wounded were sent below until the surgeons ' quarters would hold no more . A solid shot coming through the bow struck a gunner on the neck , completely severing head from body . One poor fellow ( afterward an object of interest at the great Sanitary Commission fair in New York ) lost both legs by a cannon ball ; as he fell he threw up both arms , just in time to have them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all the crew on one side were swept down by a shot which came crashing through the bulwarks . A shell burst between the two forward guns , in charge of Lieutenant Tyson , killing and wounding fifteen men . The mast upon which the writer was perched was twice struck , once slightly , and again just below the foretop by a 120-pound shell , from a Blakely rifle on the rebel gunboat Selma . Fortunately the shell , which was about two feet long by eight inches in diameter , came tumbling end over end , and buried itself in the mast butt-end first , leaving the percussion-cap protruding . Had it come point first , or had it struck at any other part of the mast than in the re-enforced portion where the heel of the top-mast laps the top of the lower mast , this contribution to the literature of the war would probably have been lost to the world , as the distance to the deck was some one hundred feet . As it was , the sudden jar would have dislodged any one from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time it left the Sebna , thus giving time to prepare for it by an extra grip around the top of the mast . Looking out over the water , it was easy to trace the course of every shot , both from the guns of the Hartford and from the rebel fleet . Meanwhile , the men were working the guns that could be used , as though the sight and smell of blood had sharpened their appetites . There was no skulking ; in fact , there was no chance to skulk , if there had been such a disposition . They stood to their work , white and black side by side . There was no thought of social differences then ; and whenever a shot was believed to have been well placed , the cheers of the men rang out above the roar of the guns . As our poet laureate , the Admiral 's secretary , Harry Howard Brownell , of Hartford , sang of the fight , in the most grajThic and truthful description ever written of it : " Never a nerve that failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gloom or pallor . There was bold Kentucky grit , And the old Virginian valor And the daring Yankee wit . * * * * * * // There were black orbs from the palmy Niger , But there , alongside the cannon , Each man fought like a tiger . One only doubt was ours , Only one fear we knew : Could the day that dawned so well Go down for the darker powers ? Would the fleet get through ? " And ever the shot and shell Came with the howl of hell The splinter-clouds rose and ' fell , And the long line of corpses grew . Would the fleet go through ? " Happily for the fleet and for the country , there was a man in command that day equal to the emergency  --  a man whose eagle eye grasped every detail of the fight , while he possessed the skill to direct and the nerve and ability to execute . There was no time for doubt or delay . Had he hesitated , the fortune of the day must have been against us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the main-top ,  --  .  --  a position above the smoke , from which he could take in the whole situation , and could commumcate with the pilot in the main-top , and with the fleet-captain and executive officer on the deck beneath . For several years , there has been a discussion in the papers and magazines of the country as to the Admiral 's being " lashed to the rigging . " The writer has no light to throw on the subject . Farragut was standing in the shrouds , as described , when the writer went on deck , and he remained there until the Hartford had passed beyond the range of the fort ; but there were not more than two or three persons on board who knew anything about his being fastened in place . The first heard of it in the fleet was some three or four weeks after the fight , when the New York papers were received . Various rumors have been circulated as to the fact , one of which was that the Admiral took a rope's-end with him when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his falling on deck in case of accident . This is the story which was current on shipboard at that time , and was generally believed . Since the incident has been under discussion in the papers the " real facts " in the case have been made known , and will stand in history on the unquestioned authority of Fleet-Captain Drayton and of Flag-Lieutenant J. Crittenden Watson , of the Admiral 's staff . This is to the effect that Captain Drayton , seeing the Admiral in the rigging , and fearing he might be killed by a fall on deck in case he were wounded , ordered an old quartermaster to take a rope's-end and secure it around him , so that he would be prevented from falling . The writer is disposed to believe that the Admiral was so absorbed in watching the fight that he did not know at the moment the l ) recautions taken for his safety by his fleet-captain . But whatever doubt may attach to this particular incident , - of which so much has since been made , while so little was thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for doubt as to the Admiral 's action . Finding that the Brooklyn did not start ahead , he hurriedly inquired of pilot Freeman , in the main-top , if there was depth enough for the Hartford to pass to the left of the vessels in front . Receiving an affirmative reply , he said , " I will take the lead , " and immediately ordered the ship " ahead fast . " On board a war steamer the engines are directed by the tap of a bell , the wires connected with which lead to the quarter-deck . One stroke of the bell means " g&amp; ahead ' * two , " stop " ; three , " back " ; and four , " go ahead as fast as possible . " Leaning down through the shrouds to the officer on deck at the bell-pull , the Admiral shouted , " Four bells , e*4lit bells , SIXTEEN BELLS ! Give her all the steam you 've got . " The order was instantly transmitted , and the old ship seemed imbued with the Admiral 's spirit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regardless of fort , ram , gunboats , and the unseen foe beneath , dashed ahead , all alone , save for her gallant consort , the Metacomet . As we ran clear of the fleet , we became the target for the rebel vessels which were lying across the channel in front . We were moving over what is called the middle ground , with shallow water on each side , so that it was impossible to maneuver the ship from right to left , for fear of running aground . Taking advantage of the situation , the rebel gun-boat Selma kept directly in front of us , where , in consequence of our projecting bow and our inability to turn , it was impossible to bring a single gun to bear on her , while she raked us , fore and aft , with terrible effect , doing , in reality , more damage than the rest of the rebel fleet . The two other gun-boats , the Gaines and the Morgan , were on our starboard bow , fighting in rather a timid manner ; while the ram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amidships . At the same time , the water-battery and a portion of the guns of the fort had a fine chance at our side . To quote again from Brownell : " Trust me , our berth was hot ! Ah , wickedly well they shot ! // How their death-bolts howled and stung ! And the water-batteries played , With their deadly cannonade , Till the air around us rung . So the battle raged and roared . " We were now at the second period of the fight , when success seemed trembling in the scales . The Hartford and her mate had reached about a mile beyond the fort and the same distance in advance of most of the fleet , which were still under the guns of the fort . Had the ram kept on , it could have hardly failed to sink us , as our shot glanced harmlessly from its side , and we were unable , on account of the narrow channel , to move out of its way . But , for some reason , the rebel admiral changed his course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water between us was too shallow , or perhaps he thought us an easy prey for his leisure , and considered it more important to prevent other vessels from getting inside . Whatever the reason , his course was changed , and we were safe . Our greatest annoyance now was from the three rebel gun-boats , particularly from the Se/ma , which was handled with great ability . Three times Captain Jouett , commanding our light-draught consort , the Afetacomet , the fastest vessel in the fleet , requested permission from the Admiral to leave us and tackle the Se/ma , but the Admiral replied " Wait a little longer . " But finally we emerged from the narrow channel into the deep water of the bay , and then the desired order was given . Already men had been stationed with sharp axes , ready to cut the cables which bound the two ships together , and the Admiral had hardly waved his hand to Captain Jouett before the ropes were severed , and , as the crew gave three hearty cheers , the Ak/acomet darted forward after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but endeavored to escape up the bay . A brisk chase ensued , but the Metacomet was too much for her adversary , and , when one of her shots wounded the captain and killed the first lieutenant , a speedy surrender followed , and in half an hour Jouett returned with the saucy little rebel in tow . Meantime , the guns of the Hartford had crippled the Gaines , and she was run aground near Fort Morgan , deserted , and set on fire . The other gun-boat , the Morgan , which had kept at a safe distance during the fight , retreated under the guns of Fort Morgan . And the great ram , after making an unsuccessful effort to sink or injure any of the Union vessels , and after receiving a heavier blow from the Monongaliela than it had inflicted , also retired to the fort . The other vessels of the fleet , each with its own special record of bravery , followed the Hartford past the fort and joined us in the bay . The roar of the battle was now over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made to give the hungry men some breakfast . Those of us who had been perched aloft came down on deck , and , as if by a general understanding , the officers of the Hartford who could be spared from immediate duty hastened to the ward-room to ascertain how it had fared with their messmates . One , Ensign Heginbotham , of the Admiral 's staff , was mortally wounded . Lieutenant Adams was slightly wounded ; all the rest had escaped unhurt . Of the crew , nineteen mangled bodies were lying in a ghastly row on the port side of the deck , and some thirty wounded were being cared for below . The first thought was of wonder and thankfulness that of the eighteen officers of the ward-room but one was fatally hurt . Each had a story of marvelous escapes to tell , and there was a general and hearty hand-shaking , as after a long separation . We were just beginning to feel the reaction following such a season of extreme peril and excitement , when we were brought to our senses by the sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to quarters , and a messenger-boy hurried down to us with the word , " The ram is coming . " Every man hastened to his post , the writer to the quarter-deck , where the Admiral and fleet-captain , were standing . The cause of the new excitement was evident at once . The Tennessee , as if ashamed of her failure , had left the fort and was making at full speed directly for the Hartford , being then perhaps a mile and a half distant . The spectacle was a grand one , and was viewed by the rebel soldiers in both forts , who were now out of range of our guns and lined the walls . Few audiences have ever witnessed so imposing a sight . The great ram came on for a single-handed contest with the fleet . She was believed to be invulnerable , and had powerful double engines by which she could be easily handled , while our monitors were so slowgaited that they were unable to offer any serious obstacle to her approach . Farragut himself seemed to place his chief dependence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers who watched the fight expected to see the Tennessee sink the Yankee vessels in detail , and the chances // 207 seemed all in. its favor . The Admiral wished to order the whole fleet to attack the ram , but to do this by the cumbrous naval code of signaling would occupy some moments of valuable time . It would be necessary first to send up to the mizzen-peak a signal-flag calling the attention of the fleet , and when this was answered ( by each vessel sending up and hauling down a flag ) , a set of signals followed , each flag representing an arbitrary number , the meaning of which was ascertained by consulting the signal-book . The army signal service , on the contrary , consists in telegraphing by motions of a flag to the right and left , and is as ral ) id and instantaneous as sight , or the electric telegraph . So , while the quartermaster was preparing to send up the flags for the general order , the Admiral desired me to use the army code in starting the fastest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seconds as the other method did minutes , with the advantage of saying precisely what was wanted . For example , the Admiral said : " Order Captain Strong , of the Afononga he/a , to run down the ram . " The nearest approach to the message by naval signal would have been a special one , prepared and entered in the signal books for this occasion , namely : " Destroy the enemy 's principal vessel by running her down " ; which would have required precious moments to transmit and translate . The Mionongahela was lying , with all steam up , on our port quarter , perhaps an eighth of a mile distant . Facing toward her , I made the letter " M , " her call , which was instantly responded to by the signal officer on board , for every eye in the fleet was on the flag-ship , waiting for instructions . To send the message : " Capt . S .. - Run down ram. - Ad . F. , " took less than twenty seconds , and before the signal officer had finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward , not waiting to raise her anchor , but slipping her cable . The same message followed to Captain Marchand , of the Lackawanna , and to the monitor . Meanwhile , the general signal , " Attack the enemy , " had gone up to the peak of the Hartford , and there followed a general slipping of cables and a friendly rivalry to see which could quickest meet the foe . The Monongakela , with her artificial iron prow , was bravely in the lead , and struck the rebel craft amidships at full speed , doing no damage to the ram , but having her own iron prow destroyed and being otherwise injured . Next came the Lackawanna , with a like result . The huge iron frame of the Tennessee scarcely felt the shock , while the wooden bow of the Union ship was badly demoralized . For an instant , the two vessels swung head and stem alongside of each other . In his official report , Captain Marchand naively remarks : " A few of the enemy were seen through their ports , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them with muskets ; even a spittoon and a holystone were thrown at them from our deck , which drove them away . " The Tennessee fired two shots through her bow , and then kept on for the Hartford . The two flag-ships approached each other bow to bow . The two admirals , Farragut and Buchanan , had entered our navy together as boys , and up to the outbreak of the war had been warm friends. * But now each was hoping for the overthrow of the other , and had Buchanan possessed the grit of Farragut , it is probable that moment would have witnessed the destruction of both vessels . For had the ram struck us square , as it came , bows on , it would have plowed its way half through the Hartford , and , as we sank , we should have carried it to the bottom , unable to extricate itself . But the rebel admiral was not desirous of so much glory , and , just as the two vessels were meeting , the course of the Tennessee was slightly changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the port bow , which left us uninjured , while the two vessels grated past each other . He tried to sink us with a broadside as he went by , but only one of his guns went off , the primers in all the others failing . That gun sent a * In a letter to the Hon. Gideon Welles , Secretary of the Navy , acknowledging the receipt of the official thanks of the Department and of the Government for the success at Mobile Bay , Farragut writes of Buchanan : " He , though a rebel and traitor to the government that had raised and educated him , had always been considered one of its ablest officers , and no one knew him better or appreciated his capacity more highly than myself , and , I may add , felt more proud of overcoming him in such a contest , if for no other reason than to prove to the world that ramming and sinking a helpless frigate at her anchor is a very different affair from ramming steamers when handled by officers of good capacity . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command of the guard for the captured Tennessee was Captain Heywood , of the marine corps , who was one of the survivors of the frigate Cumberiand , sunk by Buchanan in Hampton Roads .

The muzzle of the gun was so close that the powder blackened the ship 's side . The Hartford gave the ram a salute from ten heavy guns , each loaded with thirteen pounds of powder and a solid shot , but the balls merely dented her side and bounded into the air . The scene on the Hartford during the moment of contact was of intense excitement . The Admiral coolly stood on the port quarter-rail , holding to the mizzen rigging , from which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deck of the ram . Flag-Lieutenant Watson , seeing him in this exposed position , secured him to the rigging by a rope's-end with his own hands ; so that during the day he was twice " lashed to the rigging . " As the ships came together , Captain Drayton ran to the bow of the Hartford , and , as the ram sheered off to avoid striking a square blow , he shook his lorgnette at it , and exclaimed , " The cowardly rascal ; he 's afraid of a wooden ship ! " The Tennessee now became the target for the whole fleet , all the vessels of which were making toward it , pounding it with shot , and trying to run it down . As the Hartford turned to make for it again , we ran in front of the Lackawanna , which had already turned and was moving under full headway with the same object . She struck us on our starboard side , amidships , crushing half-way through , knocking two port-holes into one , upsetting two Dahlgren guns , and creating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we must sink , and the cry rang out over the deck : " Save the Admiral ! save the Admiral ! " The port boats were ordered lowered , and in their haste some of the sailors cut the " falls " and two of the cutters dropped into the water wrong side up , and floated astern . But the Admiral , nearly as cool as ever , sprang into the starboard mizzen-rigging , looked over the side of the ship , and , finding there was still a few inches to spare above the water 's edge , instantly ordered the ship ahead again at full speed , after the ram . The unfortunate Lackawanna , which had struck the ram a second blow , was making fdr her once more , and , singularly enough , again came up on our starboard side , and another collision seemed imminent . And now the Admiral became a trifle excited . He had no idea of whipping the rebels to be himself sunk by a friend . " Can . you say , For God 's sake ' by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " was the reply . " Then say to the Lackawanna , For God 's sake get out of our way and anchor ! " ' In my haste to send the message , I brought the end of my signal flag-staff down with considerable violence upon the head of the Admiral , who was standing nearer than I thought , causing him to wince perceptibly , but I could not apologize until I finished signaling . It was a hasty message , for the fault was as much with the Hartford as with the Lackawanna , each being too eager to reach the enemy , and it turned out all right , by a fortunate accident , that Captain Marchand never received it . The army signal officer on the Lackawanna , Lieutenant Myron Adams ( now pastor of Plymouth Congregational Church , in Rochester , N. Y. ) , had taken his station in the foretop , and , just as he received the first five words , the wind flirted the large United States flag at the mast-head around him , so that he was unable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found himself a target for the muskets of the ma* rines on the ram , he concluded that the message was a personal one , directing him to " get out " of the top , and acted accordingly . The remainder of the story is soon told . The ram was unable to strike a single one of the Union vessels , while the concentration of fire upon it tore away everything except the solid iron . First , the rebel flagstaff fell ; then the smoke-stack was shot away , and finally a well-placed shot from the monitor Chickasaw broke the rudderchain , so that the great ram would no longer mind the helm , and she lay like a huge monster at bay . Already a fifteen-inch solid Thot from the Manhattan had crushed through the iron armor and let the daylight into her , and finally a shell exploded in one of her port-holes , and a fragment seriously wounded the rebel admiral . And then , up through the iron grating of her deck came a staff , bearing a white flag . The firing ceased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rang out such cheers as are seldom heard and never forgotten-cheers which meant victory after a hard and very doubtful struggle . And , as the cheering ceased , a dim echo seem to come from below , where the wounded and dying , knowing the day was at last won , joined in the shouts of triumph , rejoiced that their sacrifice would not be in vain . So ended the fight .
