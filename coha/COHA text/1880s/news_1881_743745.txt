At the hour of meeting , only a few members had heard the news . In his opening prayer , the clergyman officiating as chaplain referred to the death of a member , and it was immediately surmised to whom the reference was made . When Speaker Sharpe addressed the House , it was in a voice broken with emotion . He felt that only one thought oppressed them all , and that , feeling as they did , it would be best to make no delay in hearing read the telegram , which he passed to Clerk Johnson . The Clerk read a dispatch , dated Malone and addressed to the Speaker , setting forth that the Hon. William D. Brennan had dropped dead this afternoon near Ayer 's Hotel , in Duane , while on a trip to the woods , hoping to benefit his health . After the reading of this dispatch Mr. Chickering , of Lewis , offered the following resolution : Resolved , That a committee of five be appointed by the Speaker to draft appropriate resolutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that , after the appointment of the committee . this house do immediately adjourn .

A month later he was made First Lieutenant of Company D , and in April , 1864 , was promoted Captain of Company A. On Sept. 29 , 1864. he took part with his regiment in a very severe action at Chapin 's Farm , Va . The officers of the One Hundred and Forty-second had nearly all been disabled , and , under orders to dislodge a line of skirmishers , Capt . Brennan found himself at the head of a mere handful of men , with an open field in his front , a patch of wood beyond , and a fence to be scaled before the hopeless dash across the intervening space could be made . Calling upon his men to follow him , he attempted to cross the fence , when a perfect rain of bullets fell about him , and he felt a twinge in his foot . Turning to look for his men he saw them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rapid flow of blood , he limped away to a stump , to find his foot so shattered by a ball that he could put his hand through the wound . A negro soldier , who was running by , consented to carry Capt . Brennan on his back if the captain would carry his gun . He took the wounded officer to the rear , whore it was found necessary to amputate his leg above the ankle . joint In May , 1865. he was mustered out of the service , and in 1866 was , by President Johnson , made Major by brevet for bravery and gallantry in tine service .

He was last Fall chosen for the third time by a large majority . He exerted himself greatly during the Presidential campaign ,  --  and complained during the Speakership and Senatorial canvasses that he had not regained his health . About a fortnight ago , when he had endeavored without success to recover his health by enforced rest , he felt compelled to ask for a vacation in order that he might get the needed relief at home . Leaving here , badly shattered mentally and physically , it was hoped by his friends , that he would be able to return before the end of the session . Instead of improving , he has steadily become worse . No doubt his ill-health was intensified by the feeling of responsibility weighing upon him as Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee . He went home , and it was only to-day that a letter reached here saying that he had improved and might return next week , and that lie would soon again be at hand with the harness on .. This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brennan was a careful , honest , industrious , patriotic citizen and legislator , doing his duty in all things with all his might . His qualities of head and heart had endeared him to hosts of friends in and out of the Assembly , and his death will be deeply regretted by every one to whom be was known in private or public life . Mr. Chickering , who was recently made Chairman pro tempore of the Ways and Means Committee , will probablyabe selected permanently for the place .
