txt Louis P. HAVER , the impudent rascal whose blackmailing operations were exposed by THE TIMES last year , has finally been brought to trial and convicted . His system of operating was exceedingly simple . He was the proprietor of a paper called Thompson 's Bank Note and Commercial Reporter . A sample copy of this he would send to banks and private bankers throughout the country , and he would follow up this proceeding by sending a demand for a year 's subscription to the institutions and persons so afflicted . In case of a refusal to comply with the demand for money HAVER would keep on sending letters , mainly threatening in their character , to the victims he had selected . Combined with this plan was a scheme for obtaining advertisements from banks and bankers . ? To those who agreed to pay his terms he offered the privilege of seeing their names in print in the Reporter as among the " solvent bankers . " Those who refused to comply with his demands he vaguely threatened with the direst consequences . Many banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not even deign a reply . Others denounced him vigorously . There were , however , a sufficient number who were foolish enough to be threatened or cajoled into paying the small sums demanded . These small sums were sufficient in the aggregate to enable HAVER to keep a large office force constantly engaged and to net between $10,000 and $15,000 per year in profits . HAVER was engaged in this business for years . At last some bankers , seeing no other way out of their difficulty , appealed to THE TIMES for aid . A thorough investigation was at once instituted , and HAVER himself was asked to explain the circumstances if he could . When confronted by the evidence HAVER tried to be brazen , and he defied any attempt to interfere with his nefarious pursuit . THE TIMES thereupon printed the facts of the fellow 's rascality , and gave in detail circumstances showing the kind of business in which he *was engaged . Samples of the kind of letters he was sending to various parts of the country were printed and a wholesome public opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first indictments were quashed because of a technicality , and the rascal , emboldened by his apparent success at fighting the law , grew still more audacious . His continued operations were again brought to public notice by THE TIMES and he was again indicted . Two indictments were found by the Grand Jury in December last , and since that time HAVER 'S efforts were all directed to obtaining delays . All the while he was openly boasting that he would get the best of the law . So confident , in fact , was he that he did not cease his operations even up to the beginning of his trial . HAVER was defended by able ' counsel , who took pains to see that he was not a witness on his own behalf . Their efforts were in vain , and the jury yesterday after a brief deliberation returned a verdict adjudging him guilty of a misdemeanor in sending a threatening letter . Another indictment still remains to be tried , and many more might be obtained were it necessary . His counsel , relying on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verdict and this will be argued on Monday . No matter what the result of this application may be , the conviction of this very impudent rascal is a great boon . It ought to put a stop to his operations and it doubtless will . If the verdict remains , HAVER will stand a very good chance of going to the penitentiary for a year and of paying a fine of $500 . His punishment has certainly been most richly deserved .
