ON HORSEBACK . II . CRANBERRY FORGE is the first wedge of civilization fairly driven into the northwest mountains of North Carolina . A narrow-guage railway , starting from Johnson City , follows up the narrow gorge of the Doe River and pushes into the heart of the iron mines at Cranberry , where there is a blast furnace , and where a big company store , rows of tenement houses , heaps of slag and refuse ore , interlacing tracks , raw embankments , denuded hillsides , and a blackened landscape are the signs of a great devastating American enterprise . The Cranberry iron is in great esteem , as it has the peculiar quality of the Swedish iron . There are remains of old furnaces lower down the stream , which we passed on our way . The present " plant " is that of a Philadelphia company , whose enterprise has infused new life into all this region , made it accessible , and spoiled some pretty scenery . When we alighted , weary , at the gate of the pretty hotel , which crowns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of many gentle hills , a mile or so below the works and wholly removed from all sordid associations , we were at the point of willingness that the whole country should be devastated by civilization . In the local imagination this hotel of the company is a palace of unequaled magnificence , but probably its good-taste , comfort , and quiet elegance are not appreciated after all . There is this to be said about Philadelphia - and it will go far in pleading for it in the Last Day against its monotonous rectangularity and the Babel-like ambition of its Public Building - that wherever its influence extends there will be found comfortable lodgings and the luxury of an undeniably excellent cuisine . The visible seal that Philadelphia sets on its enterprise all through the South is a good hotel . This Cottage Beautiful has on two sides a wide veranda , set about with easy chairs ; cheerful parlors and pretty chambers , finished in native woods , among which are conspicuous the satin stripes of the cucumber tree ; luxurious beds , and an inviting table , ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boot-tap . Is it " low " to dwell upon these things of the senses , when one is on a tour in search of the picturesque ? Let the reader ride from Abingdon through a wilderness of cornpone and rusty bacon , and then judge . There were , to be sure , novels lying about , and newspapers , and fragments of information to be picked up about a world into which the travelers seemed to emerge . They , at least , were satisfied , and went off to their rooms with the restful feeling that they had arrived somewhere , and no unquiet spirit at morn would say " to horse . " To sleep , perchance to dream of rJ7atem and his household cemetery , and the Professor was heard muttering in his chamber , " Weary , with toil , I haste me to my bed , The dear repose for limbs with travel tired ; But then begins a journey in my head , To work my mind , when body 's work s expir 'd . " The morning was warm ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3000 feet ) , rainy , mildly rainy ; and the travelers had nothing better to do than lounge upon the veranda , read feeble ten-cent fictions , and admire the stems of the white birches , glistening in the moisture , and the rhododendron trees , twenty feet high , which were shaking off their last pink blossoms , and look down into the valley of the Doe . It is not an exciting landscape , nothing bold or specially wild in it , but , // 195 restful with the monotony of some of the wooded Pennsylvania hills . Sunday came up smiling , a lovely day , but offering no church privileges , for the ordinance of preaching is only occasional in this region . The ladies of the hotel have , however , gathered in the valley a Sunday-school of fifty children from the mountain cabins . A couple of rainy days , with the thermometer rising to 800 , combined with natural laziness to detain the travelers in this cottage of ease . They enjoyed this the more because it was on their consciences that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long held up before them as the most magnificent feature of this region , and on no account to be omitted . Hence naturally a strong desire to omit it . The Professor takes bold ground against these abnormal freaks of nature , and it was nothing to him that the public would demand that we should see Linville Falls . In the first place we could find no one who had ever seen them , and we spent two days in catechizing natives and strangers . The nearest we came to information was from a workman at the furnace , who was born and raised within three miles of the Falls . He had heard of people going there . He had never seen them himself . It was a good twentyfive miles there , over the worst road in the State - we d think it thirty before we got there . Fifty miles of such travel to see a little water run down hill ! The travelers reflected . Every country has a local waterfall of which it boasts ; they had seen a great many . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The vagueness of information , to be sure , lured the travelers to undertake the journey ; but the temptation was resisted - something ought to be left for the next explorer and so Linville remains a thing of the imagination . Towards evening , July 29th , between showers , the Professor and the Friend rode along the narrow-guage road , down Johnson 's Creek , to Roan Station , the point of departure for ascending Roan Mountain . It was a ride of an hour and a half over a fair road , fringed with rhododendrons , nearly blossomless ; but at one point on the stream this sturdy shrub had formed a long bower whereunder a table might have been set for a temperance picnic , completely overgrown with wild grape , and still gay with bloom . The habitations on the way are mostly board shanties and mean frame cabins , but the railway is introducing ambitious architecture here and there in the form of ornamental filigree work on flimsy houses : ornamentation is apt to precede comfort in our civilization . Roan Station is on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and is marked at 2650 feet above the sea . The visitor will find here a good hotel , with open wood fires ( not ungrateful in a July evening ) , and obliging people . This railway from Johnson City , hanging on the edge of the precipices that wall the gorge of the Doe , is counted in this region by the inhabitants one of the engineering wonders of the world . The tourist is urged by all means to see both it and Linville Falls . The tourist on horseback , in search of exercise and recreation , is not probably expected to take stock of moral conditions . But this Mitchell County , although it was a Union county during the war and is Republican in politics ( the Southern reader will perhaps prefer another adverb to " although " ) , has had the worst possible reputation . The mountains were hiding-places of illicit distilleries ; the woods were full of grogshanties , where the inflaming fluid was sold as " native brandy , " quarrels and neighborhood difficulties were frequent , and the knife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arose about boundaries and the title to mica mines , and with the revenue officers ; and force was the arbiter of all dispui*es. // Within the year four murders were committed in the sparsely settled county . Travel on any of the roads was unsafe . The tone of morals was what might be expected with such lawlessness . A lady who came up on the road on the 4th of July , when an excursion party of country people took possession of the cars , witnessed a scene and heard language past belief . Men , women , and children drank from whiskey bottles that continually circulated , and a wild orgy resulted . Profanity , indecent talk on topics that even the license of the sixteenth century would not have tolerated , and freedom of manners that even Teniers would have shrunk from putting on canvas made the journey horrible . The unrestrained license of whiskey and assault and murder had produced a reaction a few months previous to our visit . The people had risen up in their indignation and broken up the groggeries . So far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In our whole ride through the mountain region we saw only one or two places where liquor was sold . It is called twelve miles from Roan Station to Roan Summit . The distance is probably nearer fourteen , and our horses were five hours in walking it . For six miles the road runs by Doe River , here a pretty brook shaded with laurel and rhododendron , and a few cultivated patches of ground and infrequent houses . It was a blithe morning , and the horsemen would have given full indulgence to the spirit of adventure but for the attitude of the Professor towards mountains . It was not with him a matter of feeling , but of principle , not to ascend them . But here lay Roan , a long , sprawling ridge , lifting itself 6250 feet up into the sky . Impossible to go around it , and the other side must be reached . The Professor was obliged to surrender , and surmount a difficulty which he could not philosophize out of his mind . From the base of the mountain a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carriages , to the top ; but it was in poor repair and stony . We mounted slowly through splendid forests , specially of fine chestnuts and hemlocks . This big timber continues till within a mile and a half of the summit by the winding road , really within a short distance of the top . Then there is a narrow belt of scrubby hardwood , moss-grown , and then large balsams , which crown the mountain . As soon as we came out upon the southern slope we found great open spaces , covered with succulent grass , and giving excellent pasturage to cattle . These rich mountain meadows are found on all the heights of this region . The surface of Roan is uneven , and has no one culminating peak that commands the country , like the peak of Mount Washington , but several eminences within its range of probably a mile and a half , where various views can be had . Near the highest point , sheltered from the north by balsams , stands a house of entertainment , with a detached cottage , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The surface of the mountain is pebbly , but few rocks crop out ; no ledges of any size are seen except at a distance from the hotel , on the north side , and the mountain consequently lacks that savage , unsubduable aspect which the White Hills of New Hampshire have . It would , in fact , have been difficult to realize that we were over 6000 feet above the sea , except for that pallor in the sunlight , that atmospheric thinness and want of color which is an unpleasant characteristic of high altitudes . To be sure , there is a certain brilliancy in the high air - it is apt to be foggy on Roan - and objects appear in sharp outline , but I have often experienced on such places that feeling of melancholy , which would , of course , deepen upon us all if we were sensible that the sun was gradually withdrawing its power of // warmth and light . The black balsam is neither a cheerful nor a picturesque tree ; the frequent rains and mists on Roan keep the grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high mountain covered with vegetation has its compensation , but for me the naked granite rocks in sun and shower are more cheerful . The advantage of Roan is that one can live there and be occupied for a long time in mineral and botanical study . Its mild climate , moisture , and great elevation make it unique in this country for the botanist . The variety of plants assembled there is very large , and there are many , we were told , never or rarely found elsewhere in the United States . At any rate the botanists rave about Roan *ountain and spend weeks on it at a time . We found there ladies who could draw for us Grey 's lily ( then passed ) and had kept specimens of the rhododendron ( not growing elsewhere in this region ) , which has a deep red , almost purple color . The hotel is a rude mountain structure , with a couple of comfortable rooms for office and sitting-room , in which big wood fires are blazing ; for though the thermometer might record 600 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sleeping places partitioned off in the loft above gave the occupants a feeling of camping out , all the conveniences being primitive ; and when the wind rose in the night and darkness , and the loose boards rattled and the timbers creaked , the sensation was not unlike that of being at sea . The hotel was satisfactorily kept , and Southern guests , from as far south as New Orleans , were spending the season there , and not finding time hang heavy on their hands . This statement is perhaps worth more than pages of description as to the character of Roan , and its contrast to Mt . Washington . The summer weather is exceedingly uncertain on all these North Carolina mountains ; they are apt at any moment to be enveloped in mist ; and it would rather rain on them than not . On the afternoon of our arrival there was fine air and fair weather , but not a clear sky . The distance was hazy , but the outlines were preserved . We could see White Top , in Virginia ; Grandfather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Linville ; and the entire range of the Black Mountains , rising from the valley , and apparently lower than we were . They get the name of Black from the balsams which cover the summits . The rain on Roan was of less annoyance by reason of the delightful company assembled at the hotel , which was in a manner at home there , and , thrown upon its own resources , came out uncommonly strong in agreeableness . There was a fiddle in the house , which had some of the virtues of that celebrated in the history of old Mark Langston ; the Professor was enabled to produce anything desired out of the literature of the eighteenth century ; and what with the repartee of bright women , big wood fires , reading , and chat , there was no dull day or evening on Roan . I can fancy , however , that it might tire in time , if one were not a botanist , without the resource of women 's society . The ladies staying here were probably all accomplished botanists , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of plants found on Roan , among which is an interesting weed , catalogued as Ilumana , perplexict negligens . The species is , however , common elsewhere . The second morning opened , after a night of high wind , with a thunder shower . After it passed , the visitors tried to reach Eagle Cliff , two miles off , whence an extensive western prospect is had , but were driven back by a tempest , and rain practically occupied the day . Now and then through the parted clouds we got a glimpse of a mountainside , // or the gleam of a valley . On the lower mountains , at wide intervals apart , were isolated settlements , commonly a wretched cabin and a spot of girdled trees . A clergyman here , not long ago , undertook to visit some of these cabins and carry his message to them . In one wretched hut of logs he found a poor woman , with whom , after conversation on serious subjects , he desired to pray . She offered no objection , and he kneeled down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some moments with curiosity , in an effort to ascertain what he was doing , and then said : - " Why , a man did that when he put my girl in a hole . " Towards night the wind hauled round from the south to the northwest , and we went to High Bluff , a point on the north edge , where some rocks are piled up above the evergreens , to get a view of the sunset . In every direction the mountains were clear , and a view was obtained of the vast horizon and the hills and lowlands of several States - a continental prospect , scarcely anywhere else equaled for variety or distance . The grandeur of mountains depends mostly on the state of the atmosphere . Grandfather loomed up much more loftily than the day before , the giant range of the Blacks asserted itself in grim inaccessibility , and we could see , a small pyramid on the southwest horizon , King 's Mountain in South Carolina , estimated to be distant one hundred and fifty miles . To the north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like a map below us , the low country all the way into Virginia . The ' clouds lay like lakes in the valleys of the lower hills , and in every direction were ranges of mountains wooded to the summits . Off to the west by south lay the Great Smoky Mountains , disputing eminence with the Blacks . Magnificent and impressive as the spectacle was , we were obliged to contrast it unfavorably with that of the White Hills . The rock here is a sort of sand or pudding stone ; there is no limestone or granite . And all the hills are tree covered . To many this clothing of verdure is most restful and pleasing . I missed the sharp outlines , the delicate artistic sky lines , sharply defined in uplifted bare granite peaks and ridges , with the purple and violet color of the northern mountains , and which it seems to me that limestone and granite formations give . There are none of the great gorges and awful abysses of the White Mountains , both valleys and mountains here being more uniform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and less is visible of the giant ribs and bones of the planet . Yet Roan is a noble mountain . A lady from Tennessee asked me if I had ever seen anything to compare with it - she thought there could be nothing in the world . One has to dodge this sort of question in the South occasionally , not to offend a just local pride . It is certainly one of the most habitable of big mountains . It is roomy on top , there is space to move about without too great fatigue , and one might pleasantly spend a season there , if he had agreeable company and natural tastes . Getting down from Roan on the south side is not as easy as ascending on the north ; the road for five miles to the foot of the mountain is merely a river of pebbles , gullied by the heavy rains , down which the horses picked their way painfully . The travelers endeavored to present a dashing and cavalier appearance to the group of ladies who waved good-by from the hotel , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it was only a show , for the horses would neither caracole nor champ the bit ( at a dollar a day ) down hill over the slippery stones , and , truth to tell , the wanderers turned with regret from the society of leisure and persiflage to face the wilderness of Mitchell County . // 199 " How heavy , " exclaimed the Professor , pricking Laura Matilda to call her attention sharply to her footing : - " How heavy do I journey on the way , When what I seek - my weary travel 's end - Doth teach that ease and that repose to say , Thus far the miles are measur 'd from thy friend The beast that bears me , tired with my woe , Plods dully on , to bear that weight in me , As if by some instinct the wretch did know His rider loved not speed , being made from thee The bloody spur can not provoke him on That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide , Which heavily he answers with a groan , More sharp to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doth put this in my mind ; My grief lies onward and my joy behind . " This was not spoken to the group who fluttered their farewells , hut poured out to the uncomplaining forest , which rose up in ever statelier and grander ranks to greet the travelers as they descended the silent vast forest , without note of bird or chip of squirrel , only the wind tossing the great branches high overhead in response to the sonnet . Is there any region or circumstance of life that the poet did not forecast and provide for ? But what would have been his feelings if he could have known that almost three centuries after these lines were penned , they would be used to express the emotion of an unsentimental traveler in the primeval forests of the New World ? At any rate he peopled the New World with the children of his imagination . And , thought the Friend , whose attention to his horse did not permit him to drop into poetry , Shakespeare might have had a vision of this vast continent , though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What is your substance , whereof are you made , That millions of strange shadows on you tend ? " Bakersyille , the capital of Mitchell County , is eight miles from the top of Roan , and the last three miles of the way the horsemen found tolerable going , over which the horses could show their paces . The valley looked fairly thrifty and bright , and was a pleasing introduction to Bakersville , a pretty place in the hills , of some six hundred inhabitants , with two churches , three indifferent hotels and a court-house . This mountain town , 25*O feet above the sea , is said to have a decent winter climate , with little snow , favorable to fruit-growing , and , by contrast with New England , encouraging to people with weak lungs . This is the centre of the mica mining , and of considerable excitement about minerals . All around , the hills are spotted with " diggings . " Most of the mines which yield well show signs of having been worked before , a very long time ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The mica is of excellent quality and easily mined . It is got out in large irregular-shaped blocks and transported to the factories , where it is carefully split by hand , and the laminm , of as large size as can be obtained , are trimmed with shears and tied up in packages for market . The quantity of refuse , broken , and rotten mica piled up about the factories is immense , and all the roads round about glisten with its scales . Garnets are often found imbedded in the laminm , flattened by the extreme pressure to which the mass was subjected . It is fascinating material , this mica , to handle , and we amused ourselves by experimenting on the thinness to which its scales could be reduced by splitting . It was at Bakersville that we saw specimens of mica that resembled the delicate tracery in the mossagate , and had the iridescent sheen of the rainbow colors - the most delicate greens , reds , blues , purples , and gold , changing from one to the other in the reflected light . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ferns and the most exquisite and delicate vegetable beauty of the coal age . But the magnet shows this tracery to he iron . We were shown also emeralds and " dinmonds , " picked up in this region , and there is a mild expectation in all the inhabitants // of great mineral treasure . A singular product of the region is the flexible sandstone . It is a most uncanny stone . A slip of it a couple of feet long and an inch in diameter each way bends in the hand like a half frozen snake . This conduct of a substance that we have been taught to regard as infIexibl* impairs one 's confidence in the stability of nature and affects him as an earthquake does . This excitement over mica and other minerals has the usual effect of starting up business and creating bad blood . Fortunes have been made , and lost in riotous living ; scores of visionary men have been disappointed ; lawsuits about titles and claims have multiplied , and quarrels ending in murder have been frequent in the past few years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make this region one of lawlessness and violence . The travelers were told stories of the lack of common morality and decency in the region , but they made no note of them . And , perhaps fortunately , they were not there during court week to witness the scenes of license that were described . This court week , which draws hither the whole population , is a sort of Saturnaha . Perhaps the worst of this is already a thing of the past ; for the outrages a year before had reached such a pass that by a common movement the sale of whiskey was stopped ( not interdicted , but stopped ) , and not a drop of liquor could be bought in Bakersville nor within three miles of it . The jail at Bakersville is a very simple residence . The main building is brick , two stories high and about twelve feet square . The walls are so loosely laid up that it seems as if a colored prisoner might butt his head through . Attached to this is a room for the jailer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of logs bolted together and filled with spikes , nine feet by ten feet square and perhaps seven or eight feet high . Between this cage and the wall is a space of eighteen inches in width . It has a narrow door , and an opening through which the food is passed to the prisoners , and a conduit leading out of it . Of course it soon becomes foul , and in warm weather somewhat warm . A recent prisoner , who wanted more ventilation than the State allowed him , found some means , by a loose plank , I think , to batter a hole in the outer wall opposite the window in the cage , and this ragged opening , seeming to the jailer a good sanitary arrangement , remains . Two murderers occupied this apartment at the time of our visit . During the recent session of court , ten men had been confined in this narrow space , without room enough for them to lie down together . The cage in the room above , a little larger , had for tenant a person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who was probably innocent - from the jailer 's statement . This box is a wretched residence , month after month , while awaiting trial . We learned on inquiry that it is practically impossible to get a jury to convict of murder in this region , and that these admitted felons would undoubtedly escape . We even heard that juries were purchasable here , and that a man 's success in court depended upon the length of his purse . This is such an unheard of thing that we refused to credit it . When the Friend attempted to arouse the indignation of the Professor about the barbarity of this jail , the latter defended it on the ground that as confinement was the only punishment that murderers were likely to receive in this region , it was well to make their detention disagreeable to them . But the Friend did not like this wild-beast cage for men , and could only exclaim , " Oh , murder ! what crimes are done in thy name . " If the comrades wished an adventure , they had a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public , the morning they left Bakersyille to ride to Burasyille , which sets itself up as the capital of Yancey . The way for the first three miles lay down a small creek and in a valley fairly settled , the houses , a store , and a grist-mill giving evidence of the new enterprise of the region . When Toe River was reached there was a choice of routes . We might ford the Toe at that point , where the river was wide , but shallow , and the crossing safe , and climb over the mountain by a rough but sightly road , or descend the stream by a better road and ford the river at a place rather dangerous to those unfamiliar with it . The danger attracted us , but we promptly chose the hill road on account of the views , for we were weary of the limited valley prospects . The Toe River , even here , where it bears westward , is a very respectable stream in size , and not to be trifled with after a shower . It gradually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tennessee system . We crossed it by a long , diagonal ford , slipping and sliding about on the round stones , and began the ascent of a steep hill . The sun beat down unmercifully , the way was stony , and the horses did not relish the weary climbing . The Professor , who led the way , not for the sake of leadership but to be the discoverer of laden blackberry bushes , which began to offer occasional refreshment , discouraged by the inhospitable road and perhaps oppressed by the moral backwardness of things in general , cried out : - " Tired with all these , for restful death I cry , - As , to behold desert a beggar born , And needy nothing trimm 'd in jollity , And purest faith unhappily forsworn , And gilded honor shamefully misplaced , And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted , And right perfection wrongfully disgraced , And strength by limping sway disabled , And art made tongue-tied by authority , And folly ( doctor-like ) controlling skill , And simple truth miscall 'd simplicity , And captive good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these would I be gone , Save that , to die , I leave my love alone . " In the midst of a lively discussion of this pessimistic view of the inequalities of life , in which desert and capacity are so often put at disadvantage by birth in beggarly conditions , and brazen assumption raises the dust from its chariot wheels for modest merit to plod along in , the Professor swung himself off his horse to attack a blackberry bush , and the Friend , representing simple truth , and desirous of getting a wider prospect , urged his horse up the hill . At the top he encountered a stranger , on a sorrel horse , with whom he entered into conversation and extracted all the discouragement the man had as to the road to Burnsville . Nevertheless , the view opened finely and extensively . There are few exhilarations comparable to that of riding or walking along a high ridge , and the spirits of the traveler rose many degrees above the point of restful death , for which the Professor was crying when he encountered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a like temptation , and dismounted . He discovered something that spoiled his appetite for berries . His coat , strapped on behind the saddle , had worked loose , the pocket was open , and the pocket-book was gone . This was serious business . For while the Professor was the cashier , and traveled like a Rothschild , with large drafts , the Friend represented the sub-treasury . That very morning , in response to inquiry as to the sinews of travel , the Friend had displayed , without counting , a roll of bills . These bills had now disappeared , and when the Friend turned back to communicate his loss , in the character of needy nothing not trimm 'd in jollity , he had a sympathetic listener to the tale of woe . Going back on such a journey is the woefulest experience , but retrace our steps we must . Perhaps the pocket-book lay in the road not half a mile back . But not in a half a mile , or a mile , was it // found . Probably , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But who was the man on the sorrel horse , and where had he gone ? Probably the coat worked loose in crossing Toe River and the pocket-book had gone down stream . The number of probabilities was infinite , and each more plausible than the others as it occurred to us . We inquired at every house we had passed on the way , we questioned every one we met . At length it began to seem improbable that any one would remember if he had picked up a pocket-book that morning . This is just the sort of thing that slips an untrained memory . At a post-office , or doctor 's shop , or inn for drovers , it might be either or neither , where several horses were tied to the fence , and a group of men were tilted back in cane-chairs on the veranda , we unfolded our misfortune and made particular inquiries for a man on a sorrel horse . Yes , such a man , David Thomas by name , had just ridden towards Bakersville . If he had found the pocket-book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . It might , however , fall into hands that would freeze to it . Upon consultation , it was the general verdict that there were men in the county who would keep it if they had picked it up . But the assembly manifested the liveliest interest in the incident . One suggested Toe River . Another thought it risky to drop a purse on any road . But there was a chorus of desire expressed that we should find it , and in this anxiety was exhibited a decided sensitiveness about the honor of Mitchell County . It seemed too bad that a stranger should *go away with the impression that it was not safe to leave money anywhere in it . We felt very much obliged for this genuine sympathy , and we told them that if a pocket-book were lost in this way on a Connecticut road , there would be felt no neighborhood responsibility for it , and that nobody would take any interest in the incident except the man who lost , and the man who found . By the time the travelers pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expectation of recovering the missing article , and were discussing the investment of more money in an advertisement in the weekly newspaper of the capital . The Professor , whose reform sentiments agreed with those of the newspaper , advised it . There was a group of idlers , mica acquaintances of the morning , and philosophers in front of the store , and the Friend opened the colloquy by asking if a man named David Thomas had been seen in town . He was in town , had ridden in within an hour , and his brother , who was in the group , would go in search of him . The information was then given of the loss , and that the rider had met David Thomas just before it was discovered , on the mountain beyond the Toe . The news made a sensation , and by the time David Thomas appeared a crowd of a hundred had drawn around the horsemen eager for further developments . Mr. Thomas was the least excited of the group as he took his position on the sidewalk , conscious of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin a duel in which both reputation and profit were concerned . He recollected meeting the travelers in the morning . The Friend said , " I discovered that I had lost my purse just after meeting you ; it may have been dropped in Toe River , but I was told back here that if David Thomas had picked it up it was as safe as if it were in the bank . " " What sort of a pocket-book was it ? " asked Mr. Thomas . " It was of crocodile skin , or what is sold for that , very likely it is an imitation , and about so large " - indicating the size . " What had it in it ? " " Various things . Some specimens of mica ; so*eblank checks ; some money . " // 203 " Anything else ? " " Yes , a photograph . And , oh , something that I presume is not in another pocket-iook in North Carolina , - in an envelope , a lock of the hair of George Washington , the Father of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington 's hair did seem such an odd part of an outfit for a journey of this kind . " How much money was in it ? " " That I can not say , exactly . I happen to remember four twenty dollar United States notes , and a roll of small hills , perhaps something over a hundred dollars . " " Is that the pocket-book ? " asked David Thomas , slowly pulling the loved and lost out of his trousers pocket . " It is. , , " You d he willing to take your oath on it ? " " I should be delighted to . " " Well , I guess there ai n't so much money in it . You can count it ( handing it over ) ; there hai n't been nothing taken out . I ca n't read , but my friend here counted it over , and he says there ai n't so much as that . " Intense interest in the result of the counting . One hundred and ten dollars ! The Friend selected one of the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they thought that was the square thing to do . They did so think , and David Thomas said it was abundant . And then said the Friend : " I m exceedingly grateful to you besides . Washington 's hair is getting scarce , and I did not want to lose these few hairs , gray as they are . You ye done the honest thing , Mr. Thomas , as was expected of you . You might have kept the whole . But I reckon if there had been five hundred dollars in the book and you had kept it , it would n't have done you half as much good as giving it up has done ; and your reputation as an honest man is worth a good deal more than this pocket-book . The Professor was delighted with this sentiment , because it reminded him of a Sundayschool . I shall go away with a high opinion of the honesty of Mitchell County . " " Oh , he lives in Yancev , " cried two or three voices . At which there was a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from . " And the Mitchell County people laughed again at their own expense , and the levee broke up . It was exceedingly gratifying , as we spread the news of the recovered property that afternoon at every house on our way to the Toe , to see what pleasure it gave . Every man appeared to feel that the honor of the region had been on trial and had stood the test . The eighteen miles to Burnsville had now to be added to the morning excursion , but the travelers were in high spirits , feeling the truth of the adage that it is better to have loved and lost , than never to have lost at all . They decided , on reflection , to join company with the mail-rider , who was going to Burnsville by the shorter route , and could pilot them over the dangerous ford of the Toe . The mail-rider was a lean , sallow , sinewy man , mounted on a sorry sorrel nag , who proved , however , to have blood in her , and to be a fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a natural habit for a man who rides alone the year round , over a lonely road , and has nothing whatever to think of . He had been in the war sixteen months , in Hugh White 's regiment , - reckon you ye heerd of him ? " Confederate ? " " Which ? " " Was he on the Union or Confederate side ? " " Oh , Union. ** " Were you in any engagements ? " " Which ? " " Did you have any fighting ? " " Not reg'lar. " // " What did you do ? " " Which ? " " Wjiat did you do in Hugh White 's regiment ? " " Oh , just cavorted round the mountains . " " You lived on the country ? " " Which ? " " Picked up what you could find , corn , bacon , horses ? " " That s about so . Did n't make much difference which side was round , the country got cleaned out . " " Plunder seems to have been the object ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the farm-ers ? " " You bet . " Our friend and guide seemed to have been a jayhawker and mountain marauder - on the right side . His attachment to the word " which " prevented any lively flow of conversation , and there seemed to be only two trains of ideas running in his mind : one was the subject of horses and saddles , and the other was the danger of the ford we were coming to , and he exhibited a good deal of ingenuity in endeavoring to excite our alarm . He returned to the ford from every other conversational excursion , and after every silence . " I do ' know s there s any great danger ; not if you know the ford . Folks is carried away there . The Toe gits up sudden . There s been right smart rain lately . If you re afraid , you can git set over in a dugout , and I 11 take your horses across . Mebbe you re used to fording ? It s a pretty bad ford for them as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you mind your eye . There s some rocks you 11 have to look out for . But you 11 be all right , if you follow me . " Not being very successful in raising an interest in the dangers of his ford , although he could not forego indulging a malicious pleasure in trying to make the strangers uncomfortable , he finally turned his attention to a trade . " This hoss of mine , " he said , " is just the kind of brute-beast you want for this country . Your hosses is too heavy . How 11 you swap for that one o ' yourn ? " The reiterated assertion that the horses were not ours , that they were hired , made little impression on him . All the way to Burnsville he kept recurring to the subject of a trade . The instinct of " swap " was strong in him . When we met a yoke of steers , he turned round and bantered the owner for a trade . Our saddles took his fancy . They were of the army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just suit him . He rode a small flat English pad , across which was flung the United States mail pouch , apparently empty . He dwelt upon the fact that his saddle was new and ours were old , and the advantages that would accrue to us from the exchange . He did n't care if they had been through the war , as they had , for he fancied an army saddle . The Friend answered for himself that the saddle he rode belonged to a distinguished Union general , and had a bullet in it that was put there by a careless Confederate in the first battle of Bull Run , and the owner would not part with it for money . But the mail-rider said he did n't mind that . He would n't mind swapping his new saddle for my old one and the rubber coat and leggins . Long before we reached the ford we thought we would like to swap the guide , even at the risk of drowning . The ford was passed , in due time , with no inconvenience save that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the horses ; but being broad and swift and full of sunken rocks and slippery stones and the crossing tortuous , it is not a ford to be commended . There is a curious delusion that a rider has in crossing a swift broad stream . It is that he is rapidly drifting up stream , while in fact the tendency of the horse is to go with the current . // The road in the afternoon was not unpicturesque , owing to the streams and the ever noble forests , but the prospect was al*ays very limited . Agriculturally , the country was mostly undeveloped . The travelers endeavored to get from the rider an estimate of the price of land . Not much sold , he said . " There was one sale of a big piece last year ; the owner enthorited Big Tom Wilson to sell it , but I d ' know what he got for it . " All the way along the habitations were small log cabins , with one room , chinked with mud , and these were far between ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid up like a cob house , that served for a stable . Not much cultivation , except now and then a little patch of poor corn on a steep hillside , occasionally a few apple-trees , and a peach-tree without fruit . Here and there was a house that had been half finished and then abandoned , or a shanty in which a couple of young married people were just beginning life . Generally the cabins ( confirming the accuracy of the census of 1880 ) swarmed with children , and nearly all the women were thin and sickly . In the day 's ride we did not see a wheelhd vehicle , and only now and then a horse . We met on the road small sleds , drawn by a steer , sometimes by a cow , on which a bag of grist was being hauled to the mill , and boys mounted on steers gave us good evening with as much pride as if they were bestriding fiery horses . In a house of the better class , which was a post-house , and where the rider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a letter to be registered , we found the rooms decorated with patent - medicine pictures , which were often framed in strips of mica , an evidence of culture that was worth noting . Mica was the rage . Every one with whom we talked , except the rider , had more or less the mineral fever . The impression was general that the mountain region of North Carolina was entering upon a career of wonderful mineral development , and the most extravagant expectations were entertained . Mica was the shining object of most " prospecting , " but gold was also on the cards . The country about Burnsville is not only mildly picturesque , but very pleasing . Burnsville , the county-seat of Yancey , at an elevation of 2840 feet , is more like a New England village than any hitherto seen . Most of the houses stand about a square , which contains the shabby court-house ; around it are two small churches , a jail , an inviting tavern , with a long veranda , and a couple of stores . On an overlooking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry , but it is agriculturally a good country . The tavern had recently been enlarged to meet the new demands for entertainment , and is a roomy structure , fresh with paint and only partially organized . The travelers were much impressed with the brilliant chambers , the floors of which were painted in alternate stripes of vivid green and red . The proprietor , a very intelligent and enterprising man , who had traveled often in the North , was full of projects for the development of his region and foremost in its enterprises , and had formed a considerable collection of minerals . Besides , more than any one else we met , he appreciated the beauty of his country , and took us to a neighboring hill , where we had a view of Table Mountain to the east and the nearer giant Blacks . The elevation of Burnsville gives it a delightful summer climate , the gentle undulations of the country are agreeable , the views noble , the air is good , and it is altogether a " livable " and attractive place . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resort . Its nearness to the great mountains ( the whole Black range is in Yancey County ) , its fine pure air , its opportunity for fishing and hunting , commend it to those in search // of an interesting and restful retreat in summer . But it should be said that before the country can attract and retain travelers , its inhabitants must learn something about the preparation of food . If , for instance , the landlord 's wife at Burnsville had traveled with her husband , her table would probably have been more on a level with his knowledge of the world , and it would have contained something that the wayfaring man , though a Northerner , could eat . We have been on the point several times in this journey of making the observation , but have been restrained by a reluctance to touch upon politics , that it was no wonder that a people with such a cuisine should have rebelled . The travelers were in a rebellious mood most of the time . The evidences of enterprise in this region were pleasant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after all , the intrusion of the money-making spirit , which is certain to destroy much of the present simplicity . It is as yet , to a degree , tempered by a philosophic spirit . The other guest of the house was a sedate , long-bearded traveler for some Philadelphia house , and in the evening he and the landlord fell into a conversation upon what Socrates calls the disadvantage of the pursuit of wealth to the exclusion of all noble objects , and they let their fancy play about Vanderbilt , who was agreed to be the richest man in the world , or that ever lived . " All I want , " said the long-bearded man , " is enough to be comfortable . I would n't have Vanderbilt 's wealth if he 'd give it to me . " " Nor I , " said the landlord . " Give me just enough to be comfortable . The tourist could n't but note that his ideas of enough to be comfortable had changed a good deal since he had left his little farm and gone into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlarged and painted his tavern . I should like to know what more Vanderbilt gets out of his money than I get out of mine . I heard tell of a young man who went to Vanderbilt to get employment . Vanderbilt finally offered to give the young man , if he would work for him , just what he got himself . The young man jumped at that - he d be perfectly satisfied with that pay . And Vanderbilt said that all he got was what he could eat and wear , and offered to give the young man his board and clothes . " " I declare , " said the long-bearded man . " That s just it . Did you ever see Vanderbilt 's house ? Neither did I , but I heard he had a vault built in it five feet thick , solid . He put in it two hundred millions of dollars , in gold . After a year , he opened it and put in twelve millions more , and called that a poor year . They say his house has gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I should n't wonder , " said the landlord . " I heard he had one door in his house cost forty thousand dollars . I do n't know what it is made of , unless it s made of gold . " Sunday was a hot and quiet day . The stores were closed and the two churches also , this not being the Sunday for the itinerant preacher . The jail also showed no sign of life , and when we asked about it , we learned that it was empty , and had been for some time . No liquor is sold in the place , nor within at least three miles of it . It is not much use to try to run a jail without liquor . In the course of the morning a couple of stout fellows arrived , leading between them a young man whom they had arrested , - it did n't appear on any warrant , but they wanted to get him committed and locked up . The offense charged was carrying a pistol ; the boy had not used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and threatened , and the neighbors would n't stand that ; they were bound to enforce the law against carrying concealed weapons . // 207 The captors were perfectly good-natured and on friendly enough terms with the young man , who offered no resistance , and seemed not unwilling to go to jail . But a practical difficulty arose . The jail was locked , up , the sheriff had gone away into the country with the key , and no one could get in . It did not appear that there was any provision for boarding the man in jail ; no one in fact kept it . The sheriff was sent for , but was not to be found , and the prisoner and his captors loafed about the square all day , sitting on the fence , rolling on the grass , all of them sustained by a simple trust that the jail would be open some time . Late in the afternoon we left them there , trying to get into the jail . But we took a personal leaf out of this experience . Our Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had urged us not to venture into it without arms - take at least , they insisted , a revolver each . And now we had to congratulate ourselves that we had not done so . If we had , we should doubtless on that Sunday have been waiting , with the other law-breaker , for admission into the Yancey County jail . Charles Dudley Warner .
