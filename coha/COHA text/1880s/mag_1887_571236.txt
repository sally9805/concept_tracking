ARTICLE IV. - IS THEOLOGY SCIENTIFIC ? WE may eliminate from our enquiry , for the present at least , that department of theology called " Natural . " For critics like Matthew Arnold it is only " the poor old dead horses of so-called natural theology with their galvanic movements . " ( God and the Bible . ) For scientific opponents of traditional religious belief like the author of Supernatural Religion , it is a branch of Metaphysics , " the true and noble faith which is the child of reason , " not sharing indeed the exactitude and precision of the applied sciences , but well worthy the name of a " science of principles , " the investigation of that " stream of tendency by which all things fulfill the law of their being. ** For the general public , who do not hold particularly dear the arguments from design and intuition or the ontological proof of the being of God , it is a matter of comparative indifference whether the method thereof be scientific or unscientific . There may be therefore difference of opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the title of a science , especially in view of its close relationship to the admitted science of philosophy , is not yet a subject of dispute . With the second part of theology , called revealed , or doctrinal , or dogmatics , the case is different . It is a matter of fully appreciated and vital interest to the religious and general pub . lie , whether or no the doctrines of evangelical Christianity as now generally understood are scientific . If the ontological argument for the being of God is shown to be fallacious they will not be greatly distressed , but if the method by which the doctrines of Revelation , Inspiration , the Divinity of Christ , the Atonement , etc. , were reached and are upheld , is proved " unscientific , " the ears of all Christendom will tingle . There will be great searchings of heart among the theologians , and perhaps more or less of triumphant " I told you so " from Professor Clifford on the one flank and Matthew Arnold on the other . Why should the Christian world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian dogma is merely shown to be " unscientific ? " Because " unscientific " in such connection is to-day justly synonymous with untrustworthy . The honor and glory of modern science is its supreme devotion to truth . It is this which makes it imperishable . Take any one of the sciences and it will be found steadfastly to refuse to identify itself with anything short of the truth on its own particular subject , and though it is the commonest popular error in the world to confound the science with some mere stage or attitude in its advance toward the absolutely verifiable , every scientist refuses to compromise his mistress by allowing her to stand in any position but the highest . Thus the science of chemistry a century ago was colored and dominated throughout by the theory of phlogiston , so eminent a discoverer as Priestley , clinging to it to the last ; but even he would undoubtedly have admitted that this was only theory , and that so far from constituting the science , the accepted conception of that day was only a phase in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the development of a science claiming to be the absolute truth ? " Very easily ; the line which divided the phenomena , actual facts of real occurrence , from the theory which was supposed to exhibit their true significance , was never suffered to become faint . The facts were stated as facts , the theory as a mode of interpreting them more or less completely or perfectly . Eager theories pushed forward by ardent devotees into a position of authority reserved for demonstrated truth were promptly reminded of their true position and significance ; for the scientists knew that the good name and authority of the science depended on it . Hence even the destruction of a very generally accepted theory never coinpromised the science , it left its fttcts behind , increased now perhaps by the discovery of further ones , the theory itself giving way to a new and larger interpretation of them . Still more cautious are the true scientists of to-day in. respect to authoritative declarations . A hypothesis even so well attested as the nebular hypothesis is only theory . The science refuses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viz : the balance of evidence in its favor over that against it . Kay , when the question of the degree of certainty is raised , scientists are not // satisfied with the precision of their statements till they have introduced the mathematical law of probabilities , have drawn the curve which represents all degrees of certainty between what we call absolute mathematical certainty , and absolute impossibility , have located in its own spot each proposition according to its degree of evidence and have told us just how many thousand or million chances there are to one of this theory or that being true . This latter test is of course inapplicable in some of the sciences , but its rigid application in the empirical and mathematical is a good example of the spirit of devotion to truth which characterizes all ; for the precision , accuracy , and trustworthiness which in the popular mind are now inseparable from the name 8cience are ideas derived mainly from the achievements of these branches . This trait constitutes a guarantee of immortality . Astrology and alchemy could die because they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though even the law of gravitation be disproved and the atomic theory exploded . It may not be too much to say that this careful distinction between the science and its theories , absolute and relative truth , was learned in part from the mistakes of theological opponents . Another marked and growing characteristic of modern science which makes its name august by the exhibition of its supreme devotion to truth , is an entire impartiality in judgment , a complete subordination of theory to fact . As hard a lesson as it is for the individual man to learn to subordinate his own will to the will of God , so hard was it for scientists to learn rigidly to exclude the will from the sole province of the intellect . Pet theories , the beloved offspring of incomplete knowledge , must be driven out like Ishmael to make way for the child of the free woman , i. e. , the true bearing of the facts themselves , the offspring of absolute truth . Paternal tenderness is not only misplaced but suicidal . Science must act out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only allude in illustration to Newton who laid aside for years the whole vast theory of gravitation as not strictly in accord with the facts , because , although its grandeur , beauty , and consistency could not but appeal to his marvellous instinct for scientific truth , an error in the then accepted distance of the // moon gave a result slightly , but intractably , different from that which his hypothesis required . All honor to the father of modern science who could resist such a temptation to " reconcile " results in such minute disagreement . The salvation of science on this score has been a following of the exhortation of St. Paul to the letter , " Prove all things , " a radical liberalism , which insists not only on toleration for investigation of theories new and old , but a courting and coveting of the opportunity of putting all things to the test , each time a new fact turns up or a new theory is offered to shed light on former beliefs . It is not merely a stalwart faith in accepted theories or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of renewed and searching investigation down to bottom facts , not merely the confidence of having a good case for his theory that actuates the scientist in coveting an investigation in the light of new facts , not merely the sure hope that new discoveries will strengthen and confirm his interpretation of the old ; he has beyond and above all these a deep-seated , supreme love of the truth which will say to the most cherished and toil-worn of his theories , I want none of you unless you be true to the facts . Faith , hope , love , are his cardinal virtues , but love is the greatest of these . Enough has been said of these two interrelated characteristics of science to show the reason why " unscientific " in modern thought is equivalent to untrustworthy . To show Doctrinal Theology thus " unscientific " would be fatal , for it is nothing or far worse than nothing if not a science . To be found seriously wanting in the double characteristic of modern science above mentioned , would require a revolution of the whole system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the verified phenomena of the visible universe , of personal consciousness and of testimony past and present . From these it would become necessary to reconstruct a new science of theology which would perhaps ignore the distinction of natural and revealed , calling what is natural revelation , as it really is , and what is revealed , natural , which it certainly as much deserves to be called as " supernatural . " This however must be borne in mind , that though a thousand systems of doctrinal theology should fall , Christianity is unaffected thereby . // The Founder of Christianity has made it as necessarily immortal as true science is , for His system He simply calls Truth . " For to this end was I born and for this cause came I into the world , that I might bear witness unto the truth . " All that can be said when any system of doctriue goes down before new light is what the Calvinistic churches say of reprobate members . They did not fall from grace , they never really belonged in the household . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hypothesis goes down , becanse astronomers are content to identify the science itself with nothing short of the truth . Christianity will stand unharmed if every doctrine that was ever framed about it is exploded down to the bare verifiable historical facts of what took place in Palestine about A. D. 30 , and what took place before and after , because from the outset Jesus declined to identify it with anything short of the truth . Of the bare facts , of the observed and verified phenomena in the fields of consciousness , the sensible universe , and testimony , past and present ,  --  it being allowed for convenience to separate this latter from sense perceptiontheology is the rationale . It is impossible as a rational creature to accept these facts to any purpose without systemizing them in accordance with the categories of reason . As long as man is rational , as the theologians say , " in the image of God , " he can not believe that an event took place without a cause , or that two contradictory propositions are both true . As Bishop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed the only faculty we have wherewith to judge concerning anything , even revelation itself . " A science of theology or rationale of religious phenomena in the fields above specified , is therefore a necessity , and , as a matter of fact , exists and includes as one of its departments the rationale of the phenomena of sacred Scripture . Upon this in turn is based the department of doctrinal theology or the science of Christian doctrine . This latter therefore is the great object of attack in modern days from some of the champions of natural science and from literary critics . This rationale of the direct or implied statements of sacred Scripture is declared to be not only unscientific but " pseudo-scientific , " which is as much worse as a quack is worse than an unskilled attendant . The attack is thus concentrated on the // foundation of doctrinal theology , the doctrine of sacred Scripture , because this forms the transition between the comparatively undisputed ground of natural theology and the obnoxious doctrinal system . To be scientific , doctrinal theology must be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are genuine fact8 , i. e. , it is required to verify its data . A certain portion of these are independently verifiable , such as the general teaching of the prophets , the ministry and death of Christ , the work of Paul , etc. , in broad outline . For the verification of another and considerable portion of its data , especially all matters of detail , doctrinal theology is compelled to fall back upon the doctrine of sacred Scripture . This serves to reinforce the authority of biblical testimony . It is held to bring a great part of it up to the standard of verifted data . The battle is then plainly to be fought out on this field . If the result should be a complete vindication of the present and former doctrine of sacred Scripture , the superstructure , the system of evangelical doctrinal theology , would gain a guarantee title to the main body of its teachings , for their deduction from the point where the doctrine of sacred Scriptnre is admitted , is probably logical enough in the main . If the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrine of sacred Scripture , a new statement of the value and authority of its testimony would have to be formulated , and then according to an already mentioned necessity of the human mind the residuum of verifiable facts would be reconstructed into a new system . But without anticipating possible consequences , it is comparatively easy to give an answer to the question with which we set out , if we look simply at the contest as it now stands . Doctrinal theology claims to be scientific . Science , as defined by Sir Win . Hamilton , is a complement of cognitions , having , in point of form , the character of logical perfection , and , in point of matter , the character of real truth . We have seen further that the indispensable characteristic of a science is supreme devotion to the truth , manifesting itself among other ways in the refusal to overestimate the degree of probability in favor of any theory . In other words a system of thought may be considered unscientific which presents // theories as demonstrated , when only probable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectly verified . It may be said that doctrines are not theories , but theories are taken here to mean the sum total of observed phenomena bearing on a given subject , arranged according to the necessary categories of thought . If doctrines are not theories , then doctrinal theology is not a science , because it either does not rest upon facts , or else rests upon facts arranged otherwise than in logical order . But any doctrinal theology not entirely suicidal claims to rest its doctrines upon facts , claims that its doctrines are a " complement of cognitions , having in point of matter the character of real truth " and interpreted according to the necessary laws of reason . That is exactly what theories are to all sciences . Bringing in now the necessary characteristic of a science , theories vary in authority all the way from what is called certainty down to incredibility , and no two stand on precisely the same level , but each has precisely the amount of authority which the evidence in its favor warrants . If subsequent discovery throws the balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the theory as against the showing of the evidence would be as fatal to the essential parts of the science as for the healthy body to retain matter which has ceased to be organically connected with it . Then if doctrinal theology is a science the very wide-spread opinion that its different theories , dogmas or doctrines are not dependent upon the several complements of phenomena of which they are the interpretation , but possess an authority in themselves , independent of the evidence in their favor , is an entire misapprehension . For my own part the only way in which doctrinal theology in toto and doctrines in particular commend themselves to me as scientific is in the fact that I recognize them as theories possessing varying degrees of certainty and capable of indefinite modification . To live at all in these days of discovery , a system of thought must have more or less mobility ; it must be inexorable in declining to consider what is undemonstrable an essential part of itself . It must be unhesitatingly candid in acknowledging the exact quality of each one of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scripture ) whether demonstrated , unqaestioned fact , or more // or less doubtful . If there is some difference of opinion with regard to the doctrine of sacred Scripture , doctrinal theology must recognize its own logical deductions as only probable and subject to modification throughout . It must do so not merely in candor but in self-defense . Christian faith-my Christian faith , is based on the belief that they are suJiciently accurate and sufficiently probable for an act of trust-not in them but in the person whose teaching they endeavor to present and interpret . There must be few who do not recognize that the degree of authority assigned even to the doctrinal teaching of the Scriptures that lies at the basis of doctrinal theology is a matter of probability rather than certainty . But how few recognize the necessary corollary ! There is , to say the least , a very wide-spread o ? tion that doctrinal theology declines to admit the theoretic and probable character of its deductions and is the reverse of mobile . In fact dogmatics are consid. ered to be dogmatic . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so far from strictly refusing to *Aace doctrinesfor which there is comparatively meagre evidence on a level with such as can not be denied , that the theologians do actually refuse to recognize this scientific gradation in probability to any reasonable extent . The common opinion is a mistaken one , but as long as theologians entirely fail to oppose it , can critics be blamed for assuming that this is the general standpoint of theology ? What is thought of the minister who ventures to discriminate between the second epistle of Peter and the first , or who goes so far as to admit that there is a certain amount of evidence against the miraculous conception as well as a certain amount in its favor . And yet even in so unscientific an age as that of Jerome it was freely admitted by the most orthodox that the second epistle of Peter was quite as likely to be spurious as genuine , and no scholar of to-day would quote it as of equal authority with the Gospel of Mark . if doctrinal theology is not pseudo-scientific , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this matter of undemonstrated theories , and to admit that no two doctrines in all the system stands on precisely the same grounds . This the real theology does , and frankly admits that the degree of certainty // with which each doctrine is proclaimed should be precisely equal to , and no greater than , the amount of evidence in its favor from verified facts . It has been already stated that a certain proportion of the facts on which doctrines are based are verifiable on historical grounds , but certainly there is also a proportion that rely for verification on the superior authority of canonical writings . Now whatever may finally be the outcome of the controversy to-day raging over the meaning of revelation and inspiration , so much as this may be certainly affirmed , that the extent and degree of superiority thereby assigned to their authority is most indeterminate , so that even when the field is won and revelation and inspiration acknowledged in some form , as sooner or later I believe they will be , and even if we suppose the logical deductions of doctrinal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still be a wide margin of greater or less probability for doctrines , in that the amount of authority in their*roof texts will be , not absolute-probably not equal in all cases  --  but in no case more than a high order of testimony . With this understanding of theology as the logical interpretation of facts and testimony in the field of nature and the human consciousness , its many theoretical propositions supported by degrees of evidence widely differing in amount and certainty , we need have no fear to place it on a level with astronomy itself , in regard to its scientific character . Only let it be clearly understood that it seeks the truth above the dearest of its doctrines and desires to " prove all things " - not all other things by itself , but put all things , itself included , to the test of absolute truth , in the judgment of the reason ; only let it insist that the line between fact and theory be kept rigid and unmistakably distinct , and there will be little excuse for those who call it unscientific . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field of fact and phenomenon to go upon , their structure is necessarily largely theoretic . Theology is one of these , but this need not militate against their accuracy , if only the law of probability is strictly enforced ; it does not militate against their usefulness , as a comparison of ethics , metaphysics , and philosophy with the natural sciences will show . // If there is such a thing as nobility or rank among the sciences , the daughters and kindred servants of the truth , then the nobler ones are these , whose field of fact is narrow , but whose propositions and problems are infinite . But eldest and noblest of all daughters of the truth is a scientific theology , whose object is no other than Him who i8 the Truth , whose base , like Jacob 's ladder , rests on earth , but its top is at the very throne of God .
