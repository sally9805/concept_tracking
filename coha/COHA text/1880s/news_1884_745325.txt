txt THE TIMES was eagerly sought down town and at the hotels and news stands very early yesterday morning for the news it published exclusively in regard to the proposed Nicaraguan treaty , and discussion of the merits of the instrument interlarded current business quite generally among merchants and lawyers during the day . Ex-Secretary Evarts , when asked his opinion about the effect of the treaty , should it be ratified , said : " It has long been the belief of this Government that the route across Nicaragua was the only feasible one for interoceanic communication . These negotiations are , therefore , the natural outcome of that belief . Gen. Grant was very strongly in favor of it . By his direction , while President , Engineer Menocal was sent to Nicaragua to make surveys . The policy of Gen. Grant 's Administration in this respect was accepted as the policy of the Hayes Administration . By direction of Mr. Hayes I sent Admiral Ammen and Mr. Menocal to the Lesseps conference at Paris , not as delegates , but as accredited representatives of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government regarded the Panama route and our opinion of the feasibility of the route across Nicaragua and of its superiority over Panama , Tehuantepec. or any other route that had been suggested . They pointed out to the conference that a canal across the Isthmus of Darien , as favored by Lesseps , would , if constructed on a level with the ocean , as proposed , be the lowest water course in that country , and that not only the Chagres , but all the waters of that rewion that could reach it , would tear it to pieces . The Chagres is a very unruly river at times . It was suggested by the French in response to this that a dam be constructed at the most dangerous point along the Chagres to be i3 mile and a half long and 140 feet high . Estimates showed that such -a dam would add to the cost of the canal by $30,000.000 , even that outlay not affording certain protection against the caprices of the river . The alternative seemed to be a canal with locks , but the Frenchmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After that conference 1 addressed a letter to the President , and in a subsequent communication to Congress he reaffirmed the policy of our Government on the general subject of interoceanic canal supervision . and restated the grounds to which we had committed ourselves in favor of the Nicaragua route . " A canal across the Isthmus of Darien being then Of special interest , the feature of governmental supervision was naturally apparent . In the treatment of that feature the Ciayton-Bulwer treaty was not considered relevant , for that instrument applied to Nicaragua , Costa Rica , and the Mosquito coast , not to the isthmus . It contemplated subsequent agreements by which England and this Government were to be similarly bound in respect to other territory . But the intention of both Governments was that these agreements should follow , within reasonable time , the ** treaty . As they did not so follow that failure was held by this Government to relieve the question of consideration of any possible claims that England might raise against our declaration of supremacy over a canal across Darien . Such was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this Government since Mr. Seward 's time , and which Mr. Seward emphasized in drafting the treaty between this Government and the United States of Colombia in regard to an isthmus canal , the article of the treaty embodying it being rejected , however , by the United States of Colombia . It is held by this Government now , I believe , that the Clayton-Bulwer treaty is no longer- in effect . That justifies a treaty with Nicaragua . I have no opinion to express in regard to the proposed treaty further than I have said , that the Nicaraguan route has long been held by this government to be the only feasible one . Mr. Frelinatussen would not thank me for obtruding myself in this business , and I shall have no disposition to do so . He and Mr. Miller and Mr. Lapham will attend to our in- ' terests in the matter . As I said the other day , treaty making is very grave business . The Republicans will be in power but three months longer . I can not believe that in this short time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mr. Evarts was not alone in the opinion that the pending treaties would fall as a legacy to the powers under the coming Administration . A lawyer who is exceptionally well posted in isthmus canal diplomacy said ; " I do n't want to be disrespectful to Congress , but a correct appreciation of what is due the dignity of the Government would have resulted long ago in a declaration , backed by all the powers of the Government , settling- forever the question of isthmus supremacy . Our executive department has always held right views and urged right measures to enforce them . The matter has been practically in the hands of Congress for years , for the Executive is powerless without Congressional co-operation . Gen. Grant entreated it , as did Mr. Hayes , and now President Arthur . I regret to say that this experience has conclusively proved that the primary Congressman , the average member , is unequal to questions beyond the politics of the hour or his local interests . He is utterly lacking in conception of the true and statesmanlike province of higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this session to the Nicaraguan treaty , the Spanish treaty , or to any other , ana I am unable to predict when these important matters will get intelligent consideration in Congress ; probably not until free discussion of them outside of Congress shall have dictated a course which Congressmen , under the pressure of local influences , will feel bound to follow . " .. history of canal negotiations , which THE TIMES publishes , refers to a provision in the Nicaragua Constitution which forbids a lease or grant of any part of its territory for a longer period than 99 years . In order to give effect to this treaty , which proposes an absolute grant , would it be necessary to amend the Nicaragua Constitution ? " " That would not be indispensable , " was the smiling reply . " I do n't think any one in Wallstreet would let that stand in the way of getting a desirable thing If this Government should get that land , build the canal , and Protect it by fortifications , at an expense say of from $60,000 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be easy work to supplant us there at the end of 99 years . However , we need be concerned only with the present . There is no use in computing cost or income just yet . It would be unreasonable to suppose that the investment would be a paying one to a private company even on the basis proposed in the treaty . The Panama Canal can never yield a fair return to its present investors . Occupation of this territory involves higher considerations than an early ? pecuniary return to those who advance the money to put the canal In working order . The harbor of Greytown , which is a vast shoal , would need to be fieepened before the canal could be of the slightest use . That means a tremendous outlay to begin with . So an immediate return must not be expected . The point to be asserted and emphasized in this matter is a reassertion of the Monroe doctrine and a practical declaration of the supremacy of this country in matters affecting the serious and farreaching diplomatic , political , and commercial affairs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government through its Executive . It needs only confirmation and support by the legislative department to command general recognition . "
