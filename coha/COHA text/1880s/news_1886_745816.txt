txt The demand made upon Mexico by the Secretary of State for the release of CUTTMTG was based upon the report of Mr. BRIGHAM , our Consul at Paso del Norte , and . upon a study of the Mexican Penal Code . That code sets forth that an offense committed . by a , foreigner in a foreign country may come within the jurisdiction of Mexican courts , provided the foreigner is caught upon Mexican soil , and provided also that the offense with which . he is charged is a crime according to the law a the place where it is committed as well as according to Mexican law . Stated ' in this broad way the position of the Mexican authorities is untenable , and the position taken by the Secretary of State is entirely justified . He pointed out one obvious reason why it was inadmissible that the local law of Mexico should . be permitted to take cognizance of an offense committed . beyond the Mexican border . This was that an offense might be merely a misdemeanor according to American law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to the law of Mexico . Civilized nations provide for this possibility by admitting that the grade of a crime and its punishment must be fixed by the law of the land in which it is committed . If he takes refuge in another . country the proper proceeding Is not to , prosecute him in that country , but to return him to the scene of his crime , on a requisition to that effect , there to be dealt with according to law . This is all very well , but the facts brought out in the trial of CUTTING yesterday show that Mr. BAYARD 'S propositions do not apply to the case actually presented . CuTTING , a resident of Mexico , and the publisher of a newspaper in that country , had been prosecuted for a libel , which he had agreed , under legal compulsion , - to retract . This he did , as is testified , in an incomplete and unsatisfactory way , even in the jurisdiction of the Mexican court . Moreover , he crossed the border into Texas , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and caused this latter publication to be circulated . hi Mexico . The purpose of this performance on the part of CurriNa seems to have been to satisfy his grudges against his rival , in spite of his solemn promise to abandon them given to the court , and - to make use of his American citizenship solely for the purpose of evading the Mexican law . It is evident that this is a , very different case from the assumed case on which Mr. BAYARD took ground . in favor of the surrender of CUTTING . Suppose the case reversed . If a Mexican editor , publishing a newspaper on the Texan side of the Rio Grande , had libeled an American , and . had promised to make a full retraction of his libel in order to avoid its . legal consequences , and the libel suit had been settled upon that basis . If thereupon he had gone over to Mexico and repeated . his libel and caused it to be circulated upon this side . of the border , he would have done exactly what CurrrNa did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put himself within roach of a Texan jury it is evident that they would , have shown him no mercy . They ought to show no mercy to a person so perfidious and . disreputable . Our own States are , in respect to the law of libel , jurisdictions foreign to each other . Yet there have been several cases of the arrest of persons against whom a complaint of libel had been brought when they incautiously ventured within the jurisdiction of the courts before which the complaint was made . One such case , which many people will remember , was that of Mr. DANA , the editor of the Sun , who went to Philadelphia after his paper had published some free and personal criticism of sundry citizens of Pennsylvania , and was there arrested . Another case is that of Mr. SAMUEL BOWLES , the editor of the Springfield Republican , who once spent a night in Ludlow-Street Jail at the instance , as we remember , of the late JAMES FISK , Jr . Both Mr. DANA . and . Mr. BOWLES thought they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Mr. DANA proposed that New-York should declare war against Pennsylvania for the outrage : to which he had been subjected. , nor that Mr. BOWLES insisted that Massachusetts should invade New-York . Yet there was really as much cause for a war between these States , on account of these arrests , as there is for a war between the United States and Mexico over the case of CUTTING .. Nobody wishes for such a war , unless it be the Texan roughs and criminals , for whom CUTTING appears to be the appropriate spokesman . There should be no special difficulty in the withdrawal of our demand for the surrender of CUTTING . It appears that the Secretary of State was misled into making the demand . by the official report of the case sent to him by our Consul at Paso del Norte . Mr. BRIGHAM may have been in turn deceived by CUTTING . If the demand should . be promptly withdrawn , no harm would ensue , not even if the roughs and criminals on the Mexican side should . declare that the United States had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Mexico . Our Government might perhaps see to it that CUTTING was provided with counsel , but in this respect he seems to have been very - well served as it is . In fact , the - whole proceeding in court , as it is reported , seems to have been orderly and dignified , and there is no evidence of any other intention on the part of the court than to administer justice . It is possible that in view of the international aspects of the case the Mexican Judge will be moved to impose a lighter penalty than he would inflict if CUTTMG were a Mexican , though we can not demand . that ho shall do so . In this way CUTTING may derive some benefit from his American citizenship . Whatever benefit he gets from it will be more than he deserves . He is personally entitled to no more consideration than if he had . been running stolen horses from Mexico into Texas , and , having been caught on his return to steal more , had wrapped himself in the American flag and . called on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
