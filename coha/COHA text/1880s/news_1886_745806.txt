txt When the New-York and Chicago limited reached the Union Station at 6:15 o'clock this morning a boy about 18 years old was discovered lying between the truck and the bottom of a sleeping car . He had traveled this way from Fort Wayne , a distance of 320 miles . He . gave his name as P. A. Schell , of No. 106 State-street , N. E. , Washington , D. C. , and told the following story : " For eight months I have been working at Bass 's foundry , in Fort Wayne , as a molder . ' Yesterday a dispatch informed me that my mother is seriously ill . I bad no money , every cent having gone for board , so that there was nothing left but to steal a ride . I went to the station last evening at 9 o'clock , and when the bell rang for the train to start I jumped on the front truek of the second car of the limited , and in a second we were off . I sat on the brake beam , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms on top of the frame to steady myself , and my feet were supported by the brake rod . Every time they shut down brakes to stop I crawled over the top of the frame into the middle of the trucks and held on to the cross rods . Once my feet slipped and dragged on the ground . I then thought I was gone , but I held on like grim death and managed to get my legs up again on the brake rod . At Crestline and Alliance the train stopped to change engines , and for an inspection of the trucks . When the inspectors came to the truck where I was I rolled over against the wheel on the opposite aide and escaped detection . it was hard riding . I can tell you , but still I would rather travel in that way than on the bumper of a freight train . " A purse was made up for the boy , the railroad official furnished him with a half-fare ticket , and he started for his home on an afternoon train .
