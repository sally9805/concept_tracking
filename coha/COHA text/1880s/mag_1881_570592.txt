Henry Boynton Smith : His Life and Work . Edited by his wife . New York : A. C. Armstrong &amp; Son . 1881 . A FEW months ago , we called the attention of our readers to a review of the story of the life of Dr. Charles lodge as related by his eldest son . Almost at the same time at which this story was given to the public , there appeared a record of Professor Henry B. Smith 's career , written in loving remembrance of him by his wife . These two widely-honored and representative men died in the years 1877 and 1878 , and the two memorial volumes , presenting before the reader the description of their characters and work , recall to mind very impressively the loss which befell the Presbyterian Church through their removal , at an interval of only eighteen months the one from the other , from the scenes of their earthly labors . Dr. lodge was a native of- Philadelphia , and a resident during all his active life of the state of New Jersey . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought which was at home in the region where he lived . Dr. Smith , on the other hand , was a New England man , with a New England education . He was a gift from our own part of the country to the church which , in later years , he so faithfully served , and his intellectual life was largely influenced by the surroundings of his childhood and youth . The Biographies of two such men must be read with interest by all who study the progress of the Church in our country or the history of religious thought and discussion . The object of the present Article is merely to give a brief review of the volume whose pages tell us of the life and work of the second of these two prominent men-Dr . Henry B. Smith . Dr. Smith was born in Portland , Maine , on the twenty-first of November , 1815 . His father was a merchant of honorable position in society and of high character . His mother was of a family of somewhat greater prominence , several of whose members or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to have inherited some of the finer elements of his intellectual nature , as well as much of the grace and gentleness which adorned his character . She died , however , when he was but five years old , leaving him only the gift of her mind and heart as passing from a mother to a son , and her solemn dedication of him to God , who was calling her away from her children to Himself . His home education was under the charge of a second mother , whose marriage with his father took place four years later , and thus before he had passed beyond the limits of early childhood . She seems to have been to him as nearly all that his own mother could have been , had she lived , as was possible for any one who entered upon a new relationship of such peculiar responsibility . The affection and esteem which were given to her by his brothers and himself for half a century afterwar*1s , testify most fully to her loving care , her faithfulness in her training of their minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their welfare even until she was called to see them all enter the other life before herself . Of his boyhood we have but a brief record . What we have , however , is sufficient to show that he began , even then , to exhibit those mental characteristics which marked his later life . His second mother says , that , when she first entered the household , he was " a bright , beautiful boy , gentle , good-tempered , obedient and lovely ; so fond of reading that we found it difficult to induce him to take sufficient exercise , and had to resort to many expedients to keep him from books " Of a little later period , when he had already begun to attend the academy in his native town , she says : " He made rapid progress in all his studies . He studied in the family sitting . room , at the table at which we were all seated talking , and often some one reading aloud an interesting book ; it never seemed to disturb him , though , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us parts of what we had said or read " " He read everything , every book and paper that he could find ; we could not restrain him . He read rapidly ; he said to me , How is it that I often read sixty pages in an hour , and yet , when I try , it always takes me more than a minute to read a page ? ' He read understandingly , and remembered with wonderful accuracy , his perceptions were so quick and his memory so retentive . // He said to me once : It seems to me that I have boxes in my head where I put things to remember , and shut them up and open each one when I want the thing in it . ' His power of abstraction and concentration was very discernible even at that early age . " The testimony of his teachers , and of others who knew him at that period , is of a similar character . It is evident that the boy was father to the man . His acquaintance and students in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1850 to 1877. saw in him the same abstraction and concentration , the same love of reading everything , the same power to grasp the substance of books , the same wonderful memory . They recognized the existence of all those mental gifts which nature had bestowed upon him , just as his friends of the earlier days had done . If they recognized them with greater clearness , it was because they perceived the results which these gifts had brought to him so largely , as life advanced . For one who consecrates himself to the scholar 's work , the value of such powers can not be over-estimated . There is no forgetting of the past , while one is reaching out towards the future and what has not yet been secured . There is no loss while the student is giving himself to any subject , by reason of the pressing in upon his attention of that which lies beyond its limits . It was with an understanding of his intellectual powers in their striking peculiarities , that his father prophesied respecting him , before his maturity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a professor in some theological or literary institution ; that he will be a maker of books I have no doubt . " lit is noticeable , also , that his father speaks of " metaphysics and philosophy " as " the subjects best adapted to his tastes . " There were indications in his very nature , and in the enthusiasms of his educational period , which showed what he must become . Beyond what is true of most men , the design of God for his work in the world was manifested from the beginning . After a few years of school life , he entered Bowdoin College in the autumn of 1830 , when he was not quite fifteen years of age . Here he had a prominent position among his classmates as a scholar , and was graduated with honor . Having become a Christian in the latter part of his college course , he at once decided to be a minister of the Gospel . In ordei- to prepare // himself for this work , he entered the Theological Seminary at Andover , in 1834 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then passing a few months at Bangor , he was appointed to the office of tutor in Bowdoin College in the summer of 1836 . In this office he continued for two years . It was at this time that he became known to us through the report of an older friend and relation , who entered the college as a student in the same summer . Though in the years of early ! *hildhood then , we well remember the words of admiration with which our friend spoke of Tutor Smith , as the one who stimulated his mind and enlarged his views beyond any other teacher whom he had known . It is only four or five years ago that we heard from a classmate of this friend , a gentleman who has r*ow risen to a position among the first scholars of the country , a similar testimony to the sentiment with which Mr. Smith was then regarded by his pupils . The college boy 's report and the words of the man to whom the college days were long since passed were the same-in grateful remembrance that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With such natural endowments* such abundant acquisitions , and such ability as an instructor , his career might have been supposed to be assured . Success , it would seem , must be certain for a man so worthy of it , and an honorable place must soon present itself to his acceptance . But , unhappily , the weakness of his physical system was unequal to the work for which his mind was so richly prepared . He had been only a few months at Andover , in the season following his college graduation , when he was prostrated by illness , and a dark cloud was spread over all his hopes . This illness yielded , indeed , to time and the remedies employed , so that he was able , during the following year , to resume his studies , and also to engage in teaching , as we have seen . But the power of disease was still present , and was ready to display its energy whenever the incitements of study should lead him to overstrain his bodily strength . It can not be thought strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frame should have been attended , as it went on for two years , with much depression of spirits , or that the future , which had so much possibility of fruit , should have come at length to appear full of disappointment and darkness . // So far had disease and depression affected him in the latter part of the year 1837 , that he felt it necessary to leave his college work . It was deemed best for him to spend a year abroad , in the hope that a change of scene and climate might be of service . But the hope was not strong , and his nearest college friends , the biographer tells us , feared , as they *parted from him when he sailed , that they might never look upon his face again . The lonely voyage , which in those days extended over weeks , must have been filled with many anxious thoughts and gloomy forebodings for the young scholar himself . Life seemed to be closing its doors upon him just as it had opened them to so much of beauty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one for multitudes throughout our land , as many now living distinctly remember . But to Henry B. Smith , and to those who were interested in him and his future , it was especially dark . The news which came from him from week to week was full of doubt and uncertainty . The struggle for health , which had been going on so long , appeared still to be an unequal one . Failure seemed to be the threatening of the early future . At length , however , the new life , together with his resolute will and his hope never quite extinguished , began to give him strength . He grew better slowly as time passed on , and , after remaining in Paris for several months , he went to Germany , and there entered upon a course of study . The German universities with which he was connected were those of ilalle and Berlin . At the former he was brought into a familiar acquaintance with Professor Tho. luck , whose friendship for him became very strong and continued until the close of their lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their different countries , died in the same year , 1877 , forty years after their first meeting . In Berlin , Neander was the most prominent among the professors , whose lectures he heard . But he also listened to others , then in the earlier part of their career , such as llengstenberg , and Twesten , and Trendelenburg , whose names now belong with those of a past generation , but who were in their honored advancing age when , twenty years ago , it was our privilege to be in the membership of that celebrated university . Professor Smith 's letters from Germany , and the extracts from letters of his friends , which // are given in the biography , show how well qualified he was , through mental culture , to profit by all the opportunities and advantages which were there presented to him . His foreign life was lengthened beyond his original plan to a period of two years , in accordance with his own best jctdgment and the advice of his friends . Every new month was now giving him additional strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gradual increase of bodily vigor . The intellectual stimulus of those years was never lost . In the summer of 1840 he returned LO America . He was now only twenty-five years of age . But he was better prepared than most young men of the present generation , and far better than most at that period , to enter at once upon a professorship in some college . It is evident that the German scholars whom he knew , anticipated a university life as sure to open itself before him . We find , however , that the chapter of the memorial volume , which next follows the account of his European experience , is entitled " Years of Waiting . " The shadow of his ill-health seemed not merely to extend itself over his own personal pathway , but to reach with its discouraging influence to all who heard of him . Congregations to whom he preached were satisfied , indeed , with his pulpit efforts , but they were deterred from asking him to take the pastoral office over them , because they feared that he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a similar apprehension . They were prepared to believe in his qualifications as a scholar , but his feeble health made them first doubt , then postpone their decision , and finally conclude that they could not accept him . Honorable positions appeared to be just ready for him , once and again and again , but , at the moment when hope was almost turning into reality , disappointment came . Two years passed away , and he was still waiting . His expectations grew fainter , and finally he wrote these sad words : " The future , so dark and uncertain , no place in prospect , the doubts whether I can ever be settled anywhere , the necessity to my peace of mind of some quiet sphere of duties , the long delay , the harassing anxiety . * * * Altogether , I sometimes feel wretched . May God forgive me for this doubt and repining . " It was , indeed , the hour of darkness . But the darkest hour came , as it so often // does in human experience , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first , but it was light , and his subsequent life showed that it was to grow steadily brighter for many years . Near the close of the year 1842 , when he was just twentyseven , he was called to the pastorate of ' the Congregational church in West Amesbury , a little town in the northeastern *corner of Massachusetts . A few weeks afterwards , he was united in marriage with Miss Elizabeth L. Allen , the eldest daughter of iRev . William Allen , D.D. , who had been the president of Bowdoin College when he was a student there , but was now residing in Northampton , Mass . A settlement in such a village was a small beginning indeed , when we consider what he accomplished afterwards , and what his admiring friends thought him fitted to accomplish even at that time . He had , however , a genuine love f'or the work of the ministry . The disheartening experience which had recently been so closely connected with his continued ill health , as well as the natural taste of a quiet scholar , made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sphere of his labor was very limited , it offered him a home , opportunity for study , the possibility of doing good , and the satisfaction of feeling that life 's active and effective work was no longer delayed . It was to the credit of the people of his congregation , who were farmers and mechanics , that they appreciated his preaching and were unwilling to give him up when he was called to a more conspicuous position . It was equally to his own credit , that he won the affection of his hearers by his life among them , while he gained their admiration for his powers as an intellectual man . The four years which he spent in this village were years of faithful service to others , resulting in the growth and advancement of the church . As Professor E. A. Lawrence remarks , in a letter quoted by the biographer , " Professor Smith 's short pastorate in that country parish was a blessing to the people , the influence of which will never cease ; and it was the open door to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his residence in West Amesbury to the Theological Seminary at Andover , and the reputation which he had acquired at Bowdoin College , soon drew the attention of teachers and literary men to him as a man of no ordinary character . The hesitation // respecting his ability for continuous working passed away when he was seen to be a successful preacher and pastor . It became evident very speedily , that he would not be allowed long to remain in a village church , but would be summoned to a larger field of labor and influence . Before a year had elapsed from the time of his settlement , he received an invitation to the professorship of rhetoric at Amherst College . This invitation he declined , indeed , though it was urged upon him strongly by his friends , but it was a sign and foreshadowing of what was to come . Four years later , a more attractive chair in the same institution-that of mental and moral philosophy-was offered to his acceptance . At this time he could scarcely hesitate as to his final decision . He honestly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the course of duty plain before him . As he knew himself , he knew that the new call was a divine summons to his true life-work . With a kindly farewell to the little church , accordingly , he left his village pastorate , and became a college teacher . The work at Amherst proved to be only a temporary one . Providence was leading him to another place , and to a sphere of influence of which he then had not even the remotest thought . But the brief period in the college was a stage in the wiselyordered plan of his life . It was a time of more complete prep . aration for what was destined for him in the future . He went to Amherst in October , 1847 . Almost immediately he began to impress the students with the vigor of his intellect , the breadth of his acquisitions , and his enthusiasm as a scholar . President Seelyc says ; " When I became a daily attendant upon his recitations , I well recall my early sense of his gentleness , his quiet simplicity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready power to us&amp; , without the least ostentation , and the unaf. fected interest evident at once in all his pupils and their work . Week by week , there grew in the minds of his pupils , a deeper sense of his scholarship , his insight , his comprehensive grasp of things , and , more than all , his unwearied interest that every one receiving his instructions should grow in knowledge and in grace . If we criticised him it was for giving us so much that we could not always digest it . " Professor F. A. March , who was at that time a tutor in the college , writes in a similar strain . // It was evident that the students felt that a new order of teacher was among them in this branch of study , which stimulates and enlarges the mental powers more than any other . They saw that he was a man adequate to his work . They knew that he could meet their wants from the stores of his learning , and could lead them wisely in their investigations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " lie was eminently successful . He did not expend much strength in cross-questioaing to bring out the ignorance of the students , nor did he very much labor to enforce his own views by reiterating and enlarging . I think of him oftenest as a sower with his hands full of good seed . He seemed always watching to drop some seed-thought suited to the soil . It was a great matter with him to stimulate research . He gave out written essays on topics which required much reading and thinking , and he sought personal intercourse with the abler men , directing their reading and thinking , stimulating them to ambitious efforts for the grasping of great truths and systems of philosophy , and giving them high ideals of eminence in original investigations . " Referring to the occasions on which such essays were read before the class , President Seelye adds : " Sometimes we had half a day assigned for these exercises , and , untrammeled by the limits of the recitation hour , we took what time seemed well for the discussion assigned . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professor did not halt , and his remarks were always so ready , and withal so rich , that I do not think I ever heard any one complain because the exercises had been too long . " It is clear that such a man had not mistaken duty , when he left the narrow limits of a farming village to take his place as a helper and guide to young men in the last portion of their college life . The stimulus of his example and his teaching would have been lost to many an earnest mind preparing for the higher spheres of usefulness , if the professor 's chair had been declined . He was a preacher of recognized ability , and a useful pastor , but his true place was in a University or a Theological School . To those who look back upon his career from the end , it can not be questioned that the latter of these two was even a more appropriate home for him than the former . The summons to the Theological School was not long de . // layed . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removal to Amherst , a committee of gentlemen from the city of New York called upon him , to ask his acceptance of the Professorship of Church History in Union Theological Seminary . The question of his yielding to their request was pondered for a long time and with many doubts . But , at length , near the close of the year , he committed himself to the new work , and in January , 1851 , he removed his family and his home to the city where the remainder of his life was to be passed . The Seminary had , at that time , been in existence about fourteen years . It had , however , not yet attained its greatest prosperity . Its future was , in some degree , problematical . Whether it could have permanent and assured success must depend largely on the wisdom , the energy , the attractiveness , the ability , and the learning of the men who should fill its chairs . It is no dishonor to the professors who were nlready in the discharge of their duties , to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come was centered in the man who , with much besitation , left the New England college to help them in their arduous wom-k . In a letter to his friend , iDr . Prentiss , written just after he had decided to take the new position , Professor Smith shows that he appieciated the difficulties of the case . He alludes very distinctly to the " unfavorable things " which presented themselves to his mind ; the fact that a teacher 's influence would not be felt as it would be in a quieter place ; the many distractions of a great city , which would tend to draw away the young men from their studies ; the want of a large and properly furnished library ; the need , which so many of our literary institutions painfully experience , of larger endowments ; the meagreness of the provision even for his own support . But at the end of his letter he says , " I am going there to work . " He accepted his professorship , knowing the peculiar hindrances which might beset him , and realizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future , but he accepted it with the spirit of a true man , resolved to labor earnestly , and to deserve success , whether he attained it or not ; resolved , also , to consecrate all labors and success to the institution in which God was now giving him his sphere of action . // The results of his work in New York can not be fully measured as yet . But enough can be seen , and even long before his death enough were seen , to show how wise was the action of the Seminary trustees in offering him the position , and how fortunate for them and for the students was his decision to accept their offer . The institution soon increased in numbers . Its library was enlarged . Its influence in the city was widened . Its reputation abroad became greater than it had ever been before . The entrance of the new Professor upon his office marked the beginning of a new era in its history . Dr. Vincent very truly remarks , in an Article from which quotations are made in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his name will be permanently identified . " Well may it be so , indeed , for , as he said himself , his life was given to it . The record of this life devoted to the interests of this prominent Theological School for nearly a generation is a simple story of faithful , unremitting , honorable work . As we read the successive chapters of the biography , we find that the life moves on quietly , with the same round of daily duties among the students , and with the same scholarly occupation in his own room . This room was his library , whose shelves were filled to overflowing , and whose treasures contributed constantly to the increase of his knowledge in every department which it represented . The testimony of all his friends is , that , in this room , he seemed to be in the very home of his soul . Here he worked with enthusiasm , year after year , and always beyond his strength . Here he acquired a measure of learning exceeding that of almost any theological scholar in the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his pupils , as they came to ask for his help in theirstudies , and to discuss with his literary and cultivated friends the subjects on which his mind was always dwelling with pleasure . " To many before me , " said Dr. Prentiss on the day of his funeral , " his library was indissolubly associated with himself . It was a counterpart of the man ; " and he adds , in the same connection , " He came as near what seems to me the ideal of the American scholar as any man I have ever known . " But , while so peculiarly at home among his books that one might have supposed his whole life would be limited by the // walls of his library , Professor Smith was , by no means , a mere student . He was a teacher , a preacher , a book-maker as well as a book-reader , a man of power for good in the Church-a man , in a word , who lived , even in the quietness of his scholarly pursuits , for the welfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same methods and the same characteristics to New York , which had marked his brief career at Amherst . The department of Church History , to which he was first called , was peculiarly adapted to his mind . One of his early pupils , writing of his mode of teaching , says : " His treatment of the subject was so different from anything we had known before-so much more scientific and thorough , that he awakened our enthusiasm and stimulated us to the uttermost . - - - It was our privilege to ask questions ; and I remember that I did not know which seemed to me the more wonderful ,  --  the greatness of his learning , which was always perfectly at his command , or the acuteness and quickness of his analytical powers . " His taste seems to have turned towards this branch of study . His teaching was always in the historical line , and hence was most effective when in the historical sphere . Yet his mind was qualified both by nature and culture for metaphysics and philosophy and the life at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Theological Seminary . His lectures on the History of Doctrines were more interesting and profitable than any which had ever been given in the country up to that time . They furnished scope for the exercise of his powers both in philosophy and history . The stimulus which they afforded to the young men in his classes was acknowledged by them all . He was allowed , however , to occupy undisturbed the chair of Church History only three years . In 1853 , when the Professorship of Doctrinal Theology became vacant , the Directors of the Seminary turned immediately to him as the one best qualified to discharge its duties . He was elected to this Professorship in 1854 . For two years he continued to give instruction in Church History in connection with his theological lectures , thus performing the work appropriate to both chairs . But at the end of this period Dr. Hitchcock was installed as his successor in the Historical professorship , and from that time onward he was the teacher of // systematic theology alone . In this department he was known to more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a considerable proportion of the ministers of the Presbyterian Church in the Middle and Western States , who are now in active work , and of many , also , within the limits of other churches . The Professorship of Doctrinal Theology has always been regarded as the leading one in our American Divinity Schools . Not improbably it always will be so . Certainly , the establishing and defending for the student the system of truth which he is to preach ; the formulating for him , or the leading him wisely to formulate for himself , the doctrines of the Gospel , is a work than which no other is more important . It was , perhaps , a fortunate thing for the Seminary with which Dr. Smith was connected , that he came to this work from the historical field . His system and his teaching were necessarily affected , in some degree , by this fact . No doubt a certain breadth of view and largeness of thought were , by this means , brought into his lectures . At the same time , there may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want of the positiveness and definiteness which a less learned man would have given to his instructions . The historical scholar becomes a critic , but , while he judges accurately of others and their opinions , he is apt to fail sometimes , in greater or less measure , when he begins to create for himself . That Dr. Smith was greater as a critic than as the formulator of a doctrinal system , has been thought by many of his contemporaries . But , if this be true , it will still be questioned whether the best and ablest portion of his pupils may not have been the gainers by reason of this peculiarity in their teacher . He was able to present before them a wide survey of theological opinion , and to guide them so that they could move safely among all the varying shades of doctrine , and find for themselves a resting place in the truth . There can , at least , be no doubt that , as a theological instructor in this most interesting and essential branch of his science , he gained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lectures . In a letter addressed to him just before his departure for Europe in 1869 , when his health had so failed as to compel him to seek absolute rest from his work , we find the following words written in the name of all the students of // his class : " We have been led along by you clearly , in paths which are so often difficult and unsatisfactory . We have found you in the midst of conflicting views , taking a media via , gathering from each side the truths , and establishing a system honest and pure , which tended to unite all , and lift all into a closer communion with God , and a clearer appreciation of ' Him and His relations to us . The advance of each day has unfolded more and more the beauty of your plan , and quickened our interest . Others have made religion yield to philosophy . You have shown to us that there is no real conflict between them . A teacher to whom these words could be truthfully and heartily applied must have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labors for the Theological Seminary , Dr. Smith 's most conspicuous service to the branch of the Church with which in his later years he was associated , was his effort to bring about the reunion of its long divided sections . Indeed , we can hardly regard this effort as separated from his labors on behalf of the Seminary . Not improbably among his earliest reflections upon the subject , and the earliest incentives to exert himself for the accomplishment of the end , may have been the thought that , through the union of the Church , a greater sphere of usefulness or a greater measure of success would be given to the institution to which he had consecrated his life . The result has proved , beyond doubt , that by this means the institution has been strengthened , and so farseeing a mind as he had must , as it would seem , have understood from the beginning that it could not be otherwise . If he did understand it , however , and if he thus labored for the larger object with this lesser one also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seminary may be , for this reason in addition to many others , most fitly perpetuated in the minds of all its friends . But the service which he rendered to the Church , in this crisis of its history , was of far greater moment than anything which could have been done for any single one of its institutions . His exertions contributed , as perhaps those of no other single individual did , to the overcoming of the difficulties which naturally attended upon so great a work . That a reunion was desirable was apparent to a large proportion of the clergy and laity of both parties in the denomination . But // many doubted the wisdom of the movement and the possibility of harmony . After so many years of separation and controversy , it is no easy thing to bring discordant sections and schools together . The obstacles are felt to exist , long after the reason for their existence has ceased . The inheritance of an old strife abides with those who had themselves no part in it . But Dr. Smith believed that the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty years before ; and he determined to accomplish the end , if it were possible to do so . He threw himself into the work with all his energy and the exertion of all his mental power . By persuasion , by speeches , by resolutions , by able articles , he strove to bring Old School men and New School men alike to acknowledge that there was no longer any ground for their antagonistic attitude . Though opposed by no less eminent persons than Dr. Charles lodge , he would not yield to the thought of failure . He had no doubt that he ought to be successful . He labored as if he had no doubt that success was just before him . At length , in 1868 , he was permitted to see the beginning of the end . The votes in the Assemblies of both sections of the Church in this year made it certain that they would ere long come together . Writing from Harrisburg , where the New School Assembly met at that time , he says , " The iReunion Report has passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ** ** Everybody , almost , is delighted at the result , also at that in the Old School , so far as it goes , better , I confess , than I had expected . " " Next year , " he adds , " the Assembly meets in our church Dr. Prentiss 's , and the Old School in Murray's* ' both in the city of New York . This sentence was the sure prophecy of the future . But the actual fulfillment of the prophecy he did not witness . Ill health had again forced him to leave his work and cross the ocean for a long sojourn in Europe , before the meetings of the Assemblies to which he alludes were held , in the following year . Those who were present , however , and participated in the proceedings acknowledged fully and heartily his part in the work . Dr. Skinner wrote to him : " No man has done as much as you have in consummating our glorious reunion . I sympathize with the high rejoicing with which your soul can not but be filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Dr. Adams said : " The reunion is un fait accompli . You were missed by all ; very frequent mention was made of your name both in public and private . All feel that no one has done more than you to bring about reunion . " Dr. McCosh , in sending him notice of an honorary degree conferred upon hin by Princeton College , used these fitting words , as coming* from the other branch of the Church : " This is no honor to you , but it is an expression of esteem on our part , and may be regarded as an earnest of the reality of the Presbyterian Union , for which you have done so much . " In connection with this most important part which Dr. Smith had in the matter of the Reunion , it is interesting to recall the fact to which allusion has been already made ; - that he was a New England man , with a New England education . He had entered the Presbyterian Church from the Congregational body , and he naturally was free from those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had been born in one or the other of the opposing sections of Presbyterianism . He was , therefore , more easily disposed than they to see the advantages and blessings of union , and to esteem as of little moment the obstacles in the way of its consummation . No one could have been , in these respects , better prepared for this great undertakin* than he was by his previous training and the associations of his early years . Moreover , his theological tendencies and opinions fitted him for the same work . He pursued the middle pathway between the two extremes , rather than the course to which either party would have called him in its own exclusive interest . At the same time , the influence of his education led him to the New School body , as the company with which to join himself and thus to those among whom the desire for Reunion was most readily developed . New England has given many gifts of blessing to the Presbyterian Church , as her sons have found their work within its borders . But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the efforts of Henry B. Smith accomplished this great result . As a preacher , Dr. Smith was held in high reputation . The philosophical character of his mind , his extensive learning , his clear and polished style , his evident love of truth , combined to give him power with the most cultivated audiences . He was // always ready to preach . More than one of the churches in New York were under obligations to him for repeated services rendered in times of their special need , or when they were without a pastor . The church where Dr. Prentiss ministered for a number of years , and Dr. Vincent now ministers , was brought to a vigorous condition , in its early days , very largely by his efforts . No one who listened to him could fail to feel that he was a man of uncommon ability . In the making of books , he was a true scholar . The Tables of Church History , which he prepared , are a testimony to his indefatigable energy , to his accurate and wide learning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edition of Gieseler 's great work on the History of the Church , was a service of much importance to students of theology , and his revision of Stier 's book on the Words of our Lord , introduced it to American readers in its most useful form . He had a laige share in the establishment and editorial care of the American Theological Review . This Review took rank , from the beginning , among the best of our Theological Quarterlies . For its pages he wrote many of his most able and vigorous articles , a number of which were published in 18Th in a volume which has been most favor . ably received by leartied men , both in our own country and in England . It is to be regretted , however , that he could not have written some extended work , which should have passed onward his influence more fully to another generation . He was a scholar after the order of those who have taken a high rank in Germany . He labored as faithfully and constantly as they have ever done . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while he did an honorable work as a man of learning , he left too little of results behind him to satisfy the desires of his admiring friends . They would gladly have had a more permanent monument of his life 's labor in some epochmaking book from his pen . The story of *r . Smitb 's last years , as given in the closing chapters of the Biography , is a sad one . He returned from Europe in the latter part of the year 1870 , after a two years effort for the restoration of his health . At first he was encouraged , and entered upon his duties in the Theological Seminary with much of hope and enthusiasm . But the feeble body bad // been too long strained by the busy labors of years . Every attempt which he made to carry forward continuously his Seminary work failed after a short season . The intervals of illness became longer as time passed on ; the periods of working became shorter . Disappointment returned again and again , until , at length , it was manifest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1874 , he resigned his professorship-his friends and himself alike realizing that he was unable to meet the demands which it made upon his strength . The Directors of the Seminary , though they declined to sever his connection with the institution altogether , accepted his resignation and gave the place which he had so long filled to another . This action of theirs could not but be a bitter trial , though he knew that it came from God and accepted it in submission . " I am looking away more and more , " he says to an intimate friend , soon after his letter of resignation was written , " I am looking away more and more from the incidents and accidents , and trying to read God 's purpose in it , and that seems to me clear . * * * I have no special fear about the future ; the Lord will provide . " Yet , submissive as he was to the Providential ordering of his life in this trying crisis , he could not escape altogether the depressing influence of the clouds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved must go forward without him as its central power . The plans of working and usefulness which always filled his mind , must yield to his physical weakness . Life , as he was compelled to confess , was almost wholly behind him ; his studies and labors Were near their ending . Hope , indeed , rose for a time , with every temporary increase of strength , and energy was renewed almost before the first signs of improvement in health . But it was the flickering of a light that was dying away . The passing months carried with them , as they fled , more and more of his vital power . And yet , notwithstanding all , his work was carried forward , both for the Seminary and in the literary field , to a degree which seems wonderful as we now think of his condition . lie undertook the preparation of new lectures , he even accepted the appointment to a new lectureship in the Seminary , on the Evidences of Christianity , he kept up his living interest in the library of the institution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
