txt It would be difficult to estimate the commercial value and probable profits of a canal on the Nicaragua route , even if one were assured that there would be no competition . With another canal already in process of construction the problem becomes more formidable . Moreover , if we assume that the Panama Canal will be completed , upon what terms would the proposed Nicaragua Canal compete with it ? The Panama Canal will be less than 50 miles long , and it will have only one lock  --  a tidal lock at one of the termini ; but the Nicaragua Canal from shore to shore will be 185 miles in length , and the passage of vessels will be delayed by ten or fifteen locks . If both should be completed , which of the two would be preferred by the world 's trade ? Inasmuch as a great part of the shipping using a canal would be carrying American products between American ports or from an American port to a foreign port , it is believed that the Nicaragua Canal would be favored by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it a shorter route could be found , and because sailing vessels using it would avoid the region of calms that lies west of the Isthmus of Panama . But if the locks should greatly delay passage , as compared with the Panama route , the advantage in distance might be in that way offset , and the calms have no terrors for steam vessels that are driving sails out of the world 's carrying trade . For vessels plying between New-York and San Francisco the Nicaragua route would be shorter than the Panama route by 430 miles ; for vessels plying between NewOrleans and San Francisco it would be shorter by 530 miles . Estimates made by competent persons and the history of the Suez Canal show that one interoceanic canal built at any reasonable cost would be profitable . It is a question , however , whether either one of two competing canals , would ' pay . Fourteen years after the completion of the Suez Canal the maximum estimate of tonnage-6,000,000 tons was reached , and it became necessary to provide for doubling the capacity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only $6,112,129 , the canal having cost $95,000,000 . In 1883 the revenue was nearly $14,000,000 . The dividend in 1882 was 17 per cent. , and it is predicted that in 1890 it will be 30 per cent . The stock stands at nearly four times its par value . The estimates of the amount of business that would be done by an isthmian canal vary greatly . The promoters of the Panama Canal talked about 6,000,000 tons at $3 a ton , and a net annual profit of $11,000,000 . Estimates more recently made by the supporters of the Men ocal concession were in the neighborhood of 3,000,000 tons , and the rate proposed was $2 50 a ton . Gen. GRANT held , three years ago , that 4,000,000 tons of merchandise found their way from the Pacific coast of North and South America eastward by way of the Cape . A canal would shorten the journey from San Francisco to Liverpool by 6,000 miles , and the trip from Liverpool to Callao by 4,374 miles . Placing the cost of the canal at $75,000,000 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of $10,000,000 and a net income of $8,500,000 . On the other hand , Mr. NIMMO , of the Bureau of Statistics , reported two or three years ago that at that time a canal would attract about 1,625,000 tons . If the canals should be built , and if the Nicaragua route should afford a reasonably expeditious passage , it would probably take all of the trade by water between our ocean coasts . The Panama Canal would at least hold the trade between Europe and the west coast of South America . How the remaining trade would be divided no one can tell . If the , Nicaragua Canal should get a fair share of the total interoceanic trade its tolls would undoubtedly in course of time pay a fair interest on the money invested , for its original cost would be much less than the cost of the Panama ditch . Bearing in mind the great obstacles to be overcome at Panama , the amount of money already expended there , and the quantity of work done , it is safe to say that the cost of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may reach $400,000,000 . With so great a sum invested competition in Nicaragua would be a serious matter for Panama stockholders . In short , if both canals shall be built the chances are that the Panama Canal will not " pay , " from the stockholder 's point of view , and that the Nicaragua Canal will not only pay in course of time , but also be of great value to this Nation in a higher commercial sense .
