Wrnu* only one bushel in seven of the wheat crop of the United States is received by the Produce Exchange of New York* its traders buy and sell two for every one that comes out of the ground . When the cotton plantations of the South yielded less than six million bales , the crop on the New York Cotton Exchange was more than thirty-two millions . Oil wells are uncertain , but the flow on the Petroleum Exchanges of New York , Bradford , and Oil City never hesitates . Pennsylvania does well to run twenty-four millions of barrels in a year , but New York city will do as much in two small rooms in one week , and the Petroleum Exchanges sold altogether last year two thousand million barrels .

One million dollars ' worth a day of new stocks and bonds is needed in prosperous years to supply the demands of the New York Stock Exchange , and its annual transactions are nearly thrice the taxable valuation of all the personal property in the United States .

These Exchanges are the creameries of the world of labor . The prices of the speculative wheat and the spectral hog of the Board fix those of the real wheat and the actual hogof the field . The negro planter of Georgia who raises his bale and a half must sell it for what the Cotton Exchange says it is worth .

The " Free Breakfast Table " pays tribute to some clique , whether railroad pool , trades-union , match monopoly , coal combination , pottery tariff infant , or Board of Trade corner , on pretty much everything upon it . The coffee market of the country has lately gone out of the region of unorganized supply and demand into the hands of a Coffee Exchange , with all the modern improve. - ments for speculation . A price factory to make the quotations of butter and cheese has just been established in New York . It deals in brokers ' , eggs as well as hens ' eggs , and has all the approved facilities to enable it to count and sell the chickens that are not yet hatched out of eggs that are not yet laid .

These Exchanges are cosmopolitan legislatures . Their enactments are prices , and their jurisdiction extends beyond that of Congress , Parliament , the Assembly , and the Reichstag . They are more than negative registers of prices determined by a conflux of forces external to them . Under the manipulation of cliques they have become positive agencies of mighty influence , and are the scenes of operations that menace the lives and happiness of nations . The " strong man " now builds corners instead of castles , and collects tribute at the end of a telegraph wire instead of a chain stretched across the Rhine .

The control of the machinery of the Exchanges is the control of prices , and the control of prices is the control of property . In markets where the cotton crop , and the wheat crop , and the pork product of the whole country can be turned over half a dozen or a dozen times in a year , it is an easy thing for a combination to get hold of the marketable surplus and dictate its price . The " fittest** in the trade world are those who have learned the magic art of the manufacture of prices , and the Exchanges are shifting the property of smaller men into their hands . The greatest of these price factories is the Chicago Board of Trade . Thirty years ago , its thirty-eigNt members were scouring the country back of them to persuade the farmers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , crackers , and ale were spread . out in the Board room to induce the members to attend , but for days in succession the minutes of attendance read " none . " Last year , the Board received and paid for , in cash , three hundred and eighty-two miliions of dollars ' worth of farm produce ; and the total of its transactions was not less than three thousand million dollars . It has become not only the chief of the food markets , but " the greatest speculative market in the world , " a an authority on speculation testified last winter before the // New York Legislature . It is the only market to which all the world goes to trade . Orders to buy and sell come to it daily from London , Liverpool , Glasgow , Edinburgh , Dublin , Cork* Bordeaux , Marseilles , Zurich , Havre , Antwerp , Amsterdam , Berlin , Hamburg . No other farmer has such a market as this which mobilizes and cashes the crops of the Mississippi valley . Its scores of railroads fetch and carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Yellowstone , bring the capital of the Bank of England and of the Hopes of Amsterdam to meet the farmer when he drives up to the country station with a wagon-load of grain to sell . Its telegraph wires inform him of the prices , the weather , the supply and demand of the world . Its every opinion of value is substantiated by cash . Its warehouses will hold two days ' rations for every man , woman , and child in Europe and America . Packing-houses that can , singly , kill ten thousand hogs a day in summer and twenty thousand a day in winter , are there to receive all the live-stock that the prairies may forward . A cargo of grain lately sold in Liverpool on Chicago account had to be disposed of on six months ' time . Chicago , whether in harvest-time or midwinter , will any day buy all that any one may wish to sell , and sell all that any one may wish to buy . Liverpool is , in comparison , an awkward country market , where every consignment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parcel . But here the State inspects all the grain that arrives at Chicago , and gives a ticket of quantity and quality which is a negotiable security , and passes into commerce to be sold and bought , and borrowed upon , while the wheat itself is run with more of the same kind into the graded bins of the elevators . Farmers and country grain buyers who want to take advantage of high prices , but are too busy to ship their wheat to market , can telegraph a broker on the Board to sell for future delivery . The miller , if wheat looks cheap , can buy for future delivery . These contracts are " futures . " It is by their agency alone that the strain on the banks for money to move the crops is so distributed that we do not have a commercial crisis every fall . The fellah of Egypt and the slav of Bulgaria habitually sell their growing crops while green in the field . The distance between their misery , at the mercy of their own ignorance and // the greed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmer is as good a measure as any of the unapproachable superiority of the market which fate has given to the American farmer alone of all the tillers of the soil , but which the greed of the cornering syndicates threatens to destroy . Wheat Adam Smith declares to be the least liable of all commodities to be engrossed " by the power of a few great capitals which buy it all up , " because " its owners can never be collected in one place . " But that , impossible once , is easily done now by the Board of Trade . By the perfection of its apparatus and the magnitude of its transactions , it is now possible for a clique , almost in one day , to obtain speculative possession of the surplus of a crop , and to insist that it all be delivered to them within an impossible time under a ruinous penalty , or to put it out of reach , and then demand an impossible delivery under a ruinous penalty . Every " future " bushel sold must be made good by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and every purchaser of a " future " bushel must take and pay for a real bushel when the seller brings it to him . In olden times , when it was a prison offence all over Europe to buy wheat to sell again , it was the buyer who was mobbed and jailed . Nowadays , by a strange reversal of public sentiment , it is the seller who is treated with violence-that is , the " future " seller , the man who , in order to realize present prices , sells the wheat that he is holding in the country awaiting shipment , or which he expects to receive in the regular course of trade . It is obvious that , in the debate on prices on the Boards and Exchanges , both sides must be represented . There can not be cash buyers without cash sellers ; there can not be buyers of " futures " without sellers of " futures " ; there can not be prices made , stocks accumulated , and crops moved without both , and without all this there could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half the modern corner . The better half is cornering contracts . Most of the profit of corners , is made up of the damages extorted in the shape of fictitious prices from the country shippers and from the traders on the Board , for not fulfilling contracts which the syndicates have made with them , in tending to render them impossible of performance . And every such fictitious *price so made within the Board is a real price to the consumers in the world beyond the Board . // The market is in these days no longer the mystery of the few ; it is the mystery of the many . After giving men crop reports , market advices , banks , telegraphs , and brokers , it is too late to tell them not to try to use them for their legitimate profit . If the buyer helps the farmer , the seller helps the consnmer , and in the world of commerce the consumer is just as good a man as the prodncer . The " future " seller is the offspring of the modern facilities for business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its snpplies of commodities steadily flowing to him , that he could live . A highly organized market could not exist without him . No aspect of the corner is more ominous than that it aims at crippling the seller as well as the bread-eater , and with them the market in which they are as important personages as the farmer . The " wealthy criminal classes " have been qnick to seize on the Exchanges , at the risk of breaking them down , as the best of all instrnments for depredation . With the machinery of the Liverpool Cotton Exchange a year ago they stopped fifteen million spindles and took away the livelihood of thousands of men , women , and children . Hardly a month passes on the New York Produce Exchange , one of the witnesses said before the Legislative Committee investigating corners , without a corner or a squeeze . But it is the Chicago Board of Trade which offers the largest and the favorite field for the cornerer . It is willing to give or take nnllmited quantities at the figures it makes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possession of the crop that is in market and of contracts for all that is to come . The morate of the Board permits the millionaires who have solicited these contracts , and " forestalled** the market for the purpose of making others break them , to put prices to any height in order to exact fatal damages from their victims . It is the code of honor among wolves that no high-minded lamb will sqneal . The same class that administers trusts for the trustee , runs corporations to wreck the small capitals they were intended to consolidate , and finds only a private use in public franchises , is burrowing into the Board of Trade to kill trade . The passion for enslaving , forbidden by a squeamish civilization to bny men , finds a vent in capturing the raw material of human life . Corners nsed to come on the Board of Trade once in a year or two . Now there are corners almost all the time . The Chicago corner used to be the venture of some local Titan , and was felt // only within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is often the cosmopolitan work of the combined capitalists of half a dozen cities , and its effects , as the London " Times " said of the pork corner of 1880 , are felt in advancing prices all over the world . When six million bushels of wheat were handled by a syndicate , ten years ago , it was felt in predatory circles that the civilization of the nineteenth century had about reached its grandest heights ; but sixty million bushels of corn and twenty million bushels of wheat are now pocketed almost without exciting remark . Corners generally used to fail ; but the accumulated experience of many collapses has not been in vain . Such mistakes are not now made as that of the wheat corner of 1872 , which was begun in the face of the harvest and was drowned out by the rush of wheat from the farmers , who dropped all other work and dried their green wheat in stoves , pots , tin cans , anything in which it could be heated , with the result of forcing down prices on themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmers are selling the markets are kept down . It is after the crops are out of their hands that the manipnlators put prices up . The corner of last July followed upon the smallest surplus the farmers have had in their hands for many years . The Board has sometimes had rules to prevent corners , hut with the beginning of this year the corner rule was abolished through the influence of the wealthy operators . The radius of the combinations of capital to corner the crops is lengthening year by year . The great corner is still to come . The late disastrous shortages of the crops of Europe caused the machinery of the Board to be promptly set in motion . A series of corners in wheat , pork , and other articles began , which have not yet ceased , and have produced almost every kind of evil . The wheat corner of 1879 was commanded by a New Yorker . It began with an inspired chorus of prophecies of low prices , which continued as long as the clique were buying of the farmers . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bushel . When all the wheat and wheat contracts to be had were obtained , the price was raised to one dollar and thirty-three cents . In every way the results of this corner were deplorable . The markets were crazed . The cliques held , according to their own statement , twenty million bushels , and , according to the estimate of close observers in the trade , seventy million bushels // At one time , their wlieat was piled upin the elevators and on the railroad tracks , intentionally stopping the way , so that no other wheat could be got to market by the farmers and dealers . Wheat was refused to exporters at prices they could afford to pay . The English buyers went to Bombay and Calcutta ; and the EastIndies , which sent their first sample to Liverpool not ten years ago , have , in consequence , taken a place next only to us in supplying the British market . During the winter , four hundred vessels ' lay for months in New York harbor , the owners pleading for wheat , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt , and the majority of them finally had to sail away to seek cargoes elsewhere . When the time came to despatch this wheat from Chicago and New York to Europe , to put it out of the way , the head of the clique said to the railroads : " I will give you so many million bushels to carry ; if you do not take it at my rate , I will ship it all by lake in the spring . " The cutting of rates which ensued was one of the irritating causes of the war that followed among the trunk lines . In the same way syndicates have repeatedly forced the navigators of the lakes to take such rates as they chose to pay , for there was no one to compete with the engrossing shipper . Transportation , overtasked at one time and at another idle , is hopelessly deranged ; and all the banking and other business that must attend the movement of the crops goes by fits and starts . Three out of every four flouring mills of the country were kept idle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Produce Exchange prepared for the Legislature an estimate that this syndicate , by not selling , and by not letting others sell , and by fleecing those who had been inveigled into dealing with them , and by the injury that had been done to the millers , the shipping interest , the exporters , and the consumers of flour , had caused a loss to the country of not less than three hundred million dollars . The pork corner , which came at the same time as this in wheat , was described as follows by the London " Times* ' : " Amid the turmoil of the Presidential election , there has been closed one of the largest and most successful speculations which has ever excited the brain of Chicago- the Armour pork corner . Its influence in advancing prices was felt in every part of the world . A Chicago dispatch of November 5th , says : In July , 187% after one member of the firm of Armour &amp; Co. had returned from // Europe , where he had been taking observations of the pork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars a barrel ) , and in December , when it had risen to fourteen dollars a barrel , closed out , making a profit of two million dollars . Not satisfied that it had reached the highest price , they continued buying until pork had dropped to nine and a quarter dollars a barrel , absorbing their profit and an additional million . In April of this year they again began buying at ten dollars a barrel , and bought up three hundred and fifty thousand barrels of pork , and one million two hundred and fifty thousand barrels of futures . ' For the dast three months they have been closing out their gigantic purcliases at prices ranging from sixteen to eighteen and a half dollars . They cleared over seven million dollars on this deal , and are winners on the two deals to the extent of six million dollars . " ' There are giants in these days , and their caves are in the Exchanges . The price of pork was more than doubled , flour was put up an average of two dollars a barrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the result of these manipulations . This increase in the cost of living has not subsided . Pork and meat continued to advance . They were higher the next year and higher still last year , when pork sold for twenty-four dollars and seventy-five cents a barrel . Wheat , too , though it has fluctuated violently , has remained in the hands of the manipulators , and every year since the corner of 1879 , the average price the miller has had to pay has been higher than that of the year before . The universal strikes into which the laboring people have been forced in the last two years are traceable directly to the increase in the cost of living , which these corners have done so much to produce . The loss from these strikes has been incalculable . That at Pittsburg alone is estimated to have cost us at least ten million dollars . The following sentence is from a petition to Congress to which a member of the Produce Exchange personally obtained the signatures of " a thousand substantial men " : " As only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaging in these enterprises , they become essentially an array of capital against the industrial classes , wherein the banks and moneyed institutions are almost invariably drawn to the support of the former against the latter . " This is the communism of the syndicate , and it is the only communism the United States have yet produced . // One summer afternoon , a year ago , as a party of Chicag&amp; business men were idling in their yacht over the cool waters of Lake Michigan , one of them pointed out a great lake propeller shouldering its way eastward . " There goes some of our corner ' wheat to Liverpool , " he saTd . Propellers , sailing vessels , railroad cars were hurrying millions of bushels away from Chicago to put it out of the reach of the millers , the exporters , and the traders on the Board . It must , at any cost , be made scarce and dear for everybody . It was wanted for flour and as the stock-in-trade of the Board . But , as far as the bread eaters and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrown away , as the Dutch threw away the spices of the Moluccas . Such of it as Liverpool would take was sold at an average loss of ten cents a bushel , in order to extort twenty cents a bushel from the American consumer . Much of it lay for a long while stored in England unsold , while the working men and women from one end of the United States to the other question whether it is better to work for wages on which they can not live , or not to work at alL One of the " business " men of New York testified before the Corner Committee , that he sold corn to go to Europe for twenty-five cents a bushel less than he made the buyers in New York pay him . Another member of the New Produce Exchange said that he had seen the agents of the cornering cliques standing at the doors of the flour-mills bidding away the wheat that was needed for bread . None but a free people would submit to such wrongs . A great many , perhaps a majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least , corners are beneficial . They see only the high prices , though these usually are made after the grain has left their hands , or when they can not get it to market because the wheat of the clique stops the way . During the Chicago wheat corner of 1872 , the elevators combined to rent out their bins and keep them empty in order to prevent any more of the farmers ' crops from coming to market to embarrass the cornerers . High prices were paid during a short-lived excitement , but they were more than offset by the break that followed . The men most injured in that corner , aside from the consumer , were , as in most corners7 those who buy from farmers at the country stations and make up car-loads to ship to the city . These men had bought large quantities of wheat , which they had sold for " future " delivcry at prices that would have paid them only a fair profit . The // collapse of the corner inflicted upon them a loss of thirty and forty cents a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them the accumulations of years of patient trading , during which many of them had never made a speculative deal , though they were often " future " sellers . The commercialreports of the Chicago papers show that , during the corner of 1881 , shipments were stopped , elevators gorged , the lake marine paralyzed , sailors and laborers thrown out of work , and a blockade of the entire grain business threatened . Receivers of grain were ruined , and so lured into speculation . " Some of the houses which have bought and sold most heavily for speculative customers , " said a Chicago journal at the beginning of 1882 , " have been those who , previous to last midsummer , had done very little except in buying and selling for actual exchange between the producer and the consumer . " The commercial editor of one of the leading New York dai . lies , who had been on the Produce Exchange for eleven years , says : " Since these corners began , there is a large proportion of merchants who had a good receiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all their business from the cliques . At the time I went on the Exchange , there was not a broker in the grain trade , except those who bought and sold actual stuff for export . Now there are a few of these , and , I should judge , over one.haf or three-fourths of the members engaged in the grain trade are men who were once engaged in legitimate business out of which they have been driven by corner operations . " If there was any advantage to the farmer from such operations it would not be a natural advantage , but there is no advantage . These corners put prices down when the farmers want to sell , and put them up when the miller needs to buy . They exaggerate gambling by intensifying the fluctations of price and they cripple legitimate business . They derange the rail , lake , and ocean transport of the farmers ' crops to market . They drive away the foreign buyers to patronize the Hindoo ryot , who is happy , our Consul at Calcutta says , if he can earn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legitimate dealers on the Board into brokers and claquers for the syndicates . They will surely , if unchecked , destroy the Board , which , with all its faults , is the finest piece of mechanism commerce has yet invented , and without which the American . farmer could not retain his cominand of almost antipodal markets . The farmer who thinks cor // ners are a benefit should consider well the fate of the oil producer at the hands of the oil corner , which has become one of the established institutions of the country . The cornerer is a middle-man who leaves nothing for the end-men . The most remarkable fact in the development of these Exchanges , that which completes the corner , is still to be pointed out . One of the managers of the New York Produce Exchange told a committee of the New York Legislature that , if the State should pass a law the Exchange did not like , and a member attempted to take advantage of it , they would expel him , and he added that men were constantly turned out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compelled , contrary to their by-laws , whether they desire to do so or not , to submit their differences with their fellows to the summary tribunal of a committee of members , perhaps interested parties , and forego recourse to the law . When the proceedings by which the New York Stock Exchange expelled Mr. W. J. Hutchinson last year , whether justly or not is beside our purpose , were taken into court , the President of the Exchange refused , day after day for months , to answer any of the inquiries of the court as to the action of the Exchange . A member had been deprived of his seat , worth thirty thousand dollars , and his means of livelihood ; but the Exchange insisted that neither in this nor in anything else was it subject to the jurisdiction of the courts . The New York Stock Exchange , which is the most powerful instrumentality in the world of finance , thus took its stand outside the law . The courts have decided that the seat of a member is property that can be seized by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creditors who seized Mr. Ketcham 's seat have been trying for three years to sell it . Those who might buy are given to understand that the Exchange does not recognize the right of the courts to make any such decision , and will nullify it by refusing to accept the purchaser as a member , when he comes up for his election , which is ordinarily a matter of course . The courts of Illinois , hastening to do for the Board of Trade what the New York Stock Exchange is trying to do for itself , have decided that seats in the Board , which are every week bought and sold , are not property . The social consequences of this status of these Exchanges scarcely need be pointed out . These are the greatest markets in the world , but they are not open markets . No one can come in who comes in by way of the law . No one can remain who summons // an associate before the courts of justice , under the delusion that there is no spot under the Constitution where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public must buy its securities of the Stock Exchange ; the world must go to the Board of Trade to buy its food , and the American farmer must sell his crops there . But , for all that , they claim to be " voluntary associations , " intrenched within lines picketed against the law . The sovereignty to which the Produce Exchange and the Stock Exchange aspire has been conferred upon the Chicago Board of Trade by an unbroken line of decisions by the Supreme Court of Illinois . Year after year , those who have been cornered on the Board by its rich syndicates have appealed to the Supreme Court , sometimes for prevention of the wrong , sometimes to remedy it .. The monotonous response of the judges has been that the Board was a voluntary association , and that it was not amenable to the courts . The latest decision , just handed down , is a complete abdication of all the rights of the State to exercise any judicial supervision over this corporation , though created by it . Its effects will be felt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a barrel of Chicago pork seeks a consumer . The victims of the wheat corner of last July appealed to the court for help on these grounds : ( 1 . ) That , expecting to receive the wheat and intending to deliver it , they had bargained to supply it to certain persons , who had secretly formed a clique , and who , in order to make the performance of their contracts impossible , as well as to extort an outrageous price from the public , had bought up all the wheat in the market , and ten million bushels more . ( 2 . ) That the clique had done this , criminally andfraudulently , and then demanded ruinous damages of them , under the guise of fictitious prices . ( 3 . ) That they had been compelled by the Board against their will to submit the settlement of this claim to a special tribunal of the Board , outside the arbitration committee . ( 4 . ) That this tribunal was instituted in violation of the constitution of the State , the charter of the Board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That it had not been made up even as required by this // by-law , and that its procedure had not followed the rules of the Board . ( 6 . ) That it had excluded necessary evidence , had admitted improper evidence , and had been guilty of gross misconduct and fraud . ( 7 . ) That it had made an unjust decision contrary to the rules of the Board and the laws of the land , awarding heavy damages to those who , by conspiracy , had made it impossible for them to fulfill their contracts . ( 8 . ) That from this decision there was no appeal . ( 9 . ) That unless the court would immediately interfere to prevent the Board from acting on this decision , they must either pay these cruel and fictitious damages or be expelled without charges , trial , or notice ; be deprived of their membership in the only Exchange where they could carry on their business , worth at least $15,000 a year to them ; that their seats , worth $3,800 each , would be taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital of the Board-$200,000 --   --  and its surplus of $275,000 ; and that the consequences of this , to them , their families , their reputation , and their business , would be irreparable , and not to be made good by any money compensation . To all these statements the Board , in serene reliance on the previous decisions of the court , made answer , in three lines , that all these things might be so , but that it was none of the court 's business ; and the court said the Board was right , and denied the petition . By this decision the court declared itself the ally of the makers of unnatural prices for food . Hundreds of thousands of dollars were paid , the next morning , to the clique as a penalty for not delivering to it wheat which was already in its possession . Nothing remains for this court but to decide that it could not interfere if the Board decreed that the bodies as well as the fortunes of the cornered should be divided up among the cornerers . It seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it is law in the whole food world . This is more than Illinois law . There are years when one man in every three in England , and one man in every twenty in France , must live on American wheat , and every one of them is deprived , by this decision , of the protection of the law in buying his food . Buyers have no rights if sellers have none . Dante saw written over the // door of hell : " All hope abandon , ye who enter here . " On the threshold of the Board of Trade , the Produce Exchange , and the Stock Exchange , is inscribed : " Your rights resign within these wails . " This ends an era . Not even the Witch of Endor could have made Adam Smith believe , when he was laboring to prove that men did not deserve to be pilloried for buying and selling wheat , that within a century trading in food would be carried on with this absolute license , in markets of this power and finish . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trader of his day , has become this palace of exchange , - capable of handling the world 's surplus in an afternoon ; fixing the price of real wheat by that of fiat wheat ; connected by telegraph with the stomachs and bank accounts of Christendom ; bringing all the owners of the crop into one place , and then overcoming them by a combination of capital , banks , and the courts ; created to apportion the food of nations , and perverted to make artificial famines ; a field for free contract , where the most profitable business is conspiracy to make the performance of contracts impossible ; a creation of the State but declared officially to be above the law . " Progress " can go no farther than this . It is of no use for generous souls in search of a Cause to take the stump for freedom of contract here . They are a century too late . The fatality of their environment is against them . Freedom has o'erlcaped herself . If courts of summary jurisdiction , picturesquely called Courts of the Dusty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was the chrysalis of the modern Exchange , they are a thousand times more necessary now when business is done by electricity . No Exchange could survive the delays of the ordinary courts . But these summary tribunals must be courts of justice , not of injustice . They are to exist only as quicker ways of affording the same remedy for wrong as would be afforded , but with less celerity , by the courts . They must not be handed over to the cliques for purposes of spoliation . The rights of the farmers , the traders , the consumers , are of too vast importance to be abandoned to tribunals above the law , and composed of the members of the guilds that allow such uses as we have described to be made of them . The members who are the " judges " of these tribunals are men preoccupied with their own business . They are ignorant of the law and the rules of evidence . They // are constantly trading in the market , and are almost certain to be interested in one way or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very cliques who appeal to them to secure the results of their own conspiracy . They are certainly swayed by the false notions of business honor and morality which prevail in these Exchanges . Contracts are sacred , but the obligation is mutual .

But their dice are loaves of bread . The chances they take are the chances of human life . Real prices all over the world rise and fall with their gambling prices . That they may play their game of forfeits inside the Board , thousands who can not get enough to eat must act tragedy outside . Civilization forms an acquiescent ring around these thugs of the Board and Produce Exchange , when it knows that every movement of their struggle within intensifies the universal struggle for existence without . It is unendurable that the courts of the Board and the courts of the State should permit one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to force the prices of bread and meat to starvation figures . By the use the Exchanges have made of this privilege of having courts of their own-which , in the case of the food markets , under pretense of settling differences among the members , literally permit them to rob the world of its daily bread - they have invited the indignant interference of the public . Summary tribunals the Stock Exchange , the Board of Trade , the Produce Exchange must have , but they must not be such tribunals as these . The trunk line railroads have put railroad civilization ahead a generation by abandoning private war and referring their quarrels to the arbitration of such a man as Charles Francis Adams , Jr. , an outsider , expert and just . Something like this must be done to civilize the combats on the Board of Trade . All the markets are being paralyzed by manipulation . They can be saved only by the establishment of tribunals , of competent and disinterested men , to settle the disputes that arise in the course of business and can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assisted , if need be , by arbitrators chosen by the disputants . They should be empowered not only to receive evidence as our judges do , but , unlike them , to send out for any // evidence that they wanted . Above all , the supremacy of the law should be acknowledged , and the sacred principle enforced that he who asks equity must do equity . If an outsider can solve railroad disputes ,  --  the most intricate that arise in any business , - Board of Trade issues can be settled as easily . Those who desire to prevent gambling and plundering from becoming the chief ends of the Exchanges can do nothing more useful than to bring them back within the jurisdiction of the law . The courts have disciplined the Common Carrier for generations ; it is time to bring the Common Trader within the fold . None but national regulation will do this effectually . If New York attempts to control the evil , it will emigrate to Chicago , and Illinois could only drive it to St. Louis . When capitalists combine irresistibly against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's combination , must take them in hand . One of the unmistakable signs of the inability of the legislative committee that recently investigated corners in New York to grasp their subject was their failure to see anything out of the way in the attitude of the Exchanges toward the law . Dr. Drysdale , of London , at the last session of the Social Science Congress , pointed out how the death rate rose with scarcity of food . The mean age of the rich in England , at the time of death , is ftfty-flve ; among the poor it is not thirty . The death rate among the children of the comfortable classes is eighty in a thousand ; among the working people of Manchester and Liverpool it is three hundred in a thousand . Dr. Farr shows that the death rate of England decreases three per cent . when wheat declines two shillings a quarter . As food grows dear , typhus grows plenty . Scarcer bread means more crime . An increase of one larceny to every hundred thousand inhabitants comes with every rise of two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemies of the men who corner wheat and pork could wish for no heavier burden on their souls than that they should be successful . As wheat rises , flour rises ; and when flour becomes dear , through manipulation , it is the blood of the poor that flows into the treasury of the syndicate . Such money costs too much . The following from the records of the Chicago market shows how the wheat corners of the last four years have enhanced the price of bread . The coincidence is doubly significant , because flour is not one of the speculative commodities of the Board . It is bought and // sold only for use . But its prices are glued to the speculative quotations of wheat : THE CORNER 0 ! ' 1879 . Wheat lowest , January , 811*2 ; highest , December , $1.33 . Flour lowest , January , $4.00 ; highest , December , $6.50 . Tun CORNER or 1881 . Wheat lowest , February , 9618 ; highest , October , $1.43 . Flour lowest , February , $4.75 ; highest , September @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wheat highest , April , $1.42 ; falling to 9134 in November . Flour highest , May , $6.25 ; falling to $4.75 in December . The return of the price after the corner does not fill the stomachs that have been pinched for months . Every moment the corner lasts there is a mouthful of food the less for the laboring man . Every hour of its continuance some child in Pittsbnrg or Manchester grows more faint , and every day hundreds of little hands let go another finger from the slippery edge of existence . One of the iron manufacturers of the West , President 0 . W. Potter , of the North Chicago Rolling Mills , the employer of many thousands of men , when questioned in May about the strike of iron-workers , then believed to be impending , and promising to be the worst that had yet taken place in this country , said : " The laborers oppose the reduction of wages for the very good reason that they can not live upon any lower wages . And that is true . They can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are some things that are not to be talked about in public that bring this about , and one of them is the cornering of food on the Board of Trade . ' A few men manipulate the foods of the workingmen , and create a corner in wheat and meats , and the laborer has to pay the increased cost . They turn the screws , and up go the prices a notch or two . And they may let up so that the market goes down a little ; but all the time a few men are making money , and the laborer gets no better fare and pays no lower price for the necessaries of life . I am apprehensive of the results that all this will bring about , and there is more anxiety in certain quarters about the future than people dare to imagine. ** Carlyle has handed down Louis XV . to us as " the great regrater of bread .
