THE END OF THE WAR . THROUGHOUT the country harsh and of a million that of its antagonist , and violent declamations , or at least deep which for days after the election had and surly mutterings of discontent and been commonly conceded a majority of menace ; a great party , whose registered the electoral colleges , choking with dis popular vote had exceeded by a quarter appointments embittered by a sense of // outrage ; a large part of the successful party accepting its success with profound disgust at the methods by which it had been secured ; overwhelming adverse majorities in both houses of Congress ; all branches of industry and commerce depressed , and , at best , but semianimate ; the public credit , as indicated by the Federal securities , below that of many European nations , or of many States of the Union ; the paper currency of the country still many degrees below par , still wholly irredeemable , its redemption declared by the party which had all but seized the government to be for an indefinite period impossible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlimited augmentation ; several States , formerly in rebellion , disordered by new dissensions , in which shameless fraud was in collision with sanguinary violence* and rival claimants of state governments were kept from each other 's throats only by the illegal interference of Federal authority , - these were the conditions and environments with which the president now about to retire entered upon his duties four years ago . Only once in the history of the republic had the skies been so overcast with gloom at the opening of a presidential term . Less only than the dangers and difficulties which beset the nation at the crisis of dissolution in 1861 were those which menaced it in the dispi*ted election of 1877 ; but the requirements of good sense , discretion , non-partisan patriotism , and whatever else there may be which makes up statesmanship were greater , rather than less , at the outset of Hayes 's administration than at the outset of Lincoln 's . For if Lincoln had to face a threatened rebellion , he faced it with the resolute support of a vast party which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence in which was the *tvowed pretext for rebellion ; while Hayes , less fortunate , was far from being the chosen champion of his party , - was regarded by its most active managers rather as an accidental intruder into its highest honors , and as one whose failure , should he fail , might be a useful lesson to future nominating conventions . Adverse and discouraging as were the circumstances in which Mr. Hayes assumed the presidency , how far have they altered for the accession of Mr. Garfield ? And how much may this leader , who put on his armor four years ago in doubt and danger and dispute , boast himself in putting it off ? Rightly to compare the two dates , in their political aspects , will be to determine with approximate accuracy the place to be occupied in history by the administration whose existence reaches from the one date to the other . It is true that the post hoc propter hoc argument is too apt to involve a fallacy . But if it is the legitimate function of the chief officer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that peace and order may result from the absence of discontent ; to collect and disburse the revenues with efficiency and economy ; to manipulate the currency ( since the blunders of former legislation compel the executive to meddle with the currency ) in such manner that it may increase in value and stability ; to manage the public debt so that its principal may be steadily diminished , and its interest charge reduced to a minimum , while at the same time a constantly growing friendship and respect mark the sentiments of foreign nations toward this country , it certainly is not unreasonable , when all these facts are found to exist in a higher degree at the close of an administrative term than at its beginning , to adjudge that the administrative functions have been well discharged . To any man , entering in troublous times upon the task of directing the executive government of a great nation , it might well seem that four years formed a sadly inadequate period in which to // correct ingrown abuses ; to purge and purify large departments of the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corruption ; to r&amp;stablish order and the dominion of law in vast regions given over to lawless violence ; and to placate a sensitive and warlike population , sore with the chagrin of defeat , yet conscious of the great political power restored to it by the deliberate action of its victors . It would seem that for any such man to handicap himself with a declaration at the outset which barred the way to a possible rei*Blection was to condemn his presidential career to a fate , at best , of outlined reforms , of efforts and attempts , of beginnings without completion . Judging , however , after the event , one is forced to doubt whether , with all the ability and integrity which the out-going president has shown , his administration does not owe some part of the success and honor which have attended it to that " self-denying ordinance " which deprived it of all ambition except to achieve honor and success . Nor is it too much to say that the argument drawn from the presidential terms of 1869 to 1877 , for a constitutional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require from the history of the administration of 1877-1881 , the first which ever performed its work under the influence of such a limitation . It is easy , as has been said above , to err in attributing to a government too large a measure of the prosperity or distress of its people . Yet , four years ago it was still doubtful whether the whole southern third of the United States - a vast empire of itself , of immense resources , although prostrated by war and social revolution - should continue for a generation to come to be a mere range of subject yet hostile provinces , whose prosperity and development , their internal production and their commerce with the rest of the nation , were to be repressed and throttled by a sullen and chronic anarchy . It is little enough to say that the instant springing up throughout those States of a strong confidence and content , as soon as the character of the new government was made known by its acts , added everywhere to the acres planted for crops ; added everywhere something to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in two ways to his real or fancied purchasing ability ; that this repose and confidence , this prosperity and hopefulness , acted with the stimulus of an enlarged market upon all departments of northern production , and all together , with their mutual reaction , upon the foreign commerce and importation which is the final expression of national prosperity . It is therefore a shallow wisdom which denies credit to Mr. Hayes 's administration for the reduction of the national debt , the refunding at low interest , and the resumption of specie payments , because it was by the planting and watering of the whole people , which Providence crowned with unusual increase , that the national revenue was enlarged and the national credit enhanced to a point that made these changes possible . For the one thing that was , at the accession of President Hayes , absolutely within the uncontrolled power of the executive to determine was the question whether the disorders which are the natural sequel of a lQng civil war should continue for four years , through the intervention of the Federal government , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instantly and firmly , in the teeth of doubts and threats on the part of a large proportion of the party which had raised it to power , in the negative . The state of things which but a few months before had made it possible for a Federal official , standing with a file of Federal soldiers at the door of the statehouse at Columbia , to pass upon the credentials of members of the South Carolina legislature , and admit or ex // chide them at his discretion , may or may not have been a desirable state of things ; but at least it was not legal or constitutional . It would not have been tried , at that time , at the Boston or the Albany state-house . In short , it was a sequel of war ; it was a form of war itself ; it was the silencing of law in the presence of arms . And when the executive made known that thenceforward no intervention should be possible in South Carolina or Louisiana which was not lawful in Pennsylvania or Illinois , his act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years before the president 's call for troops had been a declaration of war . " Beats pacificatores ! " It is much to have cleansed Augean stables ; to have directed the vast and intricate machinery of government with an integrity and decency that leave no opportunity for either suspicion or investigation ; to have brought an irredeemable currency to par ; to have reduced the public debt by hundreds of millions , and its interest charge by tens of millions ; to have guided public opinion , somewhat by practice and more by precept , toward that organization of the administrative service which shall preclude its debasement for party ends ; to have seen the governments of many States pass , during his four years of office , from the hands of the opposition to those of his own party , while the house of representatives undergoes the like change , and the senate but narrowly escapes it : and all these things have befallen the administration of the outgoing president . But behind all , and a potent factor not only in all these , but iu the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which his administration partly recognized and partly made , that the war is ended . " Four years of fierce hostilities , " the future historian will say , " were followed by the amazingly brief period of twelve years of social disorder and reorganization ; until , under President Hayes , who took office by a disputed title which threatened greatly to impair his moral strength , the exasperations of the conflict were allayed , and the nation entered upon a period of prosperity in which the revolted States appear to have had even a larger share than those which had reduced them to allegiance . So general , in fact , was the Southern acquiescence in Mr. Hayes 's methods that when his successor , a man understood to be of like character , was elected by Northern votes alone , the only newspapers in which partisan disappointment was expressed in threats and denunciations were those of Northern democrats , while his lately rebel antagonists betook themselves to the news or the jests of the period with avowed indifference or contentment . No more emphatic illustration could be given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been for years before in preparation and progress , subsequent generations have come to associate distinctively with the golden age - the Saturnia regna - of President Hayes . " Thus the future historian . But will he not also have to record that this peace was delusive , that this prosperity was hollow ; that the war waged directly for union and indirectly for the rights of man had ended in an illusory success , in which the real triumph was with rebels restored to citizenship and power , and might better never have been waged at all ? Every one has heard passionate declamations of that tenor , and often from men to whom the imagined disappointment had a personal intensity from the fact that their own labor and their own blood had been expended for the cause which they now deem to have been lost . Let me paraphrase the angry ejaculations of a friend who , though now distinguished at the bar and elevated to the bench , had hurried from college to the camp when hardly of the military age , and had served honorably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that rare badge of " derring-do , " a sabre-scar . " No , sir ! " exclaimed the coloneljudge . " This is n't what I risked my life and shed my blood and gave up four of my best years for . To see these same rebels whom I was fighting all that time , who did their best to destroy this government , in undisputed control of every State that we conquered from them , - both houses of Congress full of their brigadier - generals , - unrepentant , too , sir ; to read every day of the outrages by which they frighten the negroes into voting the democratic ticket , of their swindling the poor wretches out of their wages or their share of the crops , until they have left their houses by thousands , in organized emigration , to escape this infernal tyranny ! - I tell you , sir , that if any one had said to me that in fifteen years after the war was over this would be the condition of things , I should probably have told him he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have resigned my commission and gone home to make money , as some of the rest did ! " Now it is nearly hopeless to argue against a conclusion based upon such experience and moved so by sentiment . Yet it may be worth while for any one to think about it who is not too much in a passion to think , using the modes of thought which we were wont to use before 1860 . And so far as the writer 's point of view can guide the reader 's it is that of the most " stalwart " prepossession , of earnest antislavery birth and education , and of service through the war from a belief in it . The question raised by my friend 's indignant lamentation , however doubtful or difficult the answer to it may be , is in itself a very simple one . It is merely this : Is the condition of the United States at large , and particularly of the States which went into rebellion , no better , or not much better , in a humanitarian sense , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or social science , in 1881 than in 1861 ? If the question must be answered in the . negative , then our unspeakable sufferings and sacrifices may indeed have been in vain . It is a commonplace of historical philosophy that contemporary events , or those nearly contemporary , are most difficult to judge justly . But perhaps the hardest of all are those for the comprehension of which some knowledge is required of a period which has just passed beyond personal recollection , and yet which is not distant enough to have become known to us through the work of the historian , as distinguished from the annalist or the chronicler . Now any man may fairly say that he knows all about the United States of to-day ; and , whatever be the color or the lucidity of the medium through which he takes his impressions , it is not easy to convict him of ignorance . But to a vast body of intelligent men , including myriads who served in the war , the ante-belium condition of their country is a matter wholly beyond personal reco1lecti*n , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best , such recollection is darkened and beclouded , not merely by the lapse of more than half their lifetime , but by the overwhelming stress of the events which , during that time , have convulsed the country and the world . I propose , therefore , to accept as true the strongest statements of my friend , or of the bitter newspapers which daily voice his griefs , as to the facts of 1881 . But I want him to consider them for a moment in the light of 1861 . Perhaps it would be enough to recall the purposes which , when the war began , and as long as it lasted , were continually avowed as its sole motive and justification . Except by a very slender body of humanitarian sectaries , any intention to affect , in the remotest way , the institution of slavery was at first universally disclaimed . It was not long , it is true , before the hopes of this little cluster of reformers had gradually be .. // come the desire and set purpose of the majority of Northern men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find the origin or the impulse of the war in any such design . On the contrary , it seems that after it had been raging for nearly a year so furious an original abolitionist as Mr. Wendell Phillips - an orator who was never thought to drag far in the rear of the most advanced opinions - had only got so far as to be ready to urge upon the government a measure abolishing slavery , " securing compensation to loyal slave-holders . " ( Speeches and Lectures , pages 438 , 439 . ) So that one might fairly think that , in that direction at least , the results of the war were radical enough to content any one not less conservative than Mr. Phillips . Nor was the war , for years after it had become flagrant , in any one 's view an aggressive war on the part of the United States . The defense of the national authority against open violence ; the reestablishment of the constitution and the laws where their supremacy had been subverted ; " the repossession of the forts , places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( President 's Proclamation of April 15 , 1861 ) , these alone were then and long after motives and purposes sufficient to stir all the North into the highest glow of self-sacrifice . However inadequate they may now seem , in the electric light generated by these twenty years of col-. lision , no one who was then a man , unless all his faculty of memory is gone , will venture to say that he would then have deemed those objects unworthy to be fought for . And however , from year to year , the defense of the nation needed to be more and more conducted with what the military writers call the " offensive return , " it would require some hardihood to maintain that , down to the last days of actual hostilities , if the mere restoration of the status quo ante bellurn , together with the prohibition of slavery , had been offered as conditions of peace , twenty thousand men out of twenty million would have voted to continue the fighting . So , too , in the chaotic period which immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold , occupy , and possess " the whole territory of the republic had been most triumphantly accomplished , there was no phrase more universally upon men 's lips , as expressing the common purpose of the most diverse minds , than this : " To restore the States lately in rebellion to their normal relations to the Union . " How this ought to be done , or could best be done , - as to this there was broad divergence of opinion ; but there was entire unanimity as to the end to be sooner or later attained . Nor did any one then doubt what those " normal relations " were . They were the relations sustained by the same States in 1860 , or by the States which had not gone into rebellion in 1865 . What every one meant then , whether he knew it or not , was that in due time the State of South Carolina should , like the State of Massachusetts , under its own constitution , choose its own officers and make its own laws ; that Mississippi might , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by them ; that if Connecticut should send Eaton to the senate , Georgia might send Hill* to meet him ; and that Louisiana , equally with Maine and New York , might hold its fraudulent elections and falsify its returns . It would be too much to say that every one had thought this all out , but it was none the less inseparably inclosed in the common thought of all men . Nor could any one have declared himself confident , if he had reflected so far , that the local laws of those States would be moulded by external rather than by local sentiment , just as Western laws for the collection of debts are abhorrent to Eastem views ; or that their congressmen could be depended upon , in national legislation , to consult and follow the // opinions of Vermont or of the Western Reserve . Suppose , then , that at any time before the final catastrophe of the war it had been said to my impulsive friend , " The rebels offer to drop their arms , to submit to the Federal authority as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibility of its restoration , to forfeit all political rights , except as a triumphant North shall of mere grace concede them from year to year to successive individuals or classes , on the sole condition that they may go about their peaceful avocations without being harassed by prosecutions for treason . " Does any one believe his ardor would have led him to prefer the further effusion of his blood and hazard of his life to such a conclusion of the contest ? And if he had been at the same time warned , by one possessed of second-sight , that before many years the lax liberality of Northern republicans would have restored political franchises to every rebel , and that consequently their civil and military leaders would have come to represent them in both houses of Congress , would he not have answered somewhat thus ? " Of course , in due time , whether sooner or later , that is inevitable . There can be no republican institutions under which a vast body is permanently disfranchised , or is permitted only to choose such representatives as will misrepresent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will outvote them more overwhelmingly now , and they will never try again to right themselves by arms . Of course their temper and influence will be malignant and pernicious , but their normal relations to the Federal government ' entitle them to be , as they used to be , both malignant and pernicious . " And would he not have scouted the seer and his prophetic pretensions if he had ventured to add , what we have now seen and heard ? " But the rebel brigadiers will vote from year to year taxes upon themselves , poor as they are , to pay interest on the debt incurred in crushing the life out of them . They will vote more taxes , and more and more , for bountiful pensions to Federal soldiers whose bullets they carry in their own persons , and will see themselves surrounded , when they return home , by their own crippled comrades and their comrades ' widows and orphans , depending only upon the private alms of an impoverished people . You will find many of them more sensitive to the national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 1876 , the country will be saved , by the Roman firmness of a rebel brigadier , Gibson , of Louisiana , withstanding the great mass of the democratic party in his post of vantage as holding the balance of power in the committee on banking and currency , from a measure designed to drive the nation backward from specie payments . Another , Gordon , of Georgia , is to be the most earnest , able , and independent advocate of a reformed and purified civil service in either house of Congress . Another , Key , of Tennessee , is to serve for more than three years , under a republican president , himself still a democrat , as postmaster-general of the United States , and that with universal respect- The vice - president of the Confederate States is to exhibit , during a congressional service of many years , a singularly broad patriotism and freedom from sectional prejudice . The general second in command of all the rebel armies , Joseph Johnston , of Virginia , will serve upon the military committee of the house , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no man in Congress can be more surely depended upon to stand by the regular army than Joe Johnston . ' And of another rebel brigadier , Lamar , of Mississippi , when , after long service in Congress , his life is for a while in danger from sickness , Northern republican papers will say that for his fidelity , integrity , and patriotism his // death would be a national misfortune . " To my stalwart friend , in 1864 , all this foretold history would have seemed the sanguine dream of an enthusiast . He would have remembered the teachings of all the most radical of reformers that generations , not a few years only , would hardly suffice to purge the Southern communities from the venom of slavery enough to allow such things to be hoped for . There might have been fresh in his mind the speech of Mr. Wendell Phillips in May , 1863 , in which he taught such things as these - " The South will not only not believe itself beaten , but the materials which make up its army will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to retire ? They do n't know how to do anything . You might think they would go back to trade . They do n't know how to trade ; they never bought or sold anything . You might think they would go back to their professions . They never had any . You might think they would go back to the mechanic arts . They do n't know how to open a jackknife . . . . Now , that South , angry , embittered , having arms in its hands , what is it going to do ? Shoot , burn , poison , vent its rage on every side . Guerrilla barbarities are but the first drops of the shower , the first pattering drops of the flood of barbarism which will sweep over the Southern States , unless our armies hold them . When England conquered the Highlands , she held them , - held them until she could educate them ; and it took a generation . That is just what we have to do with the South . " ( Speeches , etc. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend , answering him who prophesied smooth things , would have said , " I have been taught otherwise . What you tell me is better than I hope for , - is too good to be possible . We are about to accomplish all we have fought for . God be praised for it ! But for more generations than one these barbarous States , in their normal relations to the Union , must be passing through a slow process of education ; and not until those are gone who took part in the conflict can there be any patriotism , any fidelity to constitutional allegiance , - anything but malignant sectional passion , seeking constantly to dishonor the Federal name and to weaken the national power . " If one could but figure to himself a " fire-eating " South Carolinian of 1860 , or a Massachusetts abolitionist of the same period , withdrawn from all intermediate cognition of events for forty years , and set down upon earth now , to gather from the ordinary speech of men his knowledge of the present state of things , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have moved much in that interval . Fancy , for example , if you can , that with the knowledge , the experiences , the passions , of 1860 alone - those of the next twenty years wholly wanting - these persons should hear mentioned the movement which we have come to call the negro exodus . Would not one of them burst into a rapture of joy at the increased activity of the " underground railroad " which used to help slaves from bondage to Canada ? Would the other think of anything else , after his own spasm of anger had subsided , than the need of more stringent provisions for the recovery of fugitive slaves ? And if they should then learn that the movement spoken of , so far from being furtive or clandestine , was wholly in the light of day ; that the refugees came by families , by whole communities , crowding the railroad trains and the Mississippi steamboats , would there be in the mental constitution of either of such men the necessary apparatus for comprehending what was told them ? Nor would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much to a clear understanding . Every phrase you would use would fall with a dull astonishment upon senses not trained to receive it . // Explain that the motive of this extehsive disturbance is found in the charge that the employers of these poor people have been cheating them out of their wages , or their share of the crops . The very mention of " wages , " or of a " share of the crops , " in connection with the Southern negro ; the statement that when he is dissatisfied he gets on board a steamboat with his family and goes somewhere else , if it could have been grasped by the intelligence of 1860 , would have carried with it by implication into such a mind the idea of a completed revolution , the very beginning of which was hardly within the most sanguine hopes of the one , or the gloomiest midnight terror of the other . Here , too , is a newspaper dispatch of a few months ago , which I suppose made no more impression upon my patriot colonel , as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bank defalcation in Illinois or a burglary in Maine - " NEW ORLEANS , March 26th. - The farm hands of St. John 's parish have struck for one dollar . They receive seventy-five cents . It is stated that the negroes make threats , but no violence is reported . " Yet it would help us a little to comprehend the infinite distance which separates 1880 from 1860 , if we could imagine the reading of such an item to a group of Louisiana planters smoking their after-dinner cigars upon the veranda of a Saratoga hotel , twenty years ago . Of course , it would have been to them but a joke , and a very poor one ; but suppose they could have been persuaded to take it au s6rieux , and to find a meaning in its terms . It speaks in a language all unknown to them . " Farm hands ; " " struck ; " " they receive seventy-five cents ; " " the negroes make threats : " in every phrase , unless treated as a bold and coarse metaphor , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them had suffered himself to con-399 template in fancy otherwise than as the final wreck and crash of the cosmos . Yet . even this convulsion would have seemed to them a conservative tranquillity , if compared with that suggested by the hint that there had been considerable migrations of the working classes , impelled by an undue pressure upon their preferences in voting at elections . This would have seemed to them to be a revolution gone beyond the most radical abolitionist 's subversive fancy . Suppose yourself , further , to be submitting to such a knot of gentlemen a complaint , quite bitterly made of late , that some Southern legislatures have curtailed unduly their appropriations for colored schools and colleges . Remember that Southern planters had not been much in the habit of taxing themselves to maintain colleges or schools for whites ; and that , as for the negro race , the act of teaching one of them his letters was at that date a crime to be punished by the penitentiary , if the offender was fortunate enough to escape more summary and severe punishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentlemen that in 1878 the report of the Federal commissioner of education , an officer never dreamed of in 1860 , will show that in Virginia alone there are 14,247 schools for colored children , having 676,000 pupils . If they believed your enthusiastic second-sight , would not their natural ejaculation be ; " There could be but one terror added to the picture you have drawn . You say the negroes are free ; they travel about the country to suit themselves ; they vote ; they have free schools ; they have colleges supported by taxes upon white land-holders : you might as well put arms in their hands , and make a militia of them ! " And what resources of language would remain to express their emotions if there could have been brought before their minds , in such form that they could receive the picture as a just forecasting of the near future , a The find of the War . // view of the entire country disturbed , in 1880 , by a discussion whether a South Carolina colored cadet at West Point is as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is at Yale or Harvard ; with a vignette of Governor Hampton reviewing the several negro military companies of the city of Charleston , and pronouncing his high approval of their discipline and soldierly bearing ? Would not every one of them have declared , with his whole soul , that whenever a Hampton should be capable of doing that the world would be so changed that they would not care to live in it ? And would not they on the one part , and Mr. Wendell Phillips on the other , have fr nkly agreed in 1860 that whenever every man , white or black , should be free to go and come , to vote and to be educated , to do whatever he likes , all over the United States , subject only to the danger of lawless outrage in communities which never were closely law-abiding ; whenever Mrs. Stowe , whose books no man could offer for sale in the South but at the hazard of his life , should spend her winters upon her own orange-plantation in Florida , while the drama of Uncle Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as long as negroes could be found with half-dollars to pay for seeing it , - that whenever this should be true the long contest would in fact as well as in name be concluded , and the passions , in the exasperation of which so many men on both sides of Mason and Dixon 's line had found fame and power , could have no further pretext for exist-ence ? And this is , indeed , the sum of the whole matter . Is it not a great matter ? Could ever a twenty years ' seclusion from the world have covered a more stupendous political and social revolution than this which we , who have moved with it , instead of being left behind by it , fail so often and so profoundly to appreciate ? The establishment of Chris-March , tianity as the religion of the empire by Constantine was little more than the recognition of the change which had been for three centuries supervening upon " creeds outworn . " If a French viscount who had received his lettre de cacket in 1788 had lain forgotten by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ château in Brittany until 1808 , there would have been much , no doubt , in the France upon which his eyes then opened to startle and to grieve him . But there would have been far more that was wholly unchanged during the interval of his retirement . A dynasty of which he had never dreamed was upon the throne , and many a tradesman 's son whom he had known was blazing with military rank , and even with titles of nobility named from distant battlefields in Italy and Germany , while many of the old noblesse were exiled , or at home in poverty . But he would have needed a year 's study of newspapers and lawhooks to be entirely assured that institutions had been profoundly modified . The tremendous convulsion of the 4th of August , 1789 , left in twenty years far less impression upon France - it was , in fact , with all its corollaries and results , a less tremendous social and political revolution - than that which began on the 13th of April , 1861 , in the harbor of Charleston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose lamentation I have quoted , contributed his toil and blood .
