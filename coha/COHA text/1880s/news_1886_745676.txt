txt The Treasury statement for the month of January , which we print this morning , shows a reduction of the public debt , less cash in the Treasury , of $8,672,553 81 , making a total reduction since the present Administration took office of $46,204 , - 030 35 . The reduction is effected by the increase in the balance in the Treasury less a slight increase in the outstanding liabilities . The most noteworthy features of the Treasury 's present resources are a decrease in gold of about twelve millions ( $11,904,198 ) and an increase in silver of nearly seven millions ( $6,644,794 . ) There is also an increase in the amount of United States notes on hand of about twenty millions ( $19,879,133 . ) This closes the first eleven months of the new Administration . The total reduction of the debt within the year will doubtless exceed $50,000,000 . According to all orthodox Republican standards of financial judgment , this reduction must be regarded as a good thing , and the Democratic Party must be credited with it , very much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cups , it " had paid it itself . " This was the general reasoning regarding the heavy reductions that took place while the Republicans were in power . We need hardly say to our readers that we do not agree with this reasoning any more now than we did when it was one of the favorite arguments in support of the Republican Party . The reduction of the debt from 1866 to 1872 had , however , this in its favor ? it strengthened the public credit in a way which was very effective , and Prepared the country for refunding what remained of the debt at lower rates . It was excessive , however , even for this purpose , and nearly all of the reduction that has since taken place has been an unnecessary and grievous burden upon the prosperity and the well-being of the country . That which is now going on is even more inexcusable . The credit of the Government has reached a point where , all things considered , it may fairly be said to be better than that of any other Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid off by the Treasury bear but 3 per cent . interest , and even the 3 per cents command a slight premium in the market . We could without difficulty fund the entire remaining debt of the Government at the lowest rate now paid . It is not improbable that it could be done at even a lower rate . The reduction now going on is required by law and provided for by the revenues . The responsibility of the Democratic Party for it is only partial . But that the law is not changed , that the premature payment of the debt is not suspended , that the taxes necessary to keep it up are not reduced , is , so far as the Democratic Party could have changed all this , not to its credit .. The Executive is not to be  --  blamed , for the President and the Secretary of the Treasury have made recommendations beyond what the majority in the House is prepared to act upon . But that majority is distinctly blamable for not moving with more energy and decision in relieving the burdens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the debt is being paid off were wise taxation , so levied as to be the least possible drawback on the earning capacity of the people , it would still be the duty of Congress to keep it at the lowest point that would yield enough revenue for the real necessities of the Government . But it is not such taxation . On the contrary , it is made heaviest where it should be lightest , and interferes at every point with the activity of trade and industry . With revenue of this sort , raised in this way , it is folly to ? regard a reduction of debt as creditable to the party in power , or partially in power . It is the taxes , not the debt , that should ' be adjusted and reduced . The net reduction of the debt is due , as we have said , to ail increase in the available balance in the Treasury , but , as we have also pointed out , this balance is reached by an increase in the United States notes and in silver dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased by 6,644,794 , while the silver certificates have fallen off about $3,000,000 . All the coinage of the past month , therefore , remains in the Treasury and some $1,500,000 more has gathered there . Such a change is not in itself disquieting , but , considered with reference to the causes that have produced it , it is not reassuring . It is simply one more proof added to those already numerous and conclusive enough that if it be not suspended the silver law will empty the Treasury of gold and fill it with depreciated silver .
