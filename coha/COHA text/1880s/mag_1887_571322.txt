ARTICLE IV. - LOCKSLEY HALL . Locksley ifall Si*ety Years After , etc . By ALFRED , LORD TENNYSON , P.L. , D.C.L. London and New York : Macmillan &amp; Co. , 1886 . EVEN the least attractive works of a great poet call for notice , and the last volume which Tennyson has put forth has especial claims upon public attention . Whatever may be the estimate of its value as poetry , it has certain features which give it an extraordinary interest . And these featnres are fonnd solely in the production which gives its name to the volume . The other poems may be dismissed with a word . We find here the remarkable effusion about the " The Fleet , " which was published some time ago , and which was met with jeers by the public , jeers which might have been spared in the case of one to whom the pnblic owes so much . But the lines You , you , that have the ordering of her fleet , If you should only compass her disgrace , When all men starve , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from your place , But then too late , too late I were too much for such reverence as belongs to the " paragrapher , " and he gave his wit full scope . Following " The Fleet , " is an ode on the " Opening of the Indian and Colonial Exhibition by the Queen . " These lines may be considered as a " copy of the verses " turned out by the poet in the exercise of his function as Lanreate , and as such do not call for any special criticism , He has simply done the proper thing in the proper way . " The Promise of May " is a little drama which occupies two-thirds of the two hundred pages in the volume . The greater part of it is in prose , the dramatis persance only " dropping into poetry " on occasion . It is not a very remarkable work in any way , not enough so to call for any extended comment , either favorable or otherwise . It is different with " Locksley Hall Sixty Years After . " This would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any case , even were it not for the // Feb. , strong contrast which it presents with the original " Locksley Hall , " one of the most striking productions of Tennyson 's early years . There is perhaps no one of his poems written before " In IMlemoriam , " which produced an impression at once so deep and so widespread , as " Locksley Hall . " It particularly appealed to young men at a very impressionable period of their developinent , and it reminded older men of an experience through which many of them had passed . And it had this further interest , that it seemed , to a great extent at least , to set forth the author 's ideas on human life in general . We feel that much that is in it belongs , not to its supposed hero exclusively , but to the poet himself ; that much of the thought and feeling in it are the thought and feeling of Alfred Tennyson , or , at any rate , such as he supposed that he would have , were he really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus a very personal interest . The outline of the poem is simple and familiar , but , for purposes of contrast , I will indicate its general framework . The hero is a thoughtful , passionate , and egotistical youth , who comes in sight of " Locksley Hall " one morning early , and pauses to indulge in some meditations . The Hall has been his home until recently . It belongs to his uncle , to whose care he had been committed on the death of his father . Here he had been brought up , and had fallen in love with his cousin , who was the heiress , as it now appears , and who , to some extent at least , reciprocated his affection . But the uncle , who was something of a tyrant , interfered with the young people , and ordered his daughter to marry another man , which she did without much apparent hesitation or regret . The young man , returning to the vicinity shortly after the marriage , gives vent to his feelings in a soliloquy . He says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Falser than all fancy fathoms , falser than all songs have sung ; Puppet to a father 's threat , and servile to a shrewish tongue : and he intimates in very unmistakable terms that he expects her to have a very miserable life of it , as she fully deserves . Her husband is something of a brute , with a great fondness for dogs and horses , and a partiality for strong drink . As the husband is , the wife is , thou art mated to a clown : All the grossness of his nature shall have weight to drag thee down . // Is it well to wish thee happy , having known me to decline On a lower range of feelings and a narrower heart than mine ? Having relieved his feelings by some such wholesome abuse of his relatives , and by a prophetic foresight of the unsatisfactory motherhood of his beloved , he turns to contemplate the question what he had better do under the circumstances . He recalls the high hopes and purposes which he had cherished before the disappointment which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can now have any place in his being . The splendors of science and the hope of human progress are great things , but for him the times are out of joint . Yet I doubt not through the ages one increasing purpose runs , And the thoughts of men are widened , with the process of the suns . What is this to him who reaps not harvest of his youthful joys , Though the deep heart of existence beats forever like a boy 's ? He has not lost faith in the progress of truth , but he has no heart to take part in the battle of life . He then indulges in some very natural fancies about the advisability of fleeing to the nttermost parts of the earth , and casting in his lot with savages , who are not bound by the inconvenient conventions of civilized society . With tropic scenery and scope for the uncramped passions , it seems as if he could get along very well . He is led to this thought by the reflection that really he is making much ado @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woman who has wrecked his life . Shall it not be scorn to me to harp on such a moldering string ? lam shamed through all my nature to have loved so slight a thing . And this dream of savage life results in a powerful reaction to the things which had formerly inspired and interested him , and he awakes to the knowledge of the fact that they are still worth living for . He , the youth who had been possessed of such high thoughts and fancies , to throw himself away in this manner , " is most tolerable , and not to be endured . " I to herd with narrow foreheads , vacant of our glorious gains , Like a beast of lower pleasures , like a beast of lower pains . Mated to a squalid savage , what to me were sun or clime ? I , the heir of all the ages , in the foremost files of time . I that rather held it better , men should perish , one by one , Than that the world should stand at gaze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not in vain the distance beacons . Forward , forward let us range . Let the great world spin forever , down the ringing grooves of change . Through the shadow of the globe , we sweep into a younger day . Better fifty years of Europe than a cycle of Cathay . With the assnrance thus reached that the crescent promise of his spirit has not set , and with a final malediction upon Locksley Hall , the poem closes . Now the framework of the poem is slight enough , and its contents are not very ponderous , but it is still a good deal of a poem . It is a very truthful representation of a young man . No young man , who is still in the period of strong passion and yet stronger romance , can read it , without feeling an answering thrill in his soul . The passion is very real , although it is certain not to last very long . The egotism of youth , which is the marked feature of the creation , is the stamp of its truth . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to serve his generation , who did not feel more or less of this confidence that he was a person of some importance . Why , of course he is of importance . Does he not know a great deal , and has he not in him the capacity of great deeds ? He is bound to do great things in the earth . When he finds his worth despised or undervalued , especially by a woman whom he has deigned to love , it is the rudest kind of a shock to his passion and his pride . At first it seems overwhelming , but finally the egotism of youth will assert itself . If the woman could not appreciate him , so much the worse for her . He will of course be ever faithful to his first and only love , but he can get along without her , and , in suffering heroism , bear his part in the great struggle of life like a man . There is a high place for him there , and the woman must reap as she has sown . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contents are concerned , lies in the most truthful portrayal of the refreshing " youngness " of the hero . It is true , and beautiful , and attractive . It represents a real experience of very many very young men . The youthful passion seems overwhelming in its disappointment , but the inherent manliness and self-importance of youth asserts itself in the most wholesome way , just as it has done unnumbered times in young men of sound though romantic constitution . We would not dispense with a single touch of the poet 's hand , as he por // trays his hero . It is immensely true to life . And besides being truth , " Locksley Hall " is poetry of the most unquestionable sort . The extraordinary felicity of ornate expression which is perhaps the highest of Tennyson 's poetical gifts , is nowhere displayed more perfectly , unless it be in " The Lotus Eaters . " And the melody of it is wonderful . All that goes to make up the rich splendor of his work as a poet is seen here in lavish abundance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we have a very favorable illustration of Tennyson 's poetry . And then too there is the added interest of the poet 's own personality , which no one can fail to believe is very clearly set forth in a great deal that he puts into the mouth of his young man . Altogether , it would be hard to find anywhere in his works a poem that so well shows forth the Tennysonian genius . It was the delight of my youth , and I have not lost my relish for it yet , and there are thousands who have shared this experience with me . I remember that once , during the " Locksley Hall " period of my development , I came across a squib in a newspaper entitled , " The Lady of Locksley Hall , " which professed to give " Cousin Amy 's " side of the story . From this it appeared that she had been very greatly misrepresented . She had indeed flirted a little with that somewhat " mooney " youth , her cousin Alfred , and she did not mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had once or twice permitted him to kiss her . ( And our spirits rushed together at the touching of our lips , was the way he put it ) . But there had never really been anything serious between them . Moreover the gentleman whom she had married was a very respectable gentleman indeed . He liked a good glass of wine and was fond of hunting , but he was neither a sot nor a brute , as Alfred had intimated . Altogether , she was very happy with him . Being , as I have said , in the " Locksley Hall " period , this harmless little joke shocked me a good deal . I felt as if the writer had invented a new sort of sacrilege , for not yet had the " paragraphers " discovered that the subtlest form of wit is to assume that great writers are , in the nature of the case , absurd persons . At that time , had anyone told me that the poet // himself would live to show up the whole matter in a much more flagrant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly have believed that the would-be prophet was possessed of a lying spirit of unusual malignity . But this is precisely what Tennyson has done . He has written a poem in the meter , but certainly not in the style of the original " Locksley Hall . " It is very remarkable production . I do not suppose that any mature reader of the original poem ever thought the hero would not fall in love again . A young man who can console himself for his lost love by a consideration of " the fairy tales of science and the long results of time , " will speedily get over the attack , and will have another before long . But to have the author of the poem , who must know all about it , come forward and tell us that he married very soon after , does not help things at all . It does not add to the truth of the original picture , and it knocks the romance out of it completely . Such things ought not to be put into cold type , unless the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now we know all about the matter , for better or worse . The hero comes back to Locksley Hall after sixty years with his grandson , who is his only surviving relative . The purpose of the visit is to attend the funeral of the late master of the Hall , his old rival . It now appears that this person , whom the young man with " an angry fancy " represented as a clown and a drunkard , was really a very estimable man . The revelation of this fact does not help the original poem . No one ever questioned whether the young man 's view of his successful rival was a correct one or not . That was the way in which such a young man was sure to look upon his successful rival-as a very contemptible sort of person . I do not suppose that anyone ever asked or thought whether the man was really what he was represented to be . It could make no possible difference to the reader , who was concerned solely with the hero and his character , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be incidentally mentioned . But if anyone ever did ask the question , he was certainly not prepared to have the poet himself give the answer which he has given in these latter days . It appears from this official statement that the husband of " Cousin Amy " // was really a very rare character , altogether superior to his unsuccessful rival-quite one of the salt of the earth in fact . And the hero now holds up the deceased squire to his grandson as a model for imitation . It seems also that " Consin Amy " herself died in child-birth nearly sixty years ago . There was never anything reprehensible in her conduct . The worst accusation that can be brought against her is that she was " a timid child . " As for the hero himself , he married very soon after the date of the former poem , and his wife seems to have been altogether satisfactory sort of person , although she is described in somewhat peculiar terms . In earlier years , Tennyson could not possibly have written the lines in which " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " found them out at once , and have been at work on them ever since . So the situation is a very simple one . Amy died sixty years ago , and her husband has just died . And the aged speaker and his grandson have come to the funeral . The reason for their coming appears in the very last line . The grandson has inherited Locksley Hall . I am glad that this very valuable property has come into the family . It is business and not romance that brings the old man this time . He has had more than enough of romance , and it is to be trnsted that the pecuniary benefit accruing to his immediate family will be some consolation to the aged gentleman , for he is sadly in need of comfort of some sort . There could never be any question as to whether the first " Locksley Hall " was poetry . There have been a great many persons who did not like the poem , but no one ever denied that it was a very genuine poem . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production . It contains lines and passages which no man living , except Tennyson , could have written , and which ought to make the rhymesters of the day feel very humble indeed . These lines illustrate the remarkable use of language of which Tennyson was once master and which is still his to a great degree , and they illustrate it all the more strikingly , because they are found side by side with other lines which are not melodious , nor felicitous , but are harsh and sometimes slangy . I have referred distantly to one of these examples of infelicity . It would be possible to // cite thirty others that are as real , if not as flagrant , as the one referred to . But I can not bring myself to such an ungracious task . I feel too much reverence for a poet to whom I owe a great debt of gratitude to be willing to point out the detailed evidences of his failing powers for the amusement of the public . But it must be remarked that these lapses from poetic diction are so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the contents , they must give rise to the question whether " Locksley Hall Sixty Years After " is really poetry . Whatever may be the determination in regard to its merits as poetry , this production shares two of the characteristics which gave interest to the first poem-its truth and its apparent revelation of the poet 's personality . And it has an interest of its own , which did not belong to the original " Locksley Hall . " This is found in its political aspect . In regard to the personal element , it is impossible to believe that the views of life which are put into the mouth of the speaker are not really the poet 's own . He does not attempt to disguise the fact , and it is very interesting to know how this world looks to such a man , when he has nearly finished his earthly life . He started out with high hopes for the progress of the human race , and the consolation of his distress and the inspiration of his manhood was the cry " Forward , forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier poem . It now seems that it has all been a great mistake . Progress , as it is exemplified in modern life , is a delusion and a snare . Let us hush this cry of " Forward , " till a thousand years are gone . It seems to him that the world is all going to the bad , and that England especially is pretty much in the possession of the devil already . The rising democracy is sweeping away all that was beautiful , and sensible , and heroic . Manhood suffrage , the notion of equality , and all that English Radicalism holds dear , seem to him at once the cause and the result of the evil which is taking possession of the land . It is monstrous to undertake to settle questions of imperial policy by taking the advice of " Hodge . " " The suffrage of the plow " is in its nature an absurdity . And this cursed Radicalism is not content with the old forms of beauty , but must replace them with new forms of ugliness. // Yonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less : Science grows and Beauty dwindles-roofs of slated hideousness . Progress is not bringing at all what he expected of it . The triumphs of science are of very doubtful value . He used to count the gray barbarian lower than the Christian child , " and to shout , " Better fifty years of Europe than a cycle of Cathay . " But he has changed his mind about all that now . He cites the cases of the ancient Assyrian kings , who were accustomed to flay their captives alive ; and of Timur , with his tower of eighty thousand human skulls ; and of Christians who burned one another ; and the cruelties of Pagan and Christian Rome ; and the horrors of the French revolution , and seems to think that the Irish agrarian outrages are a good deal worse than any of these . Tie describes these outrages with so much realism and graphic force that I transcribe the verses . After speaking of the cruelties of the dark pages of history , he adds , Have we grown at last beyond the passions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you hate him , " still " your enemy " was a man . Have we sunk below them ? Peasants maim the helpless horse , and drive Innocent cattle under thatch , and burn the kindlier brutes alive . Brutes , the brutes are not your wrongers-burnt at midnight , found at morn Twisted hard in mortal agony with their offspring , born-unborn , Clinging to the silent mother . Are we devils ? Are we men ? Now this picture of the dead cows with their prematurely born calves is very unpleasant and even very pitiful , but it clearly does not indicate that we have fallen below the level of our barbarian ancestors . They did the other things , but they did not leave these , things undone . They never hesitated to maim or destroy their enemy 's cattle , when they could not steal them , and when they were not so fortunate as to maim or destroy the enemy himself . To compare the killing of these cows with the crimes of the French revolution , or with the cruelties of the great persecutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprising about the matter . This is the common Tory view of the Irish problem . An Irishman , who , under the sense of oppression , and in the hope of compelling redress , shoots his landlord 's horse , or fires the agent 's hay-rick , is a monster of evil the like of whom this world has never // before produced . This is a cardinal tenet of the Tory creed , and it lies at the bottom of the greater part of the legislation which the English parliament has enacted in reference to Ireland . This is the only direct allusion which the old gentleman makes to Irish affairs , but it is very valuable , for it furnishes the key to the whole situation . It is one of the many indications that this thing is not really meant to be a poem , although it takes on that disguise , and takes it on very successfully . It is really a political pamphlet , put forth by an old Tory lord . It is not the Laureate , who has written it , but Alfred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has inherited a good deal of the poetic power which belonged to his famous ancestor , and at the same time he has acquired a great deal of the prejudice which legitimately belongs to the aristocracy of which he is a member . I do not wish to be understood as implying that the lordly soul of the great poet has been won away from the love of mankind by the glitter of a worthless name , or the glamour of a technical nobility . It is only that the peerage came just at the right point to give a fitting stamp to the development of his political and social views . He had doubtless got all the necessary mental furniture for the vocation at the time when he was called to be a Tory peer , and his latest utterance only shows how well fitted he was for the office . Be this as it may , the person who is speaking utters the characteristic sentiments of the old Tory lord , and we have given to us a very firm assurance that they are the sentiments of the author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It consists of a single plank , " The country is going to the devil . " This is the language in which it is commonly expressed by old Tory lords , but this one , having a gift of expression , which is very rare among his class , enlarges upon the theme , and manages to spread it out through a good many pages . His sketch of the Radical gospel is a striking one : You that woo the Voices-tell them , " old experience is a fool , " Teach your flattered kings that only those who can not read can rule . Pluck the mighty from their seat , but set no meek ones in their place ; Pillory Wisdom in your markets , pelt your offal at her face . Tumble Nature heel o'er head , and yelling with the yelling street , Set the feet above the brain and swear the brain is in the feet . // Bring the old dark ages back without the faith , without the hope , Break the State , the Church , the Throne , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , novelist , realist , rhymester , play your part , Paint the mortal shame of nature with the living hues of Art . Rip your brothers ' vices open , strip your own foul passions bare ; Down with Reticence , down with Reverence  --  forward - naked - let them stare . Feed the budding rose of boyhood with the drainage of your sewer ; Send the drain into the fountain , lest the stream should issue pure . Set the maiden fancies wallowing in the troughs of Zolaism ,  - -  Forward , forward , ay and backward , downward too into the abysm . Do your best to charm the worst , to lower the rising race of men ; Have we risen from out the beast , then back into the beast again ? Only " dust to dust " for me that sicken at your lawless din , Dust in wholesome old world dust before the newer world begin . The old man has no patience with the Radical peace ten dencies , and between them and the improvements of science , it is easy to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and no crimes of violence , and science healing all diseases and putting in good repair those who ought to have perished by accident , the era of over-population is not very far off , and then there will not be enough to eat , and things will apparently have to begin all over again . And these vaunted triumphs of progress and science do not really go very deep . Is it well that while we range with Science , glorying in the Time , City children soak and blacken soul and sense in city slime ? There among the glooming alleys Progress halts with palsied feet , Crime and hunger cast our maidens by the thousand on the street . There the Master scrimps his haggard sempstress of her daily bread , There a single sordid attic holds the living and the dead . There the smouldering fire of fever creeps across the rotten floor , And the crowded couch of incest in the warrens of the poor . The poet , or at least the speaker , does not really think that there is no hope for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the God-fearing pursuit of high ideals . For the race at large , progress is a very sinuous river , and we are certainly now on one of the backward curves of the stream . Whether the current will ultimately lead to something good or something bad , he is not at all sure . lit is // Evolution ever climbing after some ideal good , And Reversion ever dragging Evolution in the mud . But whether evolution or reversion will finally get the better of it , and whether the end will be all good or all mud , the poet may have his views , but he declines to made them public . It is useless to extend this sketch of the poem further . And it is impossible to criticise the composition as poetry , when it is taken as a whole . It is equally impossible to treat it as containing any thought which calls for serious attention . It can be properly viewed only as a political pamphlet of rare and interesting form , put forth by the typical Tory , the lauda. tor temporis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have marked in the earlier poem ; and this is its truth . It contains a very true picture of an old man who has outlived his sympathy with the world , with its hopes , its aspirations , its disappointments . Such a picture of old age is necessarily pathetic , and it becomes almost tragic when we reflect that this old man , out of temper with the time , is really Tennyson . He who has been so much to the world , to find the world all wrong at last ! He who has comported so many with the hope and promise of humanity , to be so comfortless in humanity now ! He who has inspired so much enthusiasm in the hearts of his fellows , to have lost all that fine impulse which makes life worth living from even an earthly point of view ! He who has given to the sons of men the consolation and delight of divine harmonies , to be left out of all harmony with the hope and the endeavor of the world ! Oh , " the pity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let him pass . He hates him That would upon the rack of this rough world Stretch him out longer . But though he has no part , nor lot , nor hope in the progress of his race , it is good to find that he yet lives in that hope of a larger and nobler life with God , which has been his comfort and stay in every sorrow , and which he has so often spoken unto them that mourn . And it is a blessing to know that beyond the confusion and darkness and pain of a world which has been too much for him , he still discerns a divine order in which all things must consist in righteousness , and which turns to immortal results the broken purposes of the life which now // is . These verses are perhaps better than they would have been had they been better poetry . Only That which made us , meant us to be mightier by and by , Set the sphere of all the boundless Heavens within the human eye , Sent the shadow of Himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boundless inward , in the atom , boundless outward , in the Whole . The aged guide leads us by a dreary path , encompassed by the shadows of death and wrong , but at the end we * * * find the deathless Angel seated in the vacant tomb . For God has given this angel charge concerning him . THOMAS R. BACON .
