txt Shortly before 7 o'clock this morning a terrible explosion occurred in the steam supply station of Hazlett &; Underwood , at East Cambridge , by which several men were seriously wounded and two were probably injured fatally . On First-street are several large furniture factories which receive their power from Hazlett &; Underwood ' : station . The power station was a building about 40 feet square , three stories in height , and was scarcely more than a wooden shell . In the boiler room was an immense bin piled high with shavings , which were the fuel used under the boilers . There was a number of workmen in the engine room this morning when the explosion took place , men who were employed in the neighboring factories and who had stopped ou their way to work . The explosion occurred without a moment 's warning , and the unfortunate men present were shrouded in one great sheet of flame . There was no way of escape until outside assistance was rendered . The building was soon a mass of fire , and the cries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ southerly wall soon fell outward , and as soon as possible the unfortunate men were dragged from the ruins . Harry Newhall , the engineer , was standing near the shaving bin when the explosion occurred , and was fairly covered with burning shavings . He managed to rush out , a mass of flames , and threw himself into the snow , rolling over until the fire was extinguished . He was fearfully burned , the flesh hanging in bloody strings from his arms , while his hair was completely burned off . He may possibly recover , although at a late hour to-night his case was considered critical . Fireman Albert Murray was badly scorched on the head and body . but will recover . Joseph Sears was badly burned , but his injuries are not considered fatal . Joseph Livenzca , 19 years of age , was horribly burned about the face , hands , and neck , and the hospital surgeons say he can not possibly recover . The cause of the explosion is a mystery .

The loss to the building will be fully $2,000.
