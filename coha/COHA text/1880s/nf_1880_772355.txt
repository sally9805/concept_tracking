PART I MARGARET OF SCOTLAND , ATHELING  --  QUEEN AND SAINT It is strange yet scarcely difficult to the imagination to realise the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the early ages . Neither Pict nor Scot has left any record of what was going on so far south in the days when the king 's daughters , primitive princesses with their rude surroundings , were placed for safety in the castrum puellarum , the maiden castle , a title in after days proudly ( but perhaps not very justly ) adapted to the supposed invulnerability of the fortress perched upon its rock . Very nearly invulnerable , however , it must have been in the days before artillery ; too much so at least for one shut-up princess , who complained of her lofty prison as a place without verdure . If we may believe , notwithstanding the protest of that much-deceived antiquary the Laird of Monkbarns , that these fair and forlorn ladies were the first royal inhabitants of the Castle of Edinburgh , we may imagine that they watched from their battlements more wistfully than fearfully , over all the wide plain , what dust might rise or spears might gleam , or whether any galley might be visible of reiver or rescuer from the north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there would be all that broke the sweeping line of Lothian to the east or west , and all that width of landscape would lie under the eyes of the watchers , giving long notice of the approach of any enemies . " Out over the Forth I look to the north , " the maidens might sing , looking across to Dunfermline , where already there was some royal state , or towards the faint lines of mountains in the distance , over the soft swelling heights of the Lomonds . No doubt Edinburgh , Edwinesburgh , or whatever the antiquaries imagine it to have been , must have been sadly dull if safe , suspended high upon the rock , nearer heaven than earth . It is curious to hear that it was " without verdure " ; but perhaps the young ladies took no account of the trees that clothed the precipices below them , or the greenness that edged the Nor ' Loch deep at their feet , but sighed for the gardens and luxuriance of Dunfermline , where all was green about their windows and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasant to wander in . This first romantic aspect of the Castle of Edinburgh is , however , merely traditional , and the first real and authentic appearance of the old fortress and city in history is in the record , at once a sacred legend and a valuable historical chronicle , of the life of Margaret the Atheling , the first of several Queen Margarets , the woman saint and blessed patroness of Scotland , who has bequeathed not only many benefits and foundations of after good to her adopted country , but her name  --  perhaps among Scotswomen still the most common of all Christian names . No more moving and delightful story was ever written or invented than the history of this saint and Queen . She was the daughter of Edward , called the Outlaw , and of his wife a princess of Hungary , of the race which afterwards produced St. Elizabeth : and the sister of Edgar Atheling , the feeble but rightful heir of the Saxon line , and consequently of the English throne . The family , however , was more foreign than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their grandfather , the King of Hungary , one of the most pious and one of the richest Courts in Christendom ; and it was not unnatural that when convinced of the fact that the most legitimate of aspirants had no chance against the force of William , they should prefer to return to the country of their education and birth . It was no doubt a somewhat forlorn party that set out upon this journey , for to lose a throne is seldom a misfortune accepted with equanimity , and several of the beaten and despondent Saxons had joined the royal exiles . Their voyage , however , was an unprosperous one , and after much beating about by winds and storms they were at last driven up the Firth of Forth , where their ship found shelter in the little bay at the narrowing of the Firth , which has since borne the name of St. Margaret 's Hope . Lying here in shelter from all the winds behind the protecting promontory , with perhaps already some humble shrine or hermit 's cell upon Inchgarvie or Inchcolm to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Edinburgh in the distance on one side , and the soft slopes of the Fife coast rising towards the King 's palace at Dunfermline on the other , the travellers must have awaited with some anxiety , yet probably much hope , the notice of the barbaric people who came to the beach to stare at their weather-beaten ships , and hurried off to carry the news inland of such unwonted visitors . It is the very spot which is now disturbed and changed by the monstrous cobwebs of iron which bear the weight of the Forth Bridge and make an end for ever of the Queen 's Ferry , which Margaret must have crossed so often , and by which a personage more familiar , Mr. Jonathan Oldbuck , once , as we all know , made his way to the North ; but these are modern reflections such as have nothing to do with that primitive morning , fresh no doubt as to-day with sun and dew , when Malcolm 's messengers came hurrying down to see what were these intruders , and what their purpose , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so unusual . The eager and curious emissaries had apparently no warrant to board the strangers , but gazed and wondered at the big ship and all its equipments , so unlike their own rude galleys ; then hastened back again with an excited and exciting description of the greatness of the passengers on board and all their splendid array . Malcolm , cautious yet excited too , sent forth , as we are told in the Scotichronicon , " his wisest councillors " to make further inquiries . They too were astonished by the splendour of all they saw , and especially by the mien of a certain lady among these strangers , " whom , by her incomparable beauty , and the pleasantness of her jocund speech , I imagined to be the chief of the family , " said the spokesman ; " nor was it wonderful , " adds the chronicler , " that they should believe her to be the chief who was destined to be Queen of Scotland and also heir of England . " Perhaps it was the after light of these events that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story , for she must have been quite young , and it is very unlikely that in presence of her mother , and the brother whom they all considered as the King of England , a young girl , however gifted , would have taken upon her the chief place . Illustration : PILLAR IN NAVE , DUNFERMLINE ABBEY The report he received , however , had so much effect upon King Malcolm that he went himself to visit the strangers in their ship . He was not a mere barbaric prince , to be dazzled by the sight of these great persons , but no doubt had many a lingering recollection in his mind of Siward 's great house in Northumberland , where he had taken refuge after his father 's murder . It is curious and bewildering to go back in that dawn of national life to familiar Shaksperian regions , and to think that this primitive King who had so much in him of the savage , along with all his love and gentleness , was the son of that gracious Duncan who addressed his hostess like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . King Malcolm came down , no doubt with such state as he could muster , to see the wandering foreign princes . He was not unlearned , but knew Latin and the English tongue , though he could not read , as we are afterwards told . He had already reigned for fourteen years , after about as long a period of exile , so that he could not now be in his first youth , although he was still unmarried . He came down with his suite to the shore amid all the stir of the inquiring country folk , gathered about to see this strange thing  --  the ship with its unusual equipments , and the group of noble persons in their fine clothes who were to be seen upon the deck . The Athelings were carrying back with them to Hungary all the gifts with which the Emperor , Henry III , had loaded their father when he went to England , and had jewels and vessels of gold and many fine things unknown to the Scots . And Margaret , even though not so prominent as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all a most gracious and courteous young lady , with unusual grace and vivacity of speech . The grave middle-aged King , with his recollections of a society more advanced than his own , which probably had made him long for something better than his rude courtiers could supply , would seem at once to have fallen under the spell of the wandering princess . She was such a mate as a poor Scots King , badgered by turbulent clans , could scarcely have hoped to find  --  rich and fair and young , and of the best blood in Christendom . Whether the wooing was as short as the record we have no means of knowing , but in the same year , 1070 , Margaret was brought with great rejoicing to Dunfermline , and there married to her King , amid the general joy . Illustration : DUNFERMLINE ABBEY The royal house at Dunfermline , according to the chronicle , was surrounded by a dense forest and guarded by immense cliffs . The latter particular , however , it is difficult to accept , for the dell in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more recent , it is needless to say , than that of Malcolm ) still stand , though picturesque in its acclivities and precipices , is as far as possible from including any cliffs that could be called immense . The young Queen made a great change in the internal arrangements of what was no doubt a grim stronghold enough , soft as was the country around . Probably the absence of decoration and ornament struck her painfully , accustomed as she was to palaces of a very different kind  --  for almost the first thing we hear in the contemporary history written by her confessor Theodoric , afterwards a monk at Durham , is of the workshops and rooms for embroidery and all the arts which were established in Dunfermline , presumably in the palace itself under Margaret 's own eye , for the beautifying of the great church which she founded there , and also no doubt for her own house . Certain women of good birth were judged worthy to share the Queen 's work , and lived with her , it would seem , in a kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought with her to cheer their labours , and forswearing all idle talk and frivolity . The Queen had such austerity mingled with her graciousness and such grace with her severity , says her monkish biographer , loving an antithesis , that all feared and respected her presence . " Her life was full of moderation and gentleness , her speech contained the very salt of wisdom ; even her silence was full of good thoughts . " This biographer  --  according to the conscientious and painstaking investigations of the Bollandist Fathers , who examine in their careful way all the guarantees and traditions of the manuscript with a jealousy worthy of the most enlightened historians  --  is not Turgot , who is usually credited with it , but Theodoric , a monk of Durham , who must have shared with Turgot , at some period of his life , the office of spiritual director and confidant to the Queen . It is curious that both these writers should have passed from the northern Court to the community at Durham , of which Turgot was prior and Theodoric a simple brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largely patronised and enriched by Margaret and her husband , their kingdom at this period reaching as far south . Of Turgot 's Life , which was presumably written in the vernacular , there seems nothing existing ; but that of Theodoric is very full , and contains many details which set before us the life of the simple Court , with its many labours and charities : the King full of reverence and tender surprise and admiration of all his wife 's perfections ; the young saint herself , sweet and bright in modest gravity amid a tumultuous world little respectful of women , full of the excessive charity of the age and of her race , and of those impulses of decoration and embellishment which were slow to develop among the ruder difficulties of the north . Theodoric himself must have been more or less of an artist , for in speaking of the " golden vases " and ornaments for the altars of her new church which Margaret devised , " I myself carried out the work , " he says . These must have been busy days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the great cathedral close by , the mason with his mallet , the homely sculptor with his chisel , carving those interlaced and embossed arches which still stand , worn and gray , but little injured , in the wonderful permanency of stone , in the nave of the old Abbey of Dunfermline : while the Queen 's rooms opened into the hall where her ladies sat over their embroidery , among all the primitive dyes that art had caught from herbs and traditional mixtures , on one hand  --  and on the other into noisier workshops , where workmen with skilful delicate hammers were beating out the shining gold and silver into sacred vessels and symbols of piety . Margaret along with her stores of more vulgar wealth , and the ingots which were consecrated to the manufacture of crucifix and chalice , had brought many holy relics : and no doubt the cases and shrines in which these were enclosed afforded models for the new , over which Father Theodoric , with his monkish cape and cowl laid aside , and his shaven crown shining in the glow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasant stir of occupation and progress , the best and most trustworthy evidences of growing civilisation , must have arisen within the shelter of the woods which framed that centre of development and new life : the new abbey rising day by day , a white and splendid reality in the clearing among the trees ; the bells , symbols of peace and pleasantness , sounding out over the half-savage country ; the chants and songs of divine worship swelling upward to the skies . Margaret 's royal manufactory of beautiful things , her tapestries and metal work , her adaptation of all the possibilities of ornament latent in every primitive community , with the conviction , always ennobling to art , that by these means of sacred adornment she and her assistants and coadjutors were serving and pleasing God , no doubt consoled her ardent and active spirit for the loss of many comforts and graces with which she must have been familiar . At the same time her new sphere of influence was boundless , and the means in her hand of leavening and moulding her new country almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman , to whom the noiseless and gradual operation of influence is the chief weapon in the world . Illustration : WEST TOWER , DUNFERMLINE ABBEY There is nothing , however , in this history more charming than the description of the relations between the royal pair . King Malcolm had probably known few graces in life except those , a step or two in advance of his own , which were to be found in Northumberland in the house of Earl Siward ; and after the long practical struggle of his reign between the Scots and Celts , who had already so far settled down together as to constitute something which could be called a kingdom , he had no doubt fallen even from that higher plane of civilisation . Such rude state as the presence of a queen even in those primitive days might have procured had been wanting , and all his faculties were probably absorbed in keeping peace between the unruly chieftains , and fostering perhaps here and there the first rising of a little community of burghers , strong enough by union to defend themselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head which bore the circlet of troubled supremacy among all those half-subdued tribes ; and his dwelling in the heart of the " dense forest , " amid all the noisy retainers in the hall and jealous nobles in the council chamber , would leave little room for beauty or sweetness of any kind . When the stranger princess suddenly came in like an enchantment , with her lovely looks and " jocund eloquence "  --  full of smiles and pleasant speech , yet with a dignity which overawed every rude beholder  --  into these rude and noisy halls , with so many graceful ways and beautiful garments and sparkling jewels , transforming the very chambers with embroidered hangings and all the rare embellishments of a lady 's bower , with which no doubt the ship had been provided , and which mediaeval princesses , like modern fine ladies , carried about with them  --  the middle-aged man of war was evidently altogether subdued and enraptured . To see her absorbed in prayer  --  an exercise which Malcolm had perhaps felt to be the occupation of monks and hermits only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all its pictures , reading the sacred story there , filled him with awe and a kind of adoration . He could not himself read , which made the wonder all the more ; but though incapable of mastering what was within , he loved to handle and turn over the book from which his beautiful wife derived her wisdom , touching it with his rude hands with caressing touches , and kissing the pages she loved . When he found one manuscript which she particularly esteemed , he " sent for his goldsmith " and had the vellum encased in gold and ornamented with jewels ; then carried it back to her with such fond pleasure as may be easily imagined . Margaret on her part did what she could to secure to her King some of the punctilios of reverential respect due in her knowledge to a monarch . She suggested the formation of a royal guard to protect the King 's person and surround him with honour and observance . She filled the palace with her wealth , adorning it in every way , providing fine clothes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was served with dishes of gold and silver . And it would seem that the reputation of a new and splendid Court thus suddenly evolved among the northern mists got abroad , and brought merchants with their wares up the Firth , and quickened , if it did not altogether originate , the first feeble current of trade which was the precursor and origin of all our after wealth in Scotland . Illustration : THE NAVE , DUNFERMLINE ABBEY  --  LOOKING WEST Illustration : QUEEN MARGARET 'S CAVE This was not all , however , that Margaret did for the commonwealth . If we may trust her biographer , it was she who established that great principle of reform so important in all states , and generally one of the later fruits of civilisation , that the soldiers should be prevented from exacting or putting under requisition the peaceful people about , and that all they had should be honestly paid for , which was the last thing likely to be thought of by a mediaeval prince . Altogether Margaret 's influence was exerted for the best purposes to induce her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and civilly , " as the chronicler says . It was perhaps not so good an exercise of her power when she opened arguments , apparently through Malcolm as interpreter , with the native clergy of Scotland , the hermits and ecclesiastics of Columba 's strain , and the mysterious Culdees of whom we know so little . The one certain fact fully established concerning them being , that they kept Easter at a different date from that appointed by Rome . The King , though no scholar , would seem to have been a linguist in his way , since he spoke both languages , that is the Saxon , and the Celtic or Pictish , again a most difficult question to determine  --  with a smattering of Latin ; and was thus able to act as Margaret 's mouthpiece in her arguments . She found fault with the Celts not only for the date of their Easter , but for their habit of not communicating at that festival . It is very curious to note in their answer the very same reason which has prevailed in later days among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still put forth in Highland parishes as an excuse for the small number of communicants . The Celtic priests and bishops defended their flocks by producing the words of St. Paul , in which that Apostle says that those who eat and drink unworthily eat and drink condemnation to themselves . So , according to Theodoric , the Celtic party in the Church answered Margaret , and so would their descendants , the " Men " of the Highlands , answer at this day . The integrity of the tradition is very remarkable . On the other hand , they offended the devout Queen by their neglect of Sunday , a reproach which can not be addressed to their descendants . Illustration : WEST DOORWAY , DUNFERMLINE ABBEY These theological discussions between the fair and learned Queen and the Highland ecclesiastics and anchorites , carried on by means of her chief convert the warrior King , whom love for her had taught to respect and share in her devotion , must have afforded many picturesque and striking scenes , though unfortunately there was no modern observer there to be interested and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot upon the atrocity of a miscalculated Easter , and perhaps helping his royal mistress here and there with an argument . Naturally his story is especially full upon the religious side of Margaret 's life  --  her much prayer , her humility and reverence during the services of the Church , an intent and silent listener to all teachings , only a little disposed to rebel now and then when her confessor passed too lightly over her faults . As for her charities , they were boundless . It was not for nothing that the blood of St. Ursula , and that which was to give life to still another saint , Elizabeth of Hungary , was in her veins . It is needless to say that nobody in those days had discovered the evil of indiscriminate almsgiving , which was , on the contrary , considered one of the first of Christian virtues . Margaret was the providence of all the poor around her . Her biographer tells us naively , with no sense that the result was not one to be proud of , that the fame of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every place where she was . When she went out they crowded round her like children round their mother . When she had distributed everything she had of her own she took garments and other things from her courtiers and attendants to give away , a spoliation to which they consented willingly , knowing that the value of everything thus appropriated would be returned to them  --  an excellent reason for acquiescence . This " rapine of piety " was so strong in her that she sometimes even appropriated to her poor certain of the gold pieces which it was the King 's custom to offer at Easter to the Church  --  a pious robbery which Malcolm pretended not to perceive until he caught her in the act , when he accused her with a laugh of tender amusement for her rapacity . In all the touches by which the sympathetic priest delineates the union of this pair there is something at once humorous and pathetic in the figure of the King , the rough old warrior , always following with his eyes the angelic saintly figure by his side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that gleam of amusement at the woman 's absolute unhesitating enthusiasm  --  an amusement mingled with admiration and respect , but still a smile  --  a delighted surprise at all her amazing ways , and wonder what she will do next , though everything in his eyes was perfect that she did  --  such as may still be seen in the eyes of many a world-worn husband looking on at the movements of that directer , more simple , yet more subtle being , and the quick absolutism and certainty of the bright spirit at his side . The grey-bearded old soldier , leader of many a raid and victor in many a struggle , with this new revelation of beauty and purity bursting upon his later life , becomes to us a recognisable and friendly human soul in these glimpses we have of him , unintentional and by the way . Theodoric himself must have liked Malcolm , half-barbarian as he was , and even admired the look of ardent supplication which would come into the King 's face , " a great intentness and emotion , " such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which his wife 's beautiful example and the contagion of her piety alone could have developed . Among Margaret 's many duties there was one which throws a very strange light upon the time . Just before her arrival in Scotland , King Malcolm had been carrying fire and sword through Northumberland in one of the many raids over the Border which were the commonplace of the time  --  if indeed we may speak of the Border at such an unsettled and shifting period when the limits of the kingdoms were so little certain . The issue of this raid was that Scotland , probably meaning for the most part Lothian , the southern portion of the country , was filled with English captives , apportioned as slaves , or servants at least , through the entire population , so that scarcely a house was without one , either male or female . The Queen interested herself particularly in these captives , as was natural ; sometimes paying the ransom exacted for them , and in all cases defending and protecting them . Her emissaries went about among them inquiring into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from house to house : and all that Margaret could do to mitigate the evils of their captivity was done . Nothing can be more strange than to realise a time when Northumbrian prisoners of war could be house slaves in Lothian . No doubt what was true on one side was true on the other , and Scotch captives had their turn of similar bondage . In those days the ancient county which her children love to call the Kingdom of Fife was far more than Edinburgh , then a mere fortress standing up on an invulnerable rock in the middle of a fertile plain , the centre of the national life . Not only was the King 's residence at Dunfermline , but the great Cathedral of St. Andrews was the ecclesiastical capital , gradually working out that development of Roman supremacy and regularity which soon swept away all that was individual in the apostleship of St. Columba and the faith of his followers . That the King and Queen were frequently at Edinburgh is evident from the fact that Margaret had her oratory and chapel on the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centre of worship and spiritual life . St. Andrews , however , was the centre of influence , the shrine to which pilgrims flowed , and the pious Queen , in her care for every office of religion and eagerness to facilitate every exercise of piety , gave special thought to the task of making the way easy and safe towards that holy metropolis . The Canterbury of the north was divided from the other half of Malcolm 's kingdom by that sea which in these later days , at much cost of beauty , money , and life , has been bridged over and shortened  --  " the sea which divides Lothian from Scotland " according to the chronicler , " the Scottish Sea " as it is called by others , the mighty Firth , which to the rude galleys of the little trading villages along its shores must have been a sea dangerous and troubled , full of risks and perils . The Queen , we are told , erected houses of shelter on either side of this angry strait , and established what we should call a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expense of the State . One wonders how much or how little of State policy might mingle in this pious act , for no doubt the establishment of an easy and constant means of communication between the wealthy Lothians and the then centre of national life must have been of unspeakable use in consolidating a kingdom still so imperfectly knit together and divided by the formidable line of the great estuary . It is one drawback of a religious chronicler that no such motive , large and noble as it might be , is thought of , since even national advantage counted so much less than the cultivation of piety . And it is very likely that Margaret thought of nothing else , and reckoned a prayer at the shrine of the patron saint as far more important than the intercommunications thus established and the knowledge of each other thus acquired by the different parts of a kingdom which still retained the differences of separate nationalities . A mingled aim , a practical motive , might not have accomplished half so much ; but no doubt among Malcolm 's men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking of many things as he protected all his wife 's schemes , there was a dawning perception , along with the undoubted advantages of piety , of a national use in the quickened intercourse and securely established communications . If so he would probably blame himself for a mixed motive by the side of Margaret 's pure and absolute heavenly-mindedness , yet take pleasure in the secondary unacknowledged good all the same . Thus their life went on for nearly a quarter of a century in a course of national development to which everything contributed , even the love of splendour which Margaret brought with her , and her artistic tastes , and the rage for decoration and beautiful surroundings which had then begun to be so strong an element in national progress . She had many children in the midst of all these labours and public interests , seven sons and two daughters , whom she brought up most carefully in all the perfection of her own faith . Three of these sons succeeded one after the other to the Scottish throne , and proved the efficacy of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own . It was in the year 1093 that Margaret 's beautiful and touching life came to an end , in great sorrow yet triumph and pious victory over trouble . Before this time , but at a date not indicated in the narrative , she had parted with her friend and biographer Theodoric , probably not very long before her own death , as we are told that she was oppressed by forebodings , or rather premonitions of death and sorrow , of which she spoke to him with tears . When the moment of separation came both penitent and confessor so long united in the closest bonds of sympathy wept sore . " Farewell , " said the Queen ; " I shall not live long , but you will live long after me . Remember my soul in your prayers , and take care of my children ; cease not to teach and admonish them , especially when they are raised to great estate . " He made the promise with tears , not daring to contradict her by happier auguries , and in this way took his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . He continues his story , however , taking it from the lips of a priest who remained with her during the rest of her life , probably also a Saxon , since he became a monk of St. Cuthbert 's on Margaret 's death . The narrative goes on with an account of the declining health of the Queen . For more than six months she had been unable to mount a horse , or sometimes to rise from her bed , and in the midst of this illness the King set forth upon one of his raids into England , on what provocation or with what motive it is difficult to tell , except that the provocation was perpetual and the motive persistent the leading rule of life . His two elder sons accompanied him on this expedition , which for some reason Margaret had opposed , " much dissuading " him from going ; but this time , unfortunately , had not been hearkened to . Probably she set out along with him , on her way to Edinburgh to pass the time of his absence there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more readily than beyond the sea in Fife . The solitary castle , high perched upon its hill , whence messengers could be seen approaching , or , better still , the King 's banners coming back , was a fitter home for an anxious wife than the palace over the Firth among its woods . How long she remained there we are not told , and there are now unhappily no articulate remains at all of the old stronghold which must have risen upon that height , with its low massive walls and rude buildings . The oldest relic in Edinburgh is that little sanctuary , plain and bare as a shed , deprived of all external appearance of sanctity , and employed for vulgar uses for many centuries , which has been at length discovered by its construction , the small dark chancel arch and rude ornament , to have been a chapel , and which there seems no doubt is at least built upon the site consecrated for Margaret 's oratory , if not the very building itself . It is small enough and primitive enough , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows sending in a subdued light even in the very flush of day , to be of any antiquity . I believe that even the fortunate antiquary who had the happiness of discovering it does not claim for this little chapel the distinction of being the very building itself which Margaret erected . Yet it must have been one very similar , identical in form and ornament , so that the interested spectator may well permit himself to picture the sick and anxious Queen , worn out with illness and weighed down by sore forebodings , kneeling there in the faint light before the shadowed altar , trying to derive such comfort as was possible from the ministrations of the priests , and following with her prayers her husband and her boys , so young still and not hardened to war , who might be falling by the hands perhaps of her own kindred , in the country which was hers , yet which she scarcely knew . In the intervals of these anxious prayers , when her failing strength permitted , how wistfully the Queen and her ladies must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch for the first appearance of any messenger or herald of return . From the woods of Dunfermline and its soft rural landscape , and the new abbey with its sweet singing and all its magnificence , it must have been a change indeed to dwell imprisoned so near the sky , within the low , stern rugged walls of the primitive fort , with a few rude houses clinging about it , and the little chapel on the rock , small and dark , as the only representative of the stately arches and ornate services which she loved . But the little chapel is deeply involved in all the later history of Margaret 's life . Illustration : INTERIOR OF QUEEN MARGARET 'S CHAPEL , EDINBURGH CASTLE One day her attendants remarked that she was even more sad than her wont , and questioning her received a reply which must have made them tremble . " Perhaps to-day , " she said , " a great evil has fallen upon the Scots , such as has not happened to them for years . " Her hearers , however it alarmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prophetic foreboding , which might be but a deepened impression of the prevailing despondency in her heart . No doubt it was a melancholy night in the fortress , where the women who had husbands or sons or brothers in the distant army would cluster together in the antechamber and watch for the attendants who came and went behind the curtain into the sick chamber where the Queen , visibly sinking day by day , lay sleepless and sad , listening for every sound . Terrors surrounded the castle for the personal safety of its occupants as well as for their brethren in the wars ; and no doubt there would be whispers of the King 's brother , Donald Bane , and of the watchful jealous Celtic chiefs all ready to rise with him , should an opportunity occur , and dash the stranger brood from the throne . All these sad prognostications were quickly realised . Next morning brought messengers in fear and distress from the army to say that the King had fallen at Alnwick in Northumberland , and to prove that Margaret 's prophecy had been fulfilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November , dark and cheerless both within and without , and the Queen would seem to have been prostrated for a day or two by the sad news : but on the fourth day she rose from her bed and tottered to the little chapel on the rock to hear mass for the last time , and receive the Holy Sacrament in preparation for death . She then returned to her rooms with the pallor of death already on her face , and bidding all around  --  " me , " says the priest , " and the others who stood by "  --  to recommend her to Christ , asked that the black rood should be brought to her . This was the most holy of all the relics which she had brought with her to Scotland . It was a case of pure gold in the form of a cross , ornamented with marvellous work , bearing the image of the Saviour curiously carved in ivory , and enclosing a portion of the true cross ( proved to be so by many miracles ) . The Queen took it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and touched with it her eyes and face . While thus devoutly employed , with her thoughts diverted from all earthly things , Margaret was brought back to her sorrow by the sudden entrance of her son Ethelred , who had returned from the defeated army to carry to his mother the dreadful news of the death not only of his father but of his elder brother . The sight of his mother in extremity , almost gone , no doubt confused the poor boy , still little more than a stripling , and with that weight of disaster on his head  --  and he answered to her faltering inquiry at first that all was well . Margaret adjured him by the holy cross in her arms to tell her the truth : then when she heard of the double blow , burst out in an impassioned cry . " I thank Thee , Lord , " she said , " that givest me this agony to bear in my death hour . " Her life had been much blessed ; she had known few sorrows ; it was as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had this moment of bitterest anguish before God gave to His beloved sleep . While this sad scene was enacting within , the country was full of tumult and conspiracy without . Donald Bane , the brother of Malcolm , had no doubt chafed at the Saxon regime under which the King had fallen , for years , and struggled against the influences brought in from abroad in the retinue of the foreigner , as has been done in every commonwealth in history at one time or another . He represented the old world , the Celtic rule , the traditions of the past . Some of the chroniclers indeed assert that Malcolm was illegitimate and Donald Bane the rightful heir to the crown . He was , at all events , a pretender kept in subjection while Malcolm 's strong hand held the sceptre , but ready to seize the first opportunity of revolution . No doubt the news of the King 's death , and of that of his heir , would run like wildfire through the country ; but it would seem that the attempt of Donald must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where most of his brother 's children were with their mother , placed there for safety in the King 's absence , had already begun . Upon the death of the Queen , Donald was not likely to have treated the royal children who stood in his way with much mercy ; and the state of affairs was desperate when young Ethelred , the third of her sons , not yet arrived at man 's estate , closed his mother 's eyes , and found himself at the head of the weeping family shut up within the castle , surrounded by precipices on every side except that upon which his angry uncle lay with all the forces of the discontented in Scotland at his back , all the lovers of the old regime and enemies of the stranger , and with a fierce contingent from Norway to support his Celtic horde . In the simplicity of the narrative we hear not a word of the troubled councils which must have been held while the boy prince in his sorrow and the sudden dreadful responsibility laid on his young shoulders turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stronghold , and took thought how to save the children and carry off the precious remains of the Queen . The expedient to which they had recourse was one which their assailants evidently thought impossible . That the rock upon which Edinburgh Castle stands should have been considered inaccessible by practical mountaineers like the followers of Donald Bane seems curious : but in those days the art of climbing for pleasure had not been discovered , and it had no place in the methods of warfare . It seemed enough to the assailants to hold the gates and the summit of the eastern slopes , where probably there must already have been some clusters of huts or rough half-fortified dwellings descending from the Castle Hill , foreshadowing a Lawnmarket at least if not yet a Canongate . No one would seem to have thought of the possibility of any descent on the other side from that perpendicular rock . But despair sharpens the wits , and no doubt after many miserable consultations a desperate expedient was found . Even now nothing but a goat , or a schoolboy , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way down the wonderful curtain of rock which forms the west side of Edinburgh Castle ; and to guide the children and their attendants , a sorrowful little group of mourners , distracted with grief and fear , and Margaret 's body in its litter , down those rocks where there was scarcely footing for an alert and experienced climber , must have been one of the most difficult as it was one of the boldest of undertakings . While the rebel host raged on the other side , and any traitor might have brought the enemy round to intercept that slow and painful descent , it was accomplished safely under cover of " a great myst , " Heaven , as all thought , helping the forlorn fugitives by that natural shield . Mists are no rare things , as everybody knows , on these heights . Perhaps it was the well-known easterly haar , the veil of salt sea fog which Edinburgh so often wraps round her still , which , blowing up from the mouth of the Firth , enveloped the travellers and hid them in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till they had safely reached the level ground , and stealing down to the Queen 's Ferry escaped to loyal Fife and their home in Dunfermline . Needless to say that this mist was a miraculous agency to all the family and servants of the Queen . To us it adds a touch of local colour , the well-known symbol of a familiar scene . Edinburgh was then nothing but a castle upon a rock , and now is one of the fairest and most celebrated of historical cities ; but still its perpendicular crags rise inaccessible against the setting sun , and still the white mist comes sweeping up from the sea . It is to the credit of the priests that this is the only miracle that is connected with the name of Margaret , if we except the pretty legend which tells how a hundred years later , when her descendants removed the remains of the saint from the place where they had been deposited to lay them before the high altar in Dunfermline , the coffin in which they were placed could not be carried past the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the bones of her King . The cortege stopped perforce , the ceremonial had to be interrupted , for all the force of all the bearers could not carry even in death the faithful wife from her husband ; and the only thing it was found that could be done was to transport Malcolm along with the partner of his life to the place of honour , to which on his own account that rude soldier had but little claim . Many saints have had whims as to the place of their interment , and showed them in a similar way , but this is all sweetness and tender fidelity and worthy to be true . The royal pair were carried off afterwards , stolen away like so much gold or silver , by Philip of Spain to enrich his gloomy mausoleum-palace , and can be traced for a long time in one place or another receiving that strange worship which attaches to the most painful relics of humanity . But where they now lie , if in the bosom of the kindly earth or among other dreadful remains in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Margaret had done in her lifetime great things for Scotland . She had introduced comforts and luxuries of every kind , and the decorative arts , and a great deal of actual wealth , into a very poor and distracted country . The earliest charter which is found in the Scottish archives is one of Malcolm and Margaret , showing how the time of settlement and established order began in their reign . She had helped to give the distracted and divided kingdom , made up of warring sects , that consolidation and steadiness which enabled it to take its place among recognised nations . She turned the wavering balance between Celt and Saxon to what has proved to be the winning side , the side of progress and advancement . The Donalds and Duncans were swept away after a brief and bloody interval and were no more possible in Scotland after her , and the reign of the Anglo-Saxon was assured . She was apparently the instrument too , though there is little information on this subject , of drawing the Church of Scotland into that close union with Rome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , if it lost some doubtful freedom and independence in ecclesiastical matters , secured still more completely a recognised place in Catholic Christendom to the northern kingdom . " The pure Culdee " of whom we know so little did not survive , any more than did the Celtic kings , her influence and the transformation she effected . Her life and legend formed the stepping-stone for Scotland into authentic history as into a consolidated and independent existence . The veil of fable and uncertainty cleared away before the mild shining of her name and story . Like Edinburgh coming suddenly into sight , as in some old and primitive picture , high upon its rock , with the slope of the Castle Hill on one side and the precipices round , and the white mist sweeping up from the sea , Scotland itself becomes recognisable and grows into form and order by the light of her peaceful and gracious presence . And it is something worth noting that this image of purity and excellence was no monkish vision of the purity of the cloister , but that more complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true wife , mother , and mistress , whose work was in and for the world and the people , not withdrawn to any exceptional refuge or shelter  --  which has always been most dear to the Anglo-Saxon race . The influence of such an example in a country where manners and morals were equally rudimentary , where the cloister proved often the only refuge for women , and even that not always a safe one  --  was incalculable , and the protection of a virtuous Court something altogether novel and admirable . The gentlewomen who worked at their tapestry under Margaret 's eye , and learned the gentler manners of other Courts and countries of old civilisation by her side , and did their wooing modestly with the sanction of her approval , must have changed the atmosphere of the north in the most wonderful way and quickened every current of national development though the influence was remote and the revolution unperceived . The chroniclers go back with a fond persistence to the story of Margaret and her sons , and the number of her family and the circumstances of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is little but fable ; after her the stream of history flows clear . The story of Macbeth , which is , yet is not , the Shakspearian drama , and accordingly takes quite a curious distinct flow of its own , like a new and imperfect version of something already familiarly known , is the only episode of secular history that has any reality before we come , in the next generation , to herself and her King . The earlier annals of Adamnan , the life of Columba and the records of his sacred isle , belong to those ever-living ever-continuing legends of the saints in which the story of the nations counts for little . But Margaret was fortunately secular , and though a saint , a great and influential personage in the front of everything , and also a woman in the fullest tide of life to whom all human events were happening ; who lived by love and died of grief , and reigned and rejoiced and triumphed as well as suffered and prayed . There followed , however , a terrible moment for that new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken from them . Donald Bane set up a brief authority , restoring the old kingdom and banishing , after the familiar use and wont of such revolutions , his brother 's children from Scotland . Of these children , however , but three sons are mentioned : Edgar , Alexander , and David , who must all have been under age at the time . Ethelred , who had the dangerous office of conveying his brothers and sisters along with his mother 's body to Dunfermline , died or was killed immediately after this feat , and was laid with the King and Queen before the rood altar in Dunfermline ; and of Edmund , an elder son , we have but a confused account , Wynton and Fordun both describing him as " a man of gret wertu , " who died in religion , having taken the cowl of a monk of Cluny ; whereas William of Malmesbury accuses him of treachery and complicity in the murder of his base-born brother Duncan . However this might be , he was at least swept from the succession , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawful heirs were thus reduced to the three boys whom their uncle , Edgar Atheling , had received in England . But Donald Bane was not long permitted to enjoy his conquest in peace . Duncan , the illegitimate son ( but this counted for little in those days ) of Malcolm , who was a hostage in England , after his uncle had held the sovereign power for six months , made a rush upon Scotland with the help of an English army , and overcame and displaced Donald ; but in his turn was overcome after a reign of a year and a half , Donald Bane again resuming the power , which he held for three years more . By this time young Edgar , Margaret 's son , had come to man 's estate , and with the help of the faithful Saxons who still adhered to his uncle , Edgar Atheling , and encouraged by dreams and revelations that the crown was to be his , came back to Scotland and succeeded finally in overcoming Donald and securing his inheritance . The period of anarchy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilisation and good order which Malcolm and Margaret had toiled to establish were for the moment much disturbed . But after Edgar 's succession the interrupted progress was resumed . " He was a man of faire havyng , " says old Wynton , and in his time the Saxon race came again to great honour and promotion , at once by his own firm establishment upon the Scottish throne , and by the marriage of his sister Maud to the new King of England , Henry I. , which restored the Saxon succession and united right to might in England . Thus after a moment of darkness and downfall the seed of the righteous took root again and prospered , and the children of St. Margaret occupied both thrones . Edgar , like so many of his race , died childless ; but he was peacefully succeeded by his brother Alexander , who , though as much devoted to church-building and good works as the rest of his family , was apparently a more warlike personage , since he was called Alexander the Fierce , an alarming title , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other little incidents of the age . He was succeeded in his turn by the youngest of Margaret 's sons , David , that " sair sanct for the crown , " who covered Scotland with ecclesiastical foundations . " He illumynyd in his dayes His landys wyth kirkis and abbayis ; Bishoprychs he fand bot foure or three , Bot or he deyd nyne left he . " Among the many other foundations made by King David was the house of the Holy Rood which has been so familiar a name in Scottish history  --  built low in the valley at the foot of the surrounding hills and that castle in which the Queen died pressing the black rood  --  most precious possession  --  to her dying breast . Whether a recollection of that scene , which might well have impressed itself even on the memory of a child , and of the strange wild funeral procession , with all its associations of grief and terror , which had stumbled down the dangerous rocks in the mist thirty-five years before , was in David 's mind , it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ besides these touching and sacred associations , was a relic of almost unequalled sanctity , and well warranted the erection of a holy house for its guardianship and preservation . How far the street , which would be little more than a collection of huts , had crept down the Castle Hill towards the new monastery in the valley there is no evidence to show , but no doubt both the castle and the religious house were soon surrounded by those humble scattered dwellings , and David 's charter itself makes it plain that already the borough of Edinburgh was of some importance . Part of the revenues of the monastery were to be derived from the dues and taxes of the town , and it was also endowed with " one half of the tallow , lard , and hides of the beasts slain in Edinburgh , " an unsavoury but no doubt valuable gift . The canons of the Abbey of Holyrood , or Holyrood House as it is called from the beginning with a curious particularity , had also permission to build another town between themselves and Edinburgh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the road that led to St. Cuthbert 's , at the farther end of the North Loch , where every man could say his mass ; or more directly still to the dark little chapel upon the castle rock , made sacred by all its memorials of the blessed Margaret . The nucleus of the future capital is thus plainly apparent between the two great forces of that age , the Church , the great instrument of congregation and civilisation , and the Stronghold , in which at any moment of danger refuge could be taken . It is curious to realise the wild solitude of this historical ridge , with its rude houses coming into being one by one , the low thatched roofs and wattled walls which in the course of time were to give place to buildings so stately . The Canongate would be but a country road leading up towards the strong and gloomy gate which gave entrance to the enceinte of the castle  --  itself like some eagle 's nest perched high among the clouds . The line of Margaret went on till her sons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Parliaments were held and laws made in the Castle of Edinburgh , and the scattered huts upon the Castle Hill had grown into a metropolis . They were a pious and in many respects an enlightened race , and they came to great honour and renown on both sides of the house . Maud , Margaret 's daughter , became Queen of England , and her grand-daughter Empress , while Scotland developed and flourished in the hands of the saintly Queen 's sons and their descendants . There are unfortunate individuals in the most prosperous races , and Scotland never sustained greater humiliation than in her attempts to rescue William called the Lion , a sorry lion for his kingdom , when he allowed himself to be caught in a trap and made the prisoner of the English king . But the children of Malcolm and Margaret retained their character through many generations , and were a Godfearing house , full of faith and devotion , careful of their people 's interests , and dear to their hearts . They prospered as the virtuous and excellent so often do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  endowments which indeed proved a snare to the church on after occasions , but which at that period were probably the best means in which money could be invested for the benefit of the people , since alms and succour and help and teaching in every way came from the monks in the primitive circumstances of all nations . They were not only the guardians of learning ; they were examples in husbandry , in building , in every necessary craft ; nursing the sick , receiving the stranger , and , as the very title-deed of their existence , feeding the poor . In those uncomplicated times there was no such fear of pauperising the natives of the soil as holds our hands now , and everything had to be taught to the primitive labourer , who might have to leave the plough in the middle of the furrow and be off and away on his lord 's commands at any moment , leaving his wife and children to struggle on with the help of the good fathers who taught the boys , or the gentle sisters who trained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her brood . David and his brothers , and the devout kings who immediately followed , probably did what was best for their agitated kingdom in establishing so many centres of assured and quiet living , succour and peace , even if what was salvation for their age became the danger of another time . Those foundations continued through the whole of the period during which the lineal descendants of Margaret held the throne . Her lineage , it is true , has never died out : but the strain changed with the death of the last Alexander , and another change came over Scotland not so profound as that which attended the coming of the Saxon princess , yet great and remarkable  --  the end of an age of construction , of establishment , of knitting together ; the beginning of a time disturbed with other questions , with complications of advancing civilisation , nobles and burghers , trade and war . Illustration : ARMS OF QUEEN MARGARET OF SCOTLAND ( From the Ceiling of St. Machar 's Cathedral , Old Aberdeen ) PART II THE STEWARDS OF SCOTLAND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edinburgh is difficult to trace through the mists and the tumults of the ages . The perpetual fighting which envelops the Scotland of those days as in the " great stour " or dust , which was Sir Walter Scott 's conception of a battle , with gleams of swords and flashes of fire breaking through , offers few breaks through which we can see anything like the tranquil growth of that civic life which requires something of a steady and settled order and authority to give it being . The revolutions which took place in the country brought perpetual vicissitude to the Castle of Edinburgh , and no doubt destroyed and drove from their nests upon the eastern slopes of the rock the settlers who again and again essayed to keep their footing there . When the family of St. Margaret came to a conclusion , and the great historical struggle which succeeded ended in the establishment of Robert Bruce upon the throne , that great victor and statesman destroyed the Castle of Edinburgh with other strongholds , that it might not afford a point of vantage to the English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a step which would seem to have been premature , though probably , in the great triumph and ascendency in Scotland which his noble character and work had gained , he might have hoped that at least the unanimity of the nation and its internal peace were secured , and that only an enemy would attempt to dominate the reconciled and united country . The Castle was , however , built up again and again , re-established and destroyed , a centre of endless fighting during the tumultuous reigns that followed , though it is only on the accession of a new race , a family so deeply connected with the modern history of Great Britain that no reader can be indifferent to its early appearances , that Edinburgh begins to become visible as the centre of government , the royal residence from whence laws were issued , and where the business of the nation was carried on . Following what seems to be one of the most wonderful rules of heredity  --  a peculiarity considerably opposed to the views which have been recently current on that subject  --  Robert Bruce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him : and after the trifling and treacherous David the inheritance of his kingdom came through his daughter to a family already holding a high place  --  the Stewards of Scotland , great hereditary officials , though scarcely so distinguished in character as in position . The tradition that their ancestor Banquo was the companion of Macbeth when the prophecy was made to him which had so great an effect upon that chieftain 's career , and that to Banquo 's descendants was adjudged the crown which Macbeth had no child to inherit , is far better known , thanks to Shakspeare , than any fact of their early history . It is probably another instance of that inventive ingenuity of the original chroniclers , which so cleverly imagined a whole line of fabulous kings , to give dignity and importance to the " ancient kingdom " thus carried back to inarticulate prehistoric ages . In this way the Stewarts , actually a branch of a well-known Norman family , were linked to a poetic and visionary past by their supposed identification with the children of Banquo , with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legend , the dignity of Grand Steward of Scotland was conferred by Malcolm Canmore upon a descendant of the ancient thane , and the lineage of the family is traced through all the dim intervening ages with scrupulous minuteness . The title of Steward of Scotland was enough , it would seem , to make other lordships unnecessary , and gradually developed into that family surname with which we are now so familiar , which has wrought both Scotland and England so much woe , yet added so intense an interest to many chapters of national history . The early Stewards are present by name in all the great national events : but have left little characteristic trace upon the records , as of remarkable individuals . They took the cross in repeated crusades , carrying their official coat with its chequers , the brand of the Chief Servitor of the Scottish Court , through the wars of the Holy Land , till they came finally into the highest favour and splendour in the days of Bruce , whose cause , which was also the cause of the independence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the office of Steward , was knighted on the field of Bannockburn . He was afterwards , as the story goes , sent to receive on the Border , after peace had been made , various prisoners who had been detained in England during the war , and among them Marjory Bruce , the daughter of the patriot-king . It would be easy to imagine the romance that followed : the young knight reverently escorting the young princess across the devastated country , which had not yet had time to recover its cruel wounds , but yet was all astir with satisfaction and hope : and how his account of what had happened in Scotland , and , above all , of that memorable field where he had won from the Bruce 's own famous sword the touch of knighthood , would stir the maiden 's heart . A brave young soldier with great hereditary possessions , and holding so illustrious an office , there was no reason why he should despair , however high-placed his affections might be . It takes a little from the romance to be obliged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were early and oft-repeated in those days , and when Marjory Bruce died her husband was still only about twenty-three . It was thus that the crown came to the family of the Stewards of Scotland , the Stewarts of modern times : coming with a " lass " as her descendant said long afterwards , and likely to " go with a lass " when it was left to the infant Mary : though this last , with all her misfortunes , was the instrument not of destruction but transformation , and transferred that crown to a more splendid and enlarged dominion . It was in the reign of Marjory 's son , the grandson and namesake of the Bruce , and of his successors , that Edinburgh began to be of importance in the country , slowly becoming visible by means of charters and privileges , and soon by records of Parliaments , laws made , and public acts proceeding from the growing city . Robert Bruce , though he had destroyed the castle , granted certain liberties and aids to the burghers , both in repression and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to substitute the peaceful progress of the town for the dangerous domination of the fortress . Between that period and the reign of the second Stewart , King Robert III , the castle had already been re-erected and re-destroyed more than once . Its occupation by the English seemed the chief thing dreaded by the Scots , and it was again and again by English hands that the fortifications were restored  --  such a stronghold and point of defence being evidently of the first importance to invaders , while much less valuable as a means of defence . In the year 1385 the walls must have encircled a large area upon the summit of the rock , the enceinte probably widening , as the arts of architecture and fortification progressed , from the strong and grim eyrie on the edge of the precipice to the wide and noble enclosure , with room for a palace as well as a fortress , into which the great castles of England were growing . The last erection of these often-cast-down walls was made by Edward III on his raid into Scotland , and probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enclosure an amplitude unknown before . The Scots king most likely had neither the money nor the habits which made a great royal residence desirable , especially in a spot so easily isolated and so open to attack ; but he gave a charter to his burghers of Edinburgh authorising them to build houses within the castle walls , and to pass in and out freely without toll or due  --  a curious privilege , which must have made the castle a sort of imperium in imperio , a town within a town . The little closets of rooms which in a much later and more luxurious age must have sufficed for the royal personages whom fate drove into Edinburgh Castle as a residence , are enough to show how limited were the requirements in point of space of the royal Scots . The room in which James VI of Scotland was born would scarcely be occupied , save under protest , by a housemaid in our days . But indeed the Castle of Edinburgh was neither adapted nor intended for a royal residence . The abbey in the valley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tidings , where the winds were hushed and the air less keen , and gardens and pleasant hillsides accessible , and all the splendour of religious ceremonies within reach , afforded more fit and secure surroundings even for a primitive court . The Parliament met , however , within the fortress , and the courts of justice would seem to have been held within reach of its shelter . And thither the burghers carried their wealth , and built among the remains of the low huts of an earlier age their straight steep houses , with high pitched roofs tiled with slabs of stone , rising gray and strong within the enceinte , almost as strong and apt to resist whatever missiles were possible as the walls themselves , standing out with straight defiant gables against the northern blue . King Robert III was a feeble , sickly , and poor-spirited king , and he had a prodigal son of that gay , brilliant , attractive , and impracticable kind which is so well known in fiction and romance , and , alas ! also so familiar in common life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Scotch records who was ever raised to that rank  --  nothing above the degree of Earl having been known in the north before the son and brother of the King , the latter by the fatal title of Albany , brought a new degree into the roll of nobility . Young David , all unknowing of the tragic fate before him , was then a daring and reckless youth , held within bounds , as would appear , by the influence of a good and wise mother , and if an anxiety and trouble , at least as yet no disgrace to the throne . He was the contemporary of another madcap prince , far better known to us , of whose pranks we are all more than indulgent , and whose name has the attraction of youth and wit and freedom and boundless humour to the reader still . David of Scotland has had no one to celebrate his youthful adventures like him whose large and splendid touch has made Prince Hal1 so fine a representative of all that is careless and gay in prodigal youth , with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and humour and reckless fancy making its course of wild adventure comprehensible even to the gravest . Perhaps the licence of the Stewart blood carried the hapless northern prince into more dangerous adventures than the wild fun of Gadshill and Eastcheap . And Prince David 's future had already been compromised by certain sordid treacheries about his marriage when he first appears in history , without the force of character which changed Prince Hal into a conquering leader and strong sovereign , but with all the chivalrous instincts of a young knight . He had been appointed at a very early age Lieutenant of the Kingdom to replace his father , it being " well seen and kenned that our lorde the Kyng for sickness of his person may not travail to govern the realm , " with full provision of counsellors for his help and guidance ; which argues a certain confidence in his powers . But the cares of internal government were at this point interrupted by the more urgent necessity of repelling an invasion , a danger not unusual , yet naturally of an exciting kind . 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we feel disposed at all times to take the poet 's word in defiance of history ; though no doubt the historical argument is calculated to throw a chill of doubt upon that gay and brilliant image . On this occasion the invader was Henry IV of England , the father of the other prodigal , whose object is somewhat perplexing , and differs much from the usual raid to which the Scots were so well accustomed . So far as appears from all the authorities , his invasion was a sort of promenade of defiance or bravado , though it seems unlike the character of that astute prince to have undertaken so gratuitous a demonstration . He penetrated as far as Leith , and lay there for some time threatening , or appearing to threaten , Edinburgh Castle ; but all that he seems to have done was to make proclamation by his knights and heralds in every town they passed through , of the old , always renewed , claim of allegiance to the English crown which every generation of Scots had so strenuously and passionately resisted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unmolested is as remarkable as that the invasion was an entirely peaceful one and harmed nobody . When Henry pitched his camp at Leith , Albany was within reach with what is called a great army , but did not advance a step to meet the invader  --  in face of whom , however , young David of Rothesay , and with him many potent personages , retired into Edinburgh Castle with every appearance of expecting a siege there . But when no sign of any such intention appeared or warlike movement of any kind , nothing but the gleam of Henry 's spears , stationary day by day in the same place , and a strange tranquillity , which must have encouraged every kind of wondering rumour and alarm , the young Prince launched forth a challenge to the English king and host to meet him in person with two or three hundred knights on each side , and so to settle the question between them and save the spilling of Christian blood . Henry , it is said , replied with something of the sarcasm of a grave and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David should consider noble blood as less than Christian since he desired the effusion of one and not the other . The position of the young man shut up within the walls of the fortress in enforced inactivity while the hated Leopards of England fluttered in the fresh breezes from the Firth , and Henry 's multitudinous tents shone in the northern sun  --  an army too great to be encountered by his garrison and noble attendants alone  --  while dark treason and evil intent in the person of Albany kept the army of Scotland inactive though within reach , was one to justify any such outbreak of impatience . David must have felt that should the invader press , there was little help to be expected from his uncle , and that he and his faction would look on not without pleasure to see the castle fall and the heir of Scotland taken or slain . But King Henry 's object or meaning is more difficult to divine . Save for his proclamations , and the quite futile summons to King Robert to do homage , he seems to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permitted to march unmolested . The little party of knights with their attendant squires and heralds riding to every market-cross upon the way , proclaiming to the astonished burghers or angry village folk the invader 's manifesto , scarcely staying long enough to hear the fierce murmurs that arose  --  a passing pageant , a momentary excitement and no more  --  was a sort of defiant embassage which might have pleased the fancy of a young adventurer , but scarcely of a king so wary and experienced ; and his own stay in the midst of the startled country is still more inexplicable . When the monks of Holyrood sent a mission to him to beg his protection , lying undefended as they did in the plain , his answer to them was curiously apologetic . " Far be it from me , " he said , " to be so inhuman as to harm any holy house , especially Holyrood in which my father found a safe refuge .... I am myself half Scotch by the blood of the Comyns , " added the invader . The account which Boece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in accord with all that is said by other historians , though they may not take the same amiable view . I quote from the quaint translation of Bellenden . " A schort time efter King Harry came in Scotland with an army . Howbeit he did small injury to the people thairof , for he desirit nowt but his banner to be erected on their walls . Alwayis he was ane plesand enneme , and did gret humaniteis to the people in all places of Scotland where he was lodgit . Finally he showed to the lords of Scotland that he come in their rialm more by counsel of his nobles than ony hatred that he bore to Scottes . Soon efter he returnit without any further injure in England . " It is very seldom that a Scotch historian is able to designate an English invader as " a pleasant enemy , " and whether there was some scheme which came to nothing under this remarkable and harmless raid , or whether it was only the carrying out of Henry 's own policy " to busy giddy minds with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make them look Too near unto my state , " it is difficult to say . The nobles pent up in Edinburgh Castle with the hot-headed young Prince at their head did not know what to make of the pleasant enemy . The alarm he had caused , compelling their own withdrawal into the stronghold , wrath at the mere sight of him there in the heart of Scotland , the humiliating inaction in which they were kept by a foe which neither attacked nor withdrew , must have so chafed the Prince and his companions that the challenge thrown forth like a bugle from the heights to break this oppressive silence and bring about the lingering crisis one way or another must have been a relief to their excitement if nothing else . One of the bewildered reasons alleged for the invasion is that young David had written letters to France in which he called Bolingbroke a traitor  --  letters which had fallen into Henry 's hands ; but this is as unlikely to have brought about the invasion as any other frivolous cause , though no doubt it might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself the settling of the quarrel . We have no reason to suppose that any foreboding of his fate had crossed the mind of the youth at this period of his career , yet to watch the army of England lying below , and to know his uncle Albany close at hand , and to feel himself incapable  --  with nothing but a limited garrison at his command and no doubt the wise Douglas and the other great noblemen holding him back  --  of meeting the invader except by some such fantastic chivalrous expedient , must have been hard enough . And how strange is the scene , little in accordance with the habits and traditions of either country : the English camp all quiet below , as if on a holiday expedition , the Scots looking on in uneasy expectation , not knowing what the next moment might bring . The excitement must have grown greater from day to day within and without , while all the inhabitants , both citizens and garrison , kept anxious watch to detect the first sign of the enemy 's advance . Henry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising in Wales ; not indeed that rising which we all know so well in which Prince Hal , more fortunate than his brother prodigal , had the means of showing what was in him ; but even the suggestion approaches once more strangely and suggestively the names of the two heirs whose fate was so different  --  the one almost within sight of a miserable ending , the other with glory and empire before him . Prince Henry did not apparently come with his father to Scotland , or there might perhaps have been a different ending to the tale , and it would not have needed Harry Hotspur to rouse his namesake from his folly . There was , alas ! no such noble rival to excite David of Scotland to emulation , and no such happy turning-point before him . No one , not even a minstrel or romancer , has remembered it in his favour that he once defied the English host for the love of his country and the old never-abandoned cause of Scottish independence . Already it would seem a prodigal who was a Stewart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fibre in the race had already developed in this early representative of the name , or whether it was the persistent ill-fortune which has always pursued them , making life a continual struggle and death a violent ending , the fatal thread which has run through their history for so many generations comes here into the most tragic prominence , the beginning of a long series of tragedies . It adds a softening touch to the record of David 's unhappy fate that the death of his mother is recorded as one of the great misfortunes of his life . In the same year in which these public incidents occurred the Queen died , carrying with her the chief influence which had restrained her unfortunate son . She was Annabella Drummond , a woman of character and note , much lamented by the people . And to add to this misfortune she was followed to the grave within a year by the great Earl of Angus , David 's father-in-law , and the Bishop of St. Andrews , to whom , as the Primate of Scotland , the young Prince 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is noted along with the others as a special disaster . Thus the rash and foolish youth was left to face the world and all its temptations with no longer any one whom he feared to grieve or whom he felt himself bound to obey . His father , a fretful invalid , had little claim upon his reverence , and his uncle Albany , the strong man of the family , was his most dangerous enemy , ever on the watch to clear out of his path those who stood between him and the throne : or such at least was the impression which he left upon the mind of his time . Thus deprived of all the guides who had power over him , and of the only parent whom he could respect , the young Duke of Rothesay , only twenty-three at most , plunged into all those indulgences which are so fatally easy to a prince . It is supposed that the marriage into which a false policy had driven him was not the marriage he desired . But this was a small particular in those days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rude . He ran into every kind of riot and dissipation , which the councillors appointed to aid him could not check . After no doubt many remonstrances and appeals this band of serious men relinquished the attempt , declaring themselves unable to persuade the Prince even to any regard for decency : and the ill-advised and feeble King committed to Albany , who had been standing by waiting for some such piece of good fortune , the reformation of his son . The catastrophe was not slow to follow . Rothesay was seized near St. Andrews on the pretence of stopping a mad enterprise in which he was engaged , and conveyed to Falkland , where he died in strict confinement , " of dysentery or others say of hunger " is the brief and terrible record  --  blaming no one  --  of the chroniclers , on Easter Eve 1401 . It would be vain to attempt to add anything to the picture of the young unfortunate and his end which Sir Walter Scott has given . We can but rescue out of obscurity the brief moment in which that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into something noble . Had his challenge been accepted , and had he died sword in hand outside the castle gates for Scotland and her independence , how touching and inspiring would have been the story ! But fortune never favoured the Stewarts ; they have had no luck , to use a more homely expression , such as falls to the lot of other races , and what might have been a legend of chivalry , the record of a young hero , drops to the horror of a miserable murder done upon a victim who foils even the pity he excites  --  a young debauchee almost as miserable and wretched as the means by which he died . There was this relic of generosity and honour about the unfortunate Prince , even in his fallen state , that he refused to consent to the assassination of the uncle , who found no difficulty , it would appear , in assassinating him ; thus showing that wayward strain of nobleness among many defects and miseries which through all their tragic career was to be found even in the least defensible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some time been retired from the troubles of the throne , a poor man , infirm in health and in purpose , virtually deposed in favour of the son who was Lieutenant or the brother who was Regent of the kingdom , and from whom all his domestic comfort had been taken as well as his power , was driven to desperation by this blow . He had lost his wife and his best counsellors ; he had never been strong enough to restrain his son , nor resist his brother . David , his first-born and heir , the gay and handsome youth who was dazzling and delightful to his father 's eyes even in his worst follies , had been , as no doubt he felt , delivered over to his worst enemy by that father 's own tremulous hand ; and the heart-broken old man in his bereavement and terror could only think of getting the one boy who remained to him safe and out of harm 's way , perhaps with the feeling that Albany might once again persuade him to deliver over this last hope into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once . The boy-prince was at St. Andrews , pursuing his studies , under the care of the bishop , when his brother was murdered ; and from thence he was sent , when the preparations were complete , across the Firth to the Bass , there to await a ship which should take him to France . It was a forlorn beginning for the Prince of Scotland to be thus hastily taken from his books and the calm of a semi-monastic life and hurried off to that wild rock in the middle of the waves , probably with his brother 's awful story thrilling in his ears and his terrible uncle within reach , pushing forward a mock inquiry in Parliament into the causes of Rothesay 's death . How easy it would have been for that uncle with the supreme power in his hands to seize the boy who now stood alone between him and the throne ; and with what burning at the heart , of impotent rage and fierce indignation , the little Prince , old enough to know and feel his father 's helplessness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , must have been conveyed away to the sea stronghold among the bitter eastern blasts . James , the first of the name , was not one of the feeble ones of the family . With all the romance and poetry of his race he conjoined a great spirit and a noble intelligence , and even at twelve , in the precocious development of that age of blood , when even a royal stripling had to learn to defend himself and hold his own , he must have had some knowledge why it was that he had to be sent thus clandestinely out of his native country : he , the hope of Scotland , in terror for his life . The little garrison on the rock and the governor to whom the Prince 's safety was confided must have watched with many an anxious vigil among the trading vessels stumbling heavily down the Firth from Leith , for that sail which was to carry their charge , into safety as they thought . Whether there was any navy belonging to the Crown at this period , or whether the King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to France , we are not told . But no doubt the ship when it arrived bore some sign by which the Prince 's guardians , and unfortunately others besides , could recognise it . It could not be in any way a cheerful embarkation . It was in the dark days of Lent , in March , when the north is most severe : and the grey skies and blighting wind would be appropriate to the feelings of the exiles as they put forth from their rock amid the wild beating of the surf , anxiously watched by the defenders of the place , who no doubt had at the same time to keep up a vigilant inspection landward , lest any band of spearmen from Albany should arrive upon the adjacent shore in time to stop the flight . The grey rock , the greyer leaden sea , the whirling flight of wild sea birds white against the dark horizon , the little boat , kept with difficulty from dashing against the cliffs and rocky boulders , the attendant ship , driven up and down by the waves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of neutral tint upon the horizon  --  would all increase the sadness of the parting : but no doubt there was a long breath of relief breathed by everybody about when the vessel continued its course , and slowly disappeared down the Firth . Whatever might happen elsewhere , at least the heir was safe . Illustration : THE BASS ROCK But this hope soon proved futile . Whether it was some traitorous indication from Albany , or information from another source , or pure hazard , which directed the English ships to this one vessel with its royal freight , it had but rounded the headland of Flamborough when it fell into the hands of the enemy . Palm Sunday 1405 was the date of this event , but it was not till the end of Lent 1423 , almost exactly eighteen years after , that James came back . The calamity seemed overwhelming to the nation and to all who were not pledged to Albany throughout Scotland . It was the death-warrant of poor old King Robert in his retirement . He lingered out a weary year in sickness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's loss came round again , died at Rothesay , in Bute , amid the lovely lakes and islets of western Scotland  --  a scene of natural peace and tranquillity , which , let us hope , shed some little balm upon the heart of the helpless superseded sovereign . Perhaps he loved the place because it had given his title to his murdered boy , the hapless David , so gallant and so gay . There is something more than ordinarily pathetic and touching in the misfortunes of the feeble in an age of iron . As civilisation advances they have means of protecting themselves , but not in a time which is all for the strongest . One son buried , like any peasant 's son , ignobly in the Abbey of Lindores : the other in an English prison , at the mercy of the " auld enemy , " whom Scotland had again and again resisted to the death : and his kingdom entirely gone from him , in the hands of his arrogant and imperious brother ; there was nothing left for poor King Robert but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an English castle , the King of Scotland . His prison , however , proved a noble school instead of an ignoble confinement to his fine and elevated spirit . The name of Stewart has never been so splendidly illustrated as by this patriotic and chivalrous Prince . No doubt it is infinitely to the credit of the English kings , both Henrys , IV and V , that he received from them all the advantages of education that could have been given to a prince of their own blood  --  advantages by which he profited nobly , acquiring every art and cultivation that belonged to his rank , besides that divine art which no education can communicate , and which is bestowed by what would seem a caprice , were it not divine , upon prince or ploughman as it pleases God . For above all his knightly and kingly qualities , his studies in chivalry and statesmanship , which prepared him to fill the throne of Scotland as no man save his great ancestor Bruce had yet filled it , James Stewart was a poet of no mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence of Chaucer , and well worthy of the place which he has kept in literature . We need not enter here into that part of his history which concerns another locality full of great and princely associations  --  the noble Castle of Windsor , where the royal youth first saw and sang the lady of his love , " the fairest and the sweeteste yonge flour , " of whom he has left one of the most tender and beautiful descriptions that is to be found in all the course of poetry . It is more to our present purpose to tell how , amid all the charms of that courtly residence , so far superior to anything which primitive Scotland could offer in the way of dignity or luxury , the boy-king remained faithful to his country , and maintained the independence for which she had so long struggled . It is said that the one advantage taken of his captivity and youth was to press the old oft-repeated arguments concerning the supposed supremacy of England , and the homage due from the kings of Scotland , upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splendour of what was still a prison , however gracious and kind his jailers might be . No circumstances could have been better suited to impress upon James 's mind the conviction that submission was inevitable : and it would have been almost more than mortal virtue on the part of his captors had they not attempted to bring about so advantageous a conviction . King Henry V , under whom it is said the attempt was made , had been most generously liberal to and careful of the boy . He was a man so brilliant in reputation and success that a generous youth might well have been led by enthusiasm into any homage that was suggested , too happy to feel himself thus linked to so great a king ; and James was very young , distant from his own country and all native advisers , his very life as well as his liberty in the power of those who asked this submission from him , and the force of circumstances so great that even his own people might have forgiven , and Holy Church could scarcely have hesitated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under such pressure . But the royal youth stood fast , and was not to be moved by any argument . Boece , whose authority is unfortunately not much to be depended upon , has a still more distinct and graphic story of judgment and firmness on the part of the young captive . He had been , according to this account , taken to France in the train of King Henry , who after the defeat the English had sustained near Orleans , chiefly through the valour of the Scots who had joined the French army , sent for James , and desired him " to pass to the Scots , and to command them to return to Scotland . King Harry promised , gif the said James brought this matter to good effect , not only to remit his ransom but to send him to Scotland with great riches and honour . " James answered courteously , with expressions of goodwill and gratitude for the humanity shown towards him , but " I marvel not little , " he said , " that thou considerest not how I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ane private man and holden in captivity . " The chronicler adds : " Then said King Henry , ' Maist happy people shall they be that happens to get yon noble man to their prince . ' " It is a pity that we have no more trustworthy proof of this charming story . As a matter of fact James attained his freedom only after the death of Albany , when the resistance or the still more effectual indifference to his liberation of the man who alone could profit by his death in prison , or by any unpopular step he might be seduced into making to gain his freedom , was dead , and had ceased from troubling . It would perhaps , however , be false to say that his imprisonment had done him nothing but good . So far as education went this was no doubt the case ; but it is possible that in his subsequent life his reforms were too rapid , too thorough-going , too modern , for Scotland . The English sovereigns were richer , stronger , and more potent ; the English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strong support to a monarch who stood against the nobles and their capricious tyranny . James might not have been the enlightened ruler he was but for his training in a region of more advanced and cultivated civilisation ; but had he been less enlightened , more on the level of his subjects , he might have had a less terrible end and a longer career . He returned to Scotland  --  with the bride of whom he had made so beautiful a picture , preserving her lovely looks and curious garments , and even the blaze of the Balas ruby on her white throat , to be a delight to all the after generations  --  in 1423 , during Lent ; and on Passion Sunday , which Boece calls Care Sunday , entered Edinburgh , where there was " a great confluence of people out of all parts of Scotland richt desirous to see him : for many of them , " says the chronicle , " had never seen him before , or else at least the prent of his visage was out of their memory . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little prince who had been stolen away for safety at twelve in the accomplished man of thirty in all the fulness of his development , a bridegroom , and accustomed to the state and prestige of a richer Court than anything that Scotland could boast , who thus came among them full of the highest hopes and purposes , and surrounded by unusual splendour and wealth . It is true there was the burden behind him of a heavy ransom to pay , but her English kindred , we may well believe , did not suffer the Lady Jane to appear in her new kingdom without every accessory that became a queen ; and a noble retinue of adventurous knights , eager to try their prowess against the countrymen of that great Douglas whose name was still so well known , would swell the train of native nobles who attended the sovereign . Old Edinburgh comes to light in the glow of this arrival , not indeed with any distinctness of vision , but with something of the aspect of a capital filled to overflowing with a many-coloured and picturesque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the smaller rank of gentlemen , with their wives in the French hoods which fashion already dictated , thronged the ways and filled every window to see the King come in . It was more like the new setting up of a kingdom , and first invention of that dignity , than a mere return : and eager crowds came from every quarter to see the King , so long a mere name , now suddenly blazing into reality , with all the primitive meaning of the word so much greater and more living than anything that is understood in it now . The King 's Grace ! after the long sway of the Regent , always darkly feared and suspected , and the feeble deputy ship full of abuses of his son Murdoch , it was like a new world to have the true Prince come back , the blood of Bruce , the genuine and native King , not to speak of the fair Princess by his side and the quickened life they brought with them . From the gates of the castle where they first alighted , down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow walls , where a few high houses , first evidences of the growth of the wealthy burgher class , alternated with the low buildings which they were gradually supplanting  --  through the massive masonry of the Port with its battlements and towers to the country greenness and freshness of the Canon 's Gate which led to the great convent of the valley , there could be no finer scene for a pageant . Holyrood was one of those great monastic establishments in which kings could find a lodgment more luxurious than in their own castles , and though there would scarcely seem as yet to have been any palace attached to that holy house , it was already a frequent residence of royalty , and with all its amenities of parks and gardens would be more fit for the reception of a young queen coming straight from princely Windsor than the narrow chambers in the castle . Among the many presents which she is said to have brought with her from England there is a special mention of fine tapestries for the adornment of her new habitation . Thus the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interest and affection of the lively and eager crowd for which Edinburgh has always been famous  --  a populace more like that of a French town than an English , though with impulses sometimes leading to tragedy . James would scarcely seem to have been settled in that part of the ancient establishment of the abbey which was appropriated to the lodging of the King , or to have exhausted the thanksgivings of Easter and the rejoicings of the restoration , when he set himself to inquire into the state of the country and of the royal finances , to which he had been so long a stranger . There was no Civil List in those days nor votes of supply , and the state of the Crown lands and possessions , " the King 's rents , " was doubly important in view of the ransom yet to be paid , of which only a fourth part had been remitted as the portion of the Queen . The result of this investigation was anything but satisfactory . It was found that during the reign of Albany many of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bestowed upon the leaders of the faction which supported the Regent . " There was nothing left to sustain the Crown , " says Boece , " except the customs of burrows . He was naething content of this , " adds the chronicler with pithy conciseness , " howbeit he shewed good will ( gud vult ) for the time . " James had already griefs enough against the family of his cousin without this startling discovery ; and his " gud vult " would seem rather to have been the serious self-control of a man who was biding his time than any pretence of friendliness with his unfaithful relations and stewards . Amid the early pageants and festivities it is indeed recorded that he knighted Walter Stewart among the other candidates for that honour , the flower of the noble youth , a band of twenty-six gentlemen of the best houses in Scotland ; but this was probably a step which was inevitable , as it would have been impossible to leave his own nearest relative out of the list until he had finally made up his mind how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is stated that the complaints and grievances of the people brought him to a decision on this point , and helped him to carry out his revenge upon the house which had , in popular belief at least , the guilt of his brother 's blood upon it as well as that of his own long confinement . Walter Stewart , whose only other appearance in history is that of a rebellious and undutiful son whom his father was incapable of keeping in subjection , was arrested in Edinburgh Castle about a year after James 's restoration , and after an interval of several months his arrest was followed by that of Duke Murdoch and his son Alexander , both of whom were also seized in Edinburgh Castle , where they had probably retired for safety . A few of their retainers arrested with them were speedily liberated , and it became apparent that upon this doomed family alone was King James 's wrath directed . They were tried at Stirling , by a court of their peers , under the presidency of the King himself . The offences charged against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest of public sins : but it was no less the end of a long tragedy . The younger branch of the race had been engaged in a struggle with the elder for the last two generations at least : and it had been the royal line that had suffered most during that period . Bitterly , in blood and heartbreak and long suppression , they had been weighed down under superior force : but now the time of reprisals had come . As they stood there confronting each other , the stern young King on one side and his kinsmen on the other , with a quarter of a century of wrong between them , the shadow of the young prince at Falkland , and the old father at Rothesay , and the eighteen years of captivity full in the minds of all , what a day of reckoning at last ! It makes the retribution almost more tragic , like the overwhelming fate of the Greek drama , that the men upon their trial had nothing to do with these crimes , unless it might be the last . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that was his only evident offence , and his sons were not instrumental , so far as appears , in any injury to their royal cousin . The sins of the fathers were to be visited upon the children . We are told that the two sons , young men in the flower of their youth , were executed one day , and their father and maternal grandfather , a very old man , the Earl of Lennox , whose share in the matter it is difficult to make out , on the next . Thus James settled summarily the question between himself and his kinsmen . The house of Albany ended upon the scaffold , and however just their doom might have been , there was something appalling in this swift and sweeping revenge , carried out rigorously without a sign of hesitation by a young king , a happy bridegroom , an accomplished and gay cavalier . It must indeed be allowed , notwithstanding his poetry and his evident love of everything that was lovely and of good report , that the reign of the first James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his accomplishment , and that he was the flower of knighthood , of splendour and courtesy , the most chivalrous , the most daring , the most graceful and gracious of all his Court : and his genius as a poet is even more generally acknowledged . The King 's " Quhair " as a poem is quite capable of standing on its own merits , and needs no additional prestige as the performance of a king . Had he been but a wandering minstrel Chaucer would have had no need to be ashamed of his pupil . It is full of delightful descriptions of nature and love and youth : the fresh morning as it rises upon the castled heights , the singing of the birds and fluttering of the leaves , the impulse of a young heart even in the languor of imprisonment to start up and meet the sun , with all the springs of new life which at that verdant season come with every new day  --  the apparition of the beautiful one suddenly appearing in the old immemorial garden with all its flowers , herself the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before us , with a harmony and music not to be excelled . The young Prince chafing at his imprisonment , dreaming of all the fantastic wonderful things he might do were he free , yet still so full of irrepressible hope that his impatience and his longings are but another form of pleasure , takes shape and identity as distinct as if he had been one of the figures in that famous pilgrimage to Canterbury , which had been part of his training in this delightful art . If James had never reigned at all he would still have lived through all these centuries in the guise in which he stood at his window on that May morning , and suddenly , amid his youthful dreams , beheld the lovely vision of the Lady Jane emerging from under the young spring verdure of the trees . There is a certain window not generally supposed to be that at which the royal captive stood  --  a window in the Norman Tower of Windsor Castle , now fitly garnished and guarded by sympathetic hands , from which the spectator looking out upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ donjon will scarcely be able to withstand the thrill of feeling which attends a poetic scene and incident fully realised . Nothing could be more green , more fresh , more full of romance and association , than this garden where all is youthful as the May , yet old in endless tradition , the garden of the Edwards and Henrys , where Chaucer himself may have thought over his accounts or taken the delightful image of his young squire " synging " who was , " or flouting all the day " from among some group of bright-faced lads in their bravery , where the countess who dropped her garter may have wandered , and the hapless Henry , the mild and puny child who was born there while James was undergoing his far from harsh captivity , played . James Stewart 's name , had he been no king , would have been associated with this place , as that of his master in poetry is with the flowery ways of Kent . Nor was his inspiration derived alone from the well of English undefiled . A still more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his native country . Though the tones of Scotch humour were much less refined , and its utterances at that early period could be scarcely more than the jests and unwritten ballads of the populace , yet his early acquaintance with them must have lingered in the young Prince 's mind , acquiring additional zest from the prepossessions of exile and the longing for home . And when the polished singer of the King 's " Quhair " found himself again in his native land he seems to have burst forth with the most genuine impulse into the broad fun , rustical and natural and racy of the soil , which perhaps was more congenial to his Scottish audience . " Peblis to the Play " and " Christis Kirk on the Green " are poems full of the very breath of rural life and the rude yet joyous meetings of the country folk at kirk and market , which with wonderfully little difference of sentiment and movement also inspired Burns . He must have had a mind full of variety and wide human sympathy almost Shakspearian , who could step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all romance and ethereal splendour , to the lasses in their gay kirtles , and Hob and Raaf with their rustic " daffing , " as true to the life as the Ayrshire clowns of Burns , and all the clumsy yet genial gambols of the village festival . It is one of the most curious and least to be expected transformations of poetic versatility  --  for it is even amazing how he could know the life into which he thus plunged joyous , as if he had been familiar with it from his childhood . King James was not without an object amid all the laughter and the pranks of his holiday . The King 's cheerful ridicule of the clumsy fellows who could not draw the bow was intended , with a prick of scorn under the laughter , to rouse up his rustic lieges to emulation , not to be behind the southern pock-puddings whose deadly arrows were , in every encounter between Scots and English , the chief danger to the fighting men of the north . It is curious that this difference should have existed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Scotch spearmen were all but invulnerable in their steady square , like a rock , but they had little defence against the cloth-yard shafts of the English bowmen , which neither exhortation nor ridicule , neither prizes to win nor disaster to fear , could teach them to adopt . James laboured hard , in ways more practical than his poems , to introduce this new arm , but in vain . It was kept up languidly in holiday contentions , like that of Christis Kirk on the Green , while his life lasted ; but when his reign was over and the momentary stimulus withdrawn the bows were all thrown away . The King 's command of this humorous vein , so dear to his people , with its trenchant sketches from the life and somewhat rough jests , is wonderful , when his courtly breeding and long separation even from such knowledge of rustic existence as a prince is likely to obtain is considered . And the many-sided nature which made these humours so familiar and easy to him is a strange discovery in the midst of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ union of the most delicate poetry and romance with that genial whim and fancy is unusual enough : but it is still more unusual to find the stern Justiciar , avenger of blood and redresser of wrong , the reconstructer of a distracted country , capable not only of the broad fun of the rustic ballad-maker , but of so tolerant and humorous a view of the humble commons , the underlying masses upon which society is built . For the first aspect of affairs in Scotland could not be a cheerful one : although it was rather with the nobles and gentlemen , the great proprietors of the country , who had to be summoned to exhibit their charters and prove their titles , partly no doubt with the view of discovering what Crown lands had been alienated by the Albany party , that the King 's quarrel was , than with the humbler subjects of the nation . Yet there is no doubt , with all these lights and softening influences of character and genius , that his reign was a stern one . James had everything to reform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new ideas and so enlarged a knowledge of what the internal economy of a nation might be made . It is rather against the general historical estimate of the talents and power of the Regent Albany that the new King should have found , as appears , so much to do for the reorganisation of the commonwealth  --  regulating the laws , appointing courts of justice , inquiring into the titles of property , and in every other way giving consistency and order to the affairs of Scotland . However , the lavish grants made to the great Scots lords and the licence given them to rule their vassals as they pleased arose not from weakness but from Albany 's deliberate policy of securing a strong party on his side , a policy exactly opposed to that of James , whose heart was set on subduing these fierce nobles , and perhaps of developing the people at large , the nation itself , if that is not too modern an ambition . The reign of Law , broken and disturbed by a hundred storms , but still henceforward with a statute-book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command , began in Scotland in his day . There are some curious details in the Scotichronicon about the taxes , now , it would seem , for the first time levied upon the general mass of the people . In 1424 , the year after James 's return , a tax of twelve pence in the pound was imposed by the Parliament at Perth , for the maintenance of the King 's state and payment of his ransom , upon all goods , lands , and annual revenues of whatever description , both spiritual and temporal , which was passed with the consent of the estates , no doubt under the stimulus of the general rejoicing at the King 's return . This impost was to last for two years . An income tax so general and all-embracing could scarcely be expected to be popular , but for the first year it was paid , we are told , with readiness , certain of the greatest nobles in the kingdom being appointed in their various districts to the office of collecting . That the Church should have taken her share in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Scotch priesthood and their unity with the people at this crisis of the national history . In the second year , however , grumblings arose . It is comprehensible that a nation unaccustomed to this pressure should respond to it in a moment of enthusiasm , yet become uneasy under the repetition when the enthusiasm had probably died away , especially if a fear arose that it might become permanent . King James , however , adopted a course not at all usual with governments when the power to exact has once been placed in their hands . When the popular murmur came to his ears he stopped at once the unpopular demand . How the paying of the ransom was carried on , and how the maintenance of the King 's state we need not inquire . The Crown lands were no doubt extensive still . Some years later another experiment of the same kind was made ; the new tax , however , being only twopence in the pound , and its object the payment of expenses of a mission sent to France to negotiate a marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an object which does not appear to have appealed to the sympathies of the people , since we are told that it was the cause of immediate murmurs , the King not only stopped the unpopular tax but returned the money to those who had paid it  --  a most admirable but seldom followed example . The curious system afterwards employed by all the Scots kings of tours or " raids " of justice throughout the kingdom seems to have originated in James 's energetic reign , but he carried not only the officers of the law , but occasionally his entire Parliament with him , moving about to the different centres of Scotland with great impartiality . Sometimes they met at Edinburgh , in the Great Parliament Hall in the Castle , and made " many good laws if they could have been kept , " says the chronicler ; sometimes at Perth , a favourite residence of the King ; and on one memorable occasion so far north as Inverness , where , impatient of continual disquietude in the Highlands , James went to chastise the caterans and bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a severe and unsparing hand , seizing a number of the most eminent chiefs who had been invited to meet him there , and executing certain dangerous individuals among them without mercy . These summary measures would seem to have borne immediate fruit in the almost complete subjugation of the Highlands . But it was hard to reckon with such a restless element as the clans , and hanging and heading were very ineffectual measures among people with whom " another for Hector " was the simplest suggestion of natural law . It was after this stern Parliament of Inverness that there occurred at Edinburgh one of the most curious and picturesque scenes that it is possible to imagine . One of the chiefs tried at that assize was the greatest and most important of all , the Lord of the Isles , sometimes called Donald and sometimes Alexander by the chroniclers , who on his promise to amend his ways , and no longer harbour caterans or head forays , was , no doubt out of respect for his almost princely position , set at liberty . But no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few days after , " says the chronicler , than he took and burnt the town of Inverness , in which the Parliament had been held , and showed his impenitence by an utter abuse of the mercy accorded to him . When , however , he heard that the King himself with all the forces of the kingdom was coming against him , Donald hastily disbanded his men and took refuge in the watery fastnesses of his islands : and it would seem that he must have felt the tide of national sentiment to be against him , and his power not equal to make any stand against all the force of peaceful and law-abiding Scotland under the energetic new King . The wily Highlander made his submission in the way which , no doubt , he thought most likely to disarm authority and gain exemption . He choose Easter day , the greatest of religious festivals , for his appearance as a penitent , and in the middle of the service in the Chapel of Holyrood appeared suddenly , almost without clothing , and knelt down before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " praying for grace in the name of Him who rose from the dead that day . So strange an interruption in the midst of all the glories of the Easter mass throws a strange and wild light upon the varieties of national life in Scotland . That half-savage figure , with plaid and weapons cast aside , defenceless , at the King 's mercy , in all the primitive abandonment yet calculation of early patriarchal times ; while all that the art and culture of a splendid age could do to give magnificence to the most imposing ceremonial of the Church surrounded this strange apparition , the incense rising , the music pealing , the Court in all its glory of flashing jewels and splendid stuffs filling the lofty area . Like some wild god of the mists suddenly gleaming through the fragrant smoke between the bishop 's white robes and the kneeling King , what a strange interruption to the mass ! The King , at the request of the Queen we are told , gave him his life , as the adjuration addressed to him and all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ; for he could not have offended the sentiment of his people by refusing the boon which was demanded in that Name , however doubtful he might be of the expediency of granting it . " Then the King began to muse , " says Boece . He must have been devout indeed to have been able to return to the course of the service with the Islesman before him on his knees , and all that wild half of the kingdom , with its dangerous habits and fierce tribal laws , thus suddenly made visible  --  a spectre which had often before troubled the King 's peace . James had not to learn for the first time that apparent submission from such a suppliant did not necessarily mean any real change , and must have thoroughly felt the hollowness of that histrionic appearance and all the difficulties which beset his own action in the matter . The conclusion was , that the life of the Lord of the Isles was spared , but he was committed to safe keeping in the strong Castle of Tantallon , with , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field with all his caterans in his stead . James reigned in Scotland for thirteen years  --  a reign full of commotion and movement , by which many in high place were humiliated , the spoils of the feudal tyrants taken from them , and the wrongs of the suffering commonalty redressed , proceedings which procured for the King many enemies among the nobility before the force of popular sentiment was strong enough to balance this opposition by its support . He began in Scotland that struggle which for some time had been going on in England against the power of the nobles , who were still in the north something like a number of petty kings ruling in their own right , making little account of national laws , and regarding the King with defiance as almost a hostile power . One of the greatest risks of such a struggle is that it raises now and then a fiery spirit stung by the sense of injury and the rage of deprivation into a wild passion of revenge which bursts every restraint . The Grahams of Strathearn in the north had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws of property : and out of this house there suddenly arose the tragic figure of an avenger whose brief but terrible career occupies but a single page in history , yet contains all the elements of a fatal drama . Sir Robert Graham , of whose antecedents there is little record , was not the head of the house , but a younger brother of daring character , and one of those fanatics of race to whom the glory of their house is a religion . The first we hear of him is a sudden appearance in the Parliament of January 1435 , when he made a fiery and violent speech , ending by an impeachment of the King himself for injustice and robbery . Such an assault would find little support in the public assembly of the States , in the awe of the royal presence , and Graham had to escape for his life , finding means of flight into the Highlands , the ever-ready refuge for rebels . There he launched wild threats against James , which the King , probably well accustomed to missiles of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warned too , we are told , by another wild apparition , which suddenly appears out of the mists for this purpose  --  a Highland witch of the order of those who drove Macbeth 's ambition to frenzy , but whose mission now was to warn James of the mischief brewing against him . The King was brave and careless , used to the continual presence of danger , keeping his Christmas merrily at Perth with all the sports and entertainments with which it was possible to cheat the gloomy weather , and made little but additional mirth both of the prophecy and the threats . Evidently the Court found pleasure in the fair city on the Tay . They were still lingering there , having taken up their residence in the monastery of the Black Friars , at the end of February . In Scotland as elsewhere the great religious houses seem to have been the best adapted to give hospitality to kings . It was long after this date before anything that could be called an independent royal residence was built at Holyrood itself : for generations the King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was , like the monastery of the Black Friars , so convenient and commodious a house both for entertainment and shelter that its great chambers became the natural , as they were the most stately and pleasant , lodging that could be provided for a monarch . The tragedy that followed is well known . At the end of a pleasant evening when there had been music  --  in which James himself was the first connoisseur in Scotland , inventing , some say , the national lilt , the rapidly rising and falling strain which is so full of pathos yet so adaptable to mirth  --  " and other honest solaces of grete pleasance and disport , " the sound of trampling feet and angry voices broke upon the conventual stillness outside and the cheerful talk of the friendly group within . The King was taken at a disadvantage , apparently without even a gentleman of his Court near him , nothing but his wife and her ladies lingering for a last moment of pleasant conversation before they went to bed . It is easy to imagine the horror with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the savage band , hoping perhaps at first that it was but some tumult in the street , or affray between the townsfolk and the caterans  --  never very far off and often threatening St. John 's town  --  till the cries and clashing of the arms came nearer , and wild torch-light flared through the high windows and proved the fatal object of the raid . The groans of a few easily despatched sentinels , the absence of any serious opposition or stand in defence , the horrible discovery of bolts and bars removed and the King at the mercy of his enemies , must have followed in a few terrible moments . No incident in history is better known than that piteous attempt of one distracted girl , a Douglas , born of a heroic race , to bar the door with her own slim arm , thrusting it through the holdfasts from which the bolt had been taken away : poor ineffectual bar ! yet enough to gain a moment when moments were so precious , and while there was still a chance of saving the King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distracted attempts to find a place of concealment for the victim , are too heartrending to be repeated here . James fell , it is said , with sixteen wounds in him , hacked almost to pieces , yet facing his murderers so desperately that some of them bore the marks of his dying grip when they were brought to the scaffold to be killed in their turn with every circumstance of horror conceivable some time later . The execution of these miserable traitors , one of them the King 's own uncle Athole , took place at Edinburgh for the greater solemnity and terror of the punishment , which was accomplished by every kind of torture . The Queen , too , after the horrible scene of which she had been a witness , and almost more than a witness  --  for she had thrown herself before her husband and had been wounded in the terrible struggle  --  gathered her children and fled to Edinburgh Castle to put the little heir of the kingdom , now James II , in security . The hapless child was sadly crowned at Holyrood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the first of many such disastrous rites to come . The time of James 's reign had been one of rising prosperity throughout the realm . Law and order had been established in recognised courts and tribunals , the titles of property had been ascertained and secured , not without loss , no doubt , to many arrogant lords who had seized upon stray land without any lawful title , or on whom it had been illegally bestowed during the Albany reign  --  but to the general confidence and safety . And the condition of the people had no doubt improved in consequence . It is difficult to form any estimate of what this condition was . All foreign witnesses give testimony of an unpleasing kind , and represent the country as wretched , squalid , and uncivilised : but on the other hand nothing can be more unlike this report than the most valuable and unintentional evidence furnished by King James 's own poems , with their tale of village merry-makings and frays which convey no impression of abject poverty , nor even of that rudest level of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighter thoughts . " On Mayday , " says King James , " when everybody is bound to Peblis to the play , " " At Beltane quhan ilke bodie bownis To Peblis to the play , To heir the singing and sweit soundis , The solace suth to say . Be firth and forest furth they found , They graythit them full gay ; God wot that wald they do that stound , For it was thair feist day They said Of Peblis to the Play . " All the lasses of the west , he goes on to tell us , were up at cockcrow , and no men might rest for the chatter and the noise of their preparations . One cried that her curch was not starched enough , another that a hood was best , another bewailed herself as " so evil sunburnt " that she was not fit to be seen . The young folk stream along " full bold " with the bagpipes blowing , and every village adding its contingent , " he before and she before to see which was most gay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Some said the Quene of May Was cumit Of Peblis to the Play . " When they arrive at the " taverne hous " they give orders that the board be served , and to see that the napery is white , " for we will dyn and daunce . " At " Christis Kirk on the Green " there is a similar description , the lasses coming out as before , " weshen clean , " in their new grey kirtles " well prest with many plaits , " with their gloves of doeskin and morocco shoes . All these incidental traits , and the atmosphere of the merry ballads , though both end in a fray , contradict with vigour the cold and wretched picture given by outsiders of a country where the people warmed themselves by burning sulphureous stones dug out of the ground , where the houses had a cow 's hide stretched for a door , and all was squalid misery and nakedness . There was plenty of fighting going on it is evident  --  not a lowland fair without its broken heads ( a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean authority , lasted into the nineteenth century )  --  and much oppression , the great lords reigning like absolute tyrants in the midst of subjects without resource or protection ; but the case of the peasantry notwithstanding all these evils does not seem to have been a bad one . A certain vigorous capacity of revival , which history shows us continually as existing on the broad level of the soil , must have brought them back to rough ease and comfort , and the freedom of the natural healthful atmosphere which makes itself apparent in transcripts of life so little likely to be forced or optimistic . In all times and circumstances there can be little doubt that the amount of simple enjoyment to be got out of life , especially by the young , who form at least the half of every community , far exceeds the elements of wellbeing which outsiders see in it . And the protection of the Church , the comparative quiet to be enjoyed on church lands , the charities and succour of the cloister , must have made an incalculable addition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was calculated to increase the stability and good order which are the best guarantees of national life ; even his severities cultivating a sense of security in the weak and a wholesome consciousness of the necessity of self-restraint in the strong . For the first time for many generations the nobles were kept within bounds , and exceptional cruelties became if not impossible , yet of so certain discovery and punishment that lesser tyrants at least must have trembled . The law that might makes right fell into temporary disuse , and a better law , that of the courts that sat periodically over all the kingdom , and  --  appealing still more strongly to the imagination  --  a king that shut his ears to no petition and interfered with a strong hand to right the wronged , began a new era for the commonalty of Scotland . Even the unfavourable description so often quoted of Eneas Silvius , reports the common people as having " abundance of flesh and fish , " no small ingredient of wellbeing , and records rather a complete absence of luxuries than that want which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority tells of exportations of " hides , wool , salt fish , and pearls , " the latter a curious item , although there were as yet no manufactures , and even such necessaries as horse-shoes and every kind of harness had to be imported from Flanders . But the Scots in their farmhouses and cottages made the cloth with which they were clothed , and their " blew caps , " the well-known blue bonnet which has lasted to our own days . And they retained the right which , according to her monkish chronicler , St. Margaret had been the first to secure for them  --  of immunity from all military requisitions , and even , which is a curious contradiction of the supposed tyrannies of the nobles , held an absolute property in their own goods which out of the island of Great Britain no peasantry in the world possessed . The French allies who were in Scotland in the end of the fourteenth century were struck with angry consternation to hear themselves hailed by a set of clodhoppers , and bidden to keep the paths and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , however willing the Scots men-at-arms might be to harry England when occasion offered , not the greatest lord in the French contingent could carry off a cow or a brace of pullets without compensation . We can not but think that the country in which the peasant 's barnyard was thus defended was at least as forward in the best elements of civilisation as those in which there were hangings of arras and trenches of silver , but no security for anything in homesteads or workshop which might be coveted by the seigneur . Illustration : HOLYROOD Edinburgh , as has been said , never seems to have been a favourite habitation of this enlightened and accomplished Prince . Perhaps Queen Jane found the east winds too keen on the heights , or the Abbey of the Holy Rood too low in the valley . The heir was born there it is true , and we have note of various Parliaments and visits , but no settled residence in the capital . One incident is mentioned by the chroniclers which must have afforded a picturesque scene , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at a duel between a knight called Henry Knokkis or Knox ( curious precursor in the dimness of distance of another of his name ! ) , who had been accused by an Edinburgh burgess of treasonable speeches against the King  --  and his accuser . But who this accuser was , and by what privilege he was allowed to meet a gentleman and knight in single combat we have no information . Perhaps he was himself of noble blood , a younger son , a man before his time , seeking the peaceful profits of trade instead of those of the marauder , as it has become the fashion of a later age to do . It is almost impossible not to fancy that there must have been a touch of the burlesque in this combat , which James himself interfered to stop , separating the combatants . He was very careless it would seem of treasonable speeches , apt to treat them lightly and very probably smiled a little at the zeal of the citizen who was more jealous of his honour than he was himself . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for any feat of arms , if the winds did not interfere before the King and blow the combatants away : and the old-world crowd with their many colours , the jerkins slashed and embroidered with the blazon of all the great families in Scotland , the plumed caps and dazzling helmets of courtier and knight , the border of blue bonnets outside , and all the shining array of fair ladies around and behind the throne , would present a more striking picture than the best we could do nowadays . Let us hope the sun shone and warmed the keen clear air , and threw into high relief the towers and bastions against the northern blue . Edinburgh by this time had grown into the proportions of a town . The houses which the citizens had the privilege of building within the castle precincts would appear to have been low , to secure the protection of the walls ; and by certain precautionary regulations for their preservation from fire it would seem that many of them were still thatched . The King 's residence there , judging from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more advanced period , must have been small and poor , though there already existed a Parliament Hall , in which probably other great assemblies were held . The city walls were continued along the crest of the ridge in narrow lines , deflecting a little only on the south side , where the limits were broken by several wealthy and well-cultivated enclosures where brotherhoods were established  --  White and Black Friars , sons of Augustine and Dominic , with their great detached houses , their gardens always an example of husbandry , and chapels filling the air with pleasant sound of bells . King James had himself endowed , besides many existing foundations , a monastery for the Franciscans or Grey Friars , which has always continued to be one of the chief ecclesiastic centres of Edinburgh . It was so fine a building , as the story goes , that the humble-minded Minors declined at first to take possession of it as being too magnificent for an Order vowed to poverty ; though as their superior was a monk from Cologne , sent for by the King on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great convents of the Continent , such an objection is curious . On the south side of the town , at some distance outside the walls , on the platform afterwards occupied by the buildings of the old High School , stood amid its blossoming gardens the Church of St. Mary in the Field , afterwards so fatally known as the Kirk of Field , a great house so extensive and stately that it had already served on several occasions as a royal lodging . St. Giles 's , one of the oldest foundations of all , stood among its graves , at the foot of the Castle Hill in the centre of the life of ancient Edinburgh , as it does still . These clusters of sacred buildings , encircled by their orchards and gardens , made a fringe of verdure , of charity and peace , sanctuaries for the living and resting-places for the dead , round the strong and dark fortifications of the little royal town , which hitherto had held for its life upon that ridge of rock , a dangerous eminence lying full in every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE FIERY FACE It is clear that the public opinion of Scotland , so far as there was such a thing in existence , had no sympathy whatever with the murderers of James . The instruments of that murder were in the first place Highland caterans , with whom no terms were ever held and against whom every man 's hand was armed . And the leaders who had taken advantage of these wild allies against their natural monarch and kindred were by the very act put beyond the pale of sympathy . They were executed ferociously and horribly , according to the custom of the time , the burghers of Perth rising at once in pursuit of them , and the burghers of Edinburgh looking on with stern satisfaction at their tortures  --  these towns feeling profoundly , more perhaps than any other section of the community , the extraordinary loss they had in the able and vigorous King , already , like his descendant and successor , the King of the commons , their stay and encouragement . If there was among the nobility less lamentation over a ruler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was sternly bent on repressing all abuse of power , it was silent in the immense and universal horror with which the event filled Scotland . It would seem probable that the little heir , only six years old , the only son of King James , was not with his parents in their Christmas rejoicings at Perth , but had been left behind at Holyrood , for we are told that the day after his father 's death the poor little wondering child was solemnly but hastily crowned there , the dreadful news having flown to the centre of government . He was " crownd by the nobilitie , " says Pitscottie , the great nobles who were nearest and within reach having no doubt rushed to the spot where the heir was , to guard and also to retain in their own hands the future King . He was proclaimed at once , and the crown , or such substitute for it as could be laid sudden hands upon , put on his infant head . The scene is one which recurred again and again in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it its touching features . At six years old even the intimation of a father 's death , especially when taking place at a distance , would make but a transitory impression upon the mind ; yet we may well imagine the child taken from his toys , wrapped from head to foot in some royal mantle , with a man 's crown held over his baby head , receiving with large eyes of wonder and fright easily translated into tears , the sacred oil , the sceptre which his little fingers could scarcely enclose . Alas for the luckless Stewarts ! again and again this affecting ceremony took place before the time of their final promotion which was the precursor of their overthrow . They were all kings almost from their cradle  --  kings ill-omened , entering upon their royalty with infant terror and tears . Illustration : EDINBURGH CASTLE FROM THE SOUTH-WEST When they had crowned the little James , second of the name , the lords held a convention " to advise whom they thought most able both for manheid and witt to take the government of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this office , neither of whom was taken from a very great family , or had , so far as can be known , any special importance  --  Sir Alexander Livingstone , described as Knight of Callender , and Sir William Crichton , Chancellor of Scotland . Perhaps it was one of the compromises which are so common when parties are nearly equal in power which thus placed two personages of secondary importance at the head of affairs : but any advantage which might have been secured by this selection was neutralised by the division of power , which added to all the evils of an interregnum the perplexity of two centres of government , so that " no man knew , " as says Pitscottie , " whom he should obey . " One of the Regents reigned in Edinburgh , the other in Stirling  --  one had the advantage of holding possession of the King , the other had the doubtful good of the support of the Queen . It may be imagined what an extraordinary contrast this was to the firm and vigilant sway of a monarch in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his many gifts and accomplishments , his vigorous and manful character and his unquestioned right to the government and obedience of the country . It had been hard work enough for James I. , with all these advantages , to keep his kingdom well in hand : and it would not be easy to exaggerate the difficulties now , with two rival and feeble powers , neither great enough to overawe nor united enough to hold in check the independent power of the great houses which vied with each other in the display of dominion and wealth . In a very brief time all the ground gained by King James was lost again . Every element of anarchy arose in new force , and if it had been hard to secure the execution of the laws which would have been so good had they been kept in the time when their chief administrator was the King himself , it may be supposed what was the difficulty now , when , save in a little circuit round each seat of authority , there was virtually no power at all . Pitscottie gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this lamentable interval . " In the mean time many great dissensions rose amongst us , but it was uncertain who were the movers , or by what occasion the chancellor exercised such office , further than became him . He keeped both the Castle of Edinburgh and also our young King thereintill , who was committed to his keeping by the haill nobilitie and ane great part of the noble men assisted to his opinion . Upon the other side , Sir Alexander Livingstoun bearing the authoritie committed to him by consent of the nobilitie , as said is , contained another faction , to whose opinion the Queen mother with many of the nobility very trewly assisted . So the principals of both the factions caused proclaime lettres at mercat crosses and principal villages of the realm that all men should obey conforme to the aforesaid letters sent forth by them , under the pain of death . To the which no man knew to whom he should obey or to whose letters he should be obedient unto . And also great trouble appeared in this realm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priests , and poor men and labourers hauntind to their leisum ( lawful ) business either private or public . These men because of these enormities might not travel for thieves and brigands and such like : all other weak and decrepit persons who was unable to defend themselves , or yet to get food and sustentation to themselves , were most cruelly vexed in such troublous times . For when any passed to seek redress at the Chancellor of such injuries and troubles sustained by them , the thieves and brigands , feigning themselves to be of another faction , would burn their house and carry their whole goods and gear away before ever they returned again . And the same mischief befell those that went to complain to the Governor of the oppression done to them . Some other good men moved upon consideration and pitie of their present calamities tholed ( endured ) many such injuries , and contained themselves at home and sought no redresse . In the midst of these things and troubles , all things being out of order , Queen-Mother began to find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chancellor 's power and augment the Governor 's power , whose authority she assisted . " The position of Queen Jane in the circumstances in which her husband left her , a woman still young , with a band of small children , and no authority in the turbulent and distracted country , is as painful a one as could well be imagined . Her English blood would be against her , and even her beauty , so celebrated by her chivalrous husband , and which would no doubt increase the immediate impulse of suitors , in that much-marrying age , towards the beautiful widow who was of royal blood to begin with and still bore the title of Queen . That she seems to have had no protection from her royal kindred is probably explained by the fact that Henry VI was never very potent or secure upon his throne , and that the Wars of the Roses were threatening and demanding the whole attention of the English Government . Wounded in her efforts to protect her husband by her own person , seeing him slaughtered before her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any woman 's life , hard as were the lives of women in that age of violence , than that which passed over Jane Beaufort 's head in the Blackfriars Monastery amid the blood and tumult of that fatal night . The chroniclers , occupied by matters more weighty , have no time to picture the scene that followed that cruel and horrible murder , when the distracted women , who were its only witnesses , after the tumult and the roar of the murderers had passed by , were left to wash the wounds and compose the limbs of the dead King so lately taking his part in their evening 's pastime , and to look to the injuries of the Queen and the torn and broken arm of Catherine Douglas , a sufferer of whom history has no further word to say . The room with its imperfect lights rises before us , the wintry wind rushing in by those wide-open doors , waving about the figures on the tapestry till they too seemed to mourn and lament with wildly tossing arms the horror of the scene  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pausing no doubt to pick up what scattered jewels or rich garments might lie in their way : and by the wild illumination of a torch , or the wavering leaping flame of the faggot on the hearth , the two wounded ladies , each with an anxious group about her  --  the Queen , covered with her own and her husband 's blood ; the girl , with her broken wrist , lying near the threshold which she had defended with all her heroic might . They were used to exercise the art of healing , to bind up wounds and bring back consciousness , these hapless ladies , so constantly the victims of passion and ambition . But amid all the horrors which they had to witness in their lives , horrors in which they did not always take the healing part , there could be none more appalling than this . Neither then nor now , however , is it at the most terrible moment of life , when the revolted soul desires it most , that death comes to free the sufferer . The Queen lived , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Holyrood , the five little maidens who were dependent upon her , and resumed the burden of life now so strangely different , so dull and blank , so full of alarms and struggles . Her elder child , the little Princess Margaret , had been sent to France three or four years before , at the age of ten , to be the bride of the Dauphin  --  a great match for a Scottish princess  --  and it is possible that her next sister , Eleanor , who afterwards married the Duc de Bretagne , had accompanied Margaret  --  two little creatures solitary in their great promotion , separated from all who held them dear . But the four infants who were left would be burden enough for the mother in her unassured and unprotected state . It would seem that she was not permitted to be with her boy , probably because of the jealousy of the Lords , who would have no female Regent attempting to reign in the name of her son : but had fixed her residence in Stirling under the shield of Livingstone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the functions of the Regency , and especially the most weighty one , that of training the King . Crichton , however , who was Chancellor , had been on the spot when James II was crowned , and had secured his guardianship by the might of the strong hand , if no other , removing him to Edinburgh Castle , where he could be kept safe under watch and ward . The Queen , who would seem to have been throughout of Livingstone 's faction , and who no doubt desired to have her son with her , both from affection and policy , set her wits to discover a " moyane , " as the chroniclers say , of recovering the custody of the boy . The moyane was simple and primitive enough , and might well have been pardoned to a mother deprived of her natural rights : but it shows at the same time the importance attached to the possession of the little King , when it was only in such a way that he could be secured . Queen Jane set out from Stirling " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared at the gates of Edinburgh Castle suddenly , without warning as would seem , asking to be admitted to see her son . The Chancellor , wise and wily as he was , would appear to have acknowledged the naturalness of this request , and " received her , " the chronicler says , " with gladness , and gave her entrance to visit her young son , and gave command that whensoever the Queen came to the castle it should be patent to Her Grace . " Jane entered the castle accordingly , with many protestations of her desire for peace and anxiety to prevent dissensions , all which was , no doubt , true enough , though the chroniclers treat her protestations with little faith , declaring her to have " very craftilie dissembled " in order to dispel any suspicion the Chancellor may have entertained . It would seem that she had not borne any friendship to him beforehand , and that her show of friendship now required explanation . However that might be , she succeeded in persuading Crichton of her good faith , and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her natural place in his affections . How long they had been separated there is no evidence to show , but it could scarcely be difficult for the mother to recover , even had it fallen into forgetfulness , the affection of her child . When she had remained long enough in the castle to disarm any prejudices Crichton might entertain of her , and to persuade the little King to the device which was to secure his freedom , the Queen informed the Chancellor that she was about to make a pilgrimage to the famous shrine of Whitekirk , " the white kirk of Brechin , " Pitscottie says , in order to pray for the repose of the soul of her husband and the prosperity of her son , and asked permission to carry away two coffers with her clothes and ornaments , probably things which she had left in the castle before her widowhood , and that means of conveyance might be provided for these possessions to Leith , where she was to embark . This simple request was easily granted , and the two coffers carried out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ship in which she herself embarked with her few attendants . But instead of turning northward Queen Jane 's ship sailed up the Firth , through the narrow strait at Queensferry , past Borrowstounness , where the great estuary widens out once more , into the quiet waters of the Forth , winding through the green country to Stirling on its hill . She was " a great pairt of the watter upward before ever the keepers of the castle could perceive themselves deceived , " says Pitscottie . As the ship neared Stirling , the Governor of the kingdom came out of the castle with all his forces , with great joy and triumph , and received the King and his mother . For one of the coffers , so carefully packed and accounted for , contained no less an ornament than the little King in person , to whose childish mind no doubt this mode of transport was a delightful device and pleasantry . One can imagine how the Queen 's heart must have throbbed with anxiety while her son lay hidden in the bed made for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or any varlet made the discovery prematurely , all her hopes would have come to an end . She must have fluttered like a bird over her young about the receptacle in which her boy lay , and talked with her ladies over his head to encourage and keep him patient till the end of the journey was near enough , amid the lingering links of Forth , to open the lid and set him free . It is not a journey that is often made nowadays , but with all the lights of the morning upon Demayat and his attendant mountains , and the sun shining upon that rich valley , and the river at its leisure wending , as if it loved them , through all the verdant holms and haughs , there is no pleasanter way of travelling from Edinburgh to Stirling , the two hill-castles of the Scottish crown . Illustration : INNER BARRIER , EDINBURGH CASTLE It would be pleasant to think that Queen Jane meant something more than the mere bolstering up of one faction against another in the distracted kingdom by the abduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did so , and that to strengthen the hands of the man who was really Regent-Governor of Scotland , but whose power had been stolen from his hands by the unscrupulousness of Crichton , seemed to her a great political object , and the recovery of the supreme authority , which would seem to have appeared to all as infallibly linked with the possession of the young King , of the greatest importance . It is evident it was considered by the general public to be so ; but there is something pitiful in the struggle for the poor boy , over whose small person those fierce factionaries fought , and in whose name , still so innocent and helpless as he was , so many ferocious deeds were done . No sooner was he secure in Stirling than the Governor called together a convention of his friends , to congratulate each other and praise the wit and skill of " that noble woman , our soverain mother , " who had thus set things right . " Whereby I understand , " he says piously , " that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor yet the hardy man happiest , " seeing that Crichton , though so great and sagacious and powerful , should be thus deceived and brought to shame . " Be of good comfort therefore , " adds this enlightened ruler ; " all the mischief , banishment , troubles , and vexation which the Chancellor thought to have done to us let us do the like to him . " He ended this discourse by an intimation that he was about to besiege Edinburgh . " Let us also take up some band of men-of-war , and every man after his power send secret messages to their friends , that they and every one that favours us may convene together quietly in Edinburgh earlie in the morning , so that the Chancellor should not know us to come for the sieging of the castle till we have the siege even belted about the walls ; so ye shall have subject to you all that would have arrogantly oppressed you . " This resolution was agreed to with enthusiasm , the Queen undertaking to provision the army " out of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " belted the siege about the castle , " an expression which renders most graphically the surrounding of the place , than the Chancellor , taken by surprise , prostrated by the loss of the King , and finding it impossible to draw the powerful Earl of Douglas to his aid , made overtures of submission , and begged for a meeting " in the fields before the gates , " where , with a few chosen friends on either side , the two great functionaries of the kingdom might come to an agreement between themselves . By this time there would seem to have begun that preponderating influence of the Douglas family in Scotland which vexed the entire reign of the second James , and prompted two of the most violent and tragic deeds which stain the record of Scottish history . James I. was more general in his attempt at the repression and control of his fierce nobility , and the family most obnoxious to him was evidently that of his uncle , nearest in blood and most dangerous to the security of the reigning race . The Douglas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a power and place unexampled , and which it took the entire force of Scotland , and all the wavering and uncertain expedients of law , as well as the more decisive action of violence quite lawless , to put down . Whether there was in the pretensions of this great house any aim at the royal authority in their own persons , or ambitious assertion of a rival claim in right of the blood of Bruce , which was as much in their veins as in those of the Stewarts , as some recent historians would make out , it is probably now quite impossible to decide . The chroniclers say nothing of any such intention , nor do the Douglases themselves , who throughout the struggle never hesitated to make submission to the Crown when the course of fortune went against them . The Chancellor had been deeply stung , it is evident , by the answer of Douglas to his appeal , in which the fierce Earl declared that discord between " you twa unhappie tyrants " was the most agreeable thing in the world to him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue . Deprived of the sanction given to all his proceedings by the name of the King , outwitted among his wiles , and exposed to the ridicule even of those who had regarded his wisdom with most admiration , Crichton would seem to have turned fiercely upon the common opponent , perhaps with a wise prescience of the evil to come , perhaps only to secure an object of action which might avert danger from himself and bring him once more into command of the source of authority  --  most likely with both objects together , the higher and lower , as is most general in our mingled nature . The meeting was held accordingly outside the castle gates , the Chancellor coming forth in state bearing the keys of the castle , which were presented , Buchanan says , to the King in person , who accompanied the expedition , and who restored the great functionary to his office . The great keys in the child 's hand , the little treble pipe in which the reappointment would be made , the tiny figure in the midst of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the many pictorial scenes of an age so rich in the picturesque ; but the earlier writers say nothing of the little James 's presence . There was , however , a consultation between the two Regents , and Douglas 's letter was read with such angry comments as may be supposed . The Earl 's contempt evidently cut deep , and strongly emphasised the necessity of dealing authoritatively with such a high-handed rebel against the appointed rulers . It would appear , however , that little could be done against the immediate head of that great house , and the two rulers , though they had made friends over this common object , had to await their opportunity , and in the meantime do their best to maintain order and to get each the chief power into his own hands . Crichton found means before very long to triumph over his adversaries in his turn by rekidnapping the little King , for whom he laid wait in the woods about Stirling , where James was permitted precociously to indulge the passion of his family for hunting . No doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persuade the boy to a renewed escape , for " the King smiled , " say the chroniclers , probably delighted by the novelty and renewed adventure  --  the glorious gallop across country in the dewy morning , a more pleasant prospect than the previous conveyance in his mother 's big chest . Thus in a few hours the balance was turned , and it was once more the Chancellor and not the Governor who could issue ordinances and make regulations in the name of the King . Nothing , however , could be more tedious and trifling in the record than these struggles over the small person of the child-king . But the story quickens when the long-desired occasion arrived , and the two rulers , rivals yet partners in power , found opportunity to strike the blow upon which they had decided , and crush the great family which threatened to dominate Scotland , and which was so contemptuous of their own sway . The great Earl , Duke of Touraine , almost prince at home , the son of that Douglas whose valour had moved England , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a battle  --  died in the midst of his years , leaving behind him two young sons much under age as the representatives of his name . It is extraordinary to us to realise the place held by youth in those times , when one would suppose a man 's strength peculiarly necessary for the holding of an even nominal position . Mr. Church has just shown in his Life of Henry V how that prince at sixteen led armies and governed provinces ; and it is clear that this was by no means exceptional , and that the right of boys to rule themselves and their possessions was universally acknowledged and permitted . The young William , Earl of Douglas , is said to have been only about fourteen at his father 's death . He was but eighteen at the time of his execution , and between these dates he appears to have exercised all the rights of independent authority without tutor or guardian . The position into which he entered at this early age was unequalled in Scotland , in many respects superior to that of the nominal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every step he took  --  counsellors and critics more plentiful than courtiers . The chronicles report all manner of vague arrogancies and presumptions on the part of the new Earl . He held a veritable court in his castle , very different from the semi-prison which , whether at Edinburgh or Stirling , was all that James of Scotland had for home and throne  --  and conferred fiefs and knighthood upon his followers as if he had been a reigning prince . " The Earl of Douglas , " says Pitscottie , " being of tender age , was puffed up with new ambition and greater pride nor he was before , as the manner of youth is ; and also prideful tyrants and flatterers that were about him through this occasion spurred him ever to greater tyranny and oppression . " The lawless proceedings of the young potentate would seem to have stirred up all the disorderly elements in the kingdom . His own wild Border county grew wilder than ever , without control . Feuds broke out over all the country , in which revenge for injuries or traditionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's breast not only of killing his neighbour , but taking possession of his neighbour 's lands . The caterans swarmed down once more from the mountains and isles , and every petty tyrant of a robber laird threw off whatever bond of law had been forced upon him in King James 's golden days . This sudden access of anarchy was made more terrible by a famine in the country , where not very long before it had been reported that there was fish and flesh for every man . " A great dearth of victualls , pairtly because the labourers of the ground might not sow nor win the corn through the tumults and cumbers of the country , " spread everywhere , and the state of the kingdom called the conflicting authorities once more to consultation and some attempt at united action . The meeting this time was held in St. Giles 's , the metropolitan church , then , perhaps , scarcely less new and shining in its decoration than now , though with altars glowing in all the shadowy aisles and the breath of incense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have been any prejudice as to using a sacred place for such a council , though it might be in the chapter-house or some adjacent building that the barons met . It is to be hoped that they did not go so far as to put into words within the consecrated walls the full force of their intention , even if it had come to be an intention so soon . There was but a small following on either side , that neither party might be alarmed , and many fine speeches were made upon the necessity of concord and mutual aid to repress the common enemy . The Chancellor , having restolen the King , would no doubt be most confident in tone ; but on both sides there were equal professions of devotion to the country , and so many admirable sentiments expressed , that " all their friends on both sides that stood about began to extol and love them both , with great thanksgiving that they both regarded the commonwealth so mickle and preferred the same to all private quarrels and debates . " The decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at which aggrieved persons throughout the country might appear and make their complaints . The result was a crowd of woeful complainants , " such as had never been seen before . There were so many widows , bairns , and infants seeking redress for their husbands , kin , and friends that were cruelly slain by wicked murderers , and many for hireling theft and murder , that it would have pitied any man to have heard the same . " This clamorous and woeful crowd filled the courts and narrow square of the castle before the old parliament-hall with a murmur of misery and wrath , the plaint of kin and personal injury more sharp than a mere public grief . The two rulers and their counsellors no doubt listened with grim satisfaction , feeling their enemy delivered into their hands , and finding a dreadful advantage in the youth and recklessness of the victims , who had taken no precaution , and of whom it was so easy to conclude that they were " the principal cause of these enormities . " Whether their determination to sacrifice the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed at once , it is impossible to say . Perhaps some hope of moulding his youth to their own purpose may have at first softened the intention of the plotters . At all events they sent him complimentary letters , " full of coloured and pointed words , " inviting him to Edinburgh in their joint names with all the respect that became his rank and importance . The youth , unthinking in his boyish exaltation of any possibility of harm to him , accepted the invitation sent to him to visit the King at Edinburgh , and accompanied by his brother David , the only other male of his immediate family , set out magnificently and with full confidence with his gay train of knights and followers  --  among whom , no doubt , the youthful element predominated  --  towards the capital . He was met on the way by Crichton  --  evidently an accomplished courtier , and full of all the habits and ways of diplomacy  --  who invited the cavalcade to turn aside and rest for a day or two in Crichton Castle , where everything had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feastings and delights the great official discoursed to the young noble about the duties of his rank and the necessity of supporting the King 's government and establishing the authority of law over the distracted country , sweetening his sermon with protestations of his high regard for the Douglas name , whose house , kin , and friends were more dear to him than any in Scotland , and of affection to the young Earl himself . Perhaps this was the turning-point , though the young gallant in his heyday of power and self-confidence was all unconscious of it ; perhaps he received the advice too lightly , or laughed at the seriousness of his counsellor . At all events , when the gay band took horse again and proceeded towards Edinburgh , suspicion began to steal among the Earl 's companions . Several of them made efforts to restrain their young leader , begging him at least to send back his young brother David if he would not himself turn homeward . " But , " says the chronicler , " the nearer that a man be to peril or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grace to hear them that gives him any counsel to eschew the peril . " Illustration : EDINBURGH CASTLE FROM THE VENNEL The only result of these attempts was that the party of boys spurred on , more gaily , more confidently than ever , with the deceiver at their side , who had spoken in so wise and fatherly a tone , giving so much good advice to the heedless lads . They were welcomed into Edinburgh within the fatal walls of the Castle with every demonstration of respect and delight . How long the interval was before all this enthusiasm turned into the stern preparations of murder it seems impossible to say  --  it might have been on the first night that the catastrophe happened , for anything the chroniclers tell us . The followers of Douglas were carefully got away , " skailled out of the town , " sent for lodging outside the castle walls , while the two young brothers were marshalled , as became their rank , to table to dine with the King . Whether they suspected anything , or whether the little James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to happen , it is impossible to tell . The feast proceeded , a royal banquet with " all delicatis that could be procured . " According to a persistent tradition , the signal of fate was given by the bringing in of a bull 's head , which was placed before the young Earl . Mr. Burton considers this incident as so picturesque as to be merely a romantic addition ; but no symbol was too boldly picturesque for the time . When this fatal dish appeared the two young Douglases seem at once to have perceived their danger . They started from the table , and for one despairing moment looked wildly round them for some way of escape . The stir and commotion as that tragic company started to their feet , the vain shout for help , the clash of arms as the fierce attendants rushed in and seized the victims , the deadly calm of the two successful conspirators who had planned the whole , and the pale terrified face of the boy-king , but ten years old , who " grat verie sore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sake to let them go , make one of the most impressive of historical pictures . The two hapless boys were dragged out to the Castle Hill , which amid all its associations has none more cruel , and there beheaded with the show of a public execution , which made the treachery of the crime still more apparent ; for it had been only at most a day or two , perhaps only a few hours , since the Earl and his brother in all their bravery had been received with every gratulation at these same gates , the welcome visitors , the chosen guests , of the King . The populace would do little but stare in startled incapacity to interfere at such a scene ; some of them , perhaps , sternly satisfied at the cutting off of the tyrant stock ; some who must have felt the pity of it , and had compunction for the young lives cut off so suddenly . A more cruel vengeance could not be on the sins of the fathers , for it is impossible to believe that the Regents did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the famous Douglas race . Older and more experienced men would not have fallen into the snare , or at all events would have retained the power to sell their lives dear . If the motives of Livingstone and Crichton were purely patriotic , it is evident that they committed a blunder as well as a crime : for instead of two boys rash and ill-advised and undeveloped they found themselves in face of a resolute man who , like the young king of Israel , substituted scorpions for whips , persecuting both of them without mercy , and finally bringing Livingstone at least to destruction . The first to succeed to William Douglas was his uncle , a man of no particular account , who kept matters quiet enough for a few years ; but when his son , another William , succeeded , the Regents soon became aware that an implacable and powerful enemy , the avenger of his two young kinsmen , but an avenger who showed no rash eagerness and could await time and opportunity , was in their way . The new Earl married without much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their relationship , the little Maid of Galloway , to whom a great part of the Douglas lands had gone on the death of her brothers , and thus united once more the power and possessions of his name . He was himself a young man , but of full age , no longer a boy , and he would seem to have combined with much of the steady determination to aggrandise and elevate his race which was characteristic of the Douglases , and their indifference to commonplace laws and other people 's rights , an impulsiveness of character , and temptation towards ostentation and display , which led him at once to submission and to defiance at unexpected moments , and gave an element of uncertainty to his career . Soon after his succession it would seem to have occurred to him , after some specially unseemly disputes among some of his own followers , that to get himself into harmony with the laws of the realm and gain the friendship of the young King would be a good thing to do . He came accordingly to Stirling where James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and struggles , and throwing himself at the boy 's feet offered himself , his goods and castles , and life itself , for the King 's service , " that he might have the licence to wait upon His Majesty but as the soberest courtier in the King 's company , " and proclaimed himself ready to take any oath that might be offered to him , and to be " as serviceable as any man within the realm . " James , it would seem , was charmed by the noble suitor , and all the glamour of youth and impulse which was in the splendid young cavalier , far more great and magnificent than all the Livingstones and Crichtons , who yet came with such abandon to the foot of the throne to devote himself to its service . He not only forgave Douglas all his offences , but placed him at the head of his government , " used him most familiar of any man , " and looked up to him with the half-adoring admiration which a generous boy so often feels towards the first man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when James was but thirteen . It would be as easy to say that Douglas displaced with a rush the two more successful governors of the kingdom , and took their places by storm  --  and perhaps it would be equally true : yet it would be vain to ignore James as an actor in national affairs because of his extreme youth . In an age when a boy of sixteen leads armies and quells insurrections , a boy of thirteen , trained amid all the exciting circumstances which surrounded James Stewart , might well have made a definite choice and acted with full royal intention , perhaps not strong enough to be carried out by its own impulse , yet giving a real sanction and force to the power which an elder and stronger man was in a position to wield . We have no such means of forming an idea of the character and personality of the second James as we have of his father . No voice of his sounds in immortal accents to commemorate his loves or his sadness . He appears first passively in the hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other , a poor little royal pawn in the big game which was so bloody and so tortuous . His young memory must have been full of scares and of guileful expedients , each party and individual about him trying to circumvent the other . Never was child brought up among wilder chances . The bewildering horror of his father 's death , the sudden melancholy coronation , and all the nobles in their sounding steel kneeling at his baby feet , which would be followed in his experience by no expansion or indulgence , but by the confinement of the castle ; the terrible loneliness of an imprisoned child , broken after a while by the sudden appearance of his mother , and that merry but alarming jest of his conveyance in the great chest , half stifled in the folds of her embroideries and cloth of gold . Then another flight , and renewed stately confinement among his old surroundings , monotony broken by sudden excitements and the babble in his ears of uncomprehended politics , from which , however , his mind , sharpened by the royal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would no doubt come to find meaning at a far earlier age than could be possible under other circumstances . And then that terrible scene , most appalling of all , when he had to look on and see the two lads , not so much older than himself , young gallants , so brave and fine , to whom the boy 's heart would draw in spite of all he might have heard against them , so much nearer to himself than either governor or chancellor , those two noble Douglases , suddenly changed under his eyes from gay and welcome guests to horrified victims , with all the tragic passion of the betrayed and lost in their young eyes . Such a scene above all must have done much to mature the intelligence of a boy full like all his race of spirit and independence , and compelled to look on at so much which he could not stop or remedy . Thus passive and helpless , yet with the fiction of supremacy in his name , we see the boy only by glimpses through the tumultuous crowd about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he flashes forth into the foreground , the chief figure in a scene more violent and terrible still than any that had preceded it , taking up in his own person the perpetual and unending struggle , and striking for himself the decisive blow . There is no act so well known in James 's life as that of the second Douglas murder , which gives a sinister repetition , always doubly impressive , to the previous tragedy . And yet between the two what fluctuations of feeling , what changes of policy , how many long exasperations , ineffectual pardons , convictions unwillingly formed , must have been gone through . That he was both just and gentle we have every possible proof , not only from the unanimous consent of the chronicles , but from the manner in which , over and over again , he forgives and condones the oft-repeated offences of his friend . And there could be few more interesting psychological studies than to trace how , from the sentiments of love and admiration he once entertained for Douglas , he was wrought to such indignation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that precedent which must have been so burnt in upon his childish memory , and to repeat the tragedy which within the recollection of all men had marked the Castle of Edinburgh with so unfavourable a stain . We are still far from that , however , in the bright days when Douglas was Lieutenant-Governor of the kingdom , and the men who had murdered his kinsmen were making what struggle they could against his enmity , which pursued them to the destruction of one family and the frequent hurt and injury of the other . How Livingstone and his household escaped from time to time but were finally brought to ruin , how Crichton wriggled back into favour after every overthrow , sometimes besieged in his castle for months together , sometimes entrusted with the highest and most honourable missions , it would be vain to tell in detail . James would seem to have yielded to the inspiration of his new prime minister for a period of years , until his mind had fully developed , and he became conscious , as his father had been , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sway of the great nobles , their continual feuds among themselves , and the reckless independence of each great man 's following , whose only care was to please their lord , with little regard either for the King and Parliament or the laws they made . During this period his mother died , though there is little reason to suppose that she had any power or influence in his council , or that her loss was material to him . She had married a second time , another James Stewart called the Black Knight of Lorne , and had taken a considerable part in the political struggles of the time always with a little surrounding of her own , and a natural hope in every change that it might bring her son back to her . It is grievous that with so fair a beginning , in all the glow of poetry and love , this lady should have dropped into the position of a foiled conspirator , undergoing even the indignity of imprisonment at the hands of the Regents whom she sometimes aided and sometimes crossed in their arrangements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a queen-mother whose influence was feared and discouraged and every attempt at interference sternly repressed , would need to have been of a more powerful character than appears in any of her actions to make head against her antagonists . She died in Dunbar in 1446 , of grief , it is said , for the death of her husband , who had been banished from the kingdom in consequence of some hasty words against the power of the Douglas , of whom however , even while he was still in disgrace , Sir James Stewart had been a supporter . Thus ended in grief and humiliation the life which first came into sight of the world in the garden of the great donjon at Windsor some quarter of a century before , amid all the splendour of English wealth and greatness , and all the sweet surroundings of an English May . James was married in 1450 , when he had attained his twentieth year , to Mary of Gueldres , about whom during her married life the historians find nothing to say except that the King awarded pardon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an entirely appropriate and becoming office . No doubt his marriage , so distinct as a mark of maturity and independence , did something towards emancipating James from the Douglas influence ; and it is quite probable that the selection of Sir William Crichton to negotiate the marriage and bring home the bride may indicate a lessening supremacy of favour towards Douglas in the mind of his young sovereign . Pitscottie records a speech made to the Earl and his brothers by the King , when he received and feasted them after their return from a successful passage of arms with the English on the Border , in which James points out the advantage of a settled rule and lawful authority , and impresses upon them the necessity of punishing robbers and reivers among their own followers , and seeing justice done to the poor , as well as distinguishing themselves by feats of war . By this time the Douglases had once more become a most formidable faction . The head of the house had so successfully worked for his family that he was on many occasions surrounded by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his brothers having in succession , by means of rich marriages or other means of aggrandisement , attained the same rank as himself , and , though not invariably , acting as his lieutenants and supporters , while his faction was indefinitely increased by the followers of these cadets of his house , all of them now important personages in the kingdom . It was perhaps the swelling pride and exaltation of a man who had all Scotland at his command , and felt himself to have reached the very pinnacle of greatness , which suggested the singular expedition to France and Rome upon which Douglas set forth , in the mere wantonness of ostentation and pride , according to the opinion of all the chroniclers , to spread his own fame throughout the world , and show the noble train and bravery of every kind with which a Scottish lord could travel . It was an incautious step for such a man to take , leaving behind him so many enemies ; but he would seem to have been too confident in his own power over the King , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No sooner was he gone , however , than all the pent-up grievances , the complaints of years during which he had wielded almost supreme power in Scotland , burst forth . The King , left for the first time to himself and to the many directors who were glad to school him upon this subject , was startled out of his youthful ease by the tale of wrong and oppression which was set before him . No doubt Sir William Crichton would not be far from James 's ear , nor the representatives of his colleague , whom Douglas had pursued to the death . The state of affairs disclosed was so alarming that John Douglas , Lord Balvenie , the brother of the Earl , who was left his procurator and representative in his absence , was hastily summoned to Court to answer for his chief . Balvenie , very unwilling to risk any inquisition , held back , until he was seized and brought before the King . His explanations were so little satisfactory , that he was ordered at once to put order in the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " a command which he received respectfully , but as soon as he got free ignored altogether , keeping fast hold of the ill-gotten possessions , and hoping , no doubt , that the momentary indignation would blow over , and all go on as before . James , however , was too much roused to be trifled with . When he saw that no effect was given to his orders he took the matter into his own hands . The Earl of Orkney with a small following was first sent with the King 's commission to do justice and redress wrongs : but when James found his ambassador insulted and repulsed , he took the field himself , first making proclamation to all the retainers of the Douglas to yield to authority on pain of being declared rebels . Arrived in Galloway , he rode through the whole district , seizing all the fortified places , the narrow peel-houses of the Border , every nest of robbers that lay in his way , and , according to one account , razed to the ground the Castle of Douglas itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lochmaben , the two chief strongholds of the house . But James 's mission was not only to destroy but to restore . He divided the lands thus taken from the House of Douglas , according to Pitscottie , " among their creditors and complainers , till they were satisfied of all things taen from them , whereof the misdoers were convict . " This , however , must only have applied , one would suppose , to the small losses of the populace , the lifted cows and harried lands of one small proprietor and another . " The King , " adds the same authority , " notwithstanding of this rebellion , was not the more cruel in punishing thereof nor he was at the beginning : " while Buchanan tells us that his clemency and moderation were applauded even by his enemies . This is throughout the opinion which we find of James . He was capable of being moved to sudden violent indignation and hasty action , as was too distinctly demonstrated afterwards ; but the hasty outburst once over came back at once without rancour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anger , ready to hear whatever the accused might have to say for himself , and to pardon as long as pardon was possible . Notwithstanding the rebellious and audacious contempt of all authority but their own shown by the Douglas party , notwithstanding the standing danger of their insolent power , their promises so often broken , their frequent submissions and actual defiance , his aim in all his dealings with them was rather to do justice to the oppressed than to punish the guilty . His genial temper , and that belief in his kind which is always so ingratiating a quality , is proved by the account Major gives of his life on those military expeditions which from this time forth occupied so much of his time . He lived with his soldiers as an equal , that historian tells us , eating as they did , without the precaution of a taster , which Major thinks highly imprudent , but which would naturally bind to the frank and generous monarch the confidence and regard of his fellow-soldiers , and the captains with whom he shared the sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events was conveyed to Douglas , now in England on his return from the pilgrimage of pride and ostentation to which , though it was professedly for the Papal jubilee , no one attempts to give a religious character . He was returning at his leisure , lingering on his way , not without suspicion of secret treaties with the English in support of the party of York , though all the prepossessions of Scotland and King James were on the other side : but hurried home on hearing the news , and was politic enough to make immediate submission as soon as he became aware of the seriousness of the crisis , promising everything that could be demanded of him in the way of obedience and respect of " the King 's peace . " Once more he was fully and freely pardoned , his lands , with some small diminution , restored , and the King 's confidence given back to him with a too magnanimous completeness . In the Parliament held in Edinburgh in June 1451 he was present , and received back his charters in full amity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " all gud Scottis men . " Later in the year , in his capacity of Warden of the Marches , he was employed to assuage the endless quarrels of the Border , but during his negotiations for this purpose secretly renewed his mysterious and treacherous dealings with England , of which there is no very clear account , but which was of all others the kind of treachery most obnoxious to his countrymen . So far as would appear , James obtained some hint of these clandestine proceedings , and was very angry , " highly commoved , " as was natural : on hearing which Douglas appeared once more to ask pardon , with apparently an inexhaustible confidence in the clemency of the young man whom he had guided so long . But the idea of some " quyet draucht betwixt him and the King of Ingland , " some secret understanding with the old enemy , was more serious still than domestic rebellion , and though he pardoned at the " great request " of the Queen and nobles , the King did not again restore so doubtful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There would seem to have been a pause of consternation on the part of Douglas when he found for the first time the charm of his friendship and every petition for pardon ineffectual . To attribute the change to old Crichton , who had recovered much of his former influence and was again Chancellor , was easy , and the Earl who had but the other day sworn the King 's peace with all , set an ambush for his old opponent , and would have succeeded in killing him but for Crichton 's son , " ane young valiant man , " who overcame the bravos , and housed his father safely in his Castle of Crichton . Douglas himself was afterwards almost surprised in Edinburgh by Crichton 's followers , and saved himself only by a hurried departure not unlike a flight . This disappointment , and the loss of the King 's favour , and the apparent solidity of his rivals in their place , half maddened the great noble , little accustomed to yield to any contradiction . He had been up to this time , save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned , on the side of lawful authority ; the King 's man so long as the King was his man , and did not interfere with the growth of his wealth and greatness . But now he would seem to have given up hope of recovering his hold upon his sovereign , and turned his eyes elsewhere for support . The Earl of Crawford in the north country , and the Lord of Isles who was also Earl of Ross in the west , were as powerful and as intractable as Douglas himself , and more often in open rebellion than in amity with the King , a constant danger and disturbance of all good order and law . Douglas in his anger made an alliance with these two , by which all bound themselves to resent and avenge any injury offered to either . It was probably an expedient of rage and despair  --  the desire of doing what was most baneful and insolent to his former friends , such as happens often when a breach occurs  --  as much as a political act ; but it is evident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open treachery , no longer disposed to keep any terms with the royal master whose patience had been exhausted at last . It required , however , a crowning outrage to arouse once more James 's much-forgiving spirit . Among the gentlemen of Galloway , the most of whom rode with Douglas and supported him in all his high-handed proceedings , too near neighbours to venture upon independence , were a few who preferred to hold the other side , that of law and justice and the authority of the King . Among them was " one called Maclelan , who was tutor of Bombie for the time , and sister 's son to Sir Patrick Gray , principal servitor to the King , and captain of his guard . " The refusal of this man to serve in the rebellious host under the Earl was immediately punished by Douglas , who assailed his house and carried him off prisoner . The story reads like a romance , which , however , is no reason for receiving it with discredit . A more doubtful circumstance is that it is asserted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently destroyed by James , and which was besides at a great distance from Edinburgh . I hazard a conjecture whether it may have happened in the Castle of Abercorn , since it must have been impossible for Douglas in Galloway to pursue Sir Patrick to the very gates of Edinburgh . Wherever the incident may have occurred , the story is , that Sir Patrick Gray , the uncle of the prisoner , hastened to the King with the story of his nephew 's danger , and was at once sent off by James with " a sweit letter of supplication , " praying the Earl to deliver over the unfortunate gentleman to the messenger for love of the King . The Earl was at dinner when , " bloody with spurring , fiery red with haste , " Sir Patrick arrived at the castle , where the drawbridge was lifted and the doors closed . " The Earle caused incontinent draw the boards , and rose and met the said Sir Patrick with great reverence and humilitie , because he was the King 's principal servant and familiar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tale in the words of Pitscottie :  --  " He inquired at the said Patrick if he had dined , who answered that he had not . Then the Earle said there was ' no talk to be had betwixt ane full and ane fasting ; therefore ye shall dine , and we shall talke together at length . ' " In this meane tyme Sir Patrick Gray sat down to his dinner , and the Earle treatted him and made him goode cheare , whereof Sir Patrick was well contented , believing all things to succeed well thereafter . But the Earle of Douglas on the other pairt took a suspicion and conjecture what Sir Patrick 's Gray 's commission was , and dreading the desyne thereof should be for his friend , the tutor of Bombie ; therefore in the meane time when they were at the dinner , talking of merry matters , the Earle caused quietly take forth the tutor of Bombie out of prison , and have him to the greene and there strooke off his head and took the samine away from him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be seene of that treasonable act that was done . " In this meane time when dinner was done Sir Patrick Gray presented the King 's writing unto the Earle , who reverently received it and considered the effect thereof . He gave great thanks to Sir Patrick Gray , saying he was beholden to him that brought so familiar an writing from his Prince to him , considering how it stood betwixt them at that time : and as to the desire and supplication , it should be thankfullie granted to the King , and the rather for Sir Patrick 's sake ; and took him by the hand and led him furth to the greene where the gentleman was lying dead , and shew him the manner , and said , ' Sir Patrick , you are come a litle too late ; but yonder is your sister 's son lying , but he wants the head ; take his body and do with it what you will . ' Sir Patrick answered again with ane sore heart , and said , ' My Lord , ye have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as ye please ; ' and with that called for his horse and leapt thereon . And when he was on horseback he said to the Earle on this manner , ' My Lord , an I live ye shall be rewarded for your labour that ye have used at this time , according to your demerits . ' At this saying the Earle was highly offended and cryed for horse . Sir Patrick seeing the Earle 's fury spurred his horse , but he was chased neare to Edinburgh before they left him , and had it not been his leid horse was so tryed and goode he had been taken . " The scene that ensued when James  --  awaiting in Edinburgh the return of his messenger , without a doubt we may suppose of the obedience of Douglas the friend of his youth , the often-pardoned , owing so much to his clemency and friendship  --  saw Sir Patrick arrive breathless and haggard , scarcely escaping , though the King 's messenger , with his life , and heard his story  --  the insolent contempt , the brutal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well mark the turning-point even in a mind so magnanimous . The King had not been entirely without signs of inheriting his father 's firmness and promptitude ; but his gentleness of disposition , and strong inclination towards kindness and peace , had in general carried the day over his sterner qualities . He had shown both sides of his character when he pardoned Douglas and accepted his promises of reformation on his return , but cut him off from public service and closed all the doors of advancement against him . The defiance now addressed to him , the scorn of his letters and request , so audaciously shown , raised a sudden storm of indignation in his breast . Whether his future action was based on the decision of his council to which he submitted , sanctioning on his own part the treachery by which alone Douglas could be beguiled within his reach , as the chroniclers , to whom such a device was quite justifiable , tell us ; or whether when he issued his safe-conduct he still hoped to be able to convince the Earl of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real and effectual change of mind , no one can now tell . But James was so little addicted to treachery , so fair , tolerant and merciful , that we may well give him the benefit of the doubt , and believe that it was with the intention of making another effort to bring Douglas back to his right mind and allegiance that the King invited him to Stirling , where it was strange indeed that with all his enormities on his conscience Douglas ventured to come , whatever were the safe-conducts given . " Some sayes he got the great seale thereunto before he would grant to come to the King , " says the chronicle . The fact that he did come however , after all that had passed , says much for his confidence in King James and in his own power over him , for Douglas must have been very well aware that safe-conducts and royal promises were but broken reeds to trust to . When he arrived in Stirling , whatever lowering looks he might see around him  --  and it is scarcely possible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleared his countenance of every recollection of their last meeting , of the men-at-arms thundering at his heels , and his nephew 's body headless on the greensward  --  Douglas found no change in the King , who received and banqueted him " very royally , " thinking if it were possible " with good deeds to withdraw him from his attempt that he purposed to do . " After supper the King took his rebellious subject aside , into another room opening from that in which they had supped , and which is still exhibited in Stirling Castle to the curious stranger , and once more reasoned with him on his conduct . No private matter would seem to have been introduced , the treasonable league which the Earl had made with Crawford and Ross , rebels against the lawful authority of the kingdom , being the subject on which James put forth all his strength of argument . Douglas , Pitscottie tells us , answered " verrie proudlie , " and the argument grew hot between the two men , of whom one had always hitherto been the conqueror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this long habit of prevailing that made the proud Earl so obstinate , since to submit in words had never heretofore been difficult to him . At last the dispute came to a climax , in the distinct refusal of Douglas to give up his traitor-allies . " He said he myt not nor wald not , " says a brief contemporary record . " Then the King said , ' False traitor , if you will not , I sall , ' and stert sodunly till him with ane knyf . " " And they said , " adds this chronicle with grim significance , " that Patrick Gray straik him next the King with ane pole ax on the hed . " The other companions crowded round , giving each his stroke . And thus within a short space of years the second Earl of Douglas was killed in a royal castle , while under a royal safe-conduct , at a climax of hopeless discord and antagonism from which there seemed no issue . The exasperation of the King , the dead-lock of all authority , the absolutely impracticable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , account for , though they do not excuse , such a breach of faith . I prefer to believe that James had at least no decided purpose in his mind , but hoped in his own power to induce Douglas to relinquish these alliances which were incompatible with his allegiance ; but that the sudden exasperation with which he became convinced of his own powerlessness to move him brought about in a moment the fatal issue ( with who knows what sudden wild stimulus of recollection from the murder of which he had been a witness in his childhood ? ) which statesmen less impulsive had already determined upon as necessary , though probably not in this sudden way . Illustration : ST . ANTHONY 'S CHAPEL , AND ST . MARGARET 'S LOCH The " Schort Memorial of the Scottis Cronikles , " called the Auchinleck Chronicle , gives a brief but striking account of the proceedings that followed . Earl Douglas 's retainers and kinsmen would seem to have been struck dumb by the event , and probably fled in horror and dismay ; but it was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the younger brothers returned , on St. Patrick 's Day in Lent , bringing with them the safe-conduct with all its seals , which they exhibited at the cross and dragged through the streets tied to a horse 's tail , with many wild and fierce words against the King and all that were with him , ending by spoiling and burning the town . As James was no longer in it , however , nor apparently any one who could resist them , this was a cheap and unsatisfactory vengeance . Some months after , in the summer of 1452 , a Parliament was held at Edinburgh , in which the three Estates passed a declaration that no safe-conduct had been given on that fatal occasion  --  a declaration which it is evident no one believed , and which probably was justified by some quibble which saved the consciences of those who asserted it . The new Earl , James Douglas , was summoned to appear at this Parliament , but answered by a letter under his seal and that of his brother , which was secretly affixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the King , saying that they held not of him , nor would hold with him , with many other slanderous words , calling them traitors that were his secret council . " Some say it was upon the church doors that this defiance was attached . In any case it must have produced a wonderful hum and commotion through the town , where already no doubt the slaying of the Douglas had been discussed from every point of view  --  at the cross , and among the groups at the street corners , where there would be many adherents of the Douglas , and many citizens ready to discuss the new event and all its possible consequences . The Parliament was followed by a general muster upon the Burrowmuir , where the barons and their men gathered , with all their spears and steel caps glistening in the June sunshine , with an apparent intention of pursuing the race to its stronghold and making an end of it . The raid , which was led by the King in person , with an army of some thirty thousand men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chronicle says , treading down the new corn , and spoiling the country " right fellonly , " notwithstanding the King 's presence . The result , at all events , was complete submission on the part of the new Earl , accompanied by a promise to bear no enmity , a promise often made but altogether impossible in the fifteenth century to mortal flesh and blood . It was scarcely possible however , short of a moral miracle , that such a thing could happen as the abandonment of the entire policy of the house of Douglas at a moment when their minds were embittered by so great a tragedy . The new Earl was not a mere soldier , still less a courtier , but a man of some culture , originally intended , it is said , for the Church , though this does not seem to have withheld him from taking part in the tumults of the time . Nor did it restrain him from marrying his brother 's widow , the hapless Maid of Galloway , whose share of the Douglas lands made her indispensable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether either of the two marriages , which necessitated two dispensations from the Pope , was anything but nominal . After his submission James Douglas was employed as his brother had been in the arrangement of terms of truce with England , which was too great a temptation for him , and led to further treasonable negotiations . He would seem also to have renewed his brother 's alliances with the rebels of the north : and in a very brief period the nominal peace and doubtful vows were all thrown to the winds , and this time there seems to have been no question of partial rebellion , but every indication that a civil war , rending the entire country in two , was about to break forth . Douglas had the strong backing of England behind him , the support of the Highland hordes always ready to be poured upon the peaceful country , and many great lords in his immediate train . He had raised an army of , it is said , forty thousand men , an enormous army for Scotland , and it was evident that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this moment it would seem that King James for the first time lost heart . He had been fighting during all the beginning of the year 1455 , reducing the west and south , the Douglas country , to subjection and desolation . But when he found himself menaced by an army as great as anything he could muster , with the angry north in the background and clouds of half-savage warriors on the horizon , the King 's heart sank . He is said to have left Edinburgh in disgust and depression , and taken ship at Leith for St. Andrews , to seek counsel from the best and most trustworthy of his advisers , a man whose noble presence appears in the distracted history with such a calm and sagacious steadfastness that we can well understand the agitated King 's sudden impulse towards him at this painful period of his career . Bishop Kennedy had himself suffered from the lawlessness of the Douglas retainers : and he too had royal blood in his veins . He occupied one of the highest positions in the Church , and his wisdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statesmen in the kingdom . James arrived hastily , according to the chronicle , unexpected , and with many signs of distress and anxiety . He betrayed to the Bishop his weariness of the ever-renewed struggle , and of the falsehood and treachery which , even if victorious , were all he had to encounter , the failure of every pledge and promise , the faith sworn one day which failed him the next , and the deep discouragement with all things round him which had taken possession of his mind . The wise prelate heard this confession of heart-sickness and despondency , and with a fatherly familiarity bade the young King sit down to meat , which he much wanted , while he himself went to his oratory to pray for enlightenment . That James thought no less than to throw up the struggle and retire from his kingdom , is what the old writers say . But when , with his bosom lightened by utterance of his trouble , and his courage a little restored by food and rest , the Bishop came back to him with a cheerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Kennedy produced to him the old image of the sheaf of arrows which , bound together , were not to be broken , but one by one could easily be snapt asunder , and advised him to make proclamation of a free pardon to all who would throw down their arms and make submission , and to march at once against the rebel host with full confidence of victory . Inspired by this advice , and by the companionship of the Bishop who went with him , the King set out to meet the rebels , though with an army inferior in number to theirs . Douglas , from some unexplained reason , wavered and hesitated , taking no active step , and gave Bishop Kennedy time to put his own suggestion in practice in respect to his nephew Lord Hamilton  --  who was one of Douglas 's chief supporters  --  sending secret messengers to him to urge him to submission . Hamilton no doubt had already perceived signs of wavering purpose and insecurity in the heterogeneous host , in which were many whose hearts failed them at sight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebellion without being wound up to the extreme point of civil war : but he had " ane kyndlie love to Earl Douglas " as well as a regard for his own honour , and would not lightly desert his friend . While thus uncertain he appealed to Douglas to know what he meant to do , warning him that the longer he hesitated , the less would be the forces at his disposal . Douglas replied haughtily that if he were tired of waiting he might go when he pleased  --  an indiscreet answer , which decided Hamilton to withdraw and throw himself upon the King 's promised mercy . The same night he went over to the royal army , carrying with him so many that " on the morn thereafter the Earl Douglas had not ane hunder men by his own household , " the whole host having melted away . Never was a greater risk for a monarchy nor a more easy and bloodless escape . The Earl fled to the depths of his own country and thence to England , where he lived long a pensioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reappear in history only like a ghost after many silent years . Amid all these bewildering and bitter struggles , in which much misery was no doubt involved , it is recorded of the King that he never lost his humane character , and that even in the devastations he was forced to sanction or command , the cruel reprisals carried out over all the south of Scotland , his severity was always tempered with mercy . " He was not so much feared as a king as loved like a father , " says Major . This luminous trait appears through all the darkness of the vexed and furious time . The King was always ready to pardon at a word , to believe in the vows and receive the submission of the fiercest rebels . One curious evidence of the confidence felt in him was shown by the widow of the murdered Earl , Margaret Douglas , the Maid of Galloway , a woman doubly injured in every relation  --  the sister of the young Earl murdered at Edinburgh , married by his successor in order to reunite the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her as her brother 's heir  --  and again forced into another and unlawful marriage by her husband 's brother , immediately upon his death , for the same end . James received this fugitive kindly , restored to her part of the lands of her family , and finally married her  --  thus freeing her from the lawless bond into which she had been driven  --  to his own step-brother , John , Earl of Atholl , " the Black Knight of Lorne 's son ; " upon hearing of which another fugitive of a similar description appeared upon the scene . " When the Earl of Ross 's wyff understood the King to be some pairt favourable to all that sought his grace she fled also under his protection to eschew the cruel tyranny of her husband , which she dreaded sometyme before . The King called to remembrance that this woman was married not by her own counsel to Donald of the Isles ( the Earl of Ross ) . He gave her also sufficient lands and living whereon she might live according to her estate . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that lawless age must have been miserable indeed . Bandied about from one marriage to another , forced to accept such security as a more or less powerful lord could give , and when he was killed to fall victim to the next who could seize upon her , or to whom she should be allotted by feudal suzerain or chieftain , the mere name of a king who did not disdain a woman 's plaint , but had compassion and help to give , must have conveyed hope to many an unhappy lady bound to a repugnant life . James would seem to have been the only man who recognised the misery to which such unconsidered items in the wild and tumultuous course of affairs might be driven . Thus King James and Scotland with him were delivered from the greatest and most dangerous of the powerful houses that held the country in fear . Shortly after he conquered , partly by arms , partly by the strain of a universal impulse , which seemed to rouse the barons to a better way , those great allies in the north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Crawford and the Earl of Ross , so that at last something of a common rule and common sentiment began to move the country . It is almost needless to say that James took advantage of this temporary unity and enthusiasm in order to invade England  --  a thing without which no Scots King could be said to be happy . The negotiations by which he was at once stimulated and hindered  --  among others by ambassadors from the Duke of York to ask his help against Henry VI , with orders to arrest his army on their way  --  are too complicated to be entered upon ; but at last the Scots forces set out and , after various successes , James found himself before Roxburgh , a town and castle which had remained in the hands of the English from the time when the Earl of March deserted his country for England in the reign of Robert III . The town was soon taken , but the castle , in which there was a brave garrison , stood out manfully . This invasion of the Borders , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " was evidently an act of the highest policy while yet the surgings of civil war were not entirely quieted , and a diversion of ideas as well as new opportunities of spoil were peculiarly necessary . Its first excellent result was that Donald of the Isles , the Earl of Ross and terror of the north country , whose submission had been but provisionally accepted , and depended upon some evidence of real desire for the interest of the common weal , suddenly appeared with " ane great armie of men , all armed in the Highland fashion , " and claimed the vanguard , the place of honour , and to be allowed to take upon him " the first press and dint of the battell . " James received this unexpected auxiliary with " great humanitie , " but prudently provided , before accepting his offer , which apparently , however , was made in all good faith , that Donald should " stent his pavilliones a little by himself , " until full counsel had been taken on the subject . The army was also joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " under the Earl of Huntly , whose coming " made the King so blyth that he commanded to charge all the guns and give the castle ane new volie . " James would seem throughout to have felt the greatest interest in the extraordinary new arm of artillery which had made a revolution in warfare . He pursued siege after siege with a zeal in which something of the ardour of a military enthusiast and scientific inquirer mingled with the necessities of the struggle in which he was engaged . The " Schort Cronikle , " already quoted , describes him as lingering over the siege of Abercorn , " striking mony of the towers down with the gret gun , the which a Franche man shot richt wele , and failed na shot within a fathom where it was charged him to hit . " And when , in the exultation of his heart to see each new accession of force come in , he ordered " a new volie " against the stout outstanding walls , the excitement of the discharge , the eagerness of an adept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression of satisfaction a real demonstration of pleasure . Illustration : MONS MEG King James had attained at this time a success which probably a few years before his warmest imagination could not have aspired to . He had brought into subjection the great families which had almost contested his throne with him . Douglas , the highest and most near himself , had been swept clean out of his way . The fiercest rebel of all , the head of the Highland caterans , with his wild host in all their savage array , was by his side , ready to charge under his orders . The country , drained of its most lawless elements , was beginning to breathe again , to sow its fields and rebuild its homesteads . Instead of the horrors of civil war his soldiers were now engaged in the most legitimate of all enterprises  --  the attempt to recover from England an alienated possession . Everything was bright before him , the hope of a great reign , the promise of prosperity and honour and peace . It is almost a commonplace of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near at hand . The big guns which were a comparatively new wonder , full of interest in their unaccustomed operation , were still a danger as well as a prodigy , and James would seem to have forgotten the precautions that were considered necessary in presence of an armament still only partially understood . The historian assumes , as every human observer is apt to do in face of such a calamity , a tone of blame . " This Prince , " says the chronicle with a shrill tone of exasperation in the record of the catastrophe , " more curious than became the majestie of a king , did stand hard by when the artilliarie was discharging . " And in a moment all the labours and struggles , and the hope of the redeemed kingdom and all the prosperity that was to come , were at an end . One can imagine the sudden dismay in the group around him , the rush of his attendants , his own feeble command to keep silence when some cry of horror rose from the pale-faced circle . His thigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the explosion of the gun , " by which he was struken to the ground , and died hastilie thereafter , " with no time to say more than to order silence , lest the army should be discouraged and the siege prove in vain . So ended the troublous reign of the second James , involved in strife and warfare from his childhood , vexed by the treacheries and struggles over him of his dearest friends , full of violence alien to his mind and temper , which yet was justified by his example at the most critical moment of his life . He made his way through continual contention , intrigue , and blood , for which he was not to blame , to such a settlement of national affairs as might have consolidated Scotland and made her great  --  by patience and firmness and courage , and conspicuously by mercy , notwithstanding one crime . And when the helm was in his hands , and a fair future before him , fell , not ignominiously indeed , yet uselessly , a noble life thrown away , leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the thunderbolt thus falling from a clear sky destroyed all the hopes of Scotland ; yet had reigned long , for twenty-three years of trouble , tumult , and distress . CHAPTER III JAMES III : THE MAN OF PEACE Again the noises cease save for a wail of lamentation over the dead . The operations of war are suspended , the dark ranks of the army stand aside , and every trumpet and fatal cannon is silent while once more a woman and a child come into the foreground of the historic scene . Once more , the most pathetic figure surely in history , a little startled boy clinging to his mother  --  not afraid indeed of the array of war to which he has been accustomed all his life , and perhaps with an instinct in him of childish majesty , the consciousness which so soon develops even in an infant mind , of unquestioned rank , but surrounded by the atmosphere of horror and affright in which he has been taken from among his playthings  --  stands forth to be hastily enveloped in the robes so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are told , sent for the Prince in the first sensation of the catastrophe , and had him crowned at Kelso , feeling the necessity of that central name at least , round which to rally . They were not always respectful of the real King when they had him , yet the divinity which hedged the title , however helpless the head round which it shone , was felt to be indispensable to the unity and strength of the kingdom . Mary of Gueldres in her sudden widowhood would seem to have behaved with great dignity and spirit at this critical moment . She is said to have insisted that the siege should not be abandoned , but that her husband 's death might at least accomplish what his heart had been set upon ; and the army after a moment of despondency was so " incouraged " by the coming of the Prince " that they forgot the death of his father and past manfullie to the hous , and wan the same , and justified the captaine theroff , and kest it down to the ground that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The execution of the captain seems a hard measure unless he was a traitor to the Scottish crown ; but no doubt the conflict became more bitter from the terrible cost of the victory . Illustration : THE CANONGATE TOLBOOTH Once more accordingly the kingdom was thrown into the chaos which in those days attended a long minority , the struggle for power , the relaxation of order , and all the evils that follow when one firm hand full of purpose drops the reins which half a dozen conflicting competitors scramble for . There was not , at first at least , anything of the foolish anarchy which drove Scotland into confusion during the childhood of James II , and opened the way to so many subsequent disasters , for Bishop Kennedy , the dead King 's chief counsellor and support and a man universally trusted , was in the front of affairs , influencing if not originating all that was done : and to him , almost as a matter of course , the education of the little heir was at once confided . But Mary of Gueldres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not give up without a struggle her pretensions to the regency . Buchanan relates a scene which , according to his history , took place in Edinburgh on the occasion of the first Parliament after James 's death . The Queen had established herself in the castle while Kennedy was in Holyrood , probably with his little pupil , but there is no mention made of James . On the second day of the Parliament Mary appeared suddenly in what would seem to have been , according to modern phraseology , " a packed house , " her own partisans having no doubt been warned to be present by the action of some energetic " whip , " and was , then and there , by a hasty Act , carried through at one sitting , appointed guardian and Regent , after which summary success she returned with great pomp to her apartments , though with what hope of having really attained a tenable position it is impossible to say . When the news was carried to Holyrood , Bishop Kennedy in his turn appeared before the Estates , which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the populace of Edinburgh was excited by what had occurred  --  Mary 's partisans no doubt rejoicing , while the people in general , always jealous of a foreigner and never very respectful of a woman , surged through the great line of street towards the castle with all the fury of a popular tumult . The High Street of Edinburgh was not unaccustomed to sudden encounters , clashing of swords between two passing lords , each with fierce followers , and all the risks of sudden brawls when neither would concede the " crown of the causeway . " But the townsfolk seldom did more than look on , with perhaps an ill-concealed satisfaction in the wounds inflicted by their natural opponents upon each other . On this occasion , however , the tumult was a popular one , involving the interests of the citizens ; and it is difficult to believe that the inclinations of the townsfolk would not rather lean towards the Queen , a woman of wealth and stately surroundings , likely to entertain princes and great personages and to fill Edinburgh with the splendour of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also were magnificent , whose metropolis was not Edinburgh but St. Andrews , and who might consider frugality and sobriety the best qualities for the Court of a minor . At all events the crowd had risen and was ripe for tumult , when Bishop Kennedy persuaded them to pause , and reminded them of the mutual forbearance and patience and quiet which was above all necessary at such a troublous time . Other prelates would seem to have been in his train , for we are told it was the intercessions and explanations of " the bishops " which prevented the tumult from rising into a fight . The parties would seem to have been so strong , and so evenly divided , that the question was finally solved by a compromise , Parliament appointing a council of guardians , two on each side : Seaton and Boyd for the Queen ; John Kennedy , brother of the Bishop , and the Earl of Orkney , for the others  --  an experiment which was no more successful than in the previous minority . The Queen-mother had soon , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit it can be called , of Henry VI and his Queen and household , fugitives before the victorious party of York , who had sought refuge from the Scots , and lodging for a thousand attendants  --  a request which was granted , and the convent of the Greyfriars allotted to them as their residence . The Queen at the Castle would thus be a near neighbour of the royal fugitives , and it is interesting to think of the meeting , the sympathy and mutual condolences of the two women . Margaret , the fervid Provencal , with her passionate sense of wrong and restless energy , and the hopeless task she had of maintaining and inspiring to play his part with any dignity her too patient and gentle king ; and Mary , the fair and placid Fleming , stung too in her pride and affections by the refusal of the regency , and her subordination to those riotous and unmannerly lords and the proud Bishop who had got the affairs of Scotland in his hand . The two Queens might have had some previous acquaintance with each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; at all events they amused themselves sadly , as they sat and talked together , with fancies such as please women , of making a marriage between the little Edward , the future victim of Tewkesbury , then a child at his mother 's knee , and the little Princess of Scotland who played beside him , in the good days when all these troubles should be past , and Henry or his son after him should have regained the English crown . One follows with regretful interest the noble figure of Margaret , under the guise in which that sworn Lancastrian Shakspeare has disclosed it to us , before her sweeter mood had disappeared under the pressure of fate , and when not curses but hopes came from her mouth in her young motherhood , and every recovery and restoration , and happy marriage and royal state , were possible for her boy . Mary too had been cut off in the middle of her greatness . They were two Queens discrowned , two fair heads veiled with misfortune , though nothing irremediable had as yet happened , nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be dark ; ready to live again in their children , and make premature treaties over the little blonde heads at their knee . So natural a scene comes in strangely to the records of violence and misery . Nothing more tragic could be than the fate of Margaret ; and the splendour and happiness had been very shortlived in Mary 's experience , soon quenched in sudden destruction ; but to see the two young mothers planning over the heads of the little ones how the two kingdoms were to be united , and happiness come back in a future that was never to be , while they sat together in brief companionship in those strait rooms of Edinburgh Castle , which were so narrow and so poor for a queen 's habitation , or within the precincts of the Greyfriars , looking out upon the peaceful Pentlands and the soft hills of Braid , is like the recurring melody in a piece of stormy music , the bit of light in a tempestuous picture . It teaches us to perceive that , however the firmament of a kingdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even in queens ' chambers , scenes of tenderness and peace . Mary died in her own foundation of Trinity College Hospital  --  the beautiful church of which was demolished within living memory  --  three years after her husband , while her children were still very young : and thus all further struggles about the regency were ended . She does not seem indeed ever to have repeated her one stand for power . Bishop Kennedy , we may well believe , was not a man with whom there would be easy fighting . His sway procured a little respite for Scotland in the ordinary miseries of her career . The Douglases were safely out of the way and ended , and there was a truce of fifteen years with England which kept danger from that side at arm 's length  --  not , the chroniclers assure us , from any additional love between the two countries , but because " the Inglish had warres within themselves daylie , stryvand for the crown . " Kennedy lived some years after the Queen , guiding all the affairs of the kingdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was a Churchman of the noblest kind , full of care for the spiritual interests of his diocese as well as for the secular affairs which were placed in his hands . " He caused all persones ( parsons ) and vicars to remain at their paroche kirks , " says Pitscottie , " for the instruction and edifying of their flocks : and caused them preach the Word of God to the people and visit them that were sick ; and also the said Bishope visited every kirk within the diocese four times in the year , and preached to the said parochin himself the Word of God , and inquired of them if they were dewly instructed by their parson and vicar , and if the poor were sustained and the youth brought up and learned according to the order that was taine in the house of God . " With all this , and many other gifts beside , among which are noted the knowledge he had of the " civil laws , having practised in the same , " and his experience and sagacity in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arts . " He founded , " says Pitscottie , " ane triumphant college in Sanct Androis , called Sanct Salvatore 's College , wherein he made his lear ( library ) very curiouslie and coastlie ; and also he biggit ane ship , called the Bishop 's Barge , and when all three were complete , to wit , the college , the lear , and the barge , he knew not which of the three was the costliest ; for it was reckoned for the time by honest men of consideration that the least of the three cost him ten thousand pound sterling . " Major gives the same high character of the great Bishop , declaring that there were but two things in him which did not merit approval  --  the fact that he held a priory ( but only one , that of Pittenweem ) in commendam , " and the sumptuositie of his sepulchre . " That sepulchre , half destroyed  --  after having remained a thing of beauty for three hundred years  --  by ignorant and foolish hands in the end of the eighteenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his college at St. Andrews , the only existing memorial of the time when all Scotland was governed from that stormy headland to the great advantage of the commonwealth . It is difficult to make out from the different records whether the young King remained in the Bishop 's keeping so long as he lived , which was but until James had attained the age of thirteen , or whether the usual struggle between the two sets of guardians appointed by Parliament , the Boyds and Kennedies , had begun before the Bishop 's death . It may be imagined , however , that the evident advantages to the boy of Bishop Kennedy 's care would outweigh any formal appointment ; although at the same time the idea suggests itself whether in the perversity of human nature this training was not in itself partly the cause of James 's weaknesses and errors . He would learn at St. Andrews not only what was best in the learning of the time , but as much of the arts as were known in Scotland , and especially that noble art of architecture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And no doubt he would see the advancement of professors of these arts , of men skilful and cunning in design and decoration , the builders , the sculptors , and the musicians , whose place in the great cathedral could never be unimportant . A Churchman could promote and honour such public servants in the little commonwealth of his cathedral town with greater freedom than might be done elsewhere ; and James , a studious and feeble boy , not wise enough to see that the example of his great teacher was here inappropriate and out of place , learned this lesson but too well . The King grew up " a man that loved solitariness and desired never to hear of warre , but delighted more in musick and politie and building nor he did in the government of his realm . " It would seem that he was also fond of money , which indeed was very necessary to the carrying out of his pursuits . It is difficult to estimate justly the position of a king of such a temperament in such circumstances , whether he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or whether he was not rather conscientiously trying to carry out his stewardry of his kingdom in a better way when he withheld his countenance from the perpetual wars of the Border , and addressed himself to the construction of noble halls and chapels and the patronage of the arts . He was at least so far in advance of his time , still concerned with the rudest interests of practical life as to be universally misunderstood : and he had the further misfortune of sharing the unpopularity of the favourites with whom he surrounded himself , as almost every monarch has done who has promoted men of inferior position to the high places of the State . James 's supineness , over-refinement , and love of peaceful occupations were made the more remarkable from the contrast with two manly and chivalrous brothers , the Dukes of Mar and Albany , of fine person and energetic tastes , interested in all the operations of war , fond of fine horses and gallant doings , and coming up to all the popular expectations of what was becoming in a prince . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the real motives and meaning of family discords : and this is still more the case in an age not yet enlightened by the clear light of history . The chroniclers , especially Boece , have much doubt thrown upon them by more serious historians , who quote them and build upon them nevertheless , having really no better evidence to go upon . The report of these witnesses is that James had been warned by witches , in whom he believed , and by one Andrew the Fleming , an astrologer , that his chief danger arose from his own family , and that " the lion should be devoured by his whelps . " Pitscottie 's account , however , indicates a conspiracy between Cochrane and the Homes , whom Albany had mortally offended , as the cause at once of these prophecies and the King 's alarm . The only thing clear is that he was afraid of his brothers , and considered their existence a danger to his life . It would appear that he had already begun to surround himself with those favourites to whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this poison was first instilled into his mind : and the blame was attributed rightly or wrongly to Cochrane , the chief of his " minions , " who very probably felt it to be to his interest to detach from James 's side the manly and gallant brothers who were naturally his nearest counsellors and champions . There is very little that is authentic known of the men whom James III thus elevated to the steps of his throne . Cochrane was an architect probably , though called a mason in his earlier career , and had no doubt been employed on some of the buildings in which the King delighted , being " verrie ingenious " and " cunning in that craft . " Perhaps , however , to make the royal favour for a mere craftsman more respectable , according to the notions of the time , it is added in a popular story that the favourite was a man of great strength and stature , whose prowess in some brawl attracted the admiration of the timid monarch , to whom a man who was a tall fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar tastes to himself , might well be a special object of approval . A musician , William Roger , an Englishman , whose voice had charmed the King  --  a weakness which at least was not ignoble , and was shared by various other members of his race  --  was the second of James 's favourites : and there were others still less important  --  one the King 's tailor  --  a band of persons of no condition , who surrounded him no doubt with flattery and adulation , since their promotion and maintenance were entirely dependent on his pleasure . King Louis XI was at that time upon the throne of France , a powerful prince whose little privy council was composed of equally mean men , and perhaps some reflection from the Court of the old ally of Scotland made young James believe that this was the best and wisest thing for a King to do . Louis was also a believer in astrologers , witches , and all the prophecies and omens in which they dealt . To copy him was not a high ambition , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is conceivable that the feeble monarch of Scotland , never roused to the height of his father 's or grandfather 's example , took a little satisfaction in copying what he could from Louis . The example of Oliver le Dain might make him think that he showed his superiority by preferring his tailor , a man devoted to his service , to Albany or Angus . And if Louis trembled at the predictions of his Eastern sage , what more natural than that James should quake when the stars revealed a danger which every spaewife confirmed ? No doubt he would know well the story of the mysterious spaewife who , had her advice been taken , might have saved James I. from his murderers . It is rarely that there is not a certain cruelty involved in selfish cowardice . In a sudden panic the mildest-seeming creature will trample down furiously any weaker being who stands in the way of his own safety , and James was ready for any atrocity when he was convinced that his brothers were a danger to his life and crown . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by one treachery or another ; and Alexander of Albany , the inheritor of that ill-omened title , was laid up in prison to be safe out of his brother 's way . We find ourselves entirely in the regions of romance in this unfortunate reign . Sir Walter Scott has painted for us the uncomfortable Court of Louis with his barber and his prophet , and Dumas has reproduced almost the identical story in his Vingt Ans Apres , of the Duke of Albany 's escape from Edinburgh . There could scarcely be a more curious scene . Strangely enough James himself was resident in the castle when his brother was a prisoner there . One would have thought that so near a neighbourhood would have seemed dangerous to the alarmed monarch , but perhaps he thought , on the other hand , that watch and ward would be kept more effectually under his own eyes . Mar had died in the Canongate , perhaps in the Tolbooth there , according to tradition in a bath , where he was bled to death , probably in order that a pretence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no doubt , was full of dark whispers of this strange end of one prince , and the danger of the other , shut up within the castle walls where the King 's minions had full sway , and any night might witness a second dark deed . Prince Alexander 's friends must have been busy and eager without , while he was not so strictly under bar and bolt inside that he could not make merry with the castle officials now and then , and cheat an evening with pleasant talk and a glass of good wine with a young captain of the guard . One day there came to him an intimation of the arrival of a ship at Leith with wine from France , accompanied by some private token that there was more in this announcement than met the ear . Albany accordingly sent a trusted servant to order two flasks of the wine , in one of which , contained in a tube of wax , was enclosed a letter , in the other a rope by which to descend the castle walls . The whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duc de Beaufort , though whether the romancer could have seen the old records of Scotland , or if his legend is sanctioned by the authentic history of France , I am unable to tell . Alexander , like the prince in the novel , invited the Captain of the Guard to sup with him to try the new wine  --  an invitation gladly accepted . After supper the Captain " passed to the King 's chamber to see what was doing , who was then lodged in the castle , " probably to get the word for the night . It is curious to think of the unconscious officer , so little aware of what was about to befall , going from the chamber of the captive to that of the King , where the little Court would be assembled at their music or their " tables , " or where perhaps James was taking counsel over the leafage of a capital or the spring of an arch  --  and thence returning when all the rounds were made , the great gates barred and bolted , the sentries set , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finer companion still . Alexander plied the unsuspecting Captain with his wine , spiced or perhaps drugged to make it act the sooner , and along with him a warder or two who were in constant attendance upon the royal prisoner . A prince to drink with such carles ! " The fire was hett , and the wyne was strong " : and the united influence of the spiced drink and the hot room soon overcame the revellers , all but Alexander and his trusty man , who had taken care to refrain . In Dumas the gaoler was but gagged and bound : but in Scotland life went for little , and some of the authorities say that when the Prince saw the drunkards in his power , " he lap from the board and strak the captane with ane whinger and slew him , and also stiked other two with his own hand . " He had been informed that he was to die the next day if he did not escape that night , which was some excuse for him. 2 When the men were thus disposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his servant , " his chamber chyld , " stole out with the rope to " a quiet place " on the wall . Coming out into the dark freshness and stillness of the night after that stifling and horrible room , seeing the stars once more and the distant glimmer of the sea , and feeling freedom at hand , it was little they would reck of the gaolers , always an obnoxious class . One would imagine that it must have been on the most precipitous side of the castle rock where there were few sentinels and the exit was easy , though the descent terrible . The faithful servant tried the rope first but found it too short , and fell , breaking his thigh . With what feelings Alexander must have stolen back to get his sheets with which to lengthen the rope , pushing through the smoke , almost despairing to get off in safety ! One is relieved to hear that he took his crippled attendant on his back and carried him , some say to a safe place  --  or , as others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship rocked at the pier of Leith . They must have got down to some dark spot on the northern slopes , where there would be no city watchman or late passer-by to give the alarm , and all would be clear and still before them to the water 's edge  --  though a long , weary , and darkling way . 2 Buchanan 's account is not so bloodthirsty : he represents Alexander as entertaining his guests with stories of his restoration to favour , and approaching deliverance , and dismissing them in all mirth and friendliness though heavy with wine : so that his guards having incontinently fallen asleep at their posts he was able to make his escape . " But on the morne when the watchman perceived that the towis were hinging over the walls , then ran they to seek the Captane to show him the matter and manner , but he was not in his own chamber . Then they passed to the Duke 's chamber and found the door open and ane dead man lying in the chamber door and the captane and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them ; and when they missed the Duke of Albanie and his chamber chyld , they ran speedilie and shewed the King how the matter had happened . But he would not give it credence till he passed himself and saw the matter . " These events happened in 1479 , when Albany escaped to France , where he remained for some years . Up to this period all that is said of him has been favourable . His treatment by his brother was undeserved , and there is no sign of either treachery or rebellion in him in these early years . But when he had languished for a long time in France perhaps , notwithstanding a first favourable reception , sooner or later eating the exile 's bitter bread  --  exasperation and despair must have so wrought in him that he began to traffic with the " auld enemy " of England , and even put his hand to a base treaty , by which his brother was to be dethroned and he himself succeed to the kingdom by grace of the English king  --  a stipulation which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his countrymen . In the meantime James had begun to breathe again in the relief he felt to be freed of the presence of both his brothers . He " passed through all Scotland at his pleasure , in peace and rest , " says the chronicler . But it was not long that a king of Scotland could be left in this repose . The usual trouble on the Borders had begun again as soon as Edward IV was secure upon his throne , and the English king had even sent his ships as far as the Firth of Forth , where he burnt villages and spoiled the coast under the very eyes of James . Though he would so much rather have been left in quiet to complete his beautiful new buildings at Stirling and arrange the choir in his new chapel , where there was a double supply of musicians that the King might never want this pleasure , yet the sufferings of the people and the angry impulse of the discontented nobles were more than James could resist , and he set forth reluctantly towards the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more shut up within his little circle of favourites after the death and disappearance of his brothers , and Cochrane had gradually acquired a more and more complete sway over the mind of his master and the affairs of the realm . The favourite had been guilty of all those extravagances which constitute the Nemesis of upstarts . He had trafficked in patronage and promotion , he had debased the currency , and he was supposed to influence the King to everything least honourable and advantageous to the country . Last injury of all , he had either asked from the King or accepted from him  --  at least , permitted himself to be tricked out in the name of Mar , the title of the young prince whose death he was believed to have brought about . The lords of Scotland had already remonstrated with the King on various occasions as to the unworthy favourites who usurped their place around his throne : and their exasperation seems to have risen to a height beyond bearing when they found " the mason , " as Cochrane is called , with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of the army which was raised to avenge the English invasion , and in the closest confidence of the King . When they had got as far as Lauder the great lords , who were left out of all James 's private councils , assembled in a council of their own in the parish church to talk over their grievances , and to consult what could be done to reform this intolerable abuse and to bring back the King to the right way . Some , it would appear , went so far as to meditate deposition , declaring that James was no longer fit to be their King , having renounced their counsel and advice , banished one brother and slain another , and " maid up fallowes , maissones , to be lords and earls in the place of noblemen . " The result of the meeting , however , was that milder counsels prevailed so far as James was concerned : " They concluded that the King should be taine softlie without harm of his bodie , and conveyed to the Castle of Edinburgh with certain gentlemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hanged over Lauder Brig . The question , however , remained , Who should be so bold as to take the first step and lay hands upon the favourite ? It was now that Lord Gray , one of the conspirators , told , with that humour which comes in so grimly in many dark historic scenes , the story of the mice and the cat  --  how the mice conspired to save themselves by attaching a bell to the cat to warn them of her movements  --  until the terrible question arose which among them should attach to the neck of the enemy this instrument of safety . One can imagine the grave barons with half a smile looking at each other consciously , in acknowledgment of a risk which it needed a brave man to run . Angus , the head of the existing branch of the Douglas family , who had already risen into much of the power and importance of his forfeited kinsman , answered with equally grim brevity " I'se bell the cat . " But while he spoke , the general enemy , mad with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or boldness which could stop him in his career , forestalled the necessity . He came to the kirk , where no doubt he had heard there was some unauthorised assembly , arrayed in black velvet with bands of white , the livery he had chosen , a great gold chain round his neck , a hunting horn slung about him adorned with gold and jewels , and probably a marvel of mediaeval art  --  and " rushed rudlie at the kirk door . " The hum of fierce satisfaction which arose when the keeper of the door challenged the applicant for admission , and the answer , " The Earl of Mar , " rang into the silence in which each man had been holding his breath , may be imagined . It was Archibald Bell-the-Cat , ever hereafter known by that name , who advanced to meet the swaggering intruder in all his pride of privilege and place , but with a welcome very different from that which the favourite expected , who had come , no doubt , to break up the whisperings of the conspirators and assert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cochrane 's neck , and said " a rop would sett him better , " while another Douglas standing by snatched at the horn . Cochrane , astonished but not yet convinced that any real opposition was intended , asked between offence and alarm , perhaps beginning to doubt the sombre excited assembly , " My lords , is it jest or earnest ? " It would seem that the grim and terrible event of the execution " over the Bridge of Lauder " though why this special locality was chosen we are not told , followed with an awful rapidity . The chief offender had fallen into the hands of the conspirators with such unhoped-for ease that they evidently felt no time was to be lost . " Notwithstanding the lords held him quiet while they caused certain armed men pass to the King 's pavilion , and two or three wyse men with them , and gave the King fair and pleasant words , till they had laid hands on all his servants , and took them and hanged them over the Bridge of Lauder before the King 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council . Thereafter incontinent they brought out Cochrane and his hands bound with ane tow , behind his back , who desired them to take ane of his own pavilion tows cords which were of silk and bind his hands , for he thought shame to be bound with ane hemp tow lyk ane thiefe . The lords answered and said , ' He was worse than a thiefe , he was ane traitour and deserved no better . ' " The last despairing bravado of the condemned man desiring that his hands might be bound with a silken cord at least , the horror and wrath of the pale King , helpless , looking on , forced into the assembly of the lords to witness their pitiless vengeance , are painfully tragical and terrible . All James 's favourite attendants , the friends of his retired leisure and sharers in the occupations he loved , were thus executed before his eyes  --  all but a certain young Ramsay , who was at least a gentleman , and who , to save his life , leapt up behind his master upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the dreadful deed accomplished . Ramsay 's life was spared , not to the advantage of Scotland as became afterwards apparent . The historical student will not fail to note how close in almost every particular is this grim incident to the catastrophe of Piers Gaveston in England in a previous age . The state of affairs in Scotland after this extraordinary event was more extraordinary still , if possible . James was conveyed to Edinburgh , " with certain lords in companie with him that took hold on him and keeped him in the said castle and served and honoured him as ane prince ought to be in all things : for he was not put there as a prisoner , but for the maintaining of the commonweill : gave him leave to use all his directions , gifts , and casualties at his pleasure . For nothing was derogat from him by reason of his authority , and all letters was given and proclamations made and printed in his name lykas they were before at his inputting , nor no regent nor governour was chosen at that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to minister justice and to punish theft and slaughter within themselves , or else to bring the doers of the same to the King 's justice at Edinburgh . " " Thus there was peace and rest in the country the space of three-quarters of a year , " says Pitscottie . This , however , is a mistake , for the time of the King 's retirement was only three or four months , from St. Magdalene 's Day to Michaelmas . Short or long , it was one of the most curious moments of interregnum that history knows . James was conveyed back to Edinburgh with every show of respect , attended by the triumphant lords , who despised his milder virtues , his preferences and tastes , not one of whom could manage either pencil or lute , who cared for none of these things  --  while his strained eyes could still see nothing but the vision against the daylight , the impromptu gibbet of the high-arched bridge over the Border stream , where his familiar friends had been strung up with every sign of infamy . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the grief and loneliness of his heart , and endure as he best could the exultation which his captors would scarcely attempt to conceal . The historians tell us little or nothing of the Queen , Margaret of Denmark , to whom James had been married for several years , and who had brought with her the full allegiance of the isles , the Hebrides , which up to that time had paid a tribute to the Scandinavian kingdom , and Orkney and Shetland which were the Queen 's portion . Whether he found any comfort in her and in his children , when he was thus brought back to them to the castle , which would seem to have been their favourite residence , we are not told . At all events the shame of such a return , and of the captivity which was veiled by so many ironical appearances of freedom , must have been grievous to him , even as reflected in the eyes of his foreign wife , or the wondering questions on his sudden return of his baby son . How this strange state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell , for the story is confused and troublesome . According to Pitscottie , James 's private friends advised him first to take counsel with the Earl of Douglas , the long-forfeited and banished Earl , represented as being then imprisoned in Edinburgh , which is clearly apocryphal : and afterwards with the Duke of Albany , to whom Pitscottie is throughout very favourable , making no mention of his undoubted treachery . For whatever may be the actual truth of all the curious and confused movements that were going on , it appears to be beyond doubt that Albany  --  though he had lately visited the English Court and formed a treasonable bargain with Edward IV to dethrone James , and to be himself made King in dependence upon England  --  now acted like a true brother . His first use of his alliance with Edward seems to have been for the advantage of the sovereign whom he intended to displace , a curious paradox of which we can offer no explanation . In this magnanimous act he had the support of the English who had engaged to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an enterprise : all which is very bewildering . Accompanied by the Duke of Gloucester and a small army , he suddenly appeared in Edinburgh to deliver the royal prisoner . There would seem to have been no fighting of any kind , nor any attempt on the part of Albany to dethrone his brother  --  nothing , indeed , but what would appear the most magnanimous action on his part , were not those secret treaties in existence bearing a silent testimony against him . When the lords heard of the coming of this expedition , which occurred in August 1482 ( Albany having escaped in 1479 , three years before ) , they " drew themselves together to ane council , " apparently to watch the proceedings of the invaders . " Soon therafter compeired the Duke of Albanie and the Duke of Gloucester within the town of Edinburgh , with the number of ane thousand gentlemen , and entered within the Tolbooth thereof before the lords of Scotland , who were sitting at ane council at that time , and there very reverently saluted the Duke of Albanie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him what was his petition . He answered , ' I desire the King 's grace , my brother , to be put to libertie , ' which was granted to him incontinent . But the Chancellor answered and said , ' My lord , we will grant you your desires ; but as to that man that is with you , we know him not , nor yet will we grant nothing to his desire . ' " This speech , which breathes that undying defiance of English interference which was the very inspiration of Scotland , is too characteristic not to be genuine . " That man " was Richard , afterwards Richard III , " Crookback Richard , " the bitter and powerful hunchback of Shakespeare , whom other authorities have endeavoured in vain to persuade us to regard in a more favourable light . Whatever he might be in other aspects , in Scotland he was merely Albany 's companion , silently aiding in what seems a most legitimate and honourable mission . The only way the historians can find of reconciling this strangely virtuous and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is by the conjecture that the lords of Scotland were so evidently indisposed to favour Albany , and there was so little feeling shown towards him by any part of the population , that the treason was silently abandoned , and in the hopelessness of playing a treasonable part he played a magnanimous one , with the utmost grace and semblance of sincerity ; which is a bewildering conclusion . In any case he was the deliverer of his brother . It would seem to be the fact , however , that James 's deliverance was much aided by the attitude of the burghers of Edinburgh , who were , as so often , on the King 's side  --  and to whom the character of a patron of the arts , and promoter of so many persons of their own class into his friendship , would naturally be as great a recommendation as it was an offence to the others . Their action at this period excited the King 's gratitude so much that he conferred upon the city a special charter , securing the independence of their municipal government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the port of Leith , and also , it is said , a sign of these privileges , in the shape of the standard called the Blue Blanket , which still remains in the possession of the Edinburgh guilds , with liberty to display it for their king , country , and city rights , when occasion calls . The two Dukes of Albany and Gloucester marched together to the castle , preceded by heralds , to claim the King from the officials who had him in charge . One can imagine the mingled relief and humiliation of James when delivered from that stronghold by the brother who had escaped from it by night , within a few hours of the time when he had been ordered for execution , and who in the meantime had been an exile . There is no reason to suppose that he was aware of the secret understanding with England to which his brother had set his seal , so that there was nothing to lessen the intensity of the coals of fire thus heaped upon his head . No doubt all Edinburgh was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King rode from the castle gates , past the great Church of St. Giles , and down the long line of the Canongate to Holyrood , making his emancipation visible to all . Apparently he had not left the castle since he was brought into it in shame and misery after the fatal episode at Lauder . One wonders how he looked upon the crowd which no doubt would throng after him with acclamations  --  whether thankfully and cheerfully in the pleasure of release , or with a revengeful sense of how little he owed to their easy applauses . It is said that Albany rode behind him on the same horse as an exhibition of amity . It is very probable that James would find bitterness in that too , as another humiliation . The King was no sooner free than he made it evident that he had not forgiven the humiliation and shame to which he had been subjected . He imprisoned in their turn a number of the lords who had been foremost in the death of Cochrane , and would have " justified " them we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too great apparently for James to touch  --  and Albany . For some time after the latter remained with his brother , fulfilling the functions of chief counsellor and Prime Minister . But whether he displayed his ambition and evil intentions , or the old jealousy and terrors of James got the upper hand as the lords again became suspicious of him , it is difficult to tell . At all events Albany was forced to escape once more for his life , and again took refuge in France , where either now or previously , for the chronology is difficult to follow , he had made a great marriage . Here he disappears altogether from Scottish history , and not long after from life , having been killed by accident in a tournament . Had Albany been the elder instead of the younger brother it seems very probable that a dark chapter might have been left out of the history of Scotland , and a third patriotic and energetic King carried on the traditions of the first and second James . But it was scarcely to be looked for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lords , everything should settle into harmony again . James is said to have removed to Stirling from Edinburgh , which no doubt had acquired painful associations to him from the time of his enforced residence there  --  and to have resumed or completed the buildings in which he had taken so much pleasure  --  especially the great hall of Stirling Castle , with all its grotesque and curious ornamentation , which seems to prove that Scotland was still much behind in refinement , though with a barbaric inspiration of her own . Whether the renewed tumults began by the appropriation of certain Church lands hitherto in the power of the Homes , for the endowment of the King 's new chapel , it is difficult to tell , a similar reason having been already alleged for disturbances in which the Duke of Albany was the antagonist of that powerful family ; at all events a very small matter was enough to awake again all the old rancours . The malcontents headed by the same men who had already inflicted so much suffering and shame upon the King began to draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congenial occupations by this renewed commotion , James sent a herald to ask the reason of their assembling : but the herald was disrespectfully treated and his letters torn in pieces , an insult which seems to have convinced the King that the strongest measures of defence were necessary . He is said to have strongly fortified Stirling , where Prince James , the heir of the kingdom , now a boy of fifteen or sixteen , was . Perhaps the King was suspicious of the boy , perhaps his old terrors as to the danger to his life which was to arise from his own family had returned to him : for the restrictions under which young James was left were exceedingly severe and arbitrary . No man was to be allowed to enter the castle , great or small , till the King 's return , nor was the Prince to be allowed to pass the gates " to no game , nor to meet with no man . " Pitscottie says that Edinburgh Castle was also strengthened , and the King 's treasury placed in it and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken James embarked " in ane ship of Captane Woode 's "  --  probably the most legitimate way in which he could have travelled , the vessel being that of the Admiral , Andrew Wood , the greatest sailor in Scotland  --  and went to Fife , from whence he marched to the north , calling the nobles of the northern counties round him , and gathering an army with which to oppose the greater lords and lairds who awaited him on the other side of the Firth of Forth . James 's unusual energy must have equally roused and alarmed the rebels , against whom the royal name was as a strong tower . That such men as Angus and the other great nobles of Scotland , who had reduced their King to a puppet with such entire success , should now feel it necessary to get possession of Prince James in order to confer dignity , on their proceedings seems very strange ; but perhaps when rebellion comes to the dignity of a pitched battle its flags and pretensions are of more importance than when it can so order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the King 's own interests , as at Lauder . And how far the Prince might be an independent actor in this troubled drama there is no evidence to show . He had arrived at an age when youths in these early-maturing days acted for themselves ; even in our own a lad of sixteen would scarcely allow his name to be employed against his father without some protest , and could not be treated as a child in a conflict so momentous . Therefore it is scarcely possible to imagine that the Prince was entirely guiltless . And the spectator can not but enter with warmth into the feelings of the King when he discovered what had been done , and that his heir was in the enemy 's camp , giving substance and reason to their rebellion . There is a curious story told of how Lord Lindsay of the Byres , a fierce and grim baron of Fife , presented on the very eve of the battle " a great grey courser " to the King , assuring him that were he ever in extremity that horse would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " better than any horse in Scotland , " if well sitten "  --  a present which James accepted , and which comes in as part of the paraphernalia of fate . On the morning of the day of battle the King mounted this horse , and " rade to ane hill head to see the manner of the cuming " of his enemies against him . He saw the host defiling " in three battells , " with six thousand men in each , their spears shining , their banners waving , Homes and Hepburns in the front , with Merse and Teviotdale and all the forces of the Border , and the men of Lothian in the rear : while in the main body rose the ensigns of all the great lords who had already beaten and humbled him  --  Bell-the-Cat and the other barons who had hanged his friends before his eyes  --  but now bearing his own royal standard , with his son among them , the bitterest thought of all . James sat upon his fleet horse , presented to him the night before with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down upon him  --  his enemies and his son . " Then , " says the chronicler , " he remembered the words which the witch had spoken to him many days before , that he should be suddenly destroyed and put down by the nearest of his kin . " For this he had allowed the murder of young Mar and driven Alexander of Albany into exile ; but who can wonder if in his stricken soul he now perceived or imagined that no man can cheat the Fates ? His own son , his boy ! Some nobler poignancy of anguish than the mere sick despair and panic of the coward must surely have been in his mind as he realised this last and crowning horror . The profound moral discouragement of a man caught in the toils , and for whom no escape was possible ; the sickening sense of betrayal ; the wide country before him , in which there might still be found some peaceful refuge far from these distractions and contradictions of men ; the whirl of the dreadful yet beautiful sight , companies marching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waving , and all against him  --  a man who had never any pleasure in the pomp and circumstance of war . Who can wonder as these hurrying thoughts overwhelmed his mind , and the fleet courser pawed the turf , and the wild sweet air blew free in his face , inviting him to escape , to flee , to find somewhere comfort and peace  --  that such a man should have yielded to the mad impulse , and in an access of despair , longing for the wings of a dove that he might flee away and be at rest , have turned from the rising tumult and fled ? Of all the ironies of Fate there could be none more bitter than that which drove the hapless fugitive , in growing consciousness of shame , like a straw before the wind , across the famous field of Bannockburn . What an association to be connected with that victorious name ! He had aimed at Stirling , but wild with despair and panic and misery missed the way . As the grey courser entered the village of Bannockburn at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pig " or earthen pot in affright , and startled the horse ; and the King " being evill sitten " ( having a bad seat ) fell from his saddle before the door of the mill . The sight of this strange cavalier in his splendid armour , covered with foam and dust , borne to the earth like a log by the weight of his armour , appalled the simple people , who dragged him inside the mill and covered him where he lay with some rough horsecloth , not knowing what to do . When he had come to himself James implored the wondering people to fetch him a priest before he died . " Who are you ? " they asked , standing over him . What a world of time had passed in that wild ride ! how many ages since the dying fugitive lying on the dusty floor and covered with the miller 's rug was James Stewart , at the head of a gallant army ! " This morning , " he said , with a bitter comprehension of all that had passed since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miller 's wife ran forth to her door calling for a priest , and some one who was passing by answered her call ; but whether he was really a priest , or only one of the stragglers of the rebel army , seems uncertain . He came into the mill , hearing no doubt the cries of the astonished couple that it was the King , and kneeling down recognised the fallen monarch ; but instead of hearing his confession , drew a knife and stabbed him three or four times in the breast . Thus miserably ended James Stewart , the third of the name . Of all the tragical conclusions to which his family had come this was the most deplorable , as his life had been the least satisfactory . Whether there was more than weakness to be alleged against him it is now impossible to tell ; and whether his favourite companions and occupations proved a spirit touched to finer issues than those about him , or showed only , as his barons thought , a preference for low company and paltry pursuits of peace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has left to Scotland , or the tradition of the music and gentle pleasures which he loved , may justify him to the reader , it is at least clear that his stewardry of his kingdom was a miserable failure , and his life a loss and harm to his country . Instead of promoting the much-interrupted progress of her development , so far as his individual influence went , he arrested and hindered it . And , difficult as the position of affairs had been when he succeeded at seven years old to his father 's uncompleted labours , the situation which he left behind him , the country torn in two , one half of his subjects in arms against the other , his son 's name opposed to his own , and every national benefit postponed to the settlement of this quarrel , was ten times more difficult and terrible . He was the first of his name whose influence was all unfavourable to the progress of the nation , not only by evil fortune , but by the disasters of a mind not sufficient for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignominiously , in the month of June 1488 , having reigned twenty-eight years and lived thirty-five  --  a short lifetime for so much trouble and general misfortune . Illustration : ARMS OF JAMES IV OF SCOTLAND ( From King 's College Chapel , Old Aberdeen ) CHAPTER IV JAMES IV : THE KNIGHT-ERRANT The graver records of the nation pause at the point to which we have arrived . The tale leaves both battlefield and council chamber , though there is an inevitable something of both in the chronicle as there is something of daily bread in the most festive day . But it is not with these grave details that the historian occupies himself . The most serious page takes a glow from the story it has to tell , the weighty matters of national life and development stand aside , and it is a knight of romance who stands forth to occupy the field . The story of James , the fourth of the name , is one of those passages of veritable history in which there is scarcely anything that might not be borrowed from a tale of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of the character and personality of the boy whose education was carried on under strict surveillance at Stirling we know nothing whatever , until he suddenly appears before us in the enemy 's camp , whether with his own consent or not , or how much , if with his own consent , with any knowledge of what he was about , it is difficult to tell . His mother had died while he was still a child , and probably for the last few years of his much disturbed life James III had but little attention to spare for his son . If there is any truth in a curious story told by Pitscottie of a search on board Sir Andrew Wood 's ship for the murdered King , while yet the fact of his death was unknown , and the Prince 's wistful address to the great sailor , " Sir , are ye my father ? " we might suppose that the boy had been banished altogether from his father 's presence . But perhaps this is too slender a foundation to build upon . There can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , little honourable to either side , and lost by the King 's party almost before begun , from which he fled in a panic so ignominious and fatal , there was a moment of great perplexity and dismay , when King James 's fate remained a mystery , and the rebel nobles with the boy-prince among them knew not what to do or to say , in the doubt whether he was dead or alive , whether he might not reappear at any moment with a host from the Highlands or from France , or even England , at his back . When they had fully realised their unsatisfactory victory they marched to Edinburgh , with the Prince always among them and a chill horror about them , unaware what way to look for news of the King . The rush of the people to watch their return with their drooping banners and faces full of consternation , and wonder at the unaccustomed sight of the young Prince which yet was not exciting enough to counterbalance the anxiety , the wonder , the perpetual question what had become of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the perplexed leaders , who knew that a fierce mob might surge up into warfare at any moment , or a rally from the castle cut off their discouraged and weary troops . Where was the King ? Had he perhaps got before them to Edinburgh ? was he there on that height , misty with smoke and sunshine , turning against them the great gun , which had been forged for use against the Douglas : or ready to appear from over the Firth terrible with a new army ; or in the ships , most likely of all , with the great admiral who lay there watching , ready to carry off a royal fugitive or bring back strange allies to revenge the scorn that had been done to the King ? The lords decided to take their dispirited and broken array to Leith instead of going to Holyrood , and there collected together to hold a council of war . Among the confused reports brought to them of what one man and another had seen or heard was one , more likely than the rest , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make for the Yellow Carvel lying in the estuary , with apparently wounded men on board . They sent accordingly to summon Sir Andrew Wood to their presence . The sailor probably cared nothing about politics any further than that he held for the King  --  and furious with the Lords who had withstood his Majesty declined to come unless hostages were sent for his safety . When this was accorded , the old sea-lion , the first admiral of Scotland , came gruffly from his ships to answer their questions . Whether there was any resemblance between the two men , as he stood with his cloak wrapped round him defiant before the rebel lords , or if the Prince had , as is possible , been so long absent from his father that the vague outline of a man enveloped and muffled deceived him , it is impossible to say . But there is a tone of penetrating reality in the " Sir , are ye my father ? " of the troubled boy , perhaps only then aroused to a full comprehension of his position and the sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had brought some mysterious and unknown fate upon the King . It is difficult to see why , accepting from Pitscottie all the rest of this affecting narrative , the modern historian should cut out this as unworthy of belief , " Who answered , " continues the chronicler , " with tears falling from his eyes , " " ' Sir , I am not your father , but I was a servand to your father , and sall be to his authoritie till I die , and ane enemy to them that was the occasion of his doon-putting . ' The lords inquired of Captain Wood if he knew of the King or where he was . He answered he knew nothing of the King nor where he was . Then they speired what they were that came out of the field and passed into his ships . He answered : ' It was I and my brother , who were ready to have waired our lives with the King in his defence . ' Then they said , ' He is not in your ships ? ' who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but would to God he were in my ship safelie , I should defend him and keep him skaithless frae all the treasonable creatures who has murdered him , for I think to see the day when they shall be hanged and quartered for their demerites . ' " The lords would fain have silenced this rude sailor , but having given hostages for his safe return were obliged to let him go . There could not be a more vivid picture of their perplexity and trouble . They proceeded to Edinburgh after this rebuff , coming in , we may well believe , with little sound of trumpet or sign of welcome , and with many a threatening countenance among the crowds that gazed wistfully upon the boy in their midst , who , if the King were really dead , was the King  --  another James . There might be old men about watching from the foot of the Canongate the silent cortege trooping along the valley to Holyrood  --  men who remembered with all the force of boyish recollection how the assassins of James I. had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whisper inquiries to their sons whether such a horrible sight might be coming again , and what part that pale boy had in the dreadful deed ? It was but fifty years since that catastrophe , and already two long minorities had paralysed the progress of Scotland . How the crowding people must have eyed him , as he rode along , the slim stripling , so young , so helpless , in the midst of all these bearded men ! What part did he have in it ? Was his father done to death by his orders ? Was he consenting at least to what was done ? Was he aware of all that was to follow that hurried ride with the lords , into which he had been beguiled or persuaded ? James III had to some degree favoured Edinburgh , where , notwithstanding his long captivity in the Castle , he had found defenders and friends . And there must have been many in the crowd who took part with the unfortunate monarch , so mysteriously gone out of their midst , and who looked with horror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the ruin and death of his father . It was a sombre entry upon the future dwelling to which this young James was to bring so much splendour and rejoicing . How these doubts were cleared up and certainty attained we have no sure way of knowing . Pitscottie 's story is that when the false priest murdered the King , he took up the body on his back and carried it away , " but no man knew what he did with him or where he buried him . " Other authorities speak of a funeral service in the Abbey of Cambuskenneth on the banks of the Forth  --  a great religious establishment , of which one dark grey tower alone remains upon the green meadows by the winding river ; and there is mention afterwards of a bloody shirt carried about on the point of a lance to excite the indignant Northmen to rebellion . But notwithstanding these facts no one ventures to say that James 's body was found or buried . Masses for the dead were sung , and every religious honour paid ; but so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been performed around an empty bier . At last however , in some way , a dolorous certainty , which must by many have been felt as a relief , was attained , and the young King was crowned in Edinburgh in the summer of 1488 , some weeks after his father 's death . At the same time a Parliament was called , and the Castle of Edinburgh , which all this time seems to have kept its gates closed and rendered no submission , was summoned by the herald to yield , " which was obediently done at the King 's command , " says the chronicle . There was evidently no thought of rebellion or of resisting the lawful sovereign , so soon as it was certain which he was . The procession of the herald , perhaps the Lord Lyon himself , with all his pursuivants , up the long street to sound the trumpets outside the castle gates and demand submission , must have brightened the waiting and wondering city with the certainty of the new reign . But the bravery and fine colours of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ background of noble houses and all the lofty gables and great churches in the crowded picturesque centre at the foot of the Castle Hill , were not then as now strange to the " grey metropolis of the North . " No country in Christendom would seem to have so changed under the influence of the Reformation as Scotland . The absence of pageant and ceremonial , the discouragement of display , the suppression of the picturesque in action , in the midst of one of the most picturesque scenes in the world , are all of modern growth . In the fifteenth century , and especially in the reign that was now begun , the town ran over with bright colour and splendid spectacle . When the lists were formed upon the breezy platform , overlooking the fair plains of Lothian , the great Firth , and the surrounding circle of hills , at the castle gate  --  how brilliant must have been both scene and setting , the living picture and the wonderful frame , and how every window would be crowded to see the hundred little processions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the King and Queen riding with all their fine attendants " up the toun " all the way from Holyrood ! Nor would the curiosity be much less when , coming in from the country , with every kind of quaint surrounding , the great nobles with their glittering retinue , the lairds each with a little posse of stout men-at-arms , as many as he could muster , the burgesses from the towns , the clergy from all the great centres of the Church , on mules and soft-pacing palfreys , would gather for the meetings of Parliament . It scarcely wanted a knight-errant like the fourth James , with his chivalrous tastes and devices , to fill the noble town with brightness , for all these fine sights were familiar to Edinburgh . But the brightest day was now to come . Illustration : OLD HOUSE IN LAWNMARKET The Parliament which assembled in all the emotion of that curious crisis , while still the wonder and dismay of the King 's tragic disappearance were in the air , was a strange one . It was evidently convened with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against James III , while making a cunning attempt to throw the blame on those who had stood by him : these natural sentiments being combined with the determination , most expedient in the circumstances , to reconcile all by punishing none . The young King and the power now exercised in his name were in the hands of the lords who had headed the rebellion , Angus , Home , Bothwell , and the rest ; and while their own safety was naturally their first consideration , they had evidently no desire to stir up troublesome questions even for the fierce joy of condemning their opponents . At one or other of the early Parliaments in this reign , either that first held by way of smoothing over matters and preparing such an account of all that had happened as might be promulgated by foreign ambassadors to their respective Courts  --  or one which followed the easy settlement of an attempt at rebellion already referred to , when the Lord of Forbes carried a bloody shirt , supposed to be that of King James , through the streets of Aberdeen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial of Sir David Lindsay , one of the most quaint narratives of a cause celebre ever written . The chronicler , whom we may quote at some length  --  and whose living and graphic narrative none even of those orthodox historians who pretend to hold lightly the ever-delightful Pitscottie , upon whom at the same time they rely as their chief authority , attempt to question in this case  --  was himself a Lindsay , and specially concerned for the honour of his name . The defendant was Lindsay of the Byres , one of the chief of James III 's supporters , he who had given the King that ominous gift of a fleet courser on the eve of the battle . When he appeared at the bar of the house so to speak  --  before Parliament  --  the following " dittay " or indictment was made against him :  --  " Lord David Lindsay of the Byres compeir for the cruel coming against the King at Bannokburne with his father , and in giving him counsall to have devored his sone , the King 's grace , here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ane hors to fortify him against his sone : what is your answer heirunto ? " A more curious reversal of the facts of the case could not be , and the idea that James the actual monarch could be a rebel against his own son , then simply the heir to the crown , is bewildering in its grave defiance of all reason . There is not much wonder that Lindsay , " ane rasch man , and of rud language , albeit he was stout and hardy in the field and exercised in war , " burst forth upon the assembled knights and lords , upbraiding them with bringing the Prince into their murderous designs against the King . The effect of his speech on the assembly would seem to have been considerable , and it is very apparent that the party in power had no desire to make any fight , for the Chancellor anxiously excused Lindsay to the King as " ane man of the old world , that can not answer formallie nor get speech reverentlie in your Grace 's presence . " This roused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lindsay , otherwise described as a Churchman , who was by no means content to see the head of his house thus described , nor yet that Lord Lindsay should come " in the King 's will , " thus accepting forfeiture or any other penalties that might be pronounced against him . Accordingly he interfered in the following remarkable way :  --  " To that effect he stamped on his brother 's foot to latt him understand that he was not content with the decree which the Chancellour proponed to him . But this stamp of Mr. Patrick 's was so heavy upon his brother 's foot , who had ane sair toe which was painful to him , wherefore he looked to him and said , ' Ye were over pert to stampe upon my foot ; were you out of the King 's presence I would overtake you upon the mouth . ' Mr. Patrick , hearing the vain words of his brother , pled on his knees before the King and the Justice , and made his petition to them in this manner : ' Sir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I desire of your Grace , for His cause that is Judge of all , that your Grace will give me leave this day to speak for my brother , for I see there is no man of law that dare speak for him for fear of your Grace ; and although he and I has not been at ane this mony yeires , yet my heart may not suffer me to see the native house whereof I am descended to perish ! ' So the King and the Justice gave him leave to speak for his brother . Then the said Mr. Patrick raise off his knees , and was very blythe that he had obtained that license with the King 's favour . So he began very reverentlie to speak in this manner , saying to the whole lords of Parliament , and to the rest of them that were accusers of his brother at that time , with the rest of the lords that were in the summons of forfaltrie , according to their dittay , saying : ' I beseech you all , my lords , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give sentence and judgment on us all at the last day , that ye will remember now instantly is your time ... therefore now do all ye would be done to in the administration of justice to your neighbours and brethren , who are accused of their lives and heritages this day , whose judgment stands in your hands . Therefore beware in time , and open not the door that ye may not steik . ' Be this Mr. Patrick had ended his speeches , the Chancellour bid him say something in defence of his brother , and to answer to the points of the summons made and raised upon his brother and the rest of the lords and barons . Then Mr. Patrick answered again and said : ' If it please the King 's grace , and your honours that are here present , I say the King should not sit in judgment against his lords and barons , because he has made his oath of fidelity when he received the crown of Scotland that he should not come in judgment against his lords and barons in no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grace is both partie , and was at the committing of the crime himself , therefore he ought not , neither by the law of God nor of man , to sit in judgment at this time ; wherefore we desire him , in the name of God , to rise and depart out of judgment , till the matter be further discussed conform to justice . ' " Illustration : ST . ANTHONY 'S CHAPEL This bold request apparently commended itself to the Parliament , for we hear that the Chancellor and lords considered it reasonable , and the King was accordingly desired " to rise up and pass into the inner tolbooth , which , " adds Pitscottie , " was very unpleasant to him for the time , being ane young prince sittand upon his royall seat to be raised by his subjects . " Mr. Patrick so pressed his advantage after this strange incident , and the argument of the young King 's presence and complicity in all that had happened was so unanswerable , added to some inaccuracy in the indictment , of which the keen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Lindsay along with all the other barons of his party would seem to have shared in the general amnesty , as probably was the intention of all parties from the beginning . For the victors , who were victors by a chance , were not powerful enough to carry matters with a high hand , and their opponents , though overcome , were too strong to be despised . It was better for all to gather round the new King , who had no evil antecedents nor anything to prevent a new beginning of the most hopeful kind . The scene ends with characteristic liveliness . " The lord David Lindsay was so blyth at his brother 's sayings that he burst forth saying to him , ' Verrilie , brother , ye have fine pyet words . I should not have trowed , by St. Amarie , that you had sic words ' "  --  an amusing tribute of half-scornful gratitude from the soldier to the Churchman whose pyet or magpie words were so wonderfully efficacious , yet so despicable in themselves , to change the fate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King was so displeased at Mr. Patrick and his boldness that he sent him off to the Ross of Bute , and kept him imprisoned in that solitary yet beautiful region for a whole year . Notwithstanding , however , this little failure of respect to the sovereign , and the dismal uncertainty and anxiety in which his reign began , there seemed to be nothing but the happiest prospects opening before the young King . Out of the miserable struggle which brought him to the throne , he himself , most probably only awakened to the meaning of it after all was over , brought a lifelong remorse which he never threw off , and which was increased by the melancholy services of commemoration and expiation , the masses for his father 's soul and solemn funeral ceremonials whether real or nominal , at all of which the youth would have to be present with a sore and swelling heart . We are told that he went and unburthened himself to the Dean of the Chapel Royal in Stirling , his father 's favourite church , which James III had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special personal care . The Dean received his confession with kindness seeing him so penitent , and gave him " good counsel and comfort , " and remained his friend and spiritual adviser as he grew into manhood ; but we are not told whether it was by his ordinance as a penance and constant reminder of his sin , or by a voluntary mortification of his own , that James assumed the iron belt which he wore always round him " and eikit it from time to time , " that is , increased its size and weight as long as he lived . This sensibility , which formed part of his chivalrous and generous character , the noble , sweet , and lovable nature which conquered all hearts , at once subdued and silenced his many critics , and furnished them with a reproach which spite and ill-will could bring up against him when occasion occurred . But the enemies were few and the lovers many who surrounded the young Prince when the contentions of the crisis were once over , and the warring factions conciliated by general condemnations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not accompanied by confiscations or deprivations . Such clemency in so young a king was a marvel to all , the chroniclers say , though indeed there could be little question of clemency on James 's part in a mutual hushing-up , which was evidently dictated by every circumstance of the time and the only source of mutual safety . When , however , he had arrived at man 's estate , and makes a recognisable and individual appearance upon the stage of history , the picture of him is one of the most attractive ever made , the happiest and brightest chapter in the tragic story of the Stewarts . Youth with that touch of extravagance which becomes it , that genial wildness which all are so ready to pardon , and an adventurous disposition , careless of personal safety , gave a charm the more to the magnificent young King , handsome , noble , brave , and full of universal friendliness and sympathy , who comes forth smiling in the face of fate , ready to turn back every gloomy augury and bring in another golden age . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ :  --  " In this mean time was good peace and rest in Scotland and great love betwixt the King and all his subjects , and was well loved by them all : for he was verrie noble , and though the vice of covetousness rang over meikle in his father it rang not in himself : nor yet pykthankis nor cowards should be authorised in his companie , nor yet advanced ; neither used he the council but of his lords , whereby he won the hearts of the whole nobilitie ; so that he could ride out through any part of the realme , him alone , unknowing that he was King ; and would lie in poor men 's houses as he had been ane travellour through the country , and would require of them where he lodged , where the King was , and what ane man he was , and how he used himself towards his subjects , and what they spoke of him through the countrie . And they would answer him as they thought good , so by this doing the King heard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and diligent in execution of justice , and loved nothing so well as able men and horses ; therefore at sundry times he would cause make proclamations through the land to all and sundry his lords and barons who were able for justing and tourney to come to Edinburgh to him , and there to exercise themselves for his pleasure , some to run with the spear , some to fight with the battle-axe , some with the two-handed sword , and some with the bow , and other exercises . By this means the King brought the realm to great manhood and honour : that the fame of his justing and tourney spread through all Europe , which caused many errant knights to come out of other parts to Scotland to seek justing , because they heard of the kinglie fame of the Prince of Scotland . But few or none of them passed away unmatched , and ofttimes overthrown . " The town to which , under this young and gallant Prince , the stream of chivalry flowed , was yet more picturesque than the still and always " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Nor ' Loch reflected the steep rocks of the castle and the high crown of walls and turrets that surmounted them , with nothing but fields and greenery , here and there diversified by a village and fortified mansion between it and the sea . The walls , which followed the irregularities of the rocky ridge , as far as the beginning of the Canongate , were closed across the High Street by the picturesque port and gateway of the Nether Bow , the boundary in that direction of the town , shutting in all its busy life , its markets , its crowding citizens , its shops and churches . On the south at the foot of the hill , the burghers ' suburb , where the merchants , lawyers , and even some of the nobles had their houses and gardens , lay outside the walls in the sunshine , protected only by the soft summits of the Braid and Pentland hills : what is now the Cowgate , not a savoury quarter , being then the South Side , the flowery and sheltered faubourg in which all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still close to the town , expanded into larger life , as the wealthy tradesfolk of all ages , and persons bound to a centre of occupation and duty , always love to do . Towards the east , and gradually becoming as important and busy as the High Street itself , though outside the series of towers which guarded the city gate , lay the long line of the Court suburb , the lofty and noble Canongate descending towards the abbey and palace , where all that was splendid in Scotland congregated around the gay and gallant King . Outside the Netherbow Port , striking out in opposite directions , was the road which led to the seaport of Leith and that which took its name from the great Kirk of Field , St. Mary 's Wynd , a pleasant walk along the outside of the fortifications to the great monastery on its plateau , with the Pleasance , a name suggestive of all freshness and greenery and rural pleasure , at its feet . Inside the town , between the castle gates and those of the city , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place where business could be carried on in safety , or rich wares exhibited , or money passed from hand to hand . The Lawnmarket or Linen Market would be the chief centre of sale and merchandise , and there , no doubt , the booths before the lower stories , with all their merchandise displayed , and the salesmen seated at the head of the few deep steps which led into the cavernous depths within , would be full of fine dresses and jewellery , and the gold and silver which , some one complains , was worn away by the fine workmanship , which was then more prized than solid weight . The cloth of gold and silver , the fine satins and velvets , the embroidery , more exquisite than anything we have time or patience for now  --  embroidery of gold thread which we hear of , an uncomfortable sort of luxury , even upon the linen of great personages  --  would there be put forth and inspected by gallants in all their fine array , or by the ladies in their veils , half or wholly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adorned the West Bow or smaller wynds , where the country women bought their kirtles of red or green when they brought their produce to the market , would show more gay colours under their shade in a season than we with our soberer taste in years ; and the town ladies , in their hoods and silk gowns , which were permitted even in more primitive times to the possessors of so much a year , must have been of themselves a fair sight in all their ornaments , less veiled and muffled from profane view than more high-born dames and demoiselles . No doubt it would be a favourite walk with all to pass the port and see what was doing among the great people down yonder at Holyrood , or watch a gay band of French knights arriving from Leith with their pennons displayed , full of some challenge lately given by the knights of Scotland , or eager to maintain on their own account the beauty of their ladies and the strength of their spears against all comers . Edinburgh can never have been so amusing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times ; though , no doubt , there was always the risk of a rush together of two parties of gallants , a melee after the old mode of Clear the Causeway , a hurried shutting of shops and pulling forth of halberds . For the younger population , at least , no doubt these risks were almost the best part of the play . Illustration : OLD HOUSES AT HEAD OF WEST BOW Thus Edinburgh breasted its ridge of rock  --  a fair sight across all the green country ; its sentinel mountain crouching eastward between the metropolis and the sea , its suburbs growing and expanding ; this full of the fine people of the Court , that of the quiet wealth and enjoyment which made no extravagant demonstration . It had never been so prosperous , never so much the centre of all that was splendid in the kingdom , as in the reign of the fourth James  --  the knight of romance , the gayest and brightest representative of the House of Stewart , though unable to defend himself from the tragic fate which awaited every sovereign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edinburgh must have been those which occurred very early in his reign , when the great Admiral , Sir Andrew Wood , he who had met so proudly the inquisition of the lords , came from sea with his prisoners and his spoils . Wood had not pleased the reigning party by his rough fidelity to the dead King , but they could not induce the other sea captains , by any promise of reward or advancement , to attack and punish , as was their desire , the greatest sailor in Scotland . And when an English expedition began to vex the Scottish coasts , there was no one but Wood to encounter and defeat them , which he did on two different occasions , bringing the captains of the rover vessels  --  probably only half authorised by the astute King Henry VII , who had evidently no desire to attack Scotland , but who had to permit a raid from time to time as the most popular thing to do  --  as prisoners to the courteous King , who though he " thanked Sir Andrew Wood greatly and rewarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manhood , " yet " propined ( gave presents to ) the English captain richlie and all his men and sent them all safelie home , their ships and all their furnishing , because they had shown themselves so stout and hardie warriours . " " So he sent them all back to the King of England , " says the chronicler , with full enjoyment of James 's magnanimous brag and of thus having the better of " the auld enemy " both in prowess and in courtesy , " to let him understand he had as manlie men in Scotland as he had in England ; therefore desired him to send no more of his captains in time coming . " England was obliged to accept , it appeared , this bravado of the Scots , having no excuse for repeating the experiment , but was " discontented " and little pleased to be overcome both in courtesy and in arms . A more serious matter than this encounter at sea , which was really more a trial of strength than anything else , was the purely chivalric enterprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the supposed Duke of York , who imposed upon all Europe for a time , and on nobody so much as the King of Scotland . This adventurer , who was given out as the younger son of Edward IV escaped by the relenting of the murderers when his elder brother was killed in the Tower , was by unanimous consent of all history a youth of person and manners quite equal to his pretensions , playing his part of royal prince with a grace and sincerity which nobody could resist . The grave Pinkerton , so sarcastically superior to all fables , writing at the end of the eighteenth century , had evidently not even then made up his mind how to accept this remarkable personage , but speaks of him as " this unfortunate prince or pretender , " and of James as " sensible of the truth of his report or misled by appearance , " with an evident leaning to the side of the hero who played so bold a game . The young adventurer came to James with the most illustrious of guarantees . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Emperor Maximilian , and was followed by a train of gallant Frenchmen and by everything that was princelike , gracious , and splendid . So completely was he received and believed at the Scottish Court that when there arose a mutual love , as the story goes , between him and the Lady Catherine Gordon , daughter of the Earl of Huntly , one of the most powerful peers in Scotland , and at the same time of royal blood , a cousin of the King , the marriage seems to have been accepted as a most fit and even splendid alliance . No greater pledge of belief could have been given than this . The King of Scots threw himself into the effort of establishing the supposed prince 's claims as if they had been his own . Curious negotiations were entered into as to what the pretender should do if , by the help of Scotland , he was placed upon the English throne . He was to cede Berwick , that always-coveted morsel which had to change its allegiance from generation to generation as the balance between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sum towards defraying the expenses of the expedition , a bargain to which Perkin , playing his part much better than any king of the theatre ever did before , demurred , insisting upon easier terms  --  as he afterwards remonstrated when James harried the Borders , declaring that he would rather resign all hopes of the crown than secure it at the expense of the blood and goods of his people . A pretended prince who thus spoke might well be credited as far as faith could go . The story of this strange enterprise is chiefly told in the letters to Henry VII of England of Sir John Ramsay , the same who had been saved by James III when the rest of his favourites were killed , and who had more or less thriven since , though in evil ways , occupying a position at the Court of James IV whom he hated , and acting as spy on his actions , which were all reported to the English Court . Ramsay gives the English Government full information of all that his sovereign is about to do on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially of the invasion of England which he is about to undertake " against the minds of near the whole number of his barons and people . Notwithstanding , " Ramsay says , " this simple wilfulness can not be removed out of the King 's mind for nae persuasion or mean . I trust verrilie , " adds the traitor , " that , God will , he be punished by your mean for the cruel consent of the murder of his father . " Curiously enough Pitscottie , the most graphic and circumstantial of historians , says nothing whatever of this most romantic episode . Why he should have left it out , for it is impossible that it could have been unknown to him , we are unable to imagine ; but so it is . Buchanan however enters fully into the tale . The wisest of James 's counsellors , he tells us , were disposed to have nothing to do with this spurious young prince coming out of the unknown with his claim to be the rightful King of England ; but many more were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of England 's difficulties was always one of advantage for the Scots . An army was accordingly raised , with which James marched into England , carrying Perkin with him with a train of about fourteen hundred followers , and hopes that the country would rise to greet and acknowledge their lost prince . But it is evident that the Northumbrians looked on without any response , and saw in the expedition but one of the many raids which they were always so ready to return on their side when occasion offered . The pretender , on whose behalf all this was done , shrank , it would appear , from the devastation , and with something like the generous compunction of a prince protested that he would rather lose the crown than gain it so  --  a protest which James must have thought a piece of affectation , for he replied with a jeer that his companion was too solicitous for the welfare of a country which would neither acknowledge him as prince nor receive him as citizen . Perkin must have begun to tire the patience of the finest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemptuous retort . He returned with the King , however , when this unsuccessful expedition  --  the only use of which was that it proved to James the fruitlessness of fighting on behalf of a pretender who had no hold upon the people over whom he claimed to reign  --  came to an end . It was followed by some slight reprisals on the part of the English , and after an interval by an embassy to make peace . Henry VII would seem to have been at all times most unwilling to have Scotland for an enemy , notwithstanding the strange motive suggested to him by the traitor Ramsay . " Sir , " writes this false Scot , " King Edward had never fully the perfect love of his people till he had war with Scotland ; and he made sic good diligence and provision therein that to this hour he is lovit ; and your Grace may as well have as gude a tyme as he had . " But the cunning old potentate at Westminster was not moved even by this argument . Instead of following the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king and country reaches the height of passion , he sent a wise emissary , moderate like himself , the Bishop of Durham , to inquire into the reasons of the attack . And Edinburgh must have had another great sensational spectacle in the arrival not only of the English commissioners , but of such a great foreign personage as the Spanish envoy , one of the greatest grandees of the most splendid of continental kingdoms , who had come to England to negotiate the marriage of Catherine of Arragon with the Prince of Wales , and who continued his journey to Scotland with letters of amity from his sovereigns for James , and with the object of assisting in the peacemaking between the two Kings . Henry required James to give up the pretender into his hands  --  a thing which of course it was not consistent with honour to do  --  but it was evident that the King of Scots had already in his own mind given up the adventurer 's cause . And after the negotiations had been concluded and peace made between England and Scotland , Perkin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set sail from Scotland in a little flotilla of three ships , intending it is said to go to Ireland , where he had been well received before coming to the Court of James . The imagination follows with irrestrainable pity the forlorn voyage of this youthful band of adventurers : the young husband trained to all the manners and ways of thinking of a prince , however little reality there might be in his claims ; the young wife , mild and fair , the White Rose as she was called , with the best blood of Scotland in her veins ; the few noble followers , knights , and a lady or two who shared their fortunes , setting out vaguely to sea , not knowing were to go , with the world before them where to choose . When they got to Ireland Prince Perkin heard of an insurrection in Cornwall , and hastened to put himself at the head of it , placing his wife for security in the quaint fortress , among the waters , of St. Michael 's Mount . But the insurrection came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was taken prisoner . He was pardoned it is said , but making a wild attempt at insurrection again , was this time tried and executed . His White Rose , most forlorn of ladies , was taken by King Henry from her refuge at the end of the world , placed in charge of the Queen , and never left the English Court again . There is no record that she and her husband were ever allowed to meet . So ends one of the saddest and most romantic of historical episodes . This story takes up a large part of the early reign of James , who no doubt saw his error at the last , but in the beginning threw himself into Perkin 's fortunes with characteristic impetuosity , and thought nothing too good , not even his own fair kinswoman , for the rescued prince . It was an error , however , that James shared with many high and mighty potentates who gave their imprimatur at first to the adventurer 's cause . But even for the most genuine prince , when only a pretender , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run . James had a hundred things to do to make him forget that unfortunate adventure of Perkin . It was in the year 1497 that this incident ended so far as the Scottish Court was concerned , and James returned to the natural course of his affairs , not without occasional tumults on the Border , but with no serious fighting anywhere for a course of pleasant years . The old traditional strife between the King and the nobles no longer tore the kingdom asunder . Perhaps the first great event of his life , the waking up of his boyish conscience to find himself in the camp of a faction pitted against his own father , influenced him throughout everything , and made the duty of conciliation and union seem the first and most necessary ; perhaps it was but the natural revulsion from those methods which his father had adopted to his hurt and downfall ; or perhaps James 's chivalrous temper , his love of magnificence and gaiety , made him feel doubly the advantage of courtiers who should be great nobles and his peers , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the King lived as no Stewart had yet lived , surrounded by all without exception who were most noble in the land , encouraging them to vie with him in splendour , in noble exercises and pastimes , and almost , it may be imagined  --  with a change of method , working by good example and genial comradeship what his predecessors had vainly tried to do by fire and sword  --  tempting them to emulate him also in preserving internal peace and a certain reign of justice throughout the country . There was no lack of barons in the Court of James . Angus and Home and Huntly , who had pursued his father to the death and placed himself upon the throne , were not turned into subservient courtiers by his gallantry and charm : but neither was there any one of these proud lords in the ascendant , or any withdrawn and sullen in his castle , taking no share in what was going on . The machinery of the State worked as it had never done before . There were few Parliaments , and not very much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " if they had but been kept , " to form an ideal nation ; the thing to do now was to charm , to persuade , to lead both populace and nobility into respecting them . It would be vain to imagine that this high purpose was always in James 's mind , or that his splendour and gaieties were part of a plan for the better regulation of the kingdom . But that he was not without a wise policy in following his own character and impulses , and that the spontaneous good-fellowship and sympathy which his frank , genial , and easy nature called forth everywhere were not of admirable effect in the welding together of the nation , it would be unjust to say . If he had not the sterner nobility of purpose which made the first of his name conceive and partially carry into effect the ideal reign of justice which was the first want of his kingdom , he had yet a noble ambition for Scotland to make her honoured and feared and famous , and the success with which he seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years was great . He made the little northern kingdom known for a centre of chivalry , courtesy , courage , and , what was more wonderful , magnificence , as it had never been before . He penetrated that country with traditions and associations of himself in the character always attractive to the imagination , of that prince of good fellows , the wandering stranger , who came in unknown and sought the hospitality of farmer or ploughman , and made the humble board ring with wit and jest , and who thereafter was discovered by sudden gift , or grace , or unexpected justice , to be the King :  --  " He took a bugle from his side , and blew both loud and shrill , And four and twenty belted knights came trooping owre the hill ; " " Then he took out his little knife , let a ' his duddies fa ' , And he was the brawest gentleman that was among them a ' . " The goodman of Ballangeich , 3 the jovial and delightful Gaberlunzie , the hero of many a homely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet none involving any tragic treachery or betrayal , James was the playfellow of his people , the Haroun al Raschid of Scotch history . " By this doing the King heard the common brute ( bruit ) of himself . " Thus he won not only the confidence of the nobles but the genial sympathy and kindness of the poor . A minstrel , a poet too in his way a man curious about all handicrafts , famous in all exercises , " ane singular good chirurgian , so that there was none of that profession if they had any dangerous case in hand but would have craved his advice "  --  he had every gift that was most likely to commend him to the people , who were proud of a king so unlike other kings , the friend of all . And nothing could exceed the activity of the young monarch , always occupied for the glory of Scotland whatever he was doing . It was he who built the great ship , the Michael , which was the greatest wonder ever seen in the northern seas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build her ( the windswept Kingdom of Fife has never recovered that deprivation ) besides a great deal from Norway , with three hundred mariners to work her , and carrying " ane thousand men of warre " within those solid sides , which , all wooden as they were , could resist cannon shot . " This ship lay in the road , and the King took great pleasure every day to come down and see her , " and would dine and sup in her , and show his lords all her order and provisions ; No doubt there were many curious parties from Edinburgh who followed the King to see that new wonder , and that groups would gather on the ramparts of the castle to point out on the shining Firth the great and lofty vessel , rising like another castle out of the depths . James had also the other splendid taste , which his unfortunate father had shared , of building , and set in order the castle at Falkland in the heart of the green and wealthy Fife  --  where there was great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high farming in those days  --  and continued the adornments of Stirling , already so richly if rudely decorated in the previous reign . 3 This name and assumed character is generally supposed to belong to James V : but all the accompanying circumstances seem to point so much more to what is recorded of James IV , that I venture to attribute them to him . If it is an error there is this , at least , to be said in favour of it , that the story is as applicable to one as to the other monarch . But Edinburgh was the centre of all the feasting and splendour which distinguished his time . The lists were set before the castle gates , on that lofty and breezy plateau where all the winds blow . Sometimes there were bands of foreign chivalry breaking lances with the high Scottish nobles according to all the stately laws of that mimic war ; sometimes warriors of other conditions , fighting Borderers or Highlanders , would meet for an encounter of arms , ending in deadly earnest , which was not discouraged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was again to the realm to be disembarrassed of these champions at any cost , and the best way was that they should kill each other amicably and have no rancour against Justiciar or King . Among the foreign guests who visited James was Bernard Stuart of Aubigny , Monsieur Derbine , as Pitscottie calls him , the representative of a branch of the royal race which had settled in France , whom James received , his kinsman being an old man , with even more than his usual grace , making him the judge in all feats of chivalry " at justing and tourney , and calling him father of warres , because he was well practised in the same . " Another of the visitors , Don Pedro d'Ayala , the Spanish grandee who helped to conduct the quarrel over Perkin Warbeck to a great issue , wrote to his royal master a description of King James , which is highly interesting , and full of unconscious prophecy . The Spaniard describes the young monarch at twenty-five as one of the most accomplished and gallant of cavaliers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Flemish , Italian , and Spanish ; a good Christian and Catholic , hearing two masses every morning ; fond of priests  --  a somewhat singular quality unless such jovial priests and boon-companions as Dunbar , the poet-friar , were the subject of this preference ; though perhaps the seriousness which mingled with his jollity , the band of iron under his silken vest , led him to seek by times the charm of graver company , the mild and learned Gavin Douglas and other scholars in the monasteries , where thought and learning had found refuge . The following details , which are highly characteristic , bring him before us with singular felicity , and , as afterwards turned out , with a curious foreseeing of those points in him which brought about his tragical end . " Rarely even in joking a word escapes him which is not the truth . He prides himself much upon it , and says it does not seem to him well for kings to swear their treaties as they do now . The oath of a king should be his royal word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courageous even more than a king should be . I have seen him even undertake most dangerous things in the late wars . I sometimes clung to his skirts and succeeded in keeping him back . On such occasions he does not take the least care of himself . He is not a good captain , because he begins to fight before he has given his orders . He said to me that his subjects serve him with their persons and goods , in just or unjust quarrels , exactly as he likes ; and that therefore he does not think it right to begin any warlike undertaking without being himself the first in danger . His deeds are as good as his words . For this reason , and because he is a very humane prince , he is much loved . " Illustration : BAKEHOUSE CLOSE The perfect reason yet profound unreasonableness of this quality in James , so fatally proved in his after history , is very finely discriminated by the writer , who evidently had come under the spell of a most attractive personality in this young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true . That James should acknowledge the penalty of the fatal power he had to draw a whole nation into his quarrel , just or unjust , by risking himself the first , is so entirely just according to every rule of personal honour , yet so wildly foolish according to all higher policy ; exposing that very nation to evils so much greater than the worst battle . Flodden was still far off in the darkness of the unknown , but had this description been written after that catastrophe , it could not more clearly have disclosed the motives and magnanimity but tragic unwisdom of this prince of romance . The Spaniard adds much praise of James 's temperance , a virtue indifferently practised by his subjects , and of his morality , which is still more remarkable . The amours and intrigues of his youth , Don Pedro informs his king , this young hero had entirely renounced , " or so at least it is believed , " partly " from fear of God , and partly from fear of scandal , " which latter " is thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which would seem to indicate a magnificent indifference to public opinion , not shared by the little northern Court , in the haughtier circles of Madrid . The picture is perhaps a little flattered ; and it is hard to imagine how James could have picked up so many languages in the course of what some writers call a neglected education , confined to Scotland alone ; but perhaps his father 's fondness for clever artificers and musicians may have made him familiar in his childhood with foreign dependants , more amusing to a quick-witted boy than the familiar varlets who had no tongue but " braid Scots . " " The King speaks besides , " says Ayala , " the language of the savages who live in some parts of Scotland and in the islands " ; clearly in every sense of the word a man of endless accomplishments and personal note , quite beyond the ordinary of kings . At no time , according to unanimous testimony , had Scotland attained so high a position of national wealth , comfort , and prosperity . The wild Highlands had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditionary Lord of the Isles , and the final subjection of that lawless region , nominally at least , to the King 's authority , and with every precaution for the extension of justice and order to its farthest limits . A navy had suddenly sprung into being , signalising itself in its very birth by brilliant achievements and consisting of vessels few indeed , but of exceptional size and splendour , as great for their time as the great Italian ironclads are for this , and like them springing from something of the bravado as well as for the real uses of a rapidly growing power . And there had been peace , save for that little passage of arms on account of Perkin Warbeck , throughout all the reign of James  --  peace to which the warlike Scots seem to have accustomed themselves very pleasantly , notwithstanding that on the one side of the Border as on the other there was nothing so popular as war between the neighbour nations ; but the exploits of Sir Andrew Wood with his Yellow Carvel , and the Great Michael lying there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , afforded compensation for the postponement of other struggles . It was in these circumstances that the negotiations for James 's marriage with the little Margaret , Princess Royal of England , and in every way , as it turned out , a true Tudor , though then but an undeveloped child , took place . The gallant young King , then seven or eight and twenty , in the plenitude of his manhood , was not anxious for the bride of ten persistently offered to him by her royal father ; and the negotiations lagged , and seemed to have gone on a plusieurs reprises for several years . But at length by the persistent efforts of Henry VII , who saw all the advantages of the union , and no doubt also of councillors on the Scots side , who felt that the continued prosperity of the country was best secured by peace , it was brought about in 1504 , when James must have been just over thirty and Margaret was twelve  --  a very childish bride , but probably precocious , and not too simple or ignorant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " was married with her solemnedlie by the advice of the nobilitie of England and Scotland , and gatt great summes of money with her : and promise of peace and unity made and ordained to stand between the two realms , " says Pitscottie . The great sums , however , seem problematical , as the dower of Margaret was not a very large one , and the sacrifices made for her were considerable  --  the town of Berwick being given up to England as one preliminary step . The event , however , was one of incalculable importance to both nations , securing as it did the eventual consolidation in one of the realm of Great Britain , though nobody as yet foresaw that great consequence that might follow . Along with the marriage treaty was made one of perpetual peace between England and Scotland  --  a treaty indeed not worth the paper it was written upon , yet probably giving comfort to some sanguine spirits . Had the prudent old monarch remained on the throne of England as long as James ruled in Scotland it might indeed never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his son as hot-headed as the cousin and traditionary adversary now turned into a brother . Margaret was conveyed into Scotland with the utmost pomp , and Edinburgh roused itself and put on decorations like a bride to receive the little maiden , so strangely young to be the centre of all these rejoicings : her lofty houses covered with flutterings of tapestries and banners and every kind of gay decoration , and her windows filled with bright faces , coifs , and veils , and embroideries of gold that shone in the sun . The dress worn by James , as he carried his young bride into Edinburgh seated on horseback behind him , is fully described for the benefit of after ages . He wore a jacket of cloth of gold bordered with purple velvet , over a doublet of purple satin , showing at the neck the collar of a shirt embroidered with pearls and gold , with scarlet hose to complete the resplendent costume . At his marriage he wore a jacket of crimson satin over a doublet of cloth of gold , with the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with gold over all . No doubt the ladies were not behind in this contest of brave apparel . Grey Edinburgh , accustomed this long time to the dull tones of modern habiliments , sparkled and shone in those days of finery and splendour . The streets were meant for such fine shows ; its stairheads and strong deep doorways to relieve the glories of sweet colour , plumes , and jewels . When the lists were set on the summit of the hill , the gates thrown up , the garrison in their steel caps and breastplates lining the bars , and perhaps the King himself tilting in the melee , while all the ladies were throned in their galleries like banks of flowers , what a magnificent spectacle ! The half-empty streets below still humming with groups of gazers not able to squeeze among the throngs about the bars , but waiting the return of the splendid procession : and more and more banners and tapestries and guards of honour shining through the wide open gates of the port all the way down to Holyrood . There was nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridal board was yet spread . While this heydey of life lasted and all was bright around and about the chivalrous James , there was a certain suitor of his Court , a merry and reckless priest , more daring in words and admixtures of the sacred and the profane than any mere layman would venture to be , whose familiar and often repeated addresses to the King afford us many glimpses into the royal surroundings and ways of living , as also many pictures of the noisy and cheerful mediaeval town which was the centre of pleasures , of wit and gay conversation , and all that was delightful in Scotland . Dunbar 's title of fame is not so light as this . He was one of the greatest of the followers of Chaucer , a master of melody , in some points scarcely inferior to the master himself whose praise he celebrates as " Of oure Inglisch all the light Surmounting every tong terrestrial Alls far as Mayis morrow dois mydnyght . " But it is unnecessary here to discuss the " Thrissil and the Rois , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coming of Margaret Tudor into Scotland , or the more visionary splendour of the " Golden Targe . " The poet himself was not so dignified or harmonious as his verse . He possessed the large open-air relish of life , the broad humour , sometimes verging on coarseness , which from the time of James I. to that of Burns has been so singularly characteristic of Scots poetry : and found no scene of contemporary life too humble or too ludicrous for his genius  --  thus his more familiar poems are better for our purpose than his loftier productions , and show us the life and fashion of his town and time better than anything else can do . This is one , for example , in which he upbraids " the merchantis of renown " for allowing " Edinburgh their nobil town " to remain in the state in which he describes it :  --  " May nane pass through your principall gates For stink of haddocks and of skates , For cryin ' of carlines and debates , For fensome flytings of defame . Think ye not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your name ? " Your stinkand schule that standis dirk Halds the light from your Parroche Kirk , Your forestairs makis your houses mirk Like na country but here at hame Think ye not shame , Sa little policie to work In hurt and sklander of your name ? " At your his Croce , where gold and silk Should be , there is but curds and milk , And at your Tron but cokill and wilk , Pansches , puddings , of Jok and Jame . Think ye not shame Kin as the world sayis that ilk In hurt and sklander of your name ? " Thus old Edinburgh rises before us , beautiful and brave as she is no longer , yet thronged about the Netherbow Port , and up towards the Tron , the weighing-place and centre of city life , with fishwives and their stalls , with rough booths for the sale of rougher food , and with country lasses singing curds and whey , as they still did when Allan Ramsay nearly four hundred years after succeeded Dunbar as laureate of Edinburgh . Notwithstanding , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home of all delights to the poet-priest . When his King was absent at Stirling , Dunbar in the pity of his heart sang an ( exceedingly profane ) litany for the exile that he might be brought back , prefacing it by the following compassionate strain :  --  " We that are here in Hevinis glory To you that are in Purgatory Commendis us on our hairtly wyiss , I mean we folk in Paradyis , In Edinburgh with all merriness To you in Strivilling in distress , Where neither pleasance nor delyt is , For pity thus ane Apostle wrytis . " O ye Heremeitis and Hankersaidillis That takis your penance at your tabillis , And eitis nocht meit restorative Nor drinkis no wyne comfortative Bot aill , and that is thyn and small , With few courses into your hall ; But ( without ) company of lordis or knights Or any other goodly wightis , Solitar walkand your allone Seeing no thing but stok and stone , Out of your powerfull Purgatory To bring you to the bliss of glory Of Edinburgh the merry toun , We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meik The Lord of bliss doing besiek You to delyvre out of your noy And bring you soon to Edinburgh joy , For to be merry among us , And so the Dirige begynis thus . " Many are the poet 's addresses to the King in happier circumstances when James is at home and in full enjoyment of these joys of Edinburgh . His prayers for a benefice are sometimes grave and sometimes comic , but never-failing . He describes solicitors ( or suitors ) at Court , all pushing their fortune . " Some singis , some dancis , some tells storyis . " Some try to make friends by their devotion , some have their private advocates in the King 's chamber , some flatter , some play the fool  --  " My simpleness among the lave Wist of na way so God me save , But with ane humble cheer and face Referris me to the Kyngis grace , Methinks his gracious countenance In ryches is my sufficence . " Not always so patient , however , he jogs James 's memory with a hundred remedies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he cries with rueful glee through a lively set of verses  --  " For war it so than weill were me Bot ( without ) benefice I wald not be ; My hard fortune war endit then God gif ye war Johne Thomsounis man ! " John Thomson 's man was , according to the popular saying , a man who did as his wife told him ; and Dunbar was strong in the Queen 's favour . Therefore happy had been his fate had James been of this character . We can not , however , follow the poet through all his pleadings and witty appeals and remonstrances , until at last in despairing jest he commends " the gray horse Auld Dunbar " to his Majesty , and draws or seems to draw at last a consolatory reply , which is thus recorded at the end of the poem under the title of " Responsio Regis .

" Whether this response was really from James 's hand or was but another wile of the eager suitor it is impossible to tell : but he did eventually have a pension granted him of twenty pounds Scots a year , until such time as a benefice of at least fifty pounds should fall to him ; so that he was kept in hope . After this Dunbar tunes forth a song of welcome to " his ain Lord Thesaurair , " in which terror at this functionary 's inopportune absence  --  since quarterday we may suppose  --  is lost in gratulations over his return . " Welcome , " he cries  --  " Welcome my benefice and my rent And all the lyflett to me lent , Welcome my pension most preclair , Welcome my awin Lord Thesaurair .

" These peculiarities , however , it need not be said do not belong entirely to the sixteenth century . The reader will find a great deal of beautiful poetry among the works of Dunbar . These lighter verses serve our purpose in showing once more how perennial has been this vein of humorous criticism , and frank fun and satire , in Scotland , in all ages , and in throwing also a broad and amusing gleam of light upon Edinburgh in the early fifteen hundreds , the gayest and most splendid moment perhaps of her long history . All these splendours , however , were hard to keep up , and though Edinburgh and Scotland throve , the King 's finances after a while seem to have begun to fail , and there was great talk of a pilgrimage to the Holy Land  --  it is supposed by the historians as a measure of securing that the King might not have the uncomfortable alternative of cutting short his splendours at home . This purpose , if it was gravely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of change with which , when need comes , the impecunious of all classes and ages amuse themselves to put off actual retrenchment , never came to anything . And very soon there arose complications of various natures which threw all Christendom into an uproar . Henry VIII , young , arrogant , and hot-headed , succeeded his prudent father in England , and the treaty with the Scots which made , or seemed to make , England safe on the Borders , gave the English greater freedom in dealing with the other hereditary foe on the opposite side of the Channel ; while France on her side began to use all possible efforts to draw from the English alliance the faithful Scots , who had always been the means of a possible diversion , always ready to carry fire and flame across the Border , and call back the warring English to look after their own affairs . James , with perhaps his head slightly turned by his own magnificence and the prosperity that had attended him since the beginning of his career , seemed to have imagined that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nations of Europe . And there are many embassies recorded of a bustling bishop , Andrew Forman , who seems for some time to have pervaded Christendom , now at Rome , now at Paris , now in London , with various confused negotiations . It was a learned age , and the King himself , as has been seen , had very respectable pretensions in this way ; but that there was another side to the picture , and that notwithstanding the translator of Virgil , the three Universities now established in Scotland , and many men of science and knowledge both in the priesthood and out of it , there remained a strong body of ignorance and rudeness , even among the dignified clergy of the time , the following story , which Pitscottie tells with much humour of Bishop Forman , James 's chosen diplomatist , will show . " This bishop made ane banquet to the Pope and all his cardinals in one of the Pope 's own palaces , and when they were all set according to their custom , that he who ought ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grace , and he was not ane good scholar , nor had not good Latin , but begane ruchlie in the Scottise fashione , saying Benedicite , believing that they should have said Dominus , but they answered Deus in the Italian fashioun , which put the bishop by his intendment ( beyond his understanding ) , that he wist not well how to proceed fordward but happened in good Scottis in this manner , saying , what they understood not , ' The devil I give you all false cardinals to , in nomine Patris , Filii , et Spiritus Sancti , Amen . ' Then all the bishop 's men leuch , and all the cardinals themselves ; and the Pope inquired whereat they leuch , and the bishop showed that he was not ane good clerk , and that the cardinals had put him by his text and intendment , therefore he gave them all to the devil in good Scottis , whereat the Pope himself leuch verrie earnestlie . " This did not prevent his Holiness , probably delighted with such a racy visitor , from making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feared that the meddling diplomatist with his want of education , was perhaps a better example of the clergy of Scotland , who about this time began to be the mark of all assailants as illiterate , greedy , vicious , and rapacious , than such a gentle soul as the other poet of the age , afterwards bishop of Dunkeld , the one mild and tranquil possessor of the great Douglas name . Illustration : WHITE HORSE CLOSE The imbroglio of events into which it is unnecessary for us to enter grew more and more complicated year by year , until at length it came to be a struggle between France and England for the ally who could be of most assistance to the one in the special way of injuring the other , and whom it was of the first advantage to both to secure . James was bound by the treaty of permanent peace which he had made at his marriage , and by that marriage itself , and no doubt the strong inclination of his wife , to England ; but he was bound to France by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the memory of long friendship and alliance , and the persistent policy of his kingdom and race . The question was modified besides by other circumstances . England was , as she had but too often been , but never before in James 's experience  --  harsh , overbearing , and unresponsive : while France , as was also her wont , was tender , flattering , and pertinacious . Henry refused or delayed to pay Queen Margaret a legacy of jewels and plate left to her by her father , and at the same time protected certain Borderers who had murdered a Scottish knight , and defended them against justice and James , while still summoning him to keep his word and treaty in respect to England ; while on the other hand not only the King but the Queen of France appealed to James , he as to an ancient ally , she as to her sworn knight , to break that artificial alliance with his haughty brother-in-law . It may well have been that James in his own private soul had no more desire for such a tremendous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . But he had les defauts de ses qualites in a high degree . He was nothing if not a knight of romance . And though , as the poet has said  --  " His own Queen Margaret , who in Lithgow 's bower All silent sat , and wept the weary hour , " might be more to him than the politic Anne of France , or any fair lady in his route , it was not in him , a paladin of chivalry , the finest of fine gentlemen , the knight-errant of Christendom , to withstand a lady 's appeal . Perhaps , besides , he was weary of his inaction , the only prince in Europe who was not inevitably involved in the fray ; weary of holding tourneys and building ships ( some of which had been lately taken by the English , turning the tables upon him ) and keeping quiet , indulging in the inglorious arts of peace , while everybody else was taking the field . And Henry was arrogant and exasperating , so that even his own sister was at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flattering , caressing , eloquent . When that last embassage of chivalry came with the ring from Anne 's own finger , and the charge to ride three miles on English ground for her honour , it was the climax of many arguments . " He loves war , " the Spaniard had said . " War is profitable to him and to the country "  --  a curious and pregnant saying . James would seem to have struggled at least a little against all the impulses which were pushing him forward to his doom . He promised a fleet to his lady in France for her aid  --  a fleet foolishly if not treacherously handled by Arran , and altogether diverted from its intended end ; finally , that having failed , James flung away all precaution and yielded to the tide of many influences which was carrying him away . It is needless to tell over again the tale that everybody knows : how both heaven and hell were stirred by this ill-omened undertaking ; how an aged saint , venerable and stately , suddenly appeared out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cathedral of Linlithgow , with a message from on high ; and how when James had gone back to Holyrood , the High Street of Edinburgh resounded in the dead of night with trumpet note and herald 's call from the grim Hades of mediaeval imagination , summoning by name a long list of the Scottish nobility , of whom one man defied the portent and refused the call and was saved . James paid no heed to these warnings , whether supernatural or otherwise , or perhaps was too far committed to give any heed to them , carried away by the wild and fatal stream which had caught his feet , with something of that extraordinary impetus of natural tendency long restrained which acts with tenfold force when at last yielded to . It is unnecessary either to tell the story of all the foolish fatal lingerings upon the ill-omened way : trifling with treacherous ladies for whom he cared nothing , cartels from Surrey ; the abandonment of a strong position , lest it should give him an advantage , in ever greater and greater folly of chivalry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack , till his foes were all safely over the bridge : all exhibitions of high honour gone mad with the intoxication of fate . The Spaniard 's letter comes back in full significance as we watch with aching hearts the fatal fray . " He said to me that his subjects serve him with their persons and goods , in just or unjust quarrels , exactly as he wishes , and that therefore he does not think it right to begin any warlike undertaking without being himself the first in danger . " The knight-errant kept his consigne of honour to the last . He betrayed his people to the most utter defeat they had ever encountered , but he was himself the first victim . Thus died the only Stewart king who ever seemed to have a fair prospect of escaping the fate of his unfortunate race . The worm in his conscience , the iron belt round his body , were perhaps only symptoms of a susceptible nature , of remorse which was excessive for the bewildered acquiescence in rebellion of an unawakened mind and an irresponsible age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were then and are now but lightly thought of in a prince , was in all public matters noble , honourable , and enlightened , with always the advantage of his country for its aim , even in the midst of the natural gaieties and extravagances of a happy temper and exuberant energy . He was extravagant , light-hearted , a lover of magnificence and display , all of which things , in the face of the political economist , sometimes prove themselves excellent for a country when the moment comes to press it forward into the ranks of high civilisation out of a ruder and more primitive development . The nobility with which his father struggled to the death he held in a leash of silk or of gold , often making them the instruments of the justice which they had so long resisted . There was peace in his time such as had never before been in Scotland , and redress of grievances , and extinction or suppression of mortal feuds and intestine struggles . It is sometimes given to a man in all light-heartedness , in what seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do what is best for his surroundings and his time , without any apparent strain of self sacrifice or gravity of duty . James Stewart , the fourth of his name , was one of these happy and beautiful natures : and though his life was one of almost unbroken prosperity and brightness , yet no man can say that his stewardry was not nobly held , and to the benefit of his kingdom and people . But not for this was the doom to pass by . The brightness and the prosperity came to an end in a sudden folly , infatuation , and madness , which belonged to him as his sunny nature did and his generosity of heart . And it was no evil chance , but the principle of his life , as we have seen , that in the calamity into which he drew his people he himself should be the first to fall . CHAPTER V JAMES V : THE LAST OF THE HEROIC AGE The course of Scottish history during the fifteenth and beginning of the sixteenth century is like that of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adventures . The little barque amid all the wild commotions of the sea , sometimes driven before the wind , sometimes stripped of every rag of canvas , sometimes beating helpless in the trough of the waves , rights herself when the storm is over , repairs her masts , re-strings her cordage , puts forth again sail after sail ; and with a sure hand at the helm and a moderate breeze in her canvas , rises white and strong against the blueness of sea and sky , triumphant over all the assaults of external nature , animated by human will and courage , the most indomitable of all created things , and affording perhaps the best example of the survival and unconquerable power of these masters of the world : till again there arises in the heavens another hurricane , furious , ungovernable , rousing the sea to madness , striking once more the canvas from the yards , the masts from the deck , and leaving a mere hulk at the mercy of the waves which rush on her and over her with the wild rage of beasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessel of the State in Scotland , returning after every period of calm , after every recovery of authority , as wild , as tumultuous , as destructive as ever . Again and again they were overcome , the power of resistance restored , the equilibrium regained , only to fall once more into the raging of the elements . Each successive king , with perhaps one exception , had seized the helm as soon as his hand was fit for the strain , or even before it was strong enough for that office , and had gallantly brought the ship round and re-established the reign of a rational will and a certain unity of command over all the forces of the storms ; but when he fell , left the helpless vessel again to be balloted about by all the winds of Fate . Illustration : SALISBURY CRAGS This was the case almost more wildly than ever when the fourth James Stewart died at Flodden . The heir , the helpless infant prince , was not two years old , and the flower of Scotland had been slain with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counsellors , the men to whom the country might have looked in such an interregnum , were all gone . There remained only Churchmen and boys in the devastated country , a passionate English queen of Tudor blood , and no settled centre of government or reorganised power . Such lords as were left assembled hastily for that pathetic oft-repeated ceremony , the crowning of the child , taken out of his cradle to have the fatal circlet put upon his head  --  and committed some sort of regency , such as it was , to the Queen . And after a moment in which the country was paralysed with woe and every house full of mourning , Scotland plunged once more into the angry waves , among the lions of ever-recurring anarchy and strife . Nothing in all this turbulent and terrible history has ever been so tragic as Flodden . The nation which had lost the very flower and strength of its fighting men , its defenders and champions , the families which had lost their chiefs , their breadwinners  --  often father and son together , the master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anguish . It was only a long time after , when despair had sunk into a softened recollection , that it was possible even to breathe forth that wail over the Flowers of the Forest which all Scotland knows . In the first shock of such an appalling event there is no place for elegy . There was a broken cry of anguish throughout the country , echoed from castle and cottage , where the poor women clung together , mistress and maid equal in the flood of common loss : and there was at the same time a strained and terrible rallying of all the poor defenders left , the old men and rusty arms , those of every house upon the Border and every town upon the road who had been left behind , to meet as well as they could the no doubt inevitable march of the conquering English army , which everybody felt sure must follow . When the news reached Edinburgh the magistrates of the town put forth a proclamation calling upon the inhabitants to prepare for the defence of the capital , and forbidding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unique in public documents  --  to spread dismay through the streets by their crying and lamentations . The condition into which the community must have fallen when this became a public danger it is unnecessary to remark upon . The wail that sounded through all the country must have risen to a passionate pitch in those crowded streets , where the gates were closed and all the defences set , and nothing looked for but the approach of the victorious English with swords still dripping with Scottish blood . While Edinburgh waited breathless for this possible attack an extension of the existing wall was begun to defend the southern suburb , then semi-rural , containing the country-houses of the wealthy burghers and lawyers , the great convent of the Greyfriars , that of St. Mary in the Field , and many other monastic houses . This additional wall greatly increased the breadth of the enceinte , which now included a considerable space of embowered and luxuriant fields on the south side . It was called the Flodden Wall , and kept the memory of that great catastrophe and disaster before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some reason or other the English army which had cut Scotland to pieces at Flodden went no farther . The victory was no doubt a very costly one , and perhaps Henry VIII did not wish to drive the kingdom of which his sister would now be Regent to extremity , or do anything more to increase the desperate hostility of a country which was capable of giving him so much trouble . At all events Surrey 's army was disbanded , and Scotland was left to resume her struggle within herself : which proved the wildest and most miserable turmoil and anarchy which her troubled records had yet known . It would be at once hopeless and unnecessary to enter into any sketch of the endless tumults of this time of distress . There was a momentary lull in which , though all the old personal feuds arose again , the poor little King and his mother were left undisturbed  --  she in possession of a regency more or less nominal , and in a state of health which must have subdued her activities , for her second son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . But this child was only a few months old when Margaret , young , beautiful , impassioned , and impetuous , compromised her position by a sudden marriage with the young Earl of Angus  --  still almost a boy , and with nothing but his good looks to recommend him  --  an event which at once aroused all sleeping enmities and precipitated the usual struggle for the possession of the infant king . I will attempt nothing but an indication of one or two scenes in Edinburgh which took place during this struggle . Undeterred by the evil associations which surrounded that name , the Scottish lords bethought themselves of the French Duke of Albany , the nearest member of the royal family , the son of that duke who had been the terror of James III , who had conspired with England , and who finally had established himself in France and died there . His son was a French subject , the son of a French mother , inheriting through her great estates in France and a position which was little inferior in dignity , and much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a most turbulent kingdom . But he was James Stewart , the nearest in blood to the crown , and his name seems , temporarily at least , to have united all parties , even the Queen , though his presence was fatal to her claims of regency , receiving him with courtesy and an apparent welcome . He had not been many months , however , in Scotland before , with the sanction of his council , he claimed from Margaret the possession of the King and his brother  --  sending four peers , appointed guardians , to the castle , to receive the children . It was in July 1515 , two years after Flodden , when no doubt Edinburgh had regained that common cheerfulness and bustle of a great town which is so little interrupted even by the gravest public events . The deputation with their attendants proceeded from the Canongate , where they had been sitting in assembly , through the Netherbow Port and the bustling crowded High Street , to the castle , no doubt gathering with them on their way all the eager crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the passers-by in the streets , a continually-increasing throng . Who the four lords were we are not told . The whole incident is recorded in a letter of Lord Dacre to the English Council . No doubt he had his information either from the Queen herself or from members of her household . Of the four men chosen by Albany the Queen was at liberty to reject one , and no doubt they were men of weight and gravity , probably not unworthy of the trust . It is not difficult to realise the flying rumour which would go like the wind before them announcing their errand , and how windows and doorways and stairheads would fill with eager spectators , and all the moving population would press up the hill after them to see what was to be seen . The high houses full on every story of eager heads thrust forth , relieving with unintentional yet lively decoration the many-windowed fronts , the shopkeepers crowding at their doors or seizing cap and halberd to follow , the hum and excitement of the roused town , surround the envoys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went on foot , the distance being so short , preceded by a glittering herald and pursuivant  --  perhaps David Lindsay , who can tell ? still too young to wear the Lion of Scotland on his tabard , but keen and curious to see this scene  --  he who had seen the envoy of heaven in Linlithgow Church and so many other wonderful things . The crowd surged upwards , keeping a respectful space in the midst for the lords with their train , and filled with colour and movement and the murmuring of numbers that great square before the castle gates which had held the same excited throng so often . And before the heralds could summon the wardens or demand entrance in the name of the Regent , the great gates rolled back , and all who were near enough to see gazed in amazement at such a group in the gateway as must have filled many eyes with tears , and which gave at once the most astonishing climax to that wonderful picture . There Margaret stood , a young woman of twenty-five , not a noble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and florid Tudor good looks , and no doubt the imperious Tudor port imposing to the crowd , with her child in his little cloak and plumed bonnet , four years old , holding her hand . Among her little troop of attendants , the ladies of her subdued Court , and the cluster of cavaliers who surrounded her young husband , there might well be another name of gentler fame  --  the then Provost of St. Giles , Gawin Douglas , poet and statesman , who was her counsellor and the negotiator of her many troubled affairs . But in this emergency it was the Queen herself who bade the startled lords stand and deliver their message . They stepped forward in some confusion , one would guess , not having calculated upon this sudden encounter with such an unexpected champion , difficult to silence  --  not only a queen with all the prestige both real and sentimental which surrounds such a position , but also a mother whose children were threatened . When they had finished their explanation , the crowd looking on , no doubt impatient of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears , Margaret stepped back and bade her attendants quickly to let down the portcullis . They must have been stationed ready with the intention , and no doubt the lords had no attendants with them who could have hindered any such step or forced an entrance . While the people looked on wondering , the iron bars came crashing down , and in a moment the Queen and her child were safe though visible within . Then Margaret addressed through that iron trellis the astonished deputation . She told them that she was the guardian of the castle , enfeoffed in it by her royal husband , and not minded to yield it to any man , but that she respected the Parliament and country , and would take six days to consider the demand made to her . The lords left outside had no alternative but to turn and go back , not we may be sure without a chorus of commentaries from the lively crowd , ever quick to note the discomfiture of its masters , and delighted with such a novel sensation : though the grave burghers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had so confronted the Scots lords in their own city . The Queen transferred herself and her children to Stirling before the six days had expired , but , as might be supposed , her little triumph was short-lived . Her boyish husband had already shown signs of deserting her , and probably enough her fancy for him was as short-lived as those other ephemeral and still more tragical passions which her brother had scarcely yet begun to indulge . The excuse which the Regent and his council put forth for taking the infant King from his mother was partly her second marriage , and partly a supposed plan for carrying off the two children to England , which did actually exist , King Henry being , as a matter of fact , their nearest of kin and most powerful possible guardian , though one who would have been vehemently rejected by all Scotland : while on the other hand the little James was as yet the most likely heir to the English crown . But this scheme had been opposed both by the Queen herself  --  whose statement that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have taken her children in her arms and gone unknown to her brother , but that , being a queen , she could not move anywhere without observation , is full of homely and natural dignity  --  and by Gawin Douglas , who repeats the same objection . Margaret , however , did not long continue to identify herself with the Douglases . The conduct of Angus gave her full reason for offence , if , perhaps , she was not altogether guiltless on her side ; and they were in a state of absolute estrangement when the calling of a Parliament early in the year 1520 brought Angus to Edinburgh , where with his party he had been sometimes master and sometimes proscribed man in the innumerable variations of politics or rather of personal quarrels and intrigues . Albany had by this time returned to France without however resigning his regency , and authority was more or less represented by the Earl of Arran , who was at the head of the opposite faction . The party of Arran were in possession of Edinburgh and of the little King , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under charge of the peers who had been appointed his guardians , when Angus reappeared . Queen Margaret amid all these tumults , finding little encouragement from her brother , who was much more intent on securing a party in Scotland than on consulting her wishes , had also chosen to reside near her boy in the comparative safety of that stronghold . Accordingly when Earl Angus came to attend the Parliament he was confronted by his adversaries in possession of the town and of the castle , with his wife , the most violent adversary of all , in the fortress shut up from his access or approach . He was accompanied , Pitscottie tells us , " with all his kin and friends to the number of five hundred spears , weill accompanied and arrayed . " But the city was hostile , and perhaps something in the sombre air of all about awakened the suspicions of the Douglases , especially as the gates were hastily shut behind them and more than usual precautions taken . Awakened thus to a sense of alarm , the threatened party sent scouts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out what mischief was brewing . While the humbler spies pursued their inquiries by wynd and changehouse , Maister Gawin Douglas , the bishop , went out to see what he could discover of the real state of affairs  --  if it was true that the westland lords had held a secret meeting and resolved that Angus should not leave Edinburgh now that he had put himself in their power  --  and " if he could find any gude way betwixt the two parties . " In pursuance of this anxious quest he went in search of Archbishop James Beatoun , his brother of St. Andrews , whom he found in the church of the Black Friars , assisting , it is to be presumed , at some evening service . " The said Mr. Gawin desired him to take some pains to labour betwixt this two parties which was at ane sharp point , and meaning little less than that the bishop had most part the wyte ( blame ) thereof . But the bishop assured him again with ane oath , chopping on his breast , saying , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter . ' But when Mr. Gawin heard the bishop 's purgation , and chopping on his breast , and perceived the plates of his jack clattering , he thought the bishop deceaved him , so Mr. Gawin said to him , ' My lord , your conscience is not good , for I hear it clattering . ' " Illustration : REID 'S CLOSE , CANONGATE After all these advertisements  --  the bishop 's secret coat of mail , the angry discussion between two Hamiltons in the very presence of Arran the head of the house , when he was himself willing to grant licence to Angus " to speak with the Queen 's Grace and thereafter depart out of the town "  --  and all the lesser evidences of danger and conspiracy , the Earl and his band prepared themselves for the worst . " This young lord haisted him to his armour , and caused his friends and servants to do the same , and went right peartlie to the gate , and stood above the Nether Bow in arrayed battle . " The other party , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their defence , came rushing together from kirk and market , hastily assembling without discipline or order , to find the little mail-clad line arranged in the strongest way against the background of the houses , where , no doubt , every shopkeeper had rushed to his bolts and bars , and every door clanged to in view of the sudden tumult . Sir Walter has given us in The Abbot a glimpse more picturesque and graphic than any we can attempt , of the sudden scuffle in the street between two passing groups , the armed attendants more dangerous and less prudent than their masters , whose strife as to which was to hold the centre of the street was enough to produce at once an encounter of arms ending in blood , and death for some of the band . The struggle known by the name of " Clear the Causeway " was more important , yet of a similar kind . Angus and his five hundred spears  --  in reality a much greater number since each spear was accompanied by certain men-at-arms  --  had much the advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had expected to make an easy end of the Douglases , thus betrayed into a sort of ambush in a hostile city , where no man would lift a hand to help them . But the tables were completely turned upon the Hamiltons and their supporters , when rushing " out of their lodging rudlie to the gait in ane furious rage , " the peaceable driven forward by the taunts of the others , they found Angus and his spears in full array of battle . " When the Earl of Angus saw them coming , and perceaved Sir Patrick Hamilton foremost , and with him the Maister of Montgomerie , and saw them in sic ane furie , he knew well there was nothing but fighting , and cryed to his men to save Sir Patrick Hamilton if they might ; but he came so far before the rest that he was slain hastilie , and with him the Maister of Montgomerie , with sundry other gentlemen , to the number of twelve score and twelve persons . " The end of the fray , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " was that Arran 's men were driven down the side of the hill through the narrow wynds that led from the High Street towards the wall , and thence made their way out through some postern , or perhaps at the gate near the Well-house Tower , where the little well of St. Margaret now bubbles up unconsidered , and so across the Nor ' Loch , by boat or ford . Bishop Beatoun , he whose conscience clattered beneath his robes , fled again to the Blackfriars Church , where Mr. Gawin had found him on the previous evening prepared for mischief , and took refuge there behind the altar , where he was pursued and " his rockit rivin aff him , and had been slain , " but that Gawin Douglas , following the pursuers , perhaps with a sarcastic satisfaction in setting forth the virtues of a peaceful robe over the warlike covering that invited as well as preserved from danger , interposed , saying , " It was shame to put hand on ane consecreat bishop . " The encounter of these two priests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mail-clad bishop to interfere , and pretence of ignorance  --  and , as one may imagine , the watch over him from afar of his brother of Dunkeld with the full intention of peaceful yet effective reprisals , throw a light of grim humour upon the warlike scene . Maister Gawin had no mail-coat , and would not fight ; but he must have kept an eye upon his natural foe through the fray , and it would be strange if he had not some pleasure in perceiving the rochet , which Beatoun must have donned hastily to save himself , pulled over his head by rude hands in scorn of the priestly pretence  --  and some satisfaction in interposing to preserve the " consecreat bishop , " whose behaviour was so little saintly . " Thereafter the Earl of Angus passed to the castle and spoke with the Queen at his pleasure , " says Pitscottie . It could not be a very gracious or affectionate interview . For Margaret and her husband had long before come to a complete breach , and the greatest desire in her mind was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hastily , who had treated her , indeed , with little consideration , and whom she had come to hate with a bitterness only possible to husbands and wives ill paired . After this the young King passed from hand to hand , from one guardian or captor to another , according to the custom of his predecessors , with many troubled vicissitudes in his life : but it is pleasant to believe that though the story leaves a painful impression as of a distracted childhood , continually dragged about and harassed between contending forces , yet that persistent placidity of nature which plants flowers upon the very edge of the fiercest precipices interposed to secure for little James as for other children the nursery calm , the infant happiness which is the right of childhood . No more delightful picture of tender infancy , the babbling of the first baby words , the sweet exigence and endless requirements of a child , was ever made than that which Sir David Lindsay , the future Lyon King , whom Sir Walter Scott in gaiete de coeur ( that he should ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splendour before Flodden , but who was but a youth in the new James 's baby days , gives in his " Epistle to the King 's Grace , " dedicatory to one of his poems . We will venture , though with compunction , once more as we have already done , to modernise the spelling as far as possible , so as to present no difficulty to the reader in the understanding of these delightful verses . " When thou was young I bore thee in mine arme Full tenderlie till thou began to gang , And in thy bed oft happit thee full warme ; With lute in hand then sweetly to thee sang . Sometime in dancing wondrously I flang , And sometime playing farces on the floor , And sometime on mine office taking cure .

The first syllables that thou didst moote Was ' Pa , Da Lyn ' upon the lute . And aye when thou camest from the school Then I behoved to play the fool . " " Play , Davy Lindsay : " the touch of nature brings the water to one 's eyes . Davy Lindsay had yet to play many a spring before King James , and some that were not gay . But the gentle stripling with the infant on his shoulder , the pertinacity of the little babbling cry , the " homely springs " played offhand that it was pity to hear , but which the lad enjoyed almost as much in laughing at their dashing incorrectness as the baby who knew only that it was a pleasant sound  --  how bright and vivid is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over him , the little King , perhaps in those small state-rooms in well-defended Edinburgh , perhaps in the sunshine at Holyrood with his poet , had pleasant days . James was already a growing boy when the last and worst of the tyrannies which oppressed his youth began . When the disastrous episode of Albany was well over the Douglases again made one last desperate struggle for the supreme power . Angus it would seem was not discouraged by the change in the Queen from love to hate , nor even by the efforts which she had begun to make to divorce and shake him off , and it is evident that he must have secured the liking of the little King , to whom in the close intimacy of the family as his mother 's husband he must have been known from earliest childhood . The Earl was handsome and young , one of the finest cavaliers of the Court , and probably was kind to the infant who could not contradict or cross him , and whose favour it was so expedient to secure . It costs a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to whom he seems the incarnation of manly strength and splendour . And there is every appearance that James accepted Angus 's rule at first with pleasure , no doubt looking up to him as a guide in the manly exercises which could be pursued in his following with more spirit and zeal than in the Queen 's surroundings . The great power of the Douglases , which it took so much bloodshed to break down , and which James II had spent all his life in contending with , extinguished in one branch of the family , seemed now to have developed in another with increased and extended force . Angus was as great , as potent , as universally feared as the Earls of Douglas had ever been ; and almost as lawless , filling the country with his exactions and those of his dependants . He had attained this triumph after many drawbacks and downfalls and against the strongest opponents , and Scotland was overawed by the terror of that well-known name . It was scarcely to be supposed , however , that the young King , precociously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain subject willingly as he grew up to the sway of a vassal of the Crown however great . There must have been private counsellors ever ready to whisper that Douglas was nothing save by the King 's authority , and that James 's favour alone could keep him in his usurped place . A few months after he had attained the age of sixteen , the boy over whom everybody had intrigued and plotted all his life long , who had been torn from one side to another since ever he could remember , and whom a Douglas had but recently threatened , at a moment of alarm , that rather than render him up they would tear him in two , took at last the matter into his own hands . Whether the suggestion was his own , or had in some way been breathed into his mind , there is no evidence ; but it is clear that he had good reason to be very tired of his subjection . He had already attempted , we are told , several means of getting free of bondage , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to whom he had appealed . All his friends had been alienated from him . His mother was powerless to help , and indeed on her own account in such evil case that she is said to have wandered over the country in disguise , friendless and out of favour with all . She had hastened into a third foolish marriage as soon as she had obtained her divorce from Angus , and thus lost all her supporters and champions . His uncle , Henry VIII , was more closely bound to Angus , who was strongly in the interest of England as against France , than to any other Scot , and the young King was thus surrounded by influences hostile to his freedom . Illustration : DOORWAY , SIR A. AITCHESON 'S HOUSE There are moments , however , when the most vigilant watch relaxes , and it so happened that Angus left his young prisoner on one occasion at the Castle of Falkland , the hunting seat of the Scots kings , to all appearance fully occupied with hunting and hawking and thinking of nothing more important , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncle , George his brother , and a certain James Douglas of Parkhead , who was the captain of the guard . When Angus had been gone a day or two , the elder of these guardians asked leave of the King , according to the formula , to go to Dundee upon personal business of his own ; and George Douglas rode off to St. Andrews to see the Bishop on a question of taxes , leaving only the captain and his hundred guardsmen to be accounted for . Who can doubt that young James was well used to all devices for deceiving his gaolers , he who had been held by so many ? There was nothing in his present expedient which could have offended the most tender conscience . He desired that preparations might be made for a great hunting , calling upon " the laird of Ferme , forester of the park of Falkland , and chamberlain of Fife , " to warn everybody about and call all the surrounding gentlemen " that had speedie dogs " to hunt with him , appointing the meeting next morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slay ane deare or two for his pleasure . " Pitscottie is very particular in his description , and places the economy of the little castle before us , among its woods  --  with its simplicity , its precautions , the homeliness of the household . The King desired to have " his disjeuner " at four in the morning , and bade James Douglas " gang the sooner to his bed that night that he might rise the sooner in the morning , " and after he had supped , called for a drink and drank to Douglas , saying that they should see good hunting on the morn , and warning him not to be late ; from which it may be guessed that Captain James was not fond of early hours . The captain saw as he thought the King go to bed , and having set the watch , and arranged everything for the night , went to bed himself , as the boy had laughingly bidden him to do . As soon as all was quiet , eluding the watch without apparent difficulty , the King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the stable , " and another " secret servant , " escaped in the stillness of the night into the freedom of the sleeping country . It is said by one authority to have been in June that this evasion was made , but in June there is scarcely any night at all in Scotland , and the brief darkness could scarcely have served as a screen for the fugitives ; probably it was earlier in the year , when the night was more to be calculated upon . One can imagine the breathless excitement and delight of the long ride , with the fresh breeze in his face , and one of the richest valleys in Scotland coming softly into sight in the midst of the morning , as the young King full of spirit , ambition , and all the rising impulses of manhood , left behind him the gentle shadow of the Lomond hills , and swept round the base of the Ochils towards the castle , high-standing on its rock , where freedom and his crown and all the privileges of royal life and independence were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day , and galloping across the bridge , caused its gates to be closed after him , that no pursuer might cross the river ; and was received with great rejoicing in the castle , where everything had been prepared for his coming , and where the captain , having let down the portcullis and made all secure , " laid the King in his bed , because he had ridden all that night . " Probably there was no moment in the life of the young monarch , who had fallen upon such troubled times , more sweet than this when , after the wild excitement of the long night 's riding , he closed his young eyes , at an hour so unaccustomed , in the clear radiance of the morning , feeling his life now free before him , as light and fair and unfettered as the rising day . But Pitscottie must continue the tale in his own admirable way . He says :  --  " We will lat him sleep in his bed , and return to George Douglas , who came home to Falkland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ porters what the King was doing , who answered that he was in his own chamber sleeping , who was to rise tymous to the hunting , and right so said the watchmen . George hearing this went to his bed , till on the morn that the sun rose . Then came Patrick Carmichael , baillie of Abernethie , and knocked at George Douglas 's chamber door , and inquired of him what the King was doing . George answered that he was not waked as yet in his own chamber . The baillie answered , ' Ye are deceaved ; he is along the bridge of Stirling this night . ' Then George Douglas gat up hastilie and went to the porters and watchmen and inquired for the King , who still answered that he was sleeping in his own chamber . Then George Douglas came to the King 's chamber door and found it locked , and dang it up , but found no man in it . Then he cryed , ' Fye , treason , the King is gone ! ' " The confusion and dismay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ King had gone to Bambriefe " to visit a gentlewoman , " which explanation was received with relief , the question of morality being of small consequence in comparison . George Douglas immediately leaped on his horse to ascertain if this were true , but had not ridden more than two miles when he met the Earl of Rothes , who told him the King was not there . By this time the other Douglas who had gone to Dundee had returned also , and a hurried council was held what to do . Angus himself was immediately summoned from Tantallon by an express , " ane haistie post , " and instantly answering , set out with his uncle and brother , and rode to Stirling with some forlorn hope it would appear of recovering their empire over the King . But James had already gathered counsellors round him , and was himself too strongly determined to maintain his liberty to allow any approach . The road to Stirling would no doubt be full of scouts , to give warning of what the discomfited but powerful family meant to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herald was sent to the town cross to proclaim by sound of trumpet a royal decree that neither Angus nor his companions should approach within six miles of where the King was under pain of death . It is curious to mark how in a moment the great power of the Douglases and their high courage collapsed in face of this proclamation . They paused on their hasty ride , and held another hasty council , and though some among them were for pressing forward and seizing once more the malapert boy who defied them , the Earl himself and his brother decided to obey the proclamation and withdraw . They fell back upon Linlithgow , where they paused a day or two hoping perhaps for better news . But by this time the other nobles were crowding round the King . Huntly , Argyle , Athole , Glencairn , Monteith , and Rothes , with a still larger company of barons , hastened to Stirling to protect and aid with their counsel the liberated prince . Archbishop Beatoun , the wily Churchman , who had done all he could to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so worsted in the conflict that he skulked about his own Fife moors in the disguise of a shepherd , but who had lately made friends with the dominant family and entertained the King and his guardians together , calling them " to his pasche ( Easter ) at St. Andrews , "  --  and who had no doubt known of the momentous night journey , and probably detained George Douglas late that evening to make it more sure , had also joined the King . With this powerful escort James proceeded to Edinburgh , where for some time the lords around him kept watch night and day , keeping their little army of attendants under arms in case of any attack on the part of Angus . One night , we are told , James himself in full armour took the command of the guard , more probably , however , from a boyish desire to feel himself at the head of his defenders than for any other reason ; and even his bedchamber was shared , after an unpleasant fashion of the time , by the bastard of Arran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Pitscottie calls him , who had precipitated the fray of " Clear the Causeway " and was Angus 's most inveterate enemy . These extraordinary precautions , however , seem to have been unnecessary . The Douglases would appear to have accepted their defeat as complete , and to have been entirely cowed by it . Another proclamation was put forth on the arrival of the King in Edinburgh commanding all true subjects to refrain from intercourse of any kind with Angus , his brother , and uncle , not to receive them or succour them or hold any communication with them on peril of being considered sharers in their crime  --  in short , a sort of interdict after the papal fashion . The impromptu council sat for two days in the upper chamber of the Tolbooth , which was the recognised Parliament House , chiefly , it would seem , to hear the King 's indictment against the family of Douglas . James set forth all his grievances , his subjection to the will of Angus , his separation from his own friends , the appearance he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and vowed at the end , says Pitscottie , in the fervour of his indignation and resentment , that Scotland should not hold them both . He would receive nothing but support in that assembly where all had suffered from the supremacy of Angus , and where the too powerful race had no friends . The council appointed anew all the high officers of State , whose posts had been appropriated by the Douglases , and sent an envoy to England to announce that the government of Scotland was henceforward in the King 's own hands . It was also ordained that a Parliament should be called in the month of September , to confirm in a more decorous and regular way the decisions of the present hasty assembly . When Parliament met these questions were accordingly discussed over again , with confirmation of what had been already done . It was decided that Angus should be summoned before them to answer for his misdeeds , under the penalty if he did not appear of being " put to the horn and banished during the King 's will . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power of his enemies , as his kinsmen of the house of Douglas had already done on two fatal occasions : and as neither he nor his retainers put in an appearance , they were accordingly attainted , their lands forfeited to the Crown , their name put under the public ban , their great castle of Tantallon seized , and themselves proclaimed through all the country as traitors whom no man should receive or succour . The complete downfall which overtook this great house after the young King 's abandonment of it is very remarkable , and shows how important was the royal position , notwithstanding the manner in which it had been exploite , and the mere nominal power of its actual possessor . The house of Angus crumbled into the dust as soon as their young prisoner escaped their hands . They took refuge in England , where they vainly attempted on various occasions to negotiate for their return , but with no success . The name continued obnoxious to James during his whole life . Sir Walter has done his best to rehabilitate that name in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has been identified with Archibald of Kilspindie , " the uncle of the banished Earl , " the story of whose appearance at the games at Stirling is said to have some foundation of reality . But the historians of the house , who alone mention this , state the facts in a very different way . Thus the Angus branch of the Douglas family fell , as the Earls of Douglas had fallen , and for a generation there was little heard of it save in mutterings of treason in moments of difficulty , which never came to much  --  until in the following reign the indomitable race rose again in another branch and under another name , and furnished in the Regent Morton one of the strongest as well as the most questionable figures of a deeply disturbed time . Never was a race more difficult to subdue . The escape of James from Falkland took place between Easter and June in the year 1527 . In 1528 , the Douglases being clean swept out of the country , the young King went on a professed hunting expedition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its ostensible reason , his ride through the southern district carried punishment and death to many a Border reiver and especially to the famous John or Johnnie Armstrong , the Laird of Kilnokie , and chief or at least best-known representative of his name . Whether it was wise policy to hang the reiver who was the terror of the Borders , yet " never molested no Scottis man , " it is not necessary to decide . He was a scourge to the English , of whom it was said that there was none from the Scottish Border to Newcastle who did not " pay ane tribute to be free of his cumber . " Johnnie Armstrong had the folly to come into the King 's presence with such a train , his men so completely armed and so many in number , as to compete with royal magnificence , not very great in Scotland in those days . " What wants yon knave that a king should have ? " said the young James , who had certainly had enough of such powerful subjects : and he would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose defiance as he was led to his execution , and the wail of his wild followers after him , sounds still in the stirring strains of song and ballad . No doubt it was justice that James did  --  but justice somewhat stern and out of time . The young Court now blazing out into full splendour , with a legitimate head and every prospect of prosperity , became again the resort of foreign chivalry and magnificent envoys , among them a legate from the Pope to assure the allegiance of James to the Holy See , which his uncle of England had deserted . Henry at the same time did not neglect by constant messengers and vague promises , now of the hand of the Princess Mary , now of an English dukedom , to secure his nephew to his side . After that princess , whom her father tried his utmost to put out of the succession by divorcing her mother , James was the next heir , and Henry did not forget that possibility . The hand of the young princess had already been several times offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposal or its acceptance . One can not help wondering what might have been the issue had that unhappy Mary , to whom history has given so grim a nickname , been thus wedded in early youth to a gracious and gallant Stewart . In all history there occurs by times a gleam like this of possible deliverance from fate , an opening by which the subjects of tragedy might have secured an escape had they but known . One wonders had she thus escaped the wrongs and bitterness of her early career whether Mary would have got free from those traces of blood and madness which have left so dark a shadow upon her name ; or whether , in the conflict that was to follow , her fierce Tudor passion would have embittered every strife . It is wonderful to think that she might have been the mother of that other Mary so different yet still more sadly fated , who in that case never could have been the Mary Stewart she was . We are led to something like a reductio ad absurdum by such speculations , very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eager to marry at the earliest possible moment , and all would have welcomed the marriage with his kinswoman . In this respect , however , as in almost every other , Scotland was now at a turning-point of the utmost importance in her career . For the first time her politics had begun to be troubled by the possibility of an alliance with England more strong and lasting than the brief periods of truce which had hitherto existed between two nations whose principle and tradition were those of enmity . A perpetual peace had indeed been sworn and signed at the time of the marriage of Margaret Tudor with James IV , but how little lasting that had been is amply demonstrated by the fact that no such crushing defeat had ever been inflicted upon Scotland as that of Flodden , in which the King and the great part of his nobles perished . Perhaps it was the germ of the design to attract the lesser country into the arms of the greater by friendship rather than to set her desperately at bay against all peaceful influences , which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but certainly through all the distracted period of James 's minority efforts had been made by constant envoys to acquire a share in the councils of the country , such as had hitherto been considered the right of France , who was the old and faithful ally as England was " the auld enemy " of the Scots . The alliance with France had been taken for granted on all sides . That Scotland should harass England in every war between that country and her continental neighbour was a foregone conclusion , and it was something still more sure , a proverb on the English side , that when France was to be assailed the right thing was to begin with Scotland . The position of Henry as brother of the Scottish Queen , and the nearest relative of James , who , under circumstances not at all unlikely to occur , might be his heir , gave the English king now a natural right to interfere ; and it is conceivable that had this right been exercised more wisely it might have led to fortunate issues . But unhappily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , taking the part of his sister 's discarded husband with great determination , and apparently without any sympathy in those changes in Margaret 's affections which so much resembled his own . Angus was to Scotland the representative of the English alliance , and as everything connected with Angus had now become hateful to James , it followed that his uncle 's desire to obtain an influence over him , which was not accompanied by any substantial marks of kindness towards himself , did not meet with much success : though it might have been otherwise had the vaguely-proposed marriage been carried out . But one can scarcely be sorry that the noble and graceful James should have escaped such an alliance . Illustration : LINLITHGOW PALACE Other and still more serious matters were now , however , surging upwards in both England and Scotland , which doubled the silent struggle between the old ally and the new . On the side of France was the old religion , the Church which at this period was the strongest of the Estates of Scotland , richer than any of the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time : on the side of England a new , scarcely recognised , but powerful influence , which was soon to attain almost complete mastery in Scotland and shatter that Church to pieces . In the beginning of James 's reign this new power was but beginning to swell in the silent bosom of the country , showing here and there in a trial for heresy and in the startling fires of execution which cut off the first martyrs for the reformed faith . But there is no evidence to show that James , a young man full of affairs much more absorbing than religious controversy , with more confidence , politically at least , in the Church than in any other power of his realm , had ever been awakened to the importance of the struggle . The smoke of those fires which blew over all Scotland in potent fumes from St. Andrews , on the further side of the Firth ; and from Edinburgh , where on the Castle Hill in the intervals of the tiltings and tourneys , the Vicar of Dollar for example , of whose examination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of picturesque simplicity , not without humour even in the midst of the tragedy , was burnt  --  along with several gentlemen of his county : does not seem to have reached the young King , absorbed in some project of State , or busy with new laws and regulations , or inspecting the portraits of the great ladies among whom he had to choose his bride . There is a curious story communicated in a letter of one of the English envoys of the period of his conversation with a Scotch gentleman , in which we find a description of James listening to a play represented before the Court at the feast of the Epiphany , 1540 , in the Castle of Linlithgow . This play is believed to have been Sir David Lindsay 's Satire on the Three Estates , one of the most effective attacks upon the corruptions of the Church which had ever been made , and setting forth the exactions of the priests from the peasantry and the poor at every event of their lives , as well as the wealth and wickedness of the monastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had long been the recognised object of popular satire and objurgation . The performance would seem to have had as great an effect upon the young King as had the play in Hamlet upon the majesty of Denmark . James turned to Beatoun ( the Cardinal , nephew and successor of Archbishop James ) the Chancellor in indignant remonstrance . Were these things so ? and if they were , would not the bishops and other powerful ecclesiastics join to repress them ? Let them do so at once , cried the sovereign : or if not he should send half a dozen of the proudest of them to King Henry to be dealt with after his methods . Even Churchmen had occasionally to brook such threats from an excited prince . Beatoun answered with courtier-like submission that a word from the King was enough , upon which James , not wont to confine himself to words , and strong in the success with which he had overcome one of his Estates , the lords , now so quiet under his hand , replied that he would not spare many words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting . But probably when the memory of what he had heard faded from the busy King , and the tumult of public events gained possession again of his ear and mind , he forgot the sudden impression , or contented himself with the thought that Beatoun and the bishops must put order in their own affairs . Pitscottie tells us in respect to a projected visit to England , vaguely thought of and planned several years before this time , that " the wicked bishops of Scotland would not thole " a meeting between James and Henry . " For the bishops feared that if the King had met with King Henry that he would have moved him to casten down the abbeys , and to have altered the religion as the King of England had done before . Therefore the bishops bade him to bide at home , and gave him three thousand pounds of yearly rent out of their benefices . " It is to be feared that history has no evidence of this voluntary munificence , but James found the ecclesiastical possessions in Scotland very useful for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not permit Beatoun to have his own way . When the young King was in his twenty-fourth year he found himself able  --  many previous negotiations on the subject having come to nothing  --  to pay a visit to the Continent in his own person in order to secure a wife . It is a greater testimony to the personal power and vigour of James than any mere details could give that , within eight years of the time when , a boy of sixteen , he had escaped from the power of the Douglas , it should be possible for him to leave , after all the wild anarchy of his minority , a pacificated and orderly kingdom behind him , in the care of a Council of Regency , while he went forth upon a mission so important to himself . He had altogether extinguished and expelled the house of Douglas ; he had subdued and repressed other turbulent lords , and convinced them that his authority was neither to be neutralised nor made light of ; he had settled and calmed the Border by the most decisive means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the society of kings , and win his princess , and see the world . He had been already the object of many overtures from contemporary Powers . The Emperor and the Pope had both sent him envoys and conciliated his friendship ; and in the imperial house itself as well as in many others of the highest rank there had been ladies proposed to share his crown . The one more immediately in view when he set out on his journey was a daughter of the Duke of Vendome . The defeat of Charles V before Marseilles took place almost simultaneously with James 's arrival , and the Scotch chroniclers do not lose the opportunity of asserting that it was the coming of the King of the Scots with a supposed army of twenty thousand men to the succour of France which was the reason of the Emperor 's precipitate withdrawal . Pitscottie narrates , with more evident truthfulness , how the Frenchmen on the Norman coast were alarmed by the ships , fearing it to be an enemy which hove in sight , " for there were many strangers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army . " But the sight of the red lion of Scotland changed their alarms into joy , and they welcomed the Scots King and party , " at the New Haven beside Diep , " with much rejoicing . He would seem to have pushed across France to the Court of Vendome without pausing to pay his respects to the King at Paris ; and we find his movements recorded in a romantic tale , which is neither contradicted nor supported by other authorities , but likely enough to a romantic young prince upon a love-quest . According to this description James did not assume his proper character but appeared only as one among the many knights , who probably represented themselves , to make his feint successful , as merely a party of cavaliers seeking adventure and the exercises of chivalry . He intended thus to see , while himself unknown , " the gentlewoman who sould have been his spouse , thinking to spy her pulchritud and behaviour unkenned by her . " " Notwithstanding this fair ladie took suspition that the King of Scotland should be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took out his picture , which she had gotten out of Scotland by ane secret moyane , and as soon as she looked to the picture it made her know the King of Scotland incontinent where he stood among the rest of his companie , and past peartlie to him , and took him by the hand , and said , ' Sir , ye stand over far aside ; therefore , if it please your Grace , you may show yourself to my father or me , and confer and pass the time ane while . ' " Perhaps it was injudicious of the fair ladie to be so " peart . " At all events , after much feasting , " nothing but merriness and banquetting and great cheer and lovelie communing betwixt the King 's grace and the fair ladies , with great musick and playing on instruments , and all other kinds of pastime for the fields , " as well as " jousting and running of great horses , " the ungrateful James " thought it expedient to speak nothing of marriage at that time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considering , " adds the chronicler , who perhaps sees an excuse to be necessary , " he was within his realm he would show him his mind and have his counsel thereto before he concluded the matter . " Pitscottie thus saves the feelings of the lady of whom other historians say curtly that she did not please the King . But when the Scottish band reached the Court , though it was then in mourning for the Dauphin , recently dead , King James was received with open arms . The King of France , sick and sad for the loss of his son , was in the country at a hunting seat , and when James was suddenly introduced at the door of his chamber as " the King of Scotland , sire , come to comfort you , " the arrival evidently made the best possible impression . The sorrowful father declared , as he embraced the young stranger , that it was as if another son had been given him from heaven ; and after a little interval the royal party , increased by James 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be allowed to imagine that the Queen and her ladies came out to meet them , as the first sight which James appears to have had of his future bride was while she was " ryding in ane chariot , because she was sickly , and might not ryd upon hors . " Magdalen , too , saw him as he rode to meet the fair cavalcade in her father 's company , who looked so much happier and brighter from the encounter with this gallant young prince . The poor girl was already stricken for death , and had but a few months to live ; but it is very likely that her malady was that fatal but deceitful one which leaves a more delicate beauty to its victims , and gives feverish brightness to the eyes and colour to the cheek . A tender creature , full of poetry and imagination , and most likely all unconscious of the fate that hung over her , she loved the gallant cavalier from the first moment of seeing him , and touched the heart of James by that fragile beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a marriage that no one approved , for her days were known to be numbered . But perhaps some faint hope that happiness , that potent physician , might arrest disease , as it has been known to do , prevailed both with the anxious father and the young man beloved , in whom tender pity and gratitude replaced a warmer sentiment . At all events the marriage took place in Paris , in the noble church of Notre Dame , in the beginning of the year 1537 . The King , we are told , sent to Scotland to invite a number of other noblemen and gentlemen to attend his wedding , which was performed with the greatest pomp and splendour . Not until May did the young couple set out for their home , and then they were laden with gifts , two ships being presented to them , a number of splendid horses fully caparisoned , and quantities of valuable tapestries , cloth of silver and gold , and jewels of every description . Perhaps the long delay was intended to make the journey more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dieppe to Leith lasted five days , and the bridal party was accompanied by an escort of " fiftie ships of Scottismen , Frenchmen , and strangers . " " When the Queen was come upon Scottis eard , she bowed her down to the same , and kissed the mould thereof , and thanked God that her husband and she were come safe through the seas . " There could not be a more tender or attractive picture . How full of poetry and soft passion must the gentle creature have been who thus took possession of the land beloved for her young husband 's sake ! The Scottish eard indeed was all that she was to have of that inheritance , for in little more than a month the gentle Magdalen was dead . She was laid in the chapel of the palace which was to have been her home , with " ane dolorous lamentation ; for triumph and merriness were all turned into dirges and soul-masses , which were very lamentable to behold . " This sad story is crowned by Pitscottie with a brief note of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " who took sick displeasure at the King of Scotland 's marriage that she deceased immediately thereafter ; whereat the King of Scotland was highly displeased , thinking that he was the occasion of that gentlewoman 's death . " Other historians say that this tragical conclusion did not occur , but that the Princess of Vendome was married on the same day as James . Pitscottie 's is the more romantic ending , and rounds the pathetic tale . After such a mournful and ineffectual attempt at married life all the negotiations had to be begun over again , and James was at last married , to the general satisfaction , to Mary of Guise , a woman , as it turned out , of many fine and noble qualities , to which but indifferent justice was ever done . It was before this event , however , and immediately after the death of the Queen , that a curious and tragical incident happened , which furnished another strange scene to the many associations of Edinburgh . This was the execution of Lady Glamis upon the Castle Hill for witchcraft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of magic or of poison . No one seems to know what these attempts were . Pitscottie gives this extraordinary event a short paragraph . The grave Pinkerton fills a page or two with an apology or defence of James for permitting such an act . But we are not told what was the evidence , or how the sovereign 's life was threatened . The supposed culprit was however  --  and the fact is significant  --  the only member of the family of Angus left in Scotland , the sister of the Earl . Once more the Castle Hill was covered with an awed or excited crowd , not unaccustomed to that sight , for the heretics had burnt there not long before , but at once more and less moved than usual , for the victim was a woman fair and dignified , such a sufferer as always calls forth the pity of the spectators , but her crime witchcraft , a thing held in universal horror , and with which there would be no sympathisers . Few , if any , in that crowd would be so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horrified contempt of modern times . The throng that lined that great platform would have no doubt that it was right to burn a witch wherever she was found ; and the beauty of the woman and the grandeur of her race would give a pang the more of painful satisfaction in her destruction . But it is strange that thus a last blow should have been aimed at that family , once so great and strong , which James 's resentment had pursued to the end . A little while before , Archibald Douglas of Kilspindie had thrown himself upon James 's mercy  --  the only member of the Douglas family who can be in any way identified with the noble Douglas of The Lady of the Lake . " ' T is James of Douglas , by St. Serle , The uncle of the banished Earl . " But Archibald of Kilspindie did not meet the same forgiveness with which his prototype in the poem was received . He was sent back into banishment unforgiven , the King 's word having been passed to forgive no one condemned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stern promise was the reason why Lady Glamis was allowed to go to the stake unrescued . But we speculate in vain on subjects so veiled in ignorance and uncertainty . Perhaps his counsellors acted on their own authority in respect to a crime the reprobation and horror of which were universal , and did not disturb the King in the first shock of his mourning . In the same week the fair and fragile Magdalen of France was carried to her burial , and Lady Glamis was burned at the other extremity of Edinburgh . Perhaps it was supposed that something in the incantations of the one had a fatal influence upon the young existence of the other . At all events these two sensations fell to the populace of Edinburgh and all the strangers who were constantly passing through her gates , at the same time . Life in those days was full of pictorial circumstances which do not belong to ours . One is inclined to wonder sometimes whether the many additional comforts we possess make up for that perpetual movement in the air , the excitement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both pleasant and terrible . The burning of a witch or a heretic is perhaps too tremendous a sensation to be desired by the most heroic spectator ; but the perpetual drama going on thus before the eyes of all the world , and giving to the poorest an absolute share in every new and strange thing , must have added a reality to national life which no newspapers can give . That the people remain always eager for this share in historical events , the crowds that never weary of gazing at passing princes , the innumerable audience of the picture papers , the endless reproduction of every insignificant public event , from a procession of aldermen to the simplest day 's journey of a royal personage , abundantly testify . In the days of the Jameses few of the crowd could read , and still fewer had the chance of reading . A ballad flying from voice to voice across the country , sung at the ingle-neuk , repeated from one to another in the little crowd at a " stairhead , " in which the grossest humorous view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature . But most things that went on were visible to the crowding population . They saw the foreign visitors , the ambassadors , the knights , each with his distinguishable crest , who came to meet in encounter of arms the knights of the Scottish Court . All that went on they had their share in , and a kind of acquaintance with every notability . The public events were a species of large emblazoned history which he who ran could read . These ballads above referred to came to singular note , however , in one of the many discussions between England and Scotland which were carried on by means of the frequent envoys sent to James from his uncle . The Borders , it appears , were full of this flying literature sent forth by unknown writers , and spread probably by , here and there , a wandering friar , more glad of a merry rhyme than disconcerted by a satire against his own cloth , or with still more relish dispersing over the countryside reports of King Henry 's amours and divorces , and of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a monarch who was so far from sanctified . Popular prophecies of how a new believing king should be raised up to disconcert the heretics , and on the northern side of the Border of the speedy elevation of James to the throne of England , and final victorious triumph of the Scottish side , flew from village to village , exciting at last the alarm of Henry and his council , who made formal complaint of them at the Scottish Court , drawing from James a promise that if any of his subjects should be found to be the authors of such productions they should suffer death for it  --  a heavy penalty for literary transgression . In Scotland farther north it was another kind of ballad which was said and sung , or whispered under the breath with many a peal of rude laughter , the Satires of " Davy Lindsay " and many a lesser poet  --  ludicrous stories of erring priests and friars , indecent but humorous , with lamentable tales of dues exacted and widows robbed , and all the sins of the Church , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his exactions , the confessors who bullied a dying penitent into gifts which injured his family , and all the well-worn scandals by which in every time of reformation the coarser imagination of the populace is stirred . If James himself was startled into an angry demand how such things could be after he had witnessed the performance of David Lindsay 's play , which was trimmed into comparative decency for courtly ears , it may be supposed what was the effect of that and still broader assaults , upon the unchastened imagination of the people . The Reformation progressed by great strides by such rude yet able help as well as by the purer methods of religion . The priests , however , do not seem to have made war on the balladmakers , as the great King of England would have had his nephew do . Buchanan , indeed , whose classic weapons had been brought into this literary crusade , and who also had his fling at the Franciscans as well as his coarser and more popular brethren , was imprisoned for a time , and had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , far more effective , would seem to have escaped . All this , however , probably seemed of but little importance to James in comparison with the greater affairs of the kingdom of which his hands were full . When the episode of his marriages was over , and still more important an heir secured , he returned to that imperial track in which he had acquitted himself so well . All would seem to have been in order in the centre of the kingdom ; the Borders were as quiet as it was possible for the Borders to be ; and only the remote Highlands and islands remained still insubordinate , in merely nominal subjection to the laws of the kingdom . James , we are told , had long intended to make one of the royal raids so familiar to Scottish history among his doubtful subjects of these parts , and accordingly an expedition was very carefully prepared , twelve ships equipped both for comfort and for war , with every device known to the time for provisioning them and keeping them in full efficiency . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceedingly suspicious of this voyage , not knowing whither such preparations might tend , while all Scotland watched the @//
