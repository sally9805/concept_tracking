txt The banquet in honor of Senator John P. Jones , of Nevada , at Delmonico 's , on Saturday evening , by his friend and late colleague , ex-Senator S. , W. Dorsey , of Arkansas , brought together in social converse one of the most distinguished parties of gentlemen and statesmen that has ever been gathered in this City . The large ball-room at Delmonico 's was decorated in the most elaborate manner , and was converted . for the time into a mimic mining-camp , situated in the midst of a flowering garden . In each corner of the room monster vases were placed , from which sprang up tropical plants and flowers in almost endless variety . Festoons of flowers depended from the mirrors , and were reflected back from the polished . glasses . The music-balcony was also decorated with floral designs , and wherever the eye wandered in the large chamber it met with a reminder of the beauties of the tropical zone . One long table , 46 feet long and 7 feet in width , was provided for the accommodation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the art which years of experience as a caterer have taught him . In the centre stood a huge basket of variegated rose-buds , 1212 feet long by 4 feet in width , and the blossoms towered to a height of 2 feet above the level of the table . Four smaller baskets of rose-buds , each 4 feet in length , upon the surface of which were displayed the coats of arms of Nevada , California , Maine , and Minnesota , stood : on either side of , ' and equidistant from , the central piece . The remainder of the decorations of the table very appropriately consisted of pieces in confectionery and jellies , representing the development of the mining interests of the country , to which Senators Jones and Dorsey both owe so much of their prosperity . There were representations of the chutes used in placer mining , a mimic drift in a quartz mine , with Liliputian miners wielding Liliputian picks , a miniature quartzmill for crushing the ore , and several other devices , which were familiar to the mining men in the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the guests . The number of guests who sat down to this elaborately-decorated table was not so large as that at some of the banquets at Delmonico 's , but it it was a remarkable gathering on account of the well-known gentlemen who composed it . It comprised 5 . I. statesmen and civilians , one actual candidate for the Presidency of the United States , one possible candidate in the event of a want of unanimity in the Republican National Convention , and a great number of United . States Senators and Congressmen , and prominent office-holders from this State . Among the gentlemen comprising the distinguished . company were the Hon. J. P. Jones , the guest of the evening ; the Hon. James G. Blaine. of Maine ; the Hon. George B. Loring , of Massachusetts ? the Hon. George ee M. Robeson , of Now-Jersey ; Ate Hon. J. Donald Cameron , of Pennsylvania ; the Hon. George H. Sharpe , Speaker of the New-York State Assembly ; the Hon. Thomas Murphy , of this City ; the Hon. William Dorsheimer , of New-York ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ward , Attorney-General of New-York ; the Hon. H. W. Blair , of NowHampshire ; the Hon. J. H. Starin , of NewYork ; the Hon. Newton Booth , United States Senator from California ; Mr. N. D. Wendell , State Treasurer of New-York ; Police Commissioners Wheeler and French , of this City . and . Chauncey M. enapew . At 7 o'clock the party filed into the banquet ball , Senator Dorsey , the host , leading , with the Hon. John P. Jones , the special guest . Senators Blaine of Maine , Booth of California , Jones of Nevada , and Windom of Minnesota took seats opposite the floral devices of their several States , and the other gentlemen occupied the places assigned them . At each cover was an elaborately-designed mow , printed in gold , and bearing on the reverse side the name of the guest for whom it was intended . A second leaf , opening upward , bore the picture of a bird , dressed in its natural feathers . No two guests had the same bird , and . the plumage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this leaf was a list of the invited guests , also printed . in gold , and the whole was incased in satin of every conceivable shade . Only one after-dinner speech , in the ordinary sense , was made , and this was by Senator Blaine , in eulogy of Senator Jones . The gentleman from Maine referred to his colleague from Nevada as a striking example of the progress which can be made from poverty to afthaence. and from obscurity to fame , " in this country of free institutions , even by a foreigner . Senator Jones , Mr. Blaine said , came to the United , States from a foreign land , - and here he found a field in which his talents were untrammeled and his energy arid ambition had no artificial obstacles to grapple with . He found that his fortune was in his own hands , to make or to mar , and he made it . Front a ragged boy , be grew up to be a miner ; be pushed resolutely on . and in time became the owner and manager of great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be forced his way into the California Legislature , and secured several offices of honor and trust in that State ; be became a millionaire , and used his millions to enrich his friends , and , finally , he became a Senator of the United States , the highest civic honor to which any man , not native born , can aspire . He was an untiring , energetic man , a man of wenn impulses , and generous instincts , and he richly deserved the honors which he had won . He was a bright example of the possibilities which open out to the poorest of our citizens , if they . have only the courage , the ambition , and . the energy to reach forth for the grand prizes of life . . The party remained at the ' table discussing the good ' things set before them for about three hours . Then the gentlemen broke up into groups , and as all were interested , more or less . in the politics of the country . it was natural that the main subject of conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . were a few Democrats among the guests , but the majority were Republicans , and the question of the probable nomination at Chicago formed the basis of nearly all the discussion . Of the 51 gentlemen , 40 are pronounced Grant men , and . the remaining 11 are in favor of the nomination of Senator Blaine . In the entire number not a single friend to John Sherman was found . There was not a man in the Assembly , Republican or Democrat , who had a good word to say , or a kindly feeling to express , for the Secretary of the Treasury . In the group of which Senator Jones and Senator Blaine were the centre , Sherman s attempts to secure the nomination were the subject of a long-continued discussion . Advocates of Grant and of Blaine formed'this group . and , the argu-ments were all on one side . Among the mentlemen composing the group were Senator Plumb , ( for Grant ; ) Congressman McCook , ( for Blaine ; ) the Hon. b George Sharpe , ( for Grant. ) and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In canvassing the qualifications of the absent member , John Sherman , for the nomination . it was agreed , without a dissenting voice . that if the Republican Party attempts to carry him on its shoulders it will suffer an ignominious defeat . The Secretary of the Treasury , it was said . has shown by his entire public career that he is selfish to the last degree . He knows no party and no country when his own ambitious schemes are concerned . The little group . in which Sherman was being dissected rapidly increased as the discussion grew warm , and some of the epithets applied . to the absent member would have made the blood rush to his face could he have heard them . Several of the gentlemen expressed their determination , not only to refuse to vote for him under any consideration , but to vote against him , and to use all their influence and . power to defeat him should he succeed , by trickery , in getting the nomination . It was urged that the ' simple presentation to the people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Democrats would be sure to present all the facts in. connection with that subject  --  and . the story of the stupendous sums of money belonging to the United . States which he has left in the hands of small banks and private individuals , which will be sure to be ventilated , would render his defeat unavoidable . His recent action in sending Treasury Agents to South Carolina , Virginia , and other Southern States to manipulate the county conventions was commented . on freely , and . it was the unanimous expression of all the guests that no such prostitution of a great office to subserve personal interests has ever been known in our political history before , and that no such low trickery would be permitted in an ordinary ward meeting . Senator Blaine listened intently , and with evident sympathy , to the views thus expressed in regard to his rival . but said nothing . Indeed , he  --  was the one man in the party who did not participate actively in the discussion . He acted like a Generalthroughout the evening , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to any candidate for the Republican nomination . Ex-Secretary Robeson and Senator Cameron formed the centre of another group . Both are Grant men to the core , and the subject of discussion in their immediate vicinity was the chances of the General for receiving the nomination for a third . term . Senator Newton Booth , of California , who is a pronounced advocate of the claims of Senator Blaine , argued with Senator Cameron on the turn affairs had taken in Pennsylvania . He called the attention of Mr. Cameron to the fact that Grant had recently passed through the State with great eclat , making , , so to speak . a grand boom for himself , and asked why , with all this , and the power and influence of the Cameron family at his back , the General had secured the State delegation at Harrisburg by so small a majority . The California Senator did not think that these facts indicated . any very remarkably strong feeling in favor of Grant in Pennsylvania . Senator Cameron replied that the only mistake made on his part , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that no effort had been made to carry the primaries or County Conventions . They had . not believed . that any effort was necessary , trusting to the popularity of Gen. Grant to carry him through without-anye active work : " If , " said the Senator . " we had . taken the trouble to work at the primaries and . the County Conventions , I can assure you that ' the vote in the State Convention to instruct . our delegates to vote for Grant would . have been as tour to one . As a matter of fact . the conservative and prudent Republicans of Pennsylvania demand that the General be nominated , almost to a man . " Ex-Secretary Robeson took up the conversation where Senator Cameron . had left it . He was confident , he said , that Grant would be nominated by the Republicans , and the nomination was equivalent to an election . He was sure that if the General 's name was brought before the convention no other name would be mentioned , and the nomination would be unanimous on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buffalo , who is also in favor of Grant , said that the Republican young men of Erie County are now nearly all for Blaine , but the older . more prudent , and sub- ? stantial members of the party heartily ? indorsed the Grant movement . He thought that if the General received the nomination , the younger Republicans would catch the enthusiasm of the hour , and support him as fully as they new do Blaine . Senator Blair , of NewHampshire ; announced that his own State ! would send a Blaine delegation to the conven- , tion , and he believed that the majority of the , New-England States would do the same . Con- , greseman Loring thought that Massachusetts would send a majority of delegates for Grant . It was midnight before the party separated . As one of the gentlemen , in speaking of the dinner , yesterday , said , " Whatever kind of a boom it may have been , it certainly was not a Sherman boom . "             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
