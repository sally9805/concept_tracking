BY JOHN G. NICOLAY AND JOHN HAY , PRIVATE SECRETARIES TO THE PRESIDENT . THE ADVANCE . And General George B. McClellan , appointed to organize the Contingent from the State of Ohio , had his earliest attention directed toward a movement into western Virginia . Prompted by many different shades of feeling , there now arose throughout the North a demand for military action and military success . Assuming the undeniable preponderance of men and means in the free States , public opinion illogically also assumed that they could be made immediately victorious . Under bold head-lines a leading newspaper kept " The nation 's war cry " standing in its columns : " Forward to Richmond ! Forward to Richmond ! The rebel Congress must not be allowed to meet there on the 20th of July . By that date the place must be held by the National army ! " I Though this was but a single voice , it brought responsive echoes from all parts of the North . Two months of the first three-months ' enlistment of the militia called into service were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their term should be utilized in an energetic movement . General Scott 's original idea had been that this energetic movement should occur at Harper 's Ferry ; but Johnston 's evacuation of that place , and Patterson 's over-caution and defensive strategy , frustrated the design . Under the increasing political pressure , the most promising alternative was thought to be a direct advance from Washington against Manassas Junction , the strategical importance of which the Confederates had instinctively recognized , especially its relation to Harper 's Ferry . Colonel Cocke had written to Lee , May r5 : IECESSION sophistry about oppression and subjugation was sufficiently answered by the practical logic of the Southern States in collecting armies and uniting in military leagues . Military necessity , not political expediency , was now the unavoidable rule of action . The Washington authorities had long foreseen that merely filling the National capital with Northern regiments would not by itself give security to the Government buildings and archives . The presidential mansion , the Capitol , and the various department offices all lay within easy reach of rebel batteries which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the southern bank of the Potomac , and from which hostile shot and shell could speedily reduce the whole city to ruins . As early , therefore , as the 3d of May , Scott instructed General Mansfield , the local commander , to seize and fortify Arlington Heights . Various causes produced a postponement of the design , urgent as was the necessity ; but finally the needed reinforcements arrived . Under plans carefully matured , the Union forces commanded by Br'igadier-General Irvin McDowell on the morning of May 24 made their advance across the Potomac River and entered Virginia . Here was begun that formidable system of earth-works , crowning every hill in an irregular line for perhaps ten miles , extending from the river-bend above Georgetown to the bay into which Hunting Creek flows , below Alexandria , which constituted such an immense military strength , and so important a moral support to the Army of the Potomac , and , indeed , to the Union sentiment of the whole country during the entire war . Three other movements of troops were begun about the same time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manassas and one at Winchester , could readily cooperate and concentrate upon the one point or the other ; either to make head against the enemy 's columns advancing down the valley , should , he force 1Harper 's Ferry , or in case we repulse him at Harper 's Ferry , the Winchester supporting column could throw itself on this side of the mountains to co√∂perate with the column at Manassas. // sion to say that he was not in favor of such a movement . " He did not believe in a little war by piecemeal . But he believed in a war of large bodies . " He adhered to the " anaconda " policy , and a decisive campaign down the Mississippi River in the autumn and winter . " We were to go down , fight all the battles that were necessary , take all the positions we could find and garrison them , fight a battle at New Orleans and win it , and thus end the war . " * But being overruled by the President and Cabinet in favor of an immediate movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave his best counsel and cooperation to the new enterprise . He caused to be read the plan matured by General McDowell and approved by himself . McDowell 's plan stated that the secession forces then at Manassas Junction , under command of General Beauregard , and its dependencies , were estimated at twenty-five thousand . When threatened they would call up all reinforcements within reach . If General J. E. Johnston 's force is kept engaged by Major-General Patterson , and Major-General Butler occupies the force now in his vicinity , I think they will not be able to bring up more than ten thousand men . So we must calculate on having to do with about thirty-five thousand men . . . . Leaving small garrisons in the defensive works , I propose to move against Manassas with a force of 30,000 of all arms , organized into 3 columns , with a reserve of io , ooo . After uniting the columns this side of it , I propose to attack the main position by turning it , if possible , so as to cut off communications by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the preparation for this advance had even been completed , the first campaign of the war , though not an extensive one , was already finished with a decided success to the Union arms . When the Richmond convention by the secret secession ordinance of the 17th of April , and a few days later by a military league with Jefferson Davis , literally kidnapped Virginia and transferred her , bound hand and foot , to the rebel government at Montgomery , the western half of the State rose with an almost unanimous protest against the rude violation of self-government , and resolved to secede from secession . A series of popular meetings was held , with such success that on the *3th of May delegates from twenty-five counties met for . consultation at Wheeling , and agreed on such further action and codperation as would enable them to counteract and escape the treason and alienation to which they had been committed without their consent . The leaders made their designs known to President Lincoln at Washington , and to General McClellan at Cincinnati , commanding the Committee on Conduct of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only assured of earnest sympathy , but promised active help from the Ohio contingent of threemonths ' volunteers , whenever the decisive moment of need should arrive . In conformity with this understanding , an expedition under McClellan 's orders moved against and dispersed a little nucleus of rebel troops at Philippi , in a secluded mountain valley about fifteen miles south of Grafton . Under shelter and encouragement of this initial military success , the political scheme of forming a new State proceeded with accelerated ardor . As early as June i i a delegate convention , representing about forty counties lying between the crest of the Alleghanies and the Ohio River , met and organized at Wheeling . On the i3th of June , after reciting the various treasonable usurpations of the Richmond convention and Governor Letcher , it adopted a formal declaration that all the acts of the convention and the executive were without authority and void , and declared vacated all executive , legislative , and judicial offices in the State held by those " who adhere to said convention and executive . " On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State government , under which F. H. Peirpoint was appointed govemor , to wield executive authority in conjunction with an executive council of five members . A legislature was constituted by calling together such members-elect as would take a prescribed oath of allegiance to the United States and to the restored government of Virginia , and providing for filling the vacancies of those who refused . A similar provision continued or substituted other State and county officers . After adding sundry other ordinances to this groundwork of restoration , the convention on the 25th took a recess till August . The newly constituted legislature soon met to enact laws for the provisional government ; and on July 9 it elected two United States senators , who were admitted to seats four days later . So far the work was simply a repudiation of secession and a restoration of the government of the whole State which had been usurped . But the main motive and purpose of the counter-revolution was not allowed to halt nor fail . In August the Wheeling convention reassembled , and on the 20th adopted an ordinance creating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and providing for a popular vote to be taken in the following October on the question of ratification . The Richmond government had no thought of surrendering western Virginia to the Union without a struggle . Toward the end of June t McDowell to Townsend , June , i86i . War Records . // they sent General Garnett to oppose the Federal forces . He took position in a mountainpass at Laurel Hill with 3 or 4 regiments , and stationed Colonel Pegram in another pass at Rich Mountain , 17 miles south , with a regiment and 6 guns . Early in July , General McClellan , learning the weakness of the rebels , resolved to drive them from their positions . He sent General Morris with * or 6 regiments against Garnett , and himself moved with some 7 regiments upon Pegram 's intrenched camp . General Rosecrans , commanding McClellan 's advance , was fortunate enough to obtain a Union mountaineer , thoroughly familiar with the locality , who led a detachment of 1900 men to the rear of the rebel position , where they easily dispersed an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summit . This victory made Pegram 's position untenable ; and , hastily abandoning his intrenched camp and guns , he sought to join Garnett at Laurel Hill by a northward march along the mountain-top . Garnett , however , was already retreating ; and Pegram , unable to escape , surrendered his command of between 500 and 6oo to McClellan on the morning of the *3th of July . A difficult route of retreat to the northward still lay open to Garnett , and he made diligent efforts to impede the pursuit , which was pushed with vigor . About noon of July 13 Captain Benham with three Union regiments came up with the rebel wagon train at Carrick 's Ford , one of the crossings of Cheat River , twenty-six miles north-west of Laurel Hill . Here Garnett deployed his rear-guard of a regiment with three guns to protect his train ; but by a sharp attack the Union forces drove the enemy , capturing one of the guns . In a desultory skirmish a little farther on Garnett himself was killed by a sharpshooter , and that incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the remnant of rebels successfully continued their farther retreat . Large political and military results followed this series of comparatively slight encounters . They terminated the campaign for the possession of western Virginia , and the movement for the establishment of a separate State thereafter went on unchecked . The most important result was upon the personal fortunes of General McClellan . These were the first decided Union * HUNTSVILLE , VA. , July 14 , i86i .

We have in all killed at least 200 of the enemy , and their prisoners will amount to at least iooo . Have taken seven guns in all . I still look for the capture of the remnant of Garnett 's army by General Hill . The troops defeated are the crack regiments of eastern Virginia , aided by Georgians , Tenvictories of the war , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altogether disproportionate to their real magnitude . When on the following day McClellan summed up in a single laconic dispatch * the scattered and disconnected incidents of three different days , happening forty miles apart , the impression , without design on his part , was most naturally produced upon the authorities and the country that so sweeping and effective a campaign could only be the work of a military genius of the first order . McClellan was the unquestioned hero of the hour . The &amp;lat of this achievement soon called him to Washington , and in a train of events which followed had no insignificant influence in securing his promotion , on the ist of November following , without further victories , to the command of all the armies of the United States .

He started with barely wagons enough for his ammunition and hospital supplies ; tents , baggage , and rations were to follow . The utmost caution was enjoined to avoid another Vienna or Big Bethel disaster . Three things , his marching orders said , would be held unpardonable : FirsA to come upon a battery or a breastwork without knowledge of its position . Second , to be surprised . Tkird to fall back . His army being a new , untried machine , his men unused to the fatigues and privations of a march , progress was slow . With a cumbersome movement it felt its way toward Fairfax Court House and Centreville , the outposts of the enemy having sufficient time to retire as it advanced . Tyler commanded his first division , of 4 brigades ; Hunter the second division , of 2 brigades ; Heintzelman the third division , of 3 brigades ; and Miles the fifth division , of 2 brigades .

His total command embraced an aggregate of 34,320 men ; his marching column proper consisted of a little less than 28,000 men , including artillery , a total of 49 guns , and a single battalion of cavalry . When , on the morning of July i8 , Tyler reached Centreville , he found that the enemy had everywhere retired behind the line of Bull Run , a winding , sluggish stream flowing southeasterly toward the Potomac , about thirty-two miles south-east of Washington . While it is fordable in many places , it generally has steep and sometimes precipitous and rocky banks with wooded heights on the west . Three miles beyond the stream lies Manassas Junction on a high , open plateau . Here the railroads , from Richmond on the south and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To protect this junction the rebels had some slight field-works , armed with 14 or 15 heavy guns , and garrisoned by about 2000 men . Beauregard , in command since the ist of June , had gathered an army of nearly 22,000 men and 29 guns . The independent command of Holmes , called up from Aquia Creek , augmented his force to a little over 23,000 men and 35 guns . Instead of keeping this about the Manassas earth-works he bad brought it close down to the banks of Bull Run arid posted it along a line sQme eight miles in length , extending from the Manassas railroad to the stone bridge on the Warrenton turnpike , and guarding the five intermediate fords . The enemy retired from Centreville as Tyler approached that place ; and taking a light detachment to make a reconnaissance , he followed their main body toward the crossing of Bull Run at Blackburn 's Ford , near the center of Beauregard 's extended line . Tyler was under express orders to observe well the roads , but not to bring on an engagement. * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach , his reconnaissance became a skirmish , and calling up support , the skirmish became a preliminary battle . Before he was well aware of it 6o men had fallen , 2 exposed field-pieces had been with difficulty extricated , r regiment had retreated in confusion , and 3 others were deployed in line of battle , to make a new charge . At this point Tyler remembered his instructions and called off his troops . This engagement at Blackburn 's Ford , so apparently without necessity or advantage , greatly exasperated the men and officers engaged in it , and seriously chilled the fine spirit in which the army started on its march . The attacking detachment did not then know that the enemy had suffered equal loss and demoralization. t McDowell began his campaign with the purpose of turning the flank of the enemy on the south ; but the examinations made on the x8th satisfied him that the narrow roads and rough country in that direction made such a movement impracticable . When , in addition , he heard Tyler 's cannonade on the same day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report of that day 's engagement also seemed to prove it inexpedient to make a direct attack.t That night McDowell assembled his division commanders at Centreville and confidentially informed them that he had changed his original plan , and resolved to march northward and turn Beauregard 's left flank.t All of Friday , the x9th , and Saturday , the 20th , were spent in an effort of the engineers to find an unfortified ford over Bull Run in that direction ; and thus the main battle was postponed till Sunday , July 21 . During those two days , while McDowell 's army was refreshed by rest and supplied with rations , the strength of the enemy in his front was greatly increased . McDowell 's movement was based upon the understanding and promise that Patterson should hold Johnston in the Shenandoah Valley , and General Scott made every exertion to redeem this promise . On the *3th he directed Patterson to detain Johnston " in the valley of Winchester " ; and as the critical time approached , and hearing no official report from him for three whole days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not let the enemy amuse and delay you with a small force in front , whilst he re*nforces the Manassas Junction with his main body . " * And still more emphatically on the *8th , while the engagement of Blackburn 's Ford was being fought by McDowell 's troops : " I have certainly been expecting you to beat the enemy . If not , to hear that you had felt him strongly , or at least had occupied him by threats and demonstrations . You have been at least his equal , and , I suppose , superior in numbers . Has he not stolen a march and sent rednforcements toward ManaEsas Junction ? A week is enough to win victories . " Patterson was touched by the implied censure , and answered restively : " The enemy has stolen no march upon me . I have kept him actively employed , and by threats and reconnaissances in force have caused him to be reinforced . " But the facts did not bear out the assertion . He had been grossly outwitted , and the enemy was at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which * McDowell to Tyler , July iS , s86i . War Records . War Records . Scott to Patterson , July 17 , i86i .

Since the 9th of July his readiness to " offer battle , " or to " strike " when the proper moment should arrive , had oozed away . He became clamorous for reinforcements , and profuse of complaints . Making no energetic reconnaissance to learn the truth , and crediting every exaggerated rumor , he became impressed that he was " in face of an enemy far superior in numbers . " Understanding perfectly the nature and importance of his assigned task , and admitting in his dispatches that " this force is the key-stone of the combined movements " ; ambitious to perform a brilliant act , and commanding . abundant means to execute his plan , his courage failed in the trying moment . " To-morrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July 14 , " preparatory to the other movement . If an opportunity offers , I shall attack . " * Reaching Bunker Hill on the 15th , he was within nine miles of the enemy . His opportunity was at hand . Johnston had only 12,000 men all told ; Patterson , from i 8 , ooo to 22,000 . All that and the following day he must have been torn by conflicting emotions . He was both seeking and avoiding a battle . He had his orders written out for an attack . But it would appear that his chief of staff ; Fitz-John Porter , together with Colonels Abercrombie and Thomas , at the last moment persuaded him to change his mind . Making only a slight reconnaissance on the 16th , he late that night countermanded his orders , and on July 17 marched to Charlestown - nominally as a flank movement , but practically in retreat . Johnston , the Confederate commander , was at Winchester , in daily anticipation of Patterson 's attack , when at midnight of July 17 he received orders to go at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9 o'clock on the morning of the *8th his scouts brought him information that Patterson 's army was at Charlestown . Relieved thus unexpectedly from a menace of danger which otherwise he could neither have resisted nor escaped , he lost no time . At noon of the same day he had his whole effective force of 9000 men on the march ; by noon of Saturday , July 20 , 6ooo of them , with 20 guns , were in Beauregard 's camp at Bull Run , ready to resist McDowell 's attack . The Union army lay encamped about Centreville ; from there the Warrenton turnpike ran westward over a stone bridge , crossing Bull Run to Gainesville , several miles beyond . Unaware as yet that Johnston had joined Beauregard , McDowell desired to seize Gainesville , a station on the railroad , to pre * Patterson to Townsend , July 14 , i86i . War Records . VOL . XXXVI. - 4i. vent such a junction . The stone bridge was thought to be defended in force , besides being mined , ready to be blown up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information that Sudley Ford , two or three miles above , could be readily carried and crossed by an attacking column . On Saturday night , therefore , McDowell called his officers together and announced his plan of battle for the following day . Tyler 's division was ordered to advance on the Warrenton turnpike and threaten the stone bridge ; while Hunter and Heintzelman , with their divisions , should make a circuitous and secret night march , seize and cross Sudley Ford , and descending on the enemy 's side of Bull Run should carry the batteries at the stone bridge by a rear attack , whereby Tyler would be able to cross and join in the main battle . Beauregard , on his part , also planned an aggressive movement for that same Sunday morning . No sooner had Johnston arrived than he proposed that the Confederates should sally from their intrenchments , cross the five fords of Bull Run they were guarding , march by the various converging roads to Centreville , and surprise and crush the Union army in its camps . The orders for such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnston , as ranking officer , signed his approval of them in the gray twilight of Sunday morning . But it proved wasted labor . At sunrise Tyler 's signal guns announced the Union advance and attack . The original plan was thereupon abandoned , and Beauregard proposed a modification-to stand on the defensive with their left flank at the stone bridge , and attack with their right from the region of Blackburn 's Ford . This suggestion again Johnston adopted and ordered to be carried out . There had been confusion and delay in the outset of McDowell 's march , and the flanking route around by Sudley Ford proved unexpectedly long . Tyler 's feigned attack at the stone bridge was so feeble and inefficient that it betrayed its object ; the real attack by Hunter and Heintzelman , designed to begin at daylight , could not be made until near i r o'clock . The first sharp encounter took place about a mile north of the Warrenton turnpike ; some five regiments on each side being engaged . The rebels tenaciously held their line for an hour . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and regiments . Tyler 's division found a ford , and crossing Bull Run a short distance above the stone bridge , three of its brigades joined Hunter and Heintzelman . About 12 o'clock the Confederate line , composed mainly of Johnston 's troops , wavered and broke , and was swept back across and out of the valley of the Warrenton turnpike , and down the road // running southward from Sudley Ford to Manassas Junction . The commanders and other officers on both sides were impressed with the conviction that this conflict of the forenoon had decided the fortunes of the day . Beauregard 's plan to , make a counter-attack from his right flank against Centreville had failed through a miscarriage of orders ; and leaving Johnston at headquarters to watch the entire field , he hastened personally to endeavor to check the tide of defeat . Jackson , afterward known by the sobriquet of " Stonewall , " had already formed his fresh brigade , also of Johnston 's army , on the crest of a ridge half a mile south of the Warrenton turnpike . Other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a semicircular line of 12 regiments , 22 guns , and 2 companies of cavalry , strongly posted and well hidden in the edge of a piece of woods behind the screen of a thick growth of young pines . At half-past 2 o'clock in the afternoon , McDowell attacked this second position of the enemy with an immediately available force of about 14 regiments , 24 guns , and a single battalion of cavalry . Here the advantages of position were all strongly against him . The enemy was posted , concealed , and his artillery concentrated , while McDowell 's brigades were at the foot of the hill ; not only where the ascent must be made in open view , but where the nature of the ground rendered a united advance impossible . A series of successive and detached assaults followed . Two batteries were lost by mistaking a rebel for a Union regiment ; and because of the lax organization and want of discipline in the raw volunteer regiments , the strength of McDowell 's command melted away in a rapid demoralization and disintegration . The scales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when at 4 in the afternoon the remainder of Johnston 's army arrived , and seven fresh rebel regiments were thrown against the extreme right and partly in rear of the Union line . This heavy numerical overweight at a decisive time and place terminated the battle very suddenly . The abundant rumors that Johnston was coming to the help of Beauregard seemed verified ; and the Union regiments , ignorant of the fact that they had been successfully fighting part of his force all day , were now seized with a panic , and began by a common impulse to move in retreat . The suddenness of their victory was as unexpected to the rebel as to the Union commanders . Jefferson Davis , who had come from Richmond , arriving at Manassas at 4 o'clock , was informed that the battle was lost , and was implored by his companions not to endanger his personal safety by riding to the front . Nevertheless he persisted , and was overjoyed to find that the Union army had , by a sudden and unexplained impulse , half marched , half run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the line of retreat , and by sudden dashes picked up a large harvest of trophies in guns and supplies , but they dared not venture a serious attack ; and so unconvinced were they as yet of the final result , that that night the rebel commanders set a strong and vigilant guard in all directions against the expected return , and offensive operations , by McDowell next morning . The precaution was needless , for the Union army was so much demoralized that the commanders deemed it unsafe to make a stand at Centreville , where the reserves were posted ; and a rapid though orderly retreat was continued through the night , and until all organized regiments or fragments reached their old camps within the fortifications on the Potomac , and the scattered fugitives made their way across the river into the city of Washington . McDowell 's defeat was wholly due to Patterson 's inefficiency . He was charged with the task of defeating or holding Johnston in the Shenandoah Valley ; he had a double force with which to perform his task . Had he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been superior in numbers to Beauregard , and whose plans were in the main judicious , could easily have conquered . It was Johnston 's army , which Patterson had permitted to escape , that principally fought the battle of Bull Run and defeated McDowell. * Nor is there any good sense in that criticism which lays the blame upon General Scott and the Administration for not having first united the two Federal armies . The Administration furnished a superior force against Beauregard at Bull Run , and an overwhelming force against Johnston at Winchester , and assured victory in each locality by the only reliable condition - other things being equal - an excess of numbers . Had Patterson held his foe , as he might , and McI ) owell defeated Beauregard , as hewould have done , the capture of Johnston 's force between the two Federal armies was practically certain , as General Scott intended . t The following analysis of the forces engaged in the main and decisive phases of the actual fighting shows it conclusively : JOHN5TON 5 ARMY .

" It is known that a strong reinforcement left Winchester on the afternoon of the r8th , which you will also have to beat , " he telegraphed McDowell on the day of the battle , which it was then too late to countermand. * He also promised him immediate reinforcements . The confidence of the General-in-Chief remained unshaken , and he telegraphed McClellan : " McDowell is this forenoon forcing the passage of Bull Run . In two hours he will turn the Manassas Junction and storm it to-day with superior force . " t It may well be supposed that President Lincoln suffered great anxiety during that eventful Sunday ; but General Scott talked confidently of success , and Lincoln bore his impatience without any visible sign , and quietly went to church at i i o'clock . Soon after noon copies of telegrams began to come to him at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They brought , however , no certain information , as they came only from the nearest station to the battle-field , and simply gave what the operator saw and heard . Toward 3 o'clock they became more frequent , and reported considerable fluctuation in the apparent course and progress of the cannonade . The President went to the office of General Scott , where he found the general asleep , and woke him to talk over the news . Scott said such reports were worth nothing as indications either way - that the changes in the currents of wind and the variation of the echoes made it impossible for a distant listener to determine the course of a battle . He still expressed his confidence in a successful result , and composed himself for another nap when the President left . Dispatches continued to come about every ten or fifteen minutes , still based on hearing and hearsay . But the rumors grew more cheering and definite . They reported that the battle had extended along nearly the whole line ; that there had been considerable loss ; but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles , some of the dispatches said , to the Junction . One of General Scott 's aides now also came , bringing the telegram of an engineer , repeating that McDowell had driven the enemy before him , that he had ordered the reserves to cross Bull Run , and wanted reinforcements without delay4 The aide further stated substantially that the general was satisfied of the truth of this * Scott , Testimony , Committee onConduct of theWar. t Scott to McClellan , July 21 , i86i .

War Records . report , and that McDowell would immediately attack and capture the Junction , perhaps tonight , but certainly by to-morrow noon . Deeming all doubt at an end , President Lincoln ordered his carriage , and went out to take his usual evening drive . He had not yet returned when , at 6 o'clock , Secretary Seward came to the Executive Mansion , pale and haggard . " Where is the President ? " he asked hoarsely of the private secretaries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have you any late news ? " he continued . They read him the telegrams which announced victory . " Tell no one , " said he . " That is not true . The battle is lost . The telegraph says that McDowell is in full retreat , and calls on General Scott to save the capital . Find the President and tell him to come immediately to General Scott 's . " Half an hour later the President returned from his drive , and his private secretaries gave him Seward 's message - the first intimation he received of the trying news . He listened in silence , without the slightest change of feature or expression , and walked away to army headquarters . There he read the unwelcome report in a telegram from a captain of engineers : " General McDowell 's army in full retreat through Centreville . The day is lost . Save Washington and the remnants of this army . . . . The routed troops will not re-form . " * This information was such an irreconcilable contradiction of the former telegram that General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should report the army beyond Bull Run , driving the enemy and ordering up reserves , and another immediately report it three miles this side of Bull Run , in hopeless retreat and demoralization , seemed an impossibility . Yet the impossible had indeed come to pass ; and the apparent change of fortune had been nearly as sudden on the battle-field as in Washington . The President and the Cabinet met at General Scott 's office , and awaited further news in feverish suspense , until a telegram from McDowell confirmed the disaster . I ! Discussion was now necessarily turned to preparation for the future . All available troops were hurried forward to McDowell 's support ; Baltimore was put on the alert ; telegrams were sent to the recruiting stations of the nearest Northern States to lose no time in sending all their organized regiments to Washington ; McClellan was ordered to " come down to the Shenandoah Valley with such troops as can be spared from western Virginia . " f A great number of * Alexander , July 21 , i86i . War Records . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Records . Scott to McClellan , July 21 , i86i . War Records . // civilians , newspaper correspondents , and several senators and representatives had followed McDowell 's army to Centreville ; one of the latter , Mr. Ely of New York , went to the battle-field itself ; and was captured and sent for a long sojourn to Libby Prison in Richmond . Such of these non-combatants as had been fortunate enough to keep their horses and vehicles were the first to reach Washington , arriving about midnight . President Lincoln had by this time returned to the Executive Mansion , and reclining on a lounge in the Cabinet room he heard from several of these eye-witnesses their excited and exaggerated narratives , in which the rush and terror and unseemly stampede of lookers-on and army teamsters were altogether disproportionate and almost exclusive features . The President did not go to his bed that night ; morning found him still on his lounge in the Executive office , hearing a repetition of these recitals and making memoranda of his own comments and conclusions . As the night elapsed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispatch stated that he would hold Centreville .

They are now pouring through this place in a state of utter disorganization . . . . I think now , as all of my commanders thought at Centreville , there is no alternative but to fall back to the Potomac. " t Reports from other points generally confirmed the prevalence of confusion and disorganization . Monday morning the scattered fugitives reached the bridges over the Potomac , and began rushing across them into Washington . It was a gloomy and dismal day .

One of the principal reasons which prevented McDowell 's making a stand at Centreville or Fairfax Court House was the important fact that the term of service of the three-months ' militia , organized under President Lincoln 's first proclamation , was about to expire .

" j This vital consideration equally affected the armies at other points ; and bearing it , as well as the local exigency , in mind , the President and the Cabinet determined on several changes of army leadership . McDowell was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with fifteen regiments to defend and hold the forts . McClellan was called to Washington to take local command , and more especially to organize a new army out of the three-years ' regiments which were just beginning to come in from the various States . Patterson was only a three-months ' general , appointed by the governor of Pennsylvania ; his time expired , and he was mustered out of service . Banks was sent to Harper 's Ferry to succeed him . Dix was put in command at Baltimore , and Rosecrans in western Virginia . By noon of Monday the worst aspects of the late defeat were known ; and especially the reassuring fact that the enemy was making no pursuit ; and so far as possible immediate dangers were provided against . The War Department was soon able to reply to anxious inquiries from New York : Our loss is much less than was at first represented , and the troops have reached the forts in much better condition than we expected .

Compared with the later battles of the civil war , the battle of Bull Run involved but a very moderate loss tin men and material . Its political and moral results , however , were widespread and enduring . The fact that the rebel army suffered about equal damage in numbers of killed and wounded , and that it was crippled so as to be unable for months to resume the offensive , could not be immediately known . The flushed hope of the South magnified the achievement as a demonstration of Southern invincibility .

With the then personal government of France , and with the commercial classes whose influence always rules the government of England , it gained at once a scarcely disguised active sympathy . Upon the irritated susceptibilities , the wounded loyalty , the sanguine confidence of the North , the Bull Run defeat fell with a cruel bitterness . The eager hopes built on the victories of western Virginia were dashed to the ground . Here was a fresher and deeper humiliation than Sumter or Baltimore . But though her nerves winced , her will never faltered . She was both chastened and strengthened in the fiery trial . For the moment , however , irritation and disappointment found vent in loud complaint and blind recrimination . One or two curious incidents in this ordeal of criticism may perhaps be cited . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the White House with several Illinois members of Congress , in the presence of the President and the Secretary of War , General Scott himself was so far nettled by the universal chagrin and fault-finding that he lost his temper and sought an entirely uncalled-for self-justification . " Sir , I am the greatest coward in America , " said he . " I will prove it . I have fought this battle , sir , against my judgment ; I think the President of the United States ought to remove me to-day for doing it . As God is my judge , after my superiors haddetermined to fight it I did all in my power to make the army efficient . I deserve removal because I did not stand up , when my army was not in a condition for fighting , and resist it to the last . " The President said , " Your conversation seems to imply that I forced you to fight this battle . " General Scott then said , " I have never served a President who has been kinder to me than you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech in Congress related the scene , then drew the inference that Scott intended to pay a personal compliment to Mr. Lincoln , but that he did not mean to exonerate the Cabinet ; and when pressed by questions , further explained : " Let us have no misunderstanding about this matter . My colleagues understood that I gave the language as near as I could . Whether I have been correctly reported or not I do not know . If I did not then make the correct statement , let me do it now . I did not understand General Scott , nor did I mean so to be understood , as implying that the President had forced him to fight that battle . " * The mcident illustrates how easily history may be perverted by hot-blooded criticism . Scott 's petulance drove him to an inaccurate statement * " Globe , " July24 and Aug . I , i86i , pp.246 and 387. of events ; Richardson 's partisanship warped Scott 's error to a still more unjustifiable deduction , and both reasoned from a changed condition of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Richardson chafing at military inaction . The exact facts have already been stated . Scott advised against an offensive campaign into Virginia , but consented-was not forced  --  to prepare and direct it . He made success as certain as it ever can be made in war ; but the inefficiency of Patterson foiled his plan and preparation . Even then victory was yet possible and probable but for the panic , against which there is no safeguard , and which has been fatal to armies in all times and in all countries . Historical judgment of war is subject to an inflexible law , either very imperfectly understood or very constantly lost sight of . Military writers love to fight over the battles of history exclusively by the rules of the professional chess-board , always subordinating , often totally ignoring , the element of politics . This is a radical error . Every war is begun , dominated , and ended by political considerations ; without a nation , without a government , without money or credit , without popular enthusiasm which furnishes volunteers , or public support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no war - neither beginning nor end of methodical hostilities . War and politics , campaigns and statecraft , are Siamese twins , inseparable and interdependent ; and to talk of military operations without the direction and interference of an Administration is as absurd as to plan a campaign without recruits , pay , or rations . Applied to the Bull Run campaign , this law of historical criticism analyzes and fixes the relative responsibilities of government and commanders with easy precision . When Lincoln , on June 29 , assembled his council of war , the commanders , as military experts , correctly decided that the existing armies could win a victory at Manassas and a victory at Winchester . General Scott correctly objected that these victories , if won , would not be decisive ; and that in a military point of view it would be wiser to defer any offensive campaign until the following autumn . Here the President and the Cabinet , as political experts , intervened , and on their part decided , correctly , that the public temper would not admit of such a delay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Scott for the combined strategy of the two armies , McDowell for the conduct of the Bull Run battle , Patterson for the escape of Johnston , and Fate for the panic ; for the opposing forces were equally raw , equally undisciplined , and as a whole fought the battle with equal courage and gallantry . // But such an analysis of causes and such an apportionment of responsibilities could not be made by the public , or even by the best-informed individuals beyond Cabinet circles , in the first fortnight succeeding the Bull Run disaster . All was confused rumor , blind inference , seething passion . That the public at large and the touch-and-go newspaper writers should indulge in harsh and hasty language is scarcely to be wondered at ; but the unseemly and precipitate judgments and criticisms of those holding the rank of leadership in public affairs are less to be excused . Men were not yet tempered to the fiery ordeal of revolution , and still thought and spoke under the strong impulse of personal prejudice , and with that untamed and visionary extravagance which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That feeling , momentarily quelled and repressed by the rebel guns at Sumter , was now in danger of breaking out afresh . In illustration we need only to cite the words of prominent leaders in the three parties of the North , namely : Stanton , late Buchanan 's attorney-general , and destined soon to become famous as Lincoln 's War Secretary ; Richardson , who had been the trusted lieutenant of Douglas , and now , since Douglas was dead , the ostensible spokesman of the faction which had followed that leader ; and thirdly , Horace Greeley , exercising so prominent an influence upon the public opinion of the country through the columns of " The Tribune . " The Buchanan cabinet was still writhing under the odium which fell upon the late Administration , and much more severely upon the Breckinridge Democracy . Mr. Buchanan and his Cabinet were eager to seize upon every shadow of self-justification , and naturally not slow to emphasize any apparent shortcoming of their successors . Stanton , with his impulsive nature , was especially severe on the new President and Administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay in the members of Buchanan 's reconstructed Cabinet . Thus he wrote to his colleague Dix , on June ii , in language that resembled a stump speech of the presidential campaign : No one can imagine the deplorable condition of this city and the hazard of the Government , who did not witness the weakness and panic of the Administration , and the painful imbecility of Lincoln . We looked to New York in that dark hour as our only deliverance under Providence , and , thank God , it came . . . . But when we witness venality and corruption growing in power every day , and controlling the millions of money that should be a patriotic sacrifice for national deliverance , and treating the treasure of the nation as a booty to be divided among thieves , hope dies away : deliverance from this danger also must come from New York . . . . Of military affairs I can form no judgment . Every day affords fresh proof of the design to give the war a party direction . The army appointments appear ( with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons whose only claim is their Republicanism - broken-down politicians without experience , ability , or any other merit . Democrats are rudely repulsed , or scowled upon with jealous and ill-concealed aversion . The Western Democracy are already becoming disgusted , and between the corruption of some of the Republican leaders and the selfseeking ambition of others some great disaster may soon befall the nation . How long will the Democracy of New York tolerate these things ? . . . We hoped to see you here , especially after you had accepted the appointment of major-general . But now that the Administration has got over its panic , you are not the kind of man that would be welcome.5 This letter plainly enough shows Mr. Stanton 's attitude toward the new Administration . His letter of the following day to ex-President Buchanan reveals the state of feeling entertained by Dix : The recent appointments in the army are generally spoken of with great disapprobation . General Dix is very much chagrined with the treatment he has received from the War Department , and on Saturday I had a letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : General Dix is still here . He has been shamefully treated by the Administration . We are expecting a general battle to be commenced at Fairfax to-day , and conflicting opinions of the result are entertained . And once more , on July 26 : The dreadful disaster of Sunday can scarcely be mentioned . The imbecility of this Administration culminated in that catastrophe : an irretrievable misfortune and national disgrace , never to be forgotten , are to be added to the ruin of all peaceful pursuits and national bankruptcy as the result of Lincoln 's running the machine " for five months . You perceive that Bennett is for a change of the Cabinet , and proposes for one of the new Cabinet Mr. Holt . . . . It is not unlikely that some change in the War and Navy Departments may take place , but none beyond these two departments until Jefferson Davis turns out the whole concern . The capture of Washington seems now to be inevitable : during the whole of Monday and Tuesday it might have been taken without any resistance . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army is complete . Even now I doubt whether any serious opposition to the entrance of the Confederate forces could be offered . While Lincoln , Scott , and the Cabinet are disputing who is to blame , the city is unguarded and the enemy at hand . General McClellan reached here last evening . But if he had the ability of Cresar , Alexander , or Napoleon , what can he accomplish ? Will not Scott 's jealousy , Cabinet intrigues , Republican interference , thwart him at every step ? While hoping for the best , I can not shut my eyes against the dangers that beset the Government , and especially this city . It is certain that Davis was in the field on Sunday , and the secessionists here assert that he headed in person the last victorious charge . General Dix is in Baltimore . After three weeks ' neglect and insult he was sent there.t While Stanton and Dix were thus nursing their secret griefs on behalf of one of the late 5Dix , " Memoirs of John A. Dix. " // political factions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Democracy , was indulging in loud complaints for the other . Charging that the division of the Democratic party at Charleston had brought the present calamity upon the Union , he continued : This organization of the Breckinridge party was for the purpose of destroying the Government . That was its purpose and its object . What do we see ? Without the aid and cobperatiou of the men of the North that party was powerless . The men from the Northern States who aided and encouraged this organization which is in rebellion are at the head to-day of our army . Butler of Massachusetts , Dix of New York and Patterson of Pennsylvania , and Cadwalader - all of them in this movement to break down and disorganize the Democratic party and the country . Why is it ? This Douglas party furnished you one-half of your entire army . Where is your general , where is your man in command to-day who belongs to that party ? Why is this ? Have you Republicans sympathized with this Breckinridge party ? Are you sympathizing with them , and lending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misfortune and disgrace ? * Richardson was easily answered . A member correctly replied that these and other three-months ' generals had been selected by the governors of various States , and not by the President ; moreover , that Patterson had been specially recommended by General Scott , whom Richardson was eulogizing , and that there would be plenty of opportunity before the war was over for the Douglas men to win honors in the field . But all this did not soothe Richardson 's temper , which was roused mainly by his revived factional jealousy . Unjust fault-finding was to be expected from party opponents ; but it is not too much to say that it was a genuine surprise to the President to receive from a party friend , and the editor of the most influential newspaper in the Union , the following letter , conveying an indirect accusation of criminal indifference , and proposing an immediate surrender to rebellion and consent to permanent disunion : NEW YORK , Monday , July 29 , iSfis . Midnight . DEAR SiR : This is my seventh sleepless night - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall not die , because I have no right to die . I must struggle to live , however bitterly . But to business .

Do not fear to meet them . Can the rebels be beaten after all that has occurred , and in view of the actual state of feeling caused by our late , awful disaster ? If they can ,  --  and it is your business to ascertain and decide ,  - -  write me that such is your judgment , so that I may know and do my duty . And if they can not be beaten ,  - -  if our recent disaster is fatal ,  --  do not fear to sacrifice yourself to your country .

I pray you to decide quickly and let me know my duty . If the Union is irrevocably gone , an armistice for 30 , 6o , 90 , 120 days - better still for a year- ought at once to be proposed , with a view to a peaceful adjustment . Then Congress should call a national convention , to meet at the earliest possible day . And there should be an immediate and mutual exchange or release of prisoners and a disbandment of forces . I do not consider myself at present a judge of anything but the public sentiment . That seems to me everywhere gathering and deepening against a prosecution of the war . The gloom in this city is funereal ,  - -  for our dead at Bull Run were many , and they lie unburied yet . On every brow sits sullen , scorching , black despair . It would be easy to have Mr. Crittenden move any proposition that ought to be adopted , or to have it come from any proper quarter . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done - which is the measure of our duty , and do that very thing at the earliest moment . This letter is written in the strictest confidence , and is for your eye alone . But you are at liberty to say to members of your Cabinet that you know I will second any move you may see fit to make . But do nothing timidly nor by halves . Send me word what to do . I will live till I can hear it at all events . If it is best for the country and for mankind that we make peace with the rebels at once and on their own terms , do not shrink even from that . But bear in mind the greatest truth : " Whoso would lose his life for my sake shall save it . " Do the thing that is the highest right , and tell me how I am to second you . Yours , in the depths of bitterness , HORACE GREELEv.t These few citations are noteworthy , because of the high quarters whence they emanated and the subsequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They give us penetrating glimpses of how the Bull Run disaster was agitating the public opinion of the North . But it must not be hastily inferred that such was the preponderant feeling . The great tides of patriotism settled quickly back to their usual level . The army , Congress , and the people took up , a shade less buoyantly , but with a deeper energy , the determined prosecution of the war , and soon continued their cheerful confidence in the President , Cabinet , and military authorities . The war governors tendered more troops and hurried forward their equipped regiments ; the Administration pushed the organization of the long-term volunteers ; and out of the scattered debris of the Bull Run forces there sprang up that magnificent Army of the Potomac , which in a long and fluctuating career won such historic renown . Meanwhile , in this first shadow of defeat , President Lincoln maintained his wonted equipoise of manner and speech . A calm and resolute patience was his most constant mood ; to follow with watchfulness the details of the * Richardson , Speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unpublished Autograph MS. // accumulation of a new army was his most eager occupation . He smiled at frettings like those of Scott , Dix , and Richardson ; but letters like that of Greeley made him sigh at the strange weakness of human character . Such things gave him pain , but they bred no resentment , and elicited no reply . Already at this period he began the display of that rare ability in administration which enabled him to smooth mountains of obstacles and bridge rivers of difficulty in his control of men . From this time onward to the end of the war his touch was daily and hourly amidst the vast machinery of command and cobrdination in Cabinet , Congress , army , navy , and the hosts of national politics . To still the quarrels of factions , to allay the jealousies of statesmen , to compose the rivalries of generals , to soothe the vanity of officials , to prompt the laggard , to curb the ardent , to sustain the faltering , was a substratum of daily routine underlying the great events of campaigns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night following the battle of Bull Run , while Lincoln lay awake on a sofa in the Executive office , waiting to gather what personal information he could from the many officers and prominent civilians who were arriving at Washington after their flight from the battle-field , he already began sketching a pencil memorandum of the policy and military programme most expedient to be adopted in the new condition of affairs . This memorandum sketch or outline he added to from time to time during the succeeding days . On the 27th of July he seems to have matured his reflections on the late disaster , and with his own hand he carefully copied his memorandum in this completed form : JULY 23 , xSfii. i . Let the plan for making the blockade effective be pushed forward with all possible dispatch . 2 .

Let the forces in western Virginia act till furtber orders according to instructions or orders from General McClellan. 6 .

Let the forces late before Manassas , except the three-months ' men , be reorganized as rapidly as possible in their camps here and about Arlington . 8 . Let the three-months ' forces who decline to enter the longer service be discharged as rapidly as circumstances will permit . 9 . Let the new volunteer forces be brought forward as fast as possible ; and especially into the camps on the two sides of the river here . JULY 27 , i86i .

This done , a joint movement from Cairo on Memphis ; and from Cincinnati on east Tennessee. * FREMONT . MissouRi had been saved from organized rebellion , but the smell and blackness of insurrectionary fire were strong upon her . While Governor Jackson and General Price , flying from the battle of Boonville as fugitives , were momentarily helpless , they nevertheless had reasonable hope of quick support . Whatever of latent rebellion and secret military preparation existed were set in motion by the governor 's proclamation of June 12 and his order dividing the State into nine military districts and issuing commissions to a skeleton army under the provisions of the military bill passed by his rebel legislature before their expulsion from the capital by Lyon . Thus every one inclined to take up arms against the Union had the plausible excuse of authority and the guidance of a designated commander and rendezvous , and a simultaneous movement toward organization long preconcerted immediately began . Missouri is a large State . She had over 68 , ooo square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million souls ; a trifling percentage would yield a formidable force . The spirit and impulse of revolution were at fever heat , and all the fire of the Border-Ruffian days smoldered along the frontier . The governor 's brigadier-generals designated camps , and the hot-blooded country lads flocked to them , finding a charm of adventure in the very privations they were compelled to undergo . For half a year disloyalty had gone unpunished ; the recent reports of march and battle served rather to sharpen their zeal . Three railroads radiated from St. Louis - one toward the west , with its terminus at Sedalia ; one toward the south-west , with terminus at Rolla ; one toward the south , with terminus at Ironton . The first of these reached only about three-fourths , the last two scarcely half-way , across the State . Western Missouri , therefore , seemed beyond any quick reach of a military expedition from St. Louis . General Price , proceeding westward from Boonville , found one of these camps at Lexington ; the governor , proceeding southward , was attended by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MS. // tie of Boonville . With such following as each could gather both directed their course toward the Arkansas line , collecting adherents as they went . Their pathway was not entirely clear . Before leaving St. Louis , Lyon had sent an expedition numbering about twenty-five hundred , commanded by Sweeny , a captain of regulars , by rail to Rolla and thence by a week 's march to Springfield , from which point he had advanced a part of his force under Sigel to Carthage , near the extreme south-western corner of the State . Jackson and Price , having previously united their forces , thus found Sigel directly in their path . As they greatly outnumbered him , by the battle of Carthage , July * ,  --  a sharp but indecisive engagement ,  --  they drove him back upon Springfield , and effected a junction with the rebel force gathered in the north-western corner of Arkansas , which had already assisted them by demonstrations and by capturing one of Sigel 's companies . Delayed by the need of transportation , Lyon could not start from Boonville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The improvised forces of Jackson and Price , moving rapidly , because made up largely of cavalry , or , rather , unorganized horsemen , were far in advance of him , and had overwhelmed Sigel before Lyon was well on his way . Nevertheless he pushed ahead with energy , having called to him a detachment of regulars from Fort Leavenworth , and volunteers from Kansas numbering about 2200 . These increased his column to about 4600 men . By July 13 he was at Springfield , and with the forces he found there was at the head of an aggregate of between 7000 and 8ooo men . The Confederate authorities had ambitious plans for the West . They already possessed Arkansas ; the Indian Territory was virtually in their grasp ; Missouri they looked upon with somewhat confident eyes ; even the ultimate conquest of Kansas seemed more than a remote possibility . Nor were such plans confined to mere speculation . Major-General Polk was stationed at Memphis early in July to command the Mississippi region . The neutrality policy in Kentucky for the moment left the Tennessee contingent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made immediate preparations for a campaign in Missouri . On July * he reported to the Confederate government his purpose to send two strong columns into that State - one under McCulloch , of about 25,000 men , against Lyon at Springfield ; another , under Pillow and Hardee , to march upon Ironton in south-east Missouri , where he estimated they would collect h force of i8 , ooo . He wrote : They are directed to pass in behind Lyon 's force by land , or to proceed to St. Louis , seize it , and , taking VOL . XXXVI. - 42. possession of the boats at that point , to proceed up the river Missouri , raising the Missourians as they go ; and at such point as may appear most suitable to detach a force to cut off Lyon 's return from the west . . . . If , as I think , I can drive the enemy from Missouri with the force indicated , I will then enter Illinois and take Cairo in the rear on my return . * He was obliged a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jackson , he learned , to his chagrin , had exaggerated the available forces fully one-half. t Although he had already sent Pillow to New Madrid , he now " paused " in the execution of his plan ; and the rivalry of the various rebel commanders seems soon to have completely paralyzed it . The " neutrality " attitude of the governors of both Missouri and Kentucky greatly delayed the progress of the war in the West . The middle of June came before Lyon chased the rebels from Jefferson City , and in Kentucky open and positive military action was deferred till the first weeks of September . Meanwhile , however , it was felt that the beginning of serious hostilities was only a question of time . The Mississippi River was blockaded , commerce suspended , Cairo garrisoned and fortified , gun-boats were being built , regiments were being organized and sent hither and thither , mainly as yet to keep the neighborhood peace . In the East the several Virginia campaigns were in progress , and General Scott 's " anaconda " plan was well understood in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mississippi Valley sensitive and restless . The governors of the North-west met , and , by memorial and delegation , urged the Administration to make the Ohio line secure by moving forward and occupying advanced posts in Kentucky and Tennessee . Especially did they urge the appointment of a competent commander who could combine the immense resources of the West , and make them effective in a grand campaign southward to open the Mississippi . Almost universal public sentiment turned to John C. Fr6mont as the desired leader for this duty . He was about forty-eight years of age . As student , as explorer , as a prominent actor in making California a State of the Union , he had shown talent , displayed energy , and conquered success in situations of difficulty and peril . As senator for a brief term , his votes proved that the North could rely on his convictions and principles . As the presidential candidate of the Republican party in i8*6 , his name had broadened into national representative value . The post of honor then had brought him defeat . He might wellclaim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victory . Polk to Walker , July 23 , i86i . War Records . tWar Records . // The dash of romance in his career easily rekindled popular enthusiasm ; political sa* , acity indicated that he should be encouraged to change this popularity into armies , and lead them to military success in aid of the imperiled nation . The inclination of the Administration coincided with the sentiment of the people . Seward had proposed him for Secretary of War , and Lincoln mentioned him for the French mission ; but in the recent distribution of offices no place at once suitable to his abilities and adequate to his claims had been found available . This new crisis seemed to have carved out the work for the man . He had passed the previous winter in France , but upon the outbreak of rebellion at once returned to his country . On his arrival in the city of New York , about the ist of July , President Lincoln appointed him a major-general in the regular army , and on the 3d created the Western department , consisting of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mississippi and the Rocky Mountains , and placed it under his command , with headquarters at St. Louis . For a man whose genius could have risen to the requirements of the occasion it was a magnificent opportunity , an imperial theater . Unfortunately , the country and the Administration had overrated Frdmont 's abilities . Instead of proceeding at once to his post of duty , he remained in New York , absorbed largely in his personal affairs . Two weeks passed before he sent his letter of acceptance and oath of office . " Please proceed to your command without coming here , " telegraphed General Scott , two days later . Postmaster-General Blair testified : As soon as he was appointed , I urged him to go to his department . . . . The President questioned me every day about his movements . I told him so often that Fr*mont was off , or was going next day , according to my information , that I felt mortified when allusion was made to it , and dreaded a reference to the subject . Finally , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , descrihing the condition of his command , I felt justified in telegraphing General Fr6mont that he must go at once . But he remained till after Bull Run ; and even then , when he should have known the inspiration that would give the rebels , he traveled leisurely to St. Louis . " XVhen , on July 25 , he finally reached his headquarters , and formally assumed command , he did not find his new charge a bed of roses . The splendid military strength of the North-west was only beginning its development . Recruiting offices were full ; but commanders of departments and governors of States quarreled over the dribblets of arms and equipments remaining in the arsenals , and which were needed in a dozen places at once . * Committee on Conduct of the War . The educated and experienced officers and subalterns of the old regular army , familiar with organization and routine , did not suffice to furnish the needed brigadier-generals and colonels , much less adjutants , commissaries , quartermasters , and drill-sergeants . Error . extravagance , delay , and waste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniforms , arms , or rations ; sometimes without being mustered into service . Yet the latent resources were abundant in quantity and excellent in quality , and especially in the qualities of mind , ambition , earnestness , and talent competent through practical service to rise to every requirement of duty and sacrifice - genius which could lead , and patriotic devotion ready to serve , suffer , and die . What magnificent capabilities in those early Western volunteers ; what illustrious talent in those first regiments found by Fnimont and coming at his call ! - Lyon , Grant , Blair , McClernand , Pope , Logan , Schofield , Curtis , Sturgis , Palmer , Hurlbut , and a hundred others whose names shine on the records of the war , to say nothing of the thousands who , unheraldedr went gloriously to manful duty and patriotic death . The three weeks loitered away in New York already served to quadruple Fr*mont 's immediate task . Lyon had taken the field , and Blair had gone to Washington to take his seat in the special session of Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from headquarters of these two inspiring and guiding leaders . At three points in Fr6mont 's new department matters wore a threatening aspect . The plentiful seeds of rebellion sown by Governor Jackson throughout Missouri were springing up in noxious rankness . Amidst dominant loyalty existed a reckless and daring secession minority , unwilling to submit to the control of superior sentiment and force . Following the battle of Boonville there broke out in many parts of the State a destructive guerrilla warfare , degenerating into neighborhood and family feuds , and bloody personal reprisal and revenge , which became known under the term of " bushwhacking . ' Houses and bridges were burned , farms were plundered , railroads were obstructed and broken , men were kidnapped and assassinated . During the whole period of the war few organized campaigns disturbed the large territory of the State ; but disorder , lawlessness , crime , and almost anarchy were with difficulty repressed from beginnin0 to end . The local administration charged with the eradication of these evils was greatly embar*-rassed and often thwarted through the unfortunate jealousy and rivalry between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally sincere in their devotion to the Government , they paralyzed each other 's efforts by a blind opposition and recrimination . As events progressed these factions increased in their animosity toward each other , and their antagonistic attitude was continued throughout the whole war period . This conflict of local sentimentpersonal , political , and military- produced no end of complications requiring the repeated direct interference of President Lincoln , and taxed to the utmost his abounding forbearance . Neighborhood troubles were growing in northern Missouri before Fr*mont left New York ; and Lyon 's adjutant selected Brigadier-General Pope to take command there and restore order . Fr6mont gave the permission by telegraph ; and when he reached St. Louis , General Pope had eight Illinois regiments employed in this duty. * Fr6mont 's second point of difficulty was the strong report of danger to Cairo . The rebel general Polk , at Memphis , was in the midst of his preparations for his Missouri campaign , already mentioned . About the time of Fremont 's arrival Pillow had just moved six thousand Tennesseeans to New Madrid , and reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dutch hunt . ' " News of this movement , and the brood of wild rumors which it engendered , made General Prentiss , the Union commander at Cairo , exceedingly uneasy , and he called urgently for assistance . Cairo , the strategic key of the whole Mississippi Valley , was too important to be for a moment neglected ; and in a few days after his arrival Fr*mont gathered the nearest available reinforcements , about eight regiments in all , and , loading them on a fleet of* steamboats , led them in person in a somewhat ostentatious expedition to Cairo ; and the demonstration , greatly magnified by rumor , doubtless had much influence in checking the hopes of the rebel commanders for an early capture of Missouri and Illinois . The rednforcement of Cairo was very proper as a measure of precaution . It turned out , however , that the need was much less urgent than Fr6mont 's third point of trouble , namely , * General Pope , under date of August 3 , makes a graphic statement of the methods of the bushwhackers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I could learn , were a few reckless and violent men in parties of twenty or thirty , who were wandering ahout , committing depredations upon all whose sentiments were displeasing , and keeping this whole region in apprehension and uneasiness . . . .

When troops were sent 295 the safety of Lyon at Springfield , in southwestern Missouri . When Lyon left St. Louis he had conceived this campaign to the south* west , not merely to control that part of the State and to protect it against invasion , but also with the ultimate hope of extending his march into Arkansas . For this he . knew his force in hand was inadequate ; but he believed that from the troops being rapidly organized in the contiguous free States he would receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have seen that he reached Springfield with an aggregate of about 7000 or 8ooo men . It was , for those early days , a substantial , compact little army , somewhat seasoned , well commanded , self-reliant , and enthusiastic . Unfortunately it also , like the armies at every other point , was under the strain and discouragement of partial dissolution . The term of enlistment of the threemonths ' militia regiments , raised under the President 's first proclamation , was about to expire . In every detachment , army , and at every post , throughout the whole country , there occurred about the middle of July , i86i , the incident of quick succession of companies and regiments going out of the service . Many of these corps immediately reorganized under the three-years ' call ; many remained temporarily in the field to take part in some impending battle . But despite such instances of generous patriotism , there was at all points a shrinkage of numbers , an interval of disorganization , a paralysis of action and movement . On the whole , therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was 120 miles from a railroad ; provisions and supplies had not arrived as expected ; half his army would within a brief period be mustered out of service ; McClellant was in western Virginia , Fr6mont in New York , Blair in Washington . He scarcely knew who commanded , or where to turn . The rebels were in formidable force just beyond the Arkansas line . The dispatches at this juncture take on an almost despairing tone . All idea of any farther advance movement , or of even maintaining our present position , must soon he abandoned , unless the Government furnish us promptly out against these marauders , they found only men quietly working in the field or sitting in their offices , who , as soon as the hacks of the Federal soldiers were turned , were again in arms and menacing the peace .

None of them have as yet been paid . * Two days later Lyon wrote : If it is the intention to give up the West , let it be so ; it can - only be the victim of imbecility or malice . Scott will cripple us if he can . Can not you stir up this matter and secure us relief ? See Frdmont , if he has arrived . The want of supplies has crippled me so that I can not move , and I do not know when I can . Everything seems to combine against me at this point . Stir up Blair . t Lyon 's innuendoes against the Administration and against General Scott were alike unjust . Both were eager to aid him , but there was here , as elsewhere , a limit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Appointed by the President on July i , he had not even sent his official acceptance till the i6th , the day before Lyon wrote this appeal ; and , after final and emphatic urging by Postmaster-General Blair , it was the 25th before he entered on his duties at St. Louis . Three special messengers from Lyon awaited him on his arrival , and repeated the tale of need and of danger . But Fremont listened languidly and responded feebly . Urgent calls indeed came to him from other quarters . As already stated , Cairo was represented to be seriously threatened , and he had chosen first to insure its safety . He had the means , by a judicious rearrangement of his forces , to have aided effectually both these exposed points . Under the critical conditions fully pointed out to him , he could at least have recalled Lyon and assisted his safe withdrawal to his railroad base at Rolla . But he neither recalled him nor substantially rednforced him . Two regiments were set in motion toward him , but it proved the merest feint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in season to be of the slightest service . Lyon 's danger lay in a junction of the various rebel leaders just beyond the Arkansas line . The Confederate government had sent Brigadier-General McCulloch to conciliate or conquer the Indian Territory as events might dictate , and had given him three regiments-one from Louisiana , one from Texas , and one from Arkansas - for the work . Finding it bad policy for the present to occupy the Indian Territory , he hovered about the border with permission to move into either Kansas or Missouri . Even before Polk 's ambitious programme was found to be impracticable , McCulloch made haste to organize a campaign on his own account . On July 30 he reported that he was on his way toward Springfield with his own * Schofield to Harding , July i5 , s86i . War Records . t Lyon to Harding , July 17 , i86i . War Records . brigade of 3200 troops , the command of General Pearce , with 2500 Arkansas State troops , and the somewhat heterogeneous gathering of Missourians under Price , which he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but badly commanded , and armed only with common rifles and shotguns . It was the approach of this large force which had given Lyon such uneasiness , and with good cause . Moving steadily upon him , they soon approached so near that his position became critical . His own command had dwindled to less than five thousand effective men ; the combined enemy had nearly treble that number of effectives , and probably more than three to one , counting the whole mass . If he remained stationary , they would slowly envelop and capture him . If he attempted to retreat through the 120 miles of barren mountainous country which lay between him and Rolla , they would follow and harass him and turn his retreat into a rout . Counting to the last upon re*inforcements which did not come , he had allowed events to place him in an untenable position . As a final and desperate resource , and the only one to save his army , he resolved to attack and cripple the enemy . As at Bull Run , and as so often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9 , were under orders to advance that night and attack each other . Some showers of rain in the evening caused McCulloch temporarily to suspend his order ; but Lyon 's little army , moving at nightfall , marched ten miles south of Springfield to Wilson 's Creek . At midnight they halted for a brief bivouac . Dividing into two columns they fell upon the enemy 's camp at daylight , Sigel , with 1200 men and a battery , marching against their right flank , in an enendeavor to get to the rear , while Lyon in person led the remaining 3700 men , with two batteries , to a front attack against their left center . The movement was a most daring one , and the conflict soon became desperate . Sigel 's attack , successful at first , was checked , his detachment put to flight , and * of his 6 guns captured and turned against Lyon . Lyon , on the contrary , by an impetuous advance , not only quickly drove the enemy out of their camp , but gained and occupied a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His mixed force of regulars and volunteers fought with admirable codperation . McCulloch , confident . in his overwhelming numbers , sent forward line after line of attack , which Lyon 's xvell-posted regular batteries threw back . The forenoon was already well spent when a final unusually heavy assault from the enemy was thus repulsed , largely by help of the inspiriting per- // sonal example of Lyon himself , who led some fragments of reserves in a bayonet charge . The charge ended the conflict ; but it also caused the fall of the commander , who , pierced by a ball , almost immediately expired . It was his fourth wound received in the action . Though the battle was substantially won , Sturgis , upon whom the command devolved , deemed it too hazardous to attempt to hold the field , and a retreat to Springfield was agreed upon by a council of officers . An unmolested withdrawal was effected in the afternoon , and upon further consultation a definite retreat upon Rolla was begun the following day . As Lyon had anticipated , the enemy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had 223 killed , 721 wounded , and 291 missing . The Confederate loss was 265 killed , 8cc wounded , and 30 missing . The battle of Wilson 's Creek , the death of Lyon , and the retreat of the army to Rolla turned public attention and criticism sharply upon Fr*mont 's department and administration , and that commander was suddenly awakened to his work and responsibility . He now made haste to dispatch reinforcements to Rolla , and sent urgent telegrams for help to Washington and to the governors of the neighboring free States . His new energy partook a little too much of the character of a panic .. He declared martial law in the city of St. Louis , and began an extensive system of fortifications ; which , together with directions to fortify Rolla , Jefferson City , and several other places , pointed so much to inaction , and a defensive policy , as to increase rather than allay public murmur . His personal manners and methods excited still further and even deeper dissatisfaction . A passion for display and an inordinate love of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established his headquarters in an elegant mansion belonging to a wealthy secessionist ; his personal staff consisted largely of foreigners , new to the country , and unfamiliar with its language and laws . Their fantastic titles and gay trappings seemed devised for show rather than substantial service . He organized a special body-guard . Sentinels and subordinates unpleasantly hedged the approach to his offices . Instead of bringing order into the chaotic condition of military business , he was prone to set method and routine at defiance , issuing commissions and directing the giving out of contracts in so irregular a way as to bring a protest from the proper accounting officers of the Government . Though specially requested by the President to cooperate with the provisional governor , he continued to ignore him . A storm of coatplaint soon arose from all except the little knot of flatterers who abused his favor and the newspapers that were thriving on his patronage . The Unionists of Missouri became afraid that he was neglecting the present safety of the State for the future success of his intended Mississippi expedition , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose to imitate the scheme of Aaron Burr and set up an independent dictatorship in the West. * Reports came to President Lincoln from multiplied sources , bringing him a flood of embarrassment from the man to whom he had looked with such confidence for administrative aid and military success . It was his uniform habit , when he had once confided command and responsibility to an individual , to sustain him in the trust to the last possible degree . While he heard with pain the cumulating evidence of Fr6mont 's unfitness , instead of immediately removing him from command , he sought rather to remedy the defect . In this spirit he wrote the following letter to General Hunter , which letter peculiarly illustrates his remarkable delicacy in managing the personal susceptibilities of men : Mv DEAR SIR : General Frdmont needs assistance which it is difficult to give him . He is losing the confidence of men near him , whose support any man in his position must have to he successful . His cardinal mistake is that he isolates himself , and allows nobody to see him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on in the very matter he is dealing with . He needs to have by his side a man of large experience . Will you not , for me , take that place ? Your rank is one grade too high to be ordered to it ; but will you not serve the country and oblige me by taking it voluntarily ? With this letter of the President , Postmaster-General Blair-hitherto Fr6mont 's warm personal friend - and Meigs , the quartermaster-general of the army , went to St. Louis , to make a brief inspection and report of matters , and to give friendly advice and admonition to the commander of the Department of then West . While they were on their way , Mrs. Fr*mont was journeying toward Washington , bearing her husband 's reply to a letter from the President sent him by special messenger about a week before . Her mind was less occupied with the subject of the missive she bore than with the portent of a recent quarrel which the general had imprudently allowed to grow up between Colonel Frank Blair and himself . Blair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in public print sharply criticised his doings . Indeed , the quarrel soon progressed so far that Fr6mont placed him under arrest ; then Blair preferred formal charges against the general for maladministration , and Meigs , Diary . MS . Lincoln to Hunter , Sept. 9 , i86i . Unpublished MS. // the general in turn entered formal countercharges against Blair . Arrived at her destination Mrs. Fr6mont took the opportunity , in her interview with Mr. Lincoln , to justify General Fr6mont in all he had done , and to denounce his accusers with impetuous earnestness . She even asked for copies of confidential correspondence concerning her husband 's personal embroilment . In these circumstances it was no light task for Mr. Lincoln to be at once patient , polite , and just ; yet the following letter will testify that he accomplished even this difficult feat : WASHINGTON , D. C. , Sept. 12 , i86i . MRS . GENERAL FRtMONT . MY DEAR MADAM : Your two notes of to-day are before me . I answered the letter you bore me from General Frdmont , on yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sent the answer to him by mail . It is not exactly correct , as you say you were told by the elder Mr. Blair , to say that I sent PostmasterGeneral Blair to St. Louis to examine into that department and report . Postmaster-General Blair did go , with my approbation , to see and converse with General Frdmont as a friend . I do not feel authorized to furnish you with copies of letters in my possession , without the consent of the writers . No impression has been made on my mind against the honor or integrity of General Fuimont , and I now enter my protest against being understood as acting in any hostility towards him . Your obedient servant , A. LINcoLN. * It will be interesting to read in addition a graphic , verbal recapitulation of these incidents , made by President Lincoln in a confidential evening conversation with a few friends in the Executive office a little more than two years afterward , and which one of his secretaries recorded : The Blairs have to an unusual degree the spirit of clan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope and pride . They have a way of going with a rush for anything they undertake ; especially have Montgomery and the old gentleman . When this war first began they could think of nothing but Frdmont ; they expected everything from him , and upon their earnest solicitation he was made a general and sent to Missouri . I thought well of Frfmont . Even now I think well of his impulses . I only think he is the prey of wicked and designing men , and I think he has absolutely no military capacity . He went to Missouri the pet and protdgd of the Blairs . At first they corresponded with him and with Frank , who was with him , fully and confidentially , thinking his plans and his efforts would accomplish great things for the country . At last the tone of Frank 's letters changed . It was a change from confidence to doubt and uncertainty . They were pervaded with a tone of sincere sorrow and of fear that Frdmont would fail .

She sought an audience with me at midnight , and tasked me so violently with many things , that I had to exercise all the awkward tact I have to avoid quarreling with her . She surprised me by asking why their enemy , Montgomery Blair , had been sent to Missouri . She more than once intimated that if General Frdmont should decide to try conclusions with me , he could set up for himself.t MILITARY EMANCIPATION . NOT only President Lincoln , but the country at large as well , was surprised to find , in the newspapers of August 30 , a proclamation from the commander of the Department of the West of startling significance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and its mandatory orders so vaguely framed as to admit of dangerous variance in interpretation and enforcement . Reciting the disturbed condition of society , and defining theboundaries of army occupation , it contained the following important decrees : Circumstances , in my judgment of sufficient urgency , render it necessary that the commanding general of this department should assume the administrative powers of the State . . . . In order , therefore , to suppress disorder , to maintain as far as now practicable the public peace , and to give security and protection to the persons and property of loyal citizens , I do hereby extend and declare established martial law throughout the State of Missouri . . . . All persons who shall be taken with arms in their hands within these lines shall be tried by court-martial , and , if found guilty , will be shot . The property , real and personal , of all persons in the State of Missouri directly proven to have taken an active part with their enemies in the field is declared to be confiscated to the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are hereby declared freemen . . . . The object of this declaration is to place in the hands of the military authorities the power to give instantaneous effect to existing laws , and to supply such deficiencies as the conditions of war demand . But this is not intended to suspend the ordinary tribunals of the country , where the law will be administered by the civil officers in the usual manner , and with their customary authority , while the same can be peaceably exercised . * Despite its verbiage and confusion of subjects , it was apparent that this extraordinary document was not a measure of military protection , but a political manouvre . Since the first movement of the armies the slavery question had become a subject of new and vital contention , and the antislavery drift of public opinion throughout the North was tinmistakably manifest . There was no room for doubt tbat General Fr*mont , apprehensive about his loss of prestige through the disaster to Lyon and the public clamors growing out of his mistakes and follies in administration , had made this appeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of regaining his waning popularity . Full confirmation was afforded by his immediately convening under his * Unpublished MS . Unpublished MS. * Fr*mont , Proclamation .

As soon as an authentic text of the proclamation reached President Lincoln , he wrote and dispatched the following letter : WASHINGTON , D. C. , Sept. 2 , s86i . MAJOR-GENERAL FR*MONT . Mv DEAR SIR : Two points in your proclamation of August 30 give me some anxiety : First . Should you shoot a man , according to the proclamation , the Confederates would very certainly shoot our best men in their hands in retaliation ; and so , man for man , indefinitely . It is , therefore , my order that you allow no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my approbation or consent . Second . I think there is great danger that the closing paragraph , in relation to the confiscation of property and the liberating slaves of traitorous owners , will alarm our Southern Union friends and turn them against us ; perhaps ruin our rather fair prospect for Kentucky . Allow me , therefore , to ask that you will , as of your own motion , modify that paragraph so as to conform to the first and fourth sections of the act of Congress entitled , " An act to confiscate property used for insurrectionary purposes , " approved August 6 , i86i , and a copy of which act I herewith send you . This letter is written in a spirit of caution , and not of censure . I send it by special messenger , in order that it may certainly and speedily reach you . Yours very truly , A. LINcoLN.t It was the reply to the above which the general sent to Washington by the hand of Mrs. Fr*mont , and which contained a very lame apology for the dictatorial and precipitate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have your confidence , I have been leaving it to events themselves to show you whether or not 1 w-as shaping affairs here according to your ideas . The shortest communication between Washington and St. Louis generally involves two days , and the employment of two days in time of war goes largely towards success or disaster . I therefore went along according to my own judgment , leaving the result of my movements to justify me with you . And so in regard to my proclamation of the 30th . Between the rebel armies , the Provisional Government , and home traitors , I felt the position bad and saw danger . In the night I decided upon the proclamation and the form of it . I wrote it the next morning and printed it the same day . I did it without consultation or advice with any one , acting solely with my best judgment to serve the country and yourself , and perfectly willing to receive the amount of censure which should be thought due if I had made a false movement . This is as much a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going into these I shall have to act according to my judgment of the ground before me , as I did on this occasion . If , upon reflection , your better judgment still decides that I am wrong in the article respecting * " Rebellion Record . " t War Records . the liberation of slaves , I have to ask that you will openly direct me to make the correction . The implied censure will he received as a soldier always should the reprimand of his chief . if I were to retract of my own accord , it would imply that I myself thought it wrong , and that I had acted without the reflection which the gravity of the point demanded . But I did not . I acted with full deliberation , and upon the certain conviction that it was a measure right and necessary , and I think so still . In regard to the other point of the proclamation to which you refer , I desire to say that I do not think the enemy can either misconstrue or urge anything against it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men who shall rise in arms against an army in the military occupation of a country is merely a necessary measure of defense , and entirely according to the usages of civilized warfare . The article does not at all refer to prisoners of war , and certainly our enemies have no ground for requiring that we should waive in their benefit any of the ordinary advantages which the usages of war allow to us . Fr6mont thus chose deliberately to assume a position of political hostility to the President . Nevertheless Mr. Lincoln , acting still in his unfailing spirit of dispassionate fairness and courtesy , answered as follows : WASHINGTON , Sept. ii , x86m . MAJOR-GENERAL JOHN C. FRIlMONT . SIR : Yours of the 8th in answer to mine of the 2d instant is just received . Assuming that you , upon the ground , could better judge of the necessities of your position than I could at this distance , on seeing your proclamation of August 30 I perceived no general objection to it . The particular clause , however , in relation to the confiscation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be objectionable in its nonconformity to the act of Congress passed the 6th of last August upon the same subjects ; and hence I wrote you , expressing my wish that that clause should be modified accordingly . Your answer , just received , expresses the preference on your part that I should make an open order for the modification , which I very cheerfully do . It is therefore ordered that the said clause of said proclamation be so modified , held , and construed as to conform to , and not to transcend , the provisions on the same subject contained in the act of Congress entitled , " An act to confiscate property used for insurrectionary purposes , " approved August 6 , i86i , and that said act be published at length , with this order . Your obedient servant , A. LINcOLN*S As might have been expected , Fr*mont 's proclamation of military emancipation , and Lincoln 's order revoking it , produced a fresh and acrimonious discussion of the slavery question . The incident made the name of Fr6mont a rallying cry for men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised him to the position of a new party leader . The vital relation of slavery to the rebellion was making itself felt to a degree which the great body of the people , so long trained to a legal tolerance of the evil , could not yet bring themselves to acknowledge . Men hitherto conservative and prudent were swept along by the relentless logic of the nation 's calamity * Frdmont to Lincoln , Sept. 8 , m86i . War Records . * War Records . // to a point where they were ready at once to accept and defend measures of even the last necessity for the nation 's preservation . With admirable prudence Lincoln himself added nothing to the public discussion , but a confidential letter written to a conservative friend who approved and defended Frimont 's action will be found of enduring interest . EXECUTIVE MANSION , WASHINGTON , Sept. 22 , i86i. lION . 0 . H. BROWNING . Mv DEAR SIR : Yours of the 17th is just received ; and coming from you , I confess it astonishes me . That you should object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assisted in making , and presenting to me , less than a month before , is odd enough . But this is a very small part . General Fr6mont 's proclamation , as to confiscation of property , and the liberation of slaves , is purely political , and not within the range of military law or necessity . If a commanding general finds a necessity to seize the farm of a private owner , for a pasture , an encampment , or a fortification , he has the right to do so , and to so hold it , as long as the necessity lasts ; and this is within military law , because within military necessity . But to say the farm shall no longer belong to the owner , or his heirs forever , and this , as well when the farm is not needed for snilitary purposes as when it is , is purely political , without the savor of military law about it . And the same is true of slaves . If the general needs them he can seize them and use them , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to fix their permanent future condition . That must be settled according to laws made by lawmakers , and not by military proclamations . The proclamation in the point in question is simply " dictatorship . " It assumes that the general may do anything he pleases - confiscate the lands and free the slaves of loyal people , as well as of disloyal ones . And going the whole figure , I have no doubt , would be more popular , with some thoughtless people , than that which has been done ! But I can not assume this reckless position , nor allow others to assume it on my responsibility . You speak of it as being the only means of saving the Government . On the contrary , it is itself the surrender of the Government . Can it be pretended that it is any longer the Government of the United States - any government of constitution and laws - wherein a general or a president may make permanent rules of property by proclamation ? I do not say Congress might not , with propriety , pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fr*mont proclaimed . I do not say I might not , as a member of - Congress , vote for it . What I object to is , that I , as President , shall expressly or impliedly seize and exercise the permanent legislative functions of the Government . So much as to principle . Now as to policy . No doubt the thing was popular in some quarters , and would have been more so if it had been a general declaration of emancipation . The Kentucky legislature would not budge till that proclamation was modified ; and General Anderson telegraphed me that on the news of General Fr*mont having actually issued deeds of manumission , a whole company of our volunteers threw down their arms and disbanded . I was so assured as to think it probable that the very arms we had furnished Kentucky would be turned against us . I think to lose Kentucky is nearly the same as to lose the whole game . Kentucky gone , we can not hold Missouri , nor , as I think , Maryland . These all against us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . We would as well consent to separation at once , including the surrender of this capital . On the contrary , if you will give up your restlessness for new positions , and back me manfully on the grounds *upon which you and other kind friends gave me the election , and have approved in my public documents , we shall go through triumphantly . You must not understand I took my course on the proclamation because of Kentucky . I took the same ground in a private letter to General Fr*mont before I heard from Kentucky . You think I am inconsistent because I did not also forbid General Fr*mont to shoot men under the proclamation . I understand that part to be within military law , but I also think , and so privately wrote General Fr*mont , that it is impolitic in this , that our adversaries have the power , and will certainly exercise it , to shoot as many of our men as we shoot of theirs . I did not say this in the public letter , because it is a subject I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There has been no thought of removing General Fr*mont on any ground connected with his proclamation , and if there has been any wish for his removal on any ground , our mutual friend Sam . Glover can probably tell you what it was . I hope no real necessity for it exists on any ground . Your friend , as ever , A. LINcoLN . " The reader will not fail to note that the argument of this letter seems diametrically opposed to the action of the President , when , exactly one year later , he issued his preliminary Proclamation of Emancipation , as well as to that of the final one , on the first day of January , 1863 . Did Mr. Lincoln change his mind in the interim ? The answer is two-fold . He did not change his mind as to the principle ; he did change his mind as to the policy of the case . Rightly to interpret Mr. Lincoln 's language we must imagine ourselves in his position , and examine the question as it presented itself to his mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had authorized him to cause property used or employed in aid of insurrection to be " seized , confiscated , and condemned " ; providing , however , that such condemnation should be by judicial proceeding . He saw that Fr*mont by mere proclamation assumed to confiscate all property , both real and personal , of rebels in arms , whether such property had been put to insurrectionary use or not , and , going a step further , had annexed a rule of property , by decreeing that their slaves should become free . This assumption of authority . Lincoln rightly defined as " simply dictatorship , " and as being , if permitted , the end of constitutional government . The casc is still stronger when we remember that Fr&amp; mont 's proclamation began by broadly assuming " the administrative powers of the State " ; that its declared object was mere individual punishment , and the measure a local police regulation to suppress disorder and maintain the peace ; also that it was to operate throughout Missouri , as well within as without the " MS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1882 , " pp. 40 , 41. // portions of the State under his immediate military control . Military necessity , therefore , could not be urged in justification . The act was purely administrative and political . The difference between these extra-military decrees of Fr6mont 's proclamation and Lincoln 's acts of emancipation is broad and essential . Fr6mont 's act was one of civil administration , Lincoln 's a step in an active military campaign ; Fr6mont 's was local and individual , Lincoln 's national and general ; Fr6mont s partly within military lines , Lincoln 's altogether beyond military lines ; Fr6mont 's an act of punishment , Lincoln 's a means of war ; Fr6mont 's acting upon property , Lincoln 's acting upon persons . National law , civil and military , knew nothing of slavery , and did not protect it as an institution . It only tolerated State laws to that effect , and only dealt with fugitive slaves as " persons held to service . " Lincoln did not , as dictator , decree the abrogation of these State laws ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rebellion to the military aid of the Union , he , as Commander-in-Chief ; armed by military necessity , proclaimed that persons held as slaves within rebel lines should on a certain day become free unless rebellion ceased . Thus no real distinction of principle exists between his criticism of Fr6mont 's proclamation and the issuing of his own . On the other hand , there is a marked and acknowledged change of policy between the date of the Browning letter and the date of his preliminary Emancipation Proclamation . In September , i86i , he stood upon the position laid down in the Chicago platform ; upon that expressed in the constitutional amendment and indorsed in his inaugural ; upon that declared by Congress in July , in the Crittenden resolution , namely : that the General Government would not interfere directly or indirectly with the institution of slavery in the several States . This policy Lincoln undertook in good faith to carry out , and he adhered to it so long as it was consistent with the safety of the Government . His Browning letter is but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it military necessity was clearly against military emancipation , either local or general . The revocation of Fr6mont 's decree saved Kentucky to the Union , and placed forty thousand Kentucky soldiers in the Federal army . But one year after the date of the Browning letter , the situation was entirely reversed . The Richmond campaign had utterly failed ; Washington was menaced ; the country was despondent ; and military necessity now justified the policy of general military emancipation . Whatever temporary popularity Fr6mont VOL . XXXVI. - 43. gained with antislavery people by his proclamation was quickly neutralized by the occurrence of a new military disaster in his department . The battle of Wilson 's Creek and the retreat of the Union army to Rolla left the Confederate forces master of south-west Missouri . The junction of rebel leaders , however , which had served to gain that advantage was of short duration . Their loosely organized and badly supplied army was not only too much crippled to follow the Union retreat , but in no condition to remain together . Price , as majorgeneral of Missouri State forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve under McCulloch , holding but a brigadier-general 's commission from Jefferson Davis . Both the disagreement of the leaders and the necessities of the troops almost immediately compelled a separation of the rebel army . General Pearce with his Arkansas State forces returned home , and General McCulloch with his three Confederate regiments also marched back into Arkansas , taking up again his primary task of watching the Indian Territory . General Price held his numerous but heterogeneous Missouri followers together , and , busying himself for a time in gathering supplies , started back in a leisurely march northward from Springfield toward the Missouri River . The strong secession feeling of south-western Missouri rapidly increased his force , liberally furnished him supplies , and kept him fully informed of the numbers and location of the various Union detachments . There were none in his line of march till he neared the town of Lexington , on the Missouri River . The rebel governor , Jackson , had recently convened the rebel members of his legislature here , but a small Union detachment sent from Jefferson City occupied the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great seal of the State , brought by the governor in his flight from the capital . About the ist of September the Union commander at Jefferson City heard of the advance of Price , and sent forward the Chicago Irish Brigade under Colonel Mulligan to reinforce Lexington , with directions to fortify and hold it . Mulligan reached Lexington by forced marches , where he was soon joined by the Union detachment from Warrensburg retreating before Price . The united Federal force now numbered 2800 men , with 8 guns Price pushed forward his cavalry , and made a slight attack on the 12th , but was easily repulsed and retired to await the arrival of his main body , swelled by continual accessions to some 20,000 with 13 guns ; and on the *8th he again approached and formally laid siege to Lexington . Mulligan made good use of this interim , // gathering provisions and forage , casting shot , making ammunition for his guns , and inclosing the college building and the hill on which it stood , an area of some fifteen acres , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the *8th , but for two days made little headway . Slowly , however , he gained favorable positions ; his sharp-shooters , skilled riflemen of the frontier , drove the Federals into their principal redan , cut off their water supply by gaining and occupying the river shore , and finally adopted the novel and effective expedient of using movable breastworks , by gradually rolling forward bales of wet hemp . On September 20 , after fifty-two hours of gallant defense , Mulligan 's position became untenable . The reinforcements he had a right to expect did not come , his water cisterns were exhausted , the stench from dead animals burdened the air about his fort . Some one at length , without authority , displayed a white flag , and Price sent a note which asked , " Colonel , what has caused the cessation of the fight ? " Mulligan 's Irish wit was equal to the occasion , and he wrote on the back of it , " General , I hardly know , unless you have surrendered . " The pleasantry led to a formal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers , surrendered. * The uncertainty which for several days hung over the fate of Lexington , and the dramatic incidents of the fight , excited the liveliest interest throughout the West . Newspaper discussion soon made it evident that this new Union loss might have been avoided by reasonable prudence and energy on the part of Fr6mont , as there were plenty of disposable troops at various points , which , during the slow approach and long-deferred attack of Price , could have been hurried to Mulligan 's support . There were universal outcry and pressure that at least the disaster should be retrieved by a prompt movement to intercept and capture Price on his retreat . Fr6mont himself seems to have felt the sting of the disgrace , for , reporting the surrender , he added : " I am taking the field myself , and hope to destroy the enemy , either before or after the junction of forces under McCulloch . Please notify the President immediately . " " Your dispatch of this day is received , " responded General Scott . " The President is glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words are , he expects you to repair the disaster at Lexington without loss of time . ' " This hope was not destined to reach a fulfillment . Price almost immediately retreated southward from Lexington with his captured booty , among which the pretentious great seal * Rebellion Record . " of the State figures as a conspicuous item in his report . On September 24 Fr*mont published his order , organizing his army of five divisions , under Pope at Boonville , McKinstry at Syracuse , Hunter at Versailles , Sigel at Georgetown , Asboth at Tipton . On paper it formed a respectable show of force , figuring as an aggregate of nearly 39,000 ; in reality it was at the moment well-nigh powerless , being scattered and totally unprepared for the field . Fr*mont 's chronic inattention to details , and his entire lack of methodical administration , now fully revealed themselves . Even under the imperative orders of the general , nearly a month elapsed before the various divisions could be concentrated at Springfield ; and they were generally in miserable plight as to transportation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper reports setting forth the incidents and great expectations of Frt*mont 's campaign , the convincing evidence could not be disguised that the whole movement would finally prove worthless and barren . Meanwhile , acting on his growing solicitude , President Lincoln directed special inquiry , and about the *3th of October the Secretary of War , accompanied by the Adjutant-General of the Army , reached Fr*mont 's camp at Tipton . His immediate report to the President confirmed his apprehension . Secretary Cameron wrote : I returned to this place last night from the headquarters of General Fr*mont at Tipton . I found there and in the immediate neighborhood some 40,000 troops , with brigade ( General McKinstry 's ) in good condition for the field and well provided ; others not exhibiting good care , and but poorly supplied with munitions , arms , and clothing . I had an interview with General Fr*mont , and in conversation with him showed him an order for his removal . He was very much mortified , pained , and , I thought , humiliated . He made an earnest appeal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the request of the Government , to assume a very responsible command , and that when he reached this State he found himself without troops and without any preparation for an army ; that he had exerted himself , as he believed , with great energy , and had now around him a fine army , with everything to make success certain ; that he was now in pursnit of the enemy , whom he believed were now within his reach ; and that to recall him at this moment would not only destroy him , but render his whole expenditure useless . In reply to this appeal , I told him that I would withhold the order until my return to Washington , giving him the interim to prove the reality of his hopes as to reaching and capturing the enemy , giving him to understand that , should he fail , he must give place to some other officer . He assured me that , should he fail , he would resign at once . It is proper that I should state that after this conversation I met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that his division of the army , although then under orders to march , and a part of his command actually on the road , could not he put in proper condition for marching for a number of days . To a question I put to him , " whether he believed General Fr6mont fit for the command , " he replied that he did not think // command , he knew nothing whatever of the purposes or plans of his chief. * The opinion of another division commander , General Pope , was freely expressed in a letter of the previous day , which Hunter also exhibited to the Secretary : I received at o'clock last night the extraordinary order of General Frdmont for a forward movement of his whole force . The wonderful manner in which the actual facts and condition of things here are ignored stupefies me . One would suppose from this order tisat divisions and brigades are organized , and are under immediate command of their officers ; that transportation is in possession of all ; that every arrangement of supply trains to follow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in a perfect state of preparation for a move . You know , as well as I do , that the exact reverse is the fact ; that neither brigades nor divisions have been brought together , and that if they were there is not transportation enough to move this army one hundred yards ; that , in truth , not one solitary preparation of any kind has been made to enable this advance movement to be executed . I have never seen my division , nor do I suppose you have seen yours . I have no cavalry even for a personal escort , and yet this order requires me to send forward companies of pioneers protected by cavalry . Is it intended that this order be obeyed , or rather , that we try to obey it , or is the order only designed for Washington and the papers ? I went to Jefferson City , the last time I saw you , for the express purpose of getting transportation for my division , and explained to General Frdmont precisely what I have said above . How in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was furnished , and that Kelton has none , he should coolly order such a movement , and expect it to be made , I can not understand on any reasonable or common-sense hypothesis . Another letter to the President from a more cautious and conservative officer , General Curtis , exercising a local command in St. Louis , gave an equally discouraging view of the situation : Your Excellency 's letter of the 7th inst. , desiring me to express my views in regard to General Fnimont frankly and confidentially to the Secretary of War , was presented by him yesterday , and I have complied with your Excellency 's request . . . . Matters have gone from bad to worse , and I am greatly obliged to your Excellency 's letter , which breaks the restraint of military law , and enables me to relieve myself of a painful silence . In my judgment General Fr6mont lacks the intelligence , the experience , and the sagacity necessary to his command . I have reluctantly and gradually been forced to this conclusion . His reserve evinces vanity or embarrassment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully penetrate his capacity . He would talk of plans , which , being explained , only related to some move of a general or some dash at a shadow , and I am now convinced he has no general plan . Forces are scattered and generally isolated without being in supporting distance or relation to each other , and when I have expressed apprehension as to some , I have seen no particular exertion to repel or relieve , till it was too late . I know the demand made on him for force everywhere is oppressive ; but remote posts have improperly stood out , and some still stand , inviting assault , without power to retreat , fortify , or re*n * Cameron to Lincoln , Oct. 14 , i86i .

The question you propound , " Ought General Frdmont to be relieved from or retained in his present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a question of manner and time . Public opinion is an element of war which must not be neglected . . . . It is not necessary to be precipitate . A few days are not of vast moment , but the pendency of the question and discussion must not be prolonged . Controversies in an army are almost as pernicious as a defeat . Thus the opinions of three trained and experienced army officers , who had every means of judging from actual personal observation , coincided with the general drift of evidence which had come to the President from civilian officials and citizens , high and low . Fr*mont had frittered away his opportunity for usefulness and fame ; such an opportunity , indeed , as rarely comes to men . He had taken his command three months before with the universal good-will of almost every individual , every subordinate , every official , every community in his immense department . In his brief incumbency he not only lost the general public confidence , but incurred the special displeasure or direct enmity of those most prominent in influence or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearty codperation success was practically impossible . Waiting and hoping till the last moment , President Lincoln at length felt himself forced to intervene . On the 24th of October , just three months after Fr6mont had assumed command , he directed an order to be made that Fr6mont should be relieved and General Hunter be called temporarily to take his command . This order he dispatched by the hand of a personal friend to General Curtis at St. Louis , with the following letter : WAsHINGvoN , Oct. 24 , i86i . BRIGADIER-GENERAL S. R. CuRvIs . DEAR SIR : On receipt of this , with the accompanying inclosures , you will take safe , certain , and suitable measures to have the inclosure addressed to MajorGeneral Frdmont delivered to him with all reasonable dispatch , sul ) ject to these conditions only , that if , when General Frdmont shall be reached by the messenger ,  - -  yourself or any one sent by you ,  --  he shall then have , in personal command , fought and won a battle , or shall then be actually in a battle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy in exp&amp;tation of a battle , it is not to be delivered , but held for further orders . After , and not till after , the delivery to General Fr*mont , let the inclosure addressed to General Hunter be delivered to him . Your obedient servant , A. LINCOLN4 It will be seen that the conditions attending the delivery of this order were somewhat peculiar . If General Fr6mont had just won a battle , or were on the eve of fighting one , t Curtis to Lincoln , Oct. 12 , iS6i . MS . War Records . A HISTORY // then both justice to himself , and more especially the risk or gain to the Union cause , rendered it inexpedient to make a sudden change in command . But the question also had another and possibly serious aspect . Amid all his loss of prestige and public confidence , Fr6mont had retained the clamorous adhesion and noisy demonstrative support of three distinct elements . First , a large number of officers to whom he had given irregular commissions , issued by himself ; " subject to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment gave their holders rank , pay , and power ; and to some of them he had assigned extraordinary duties and trusts under special instructions , regardless of proper military usage and method . The second class was the large and respectable German population of St. Louis , and other portions of Missouri , forming the nucleus of the radical faction whose cause he had especially espoused . The third class comprised the men of strong antislavery convictions throughout the Union who hailed his act of military emancipation with unbounded approval . The first class composed about his person a clique of active sycophants , wielding power and dispensing patronage in his name ; the other two supplied a convenient public echo . Out of such surroundings and conditions there began to come a cry of persecution and a vague hum of insubordination , coupled with adulations of the general . Some of his favorites talked imprudently of defiance and resistance to authority ; * occasional acts of Fr6mont himself gave a color of plausibility to these mutterings . He had neglected to discontinue the expensive fortifications and barracks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even since the President ordered him to modify his proclamation , he had on one occasion personally directed the original document to be printed and distributed . Several of his special appointees were stationed about the city of St. Louis , " so they should control every fort , arsenal , and communication , without regard to commanding officers or quartermasters. " t Suspicions naturally arose , and were publicly expressed , that he would not freely yield up his command ; or , if not actually resisting superior authority , that he might at least , upon some pretext , temporarily prolong his power . There was , of course , no danger that he could successfully defy the orders of the President . The bulk of his army , officers and sol * To remove Mr. Fr*mont will be a great wrong , as the necessary investigation following it will prove . It will make immense confusion , and require all his coutrol over his friends and the army to get them to do as he will ,  --  accept it as an act of authority , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is treason to question authority . To leave him here without money , without diers , would have spurned such a proposition . But the example of delay or doubt , any shadow of insubordination , would have had an extremely pernicious effect upon public opinion . General Curtis therefore sent a trusted bearer of dispatches , who , by an easy stratagem , entered Fr6mont 's camp , gained a personal audience , and delivered the official order of removal . Duplicates of the President 's letters were at the same time , and with equal care , dispatched to the camp of General Hunter , at a considerable distance , and he traveled all night to assume his new duties . When he reached Fr6mont 's camp , on the following day , he learned that ostensible preparations had been made and orders issued for a battle , on the assumption that the enemy was at Wilson 's Creek advancing to an attack . Taking command , Hunter sent a reconnaissance to Wilson 's Creek , and obtained reliable evidence that no enemy whatever was there or expected there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it is hardly possible to conceive that he deliberately arranged this final bit of theatrical effect . The actual fact was that while Price , retreating southward , by " slow and easy marches , " f : kept well beyond any successful pursuit , his army of twenty thousand which had captured Lexington dwindled away as rapidly as it had grown . His movement partook more of the nature of a frontier foray than an organized campaign : the squirrel-hunters of western Missouri , whose accurate sharp-shooting drove Mulligan into his intrenchments to starvation or surrender , returned to their farms or their forest haunts to await the occasion of some new and exciting expedition ; the whole present effort of General Price , now at the head of only io , ooo or 12,000 men , being to reach an easy junction with McCulloch on the Arkansas border , so that their united force might make a successful stand , or at least insure a s*tfe retreat from the Union army . President Lincoln , however , did not intend that the campaign to the south-west should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With the order to supersede Frtimont he also sent the following letters , explaining his well-considered views and conveying his express directions : WASHINGTON , Oct. 24 , i86s .

Yours truly , and impoverished them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and if , as I anticipate , you will see no enemy in great force approaching , you will have a surplus of force , which you can withdraw from these points and direct to others , as may be needed , the railroads furnishing ready means of reinforcing their A.

Doubtless local uprisings will for a time continue to occur , but these can be met by detachments and local forces of our own , and will ere long tire out of themselves . While , as stated in the beginning of the letter , a large discretion must be and is left with yourself , I feel sure that an indefinite pursuit of Price , or an attempt by this long and circuitous route to reach Memphis , will be exhaustive beyond endurance , and will end in the loss of the whole force engaged in it . Your obedient servant , A. LINcOLN. * WASHINGTON , Oct. 24 , i86i . To THE COMMANDER OF THE DEPARTMENT OF THE WEST . SIR : The command of the Department of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer you a few suggestions . Knowing how hazardous it is to bind down a distant commander in the field to specific lines and operations , as so much always depends on a knowledge of localities and passing events , it is intended , therefore , to leave a considerable margin for the exercise of your judgment and discretion . The main rebel army ( Price 's ) west of the Mississippi is believed to have passed Dade County in full retreat upon north-western Arkansas , leaving Missouri almost freed from the enemy , excepting in the southeast of the State . Assuming this basis of fact , it seems desirable , as you are not likely to overtake Price , and are in danger of making too long a line from your own base of supplies and reinforcements , that you should give up the pursuit , halt your main army , divide it into two corps of observation , one occupying Sedalia and the other Rolla , the present termini of railroad ; then recruit the condition of both corps by reestablishing and improving their discipline and instructions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarters . Of course both railroads must be guarded and kept open , judiciously employing just so much force as is necessary for this . From these two points , Sedalia and Rolla , and especially in judicious codperation with Lane on the Kansas border , it would be so easy to concentrate and repel any army of the enemy returning on Missouri from the weather .
