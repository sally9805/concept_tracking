txt For some time the Hydrographic Office has been collecting and publishing information about the use of oil upon waves at sea . Reports furnished by Captains from all parts of the world have been printed upon the monthly pilot charts , and at the end of the last calendar year the reports for twelve months were issued in a pamphlet . The dissemination of the facts narrated by these observers appears to have convinced many mariners that lives and property can be saved by the use of a few cents ' worth of oil , for in some of the Southstreet ship chandlers ' stores oil especially prepared for use in gales is now advertised and sold , and the dealers say that it has become " the fashion " to carry oil on board ship , and to use it when vessels are threatened by heavy seas . No one can read the testimony published by the Hydrographic Office without coming to the conclusion that the value of this method of protecting a ship in a gale has not been overestimated . The record for 1885 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although not all of these are assigned to that year . A very small quantity of oil is required . On her way northward from Baltimore the steamship Thomas Melville was repeatedly boarded by heavy seas . Two canvas bags filled with oil and punctured in many places with a sail needle were hung over the bows and allowed to drag in the water . The seas no longer came on board . One gallon of oil lasted for several hours . During a voyage from Portland , Oregon , to Queenstown the ship Myrtle Holm encountered seas so heavy that it was necessary to lash the man at the helm to his place to keep him from being washed away . The Captain suspended from each mainyard arm a perforated canvas bag containing about half a gallon of lamp oil . " Two minutes later there was no more broken water , and the ship went along as dry as possible , although a short distance away the sea was the same as before . " Oil was used twice by the same vessel in the latter part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on a voyage from Baltimore to Liverpool , similar oil bags were used to protect the English steamer Mentmore . " The ship had been rolling heavily and taking large quantities of water on deck , but in a few minutes after placing the bags she rode quite easily and shipped no more water . " After the main-wheel gear of the steamship . North Anglia had been carried away in a hurricane , in October , 1884 , and several men had been washed away , oil was tried , and there was no more trouble . The experience of the steamship Napier from Baltimore to Cork in January , 1885 , furnishes ample proof of the excellent service rendered by oil . She encountered a hurricane . After tremendous seas had pooped the ship and flooded the deck fore and aft Capt . HENDERSON filled two canvas bags with lamp oil , two gallons in each , and hung them over the side . The sea at once became smooth . " Astern he saw the great seas approach the vessel to within 60 or 70 feet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and only a heavy swell would be felt by the ship . He ran this way for three days and three nights , and not a drop of water came on board . " Two gallons lasted for two and one-half hours . The chief officer of the steamer Durham City saved his vessel by using a paint can full of neatsfoot oil suspended from the stern . A hole was punched in the bottom of the can , and another in the top for a vent . In a terrible gale on a voyage from St. John 's to Liverpool the chief officer of the bark Algeria protected his vessel by towing to windward a stocking filled with oil and attached to a few fathoms of line . Oil is used by life-saving crews , and the results of an exhaustive investigation of the subject were published two or three years ago by our LifeSaving Service . Mineral oils are not so effective ? as vegetable or animal oils . Capt . SMITH , . of the bark Emma , used refined petroleum in a gale , emptying barrels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It had substantially no effect . But crude petroleum may be of service . Capt . THOMPSON , of the bark Maud Scammell , used it with excellent results during a gale in November , 1881 , while on his way from New-York to Santander . Linseed oil , lard oil , fish oil , and seal oil are to be preferred . Heavy and greasy oil is better than that which is light and thin . As we have shown , if oil of the right kind be selected a very small quantity will have the desired effect . One barrel is enough for two or three gales . Now that the great value of this simple and inexpensive method of protection is generally recognized by mariners , it is probable that oil of the right quality - will be supplied at all large ports , and that the machinery for applying the oil to the waves will be perfected . A complete . outfit , consisting of specially prepared bags , oil , ecc. , will cost only a few dollars , and no vessel should leave port without one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
