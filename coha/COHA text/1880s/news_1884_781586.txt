txt Several correspondents have written to THE TIMES expressing disagreement with a recent article in which the necessity of block pavements in the commercial quarters of the city was pointed out . The disagreement , however , is mainly a result of misapprehension . Certainly THE TrwEs never meant to say , as its correspondents assume it to have said , either that block granite pavements can not be laid so as to form a much smoother and more agreeable pavement than is furnished by the granite pavements in this city , or that a smooth pavement can not be laid much stronger and much more efficient than any smooth pavement that has been laid in New-York . We believe both that the strong pavement can be made much smoother and that the smooth pavement can be made much stronger . Both these requirements are , in fact , fulfilled in other cities . It remains true , however , that the pavement most suitable for heavy traffic can not be made as agreeable to drive over as a pavement the primary purpose of which is to secure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fulton-street or lower Broadway would probably ruin , in a very short time , a pavement , which might nevertheless be sufficient for the traffic of upper Fifth-avenue or Fifty-seventh-street . A differentiation of pavements according to the work they have to do is much to be desired . But it is still more to be desired that every pavement laid shall be the best of its kind , that the rough pavement shall be as smooth as is consistent with durability , and that the smooth pavement shall be so laid as to stand as much wear and tear as is consistent with smoothness . The householders of streets where a smooth pavement is possible would do a public good by trying to impress their views on the Department of Public Works . That department has been so softened by affliction that it is not at all impossible that it may have acquired some sensibility to public opinion .
