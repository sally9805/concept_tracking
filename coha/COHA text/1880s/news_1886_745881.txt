txt The announcement that all operations in. the lower levels of the Hale and Norcross and . all work in the Chollar mine have been ordered stopped has a significance which is scarcely appreciable to people living on the Atlantic coast , but which is thoroughly understood . and appreciated by the thousands of , miners on . the . Pacific side of the continent . It means that the death knell of deep mining on the great Comstock lode has been sounded , that the great silver and gold mining section of Nevada has been practically worked out , as has been feared . by those on the ground for several years , and that the thousands of miners and those dependent on them , who make up the population of Virginia City and Gold Hill , at the foot of old Mount Davidson , will soon have to seek new homes and industries , leaving the houses and abandoned mines to the semi-civilized Piutes who roam about the Sagebrush State . It means , in brief , that nature has set her bar to further exploration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after struggling in vain to defeat her for the last ten years , has concluded at last to give up the hopeless struggle . The great prosperity of the Comstock , when the bonanzas yielded . their richest harvest , was from 1873 to 1878 inclusive . During those six years the State of Nevada yielded gold and silver bullion amounting to $242,612,872 , of which more than $200 , - 000,000 was credited to the Comstock lode , where the Consolidated Virginia and California mines were pouring out treasure by the tons daily . During this unusual season of prosperity the large mining Camps , which is all that Virginia City and Gold Hill can properly be called , were crowded with busy thousands , the highest wages were paid the minors , money was plenty , and everybody was prosperous and contented . But in 1878 the workings on the upper levels began to give out , the Big Bonanza was not exhaustless , and . the returns from the mines began . to fall in figures rapidly . Then the work of sinking deeper began , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth . Mining men believed it to be practicable to go far below the 2,000-foot level , and . it was confidently expected that the deeper the shaft plunged and the winzes projected , the larger and richer would be the find of ore . These expectations were not realized as the work of sinking went on , but the faith of the miner is great , and . the failure to at once realize his expectations does not often damp his ardor . It was not the lack of paying ore in sight that has put a stop to deep mining on the Comstock . The genuine Comstocker believes that Mount Davidson is founded on a base of gold and silver , and that  --  the deeper he digs the more he will find to reward his labors . But nature has stepped to the front and given the order to pause . Intolerable heat , which required artificial ventilation from above to make it possible for the men to work , and . great floods of water , which necessitated . expensive pumping machinery to hold . it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the miners at every step . The machinery of the Comstock is the most massive and powerful in the world , but the pump at the combination shaft has proved powerless to keep the water lowered , and at last the Savage Mining Company , realizing the hopelessness of further efforts , has refused to pay its third of the expense of keeping the machinery in motion . Chollar and . Hale and Norcross under these circumstances could do nothing but suspend . work , and . the deep mining has stopped and . the floods are left in undisputed possession of the lower drifts . There is still fair paying ore in the upper levels , which was passed by in the search for richer veins below , and . the working of this will provide employment for some of the miners for several years . A movement is also reported to induce the Government to give assistance to a project for sinking a shaft 5,000 feet deep to determine if there is any attainable bottom to a tine fissure lode , or any point below which it ceases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that what the miners of the Comstock have given up as impracticable will be accomplished even with the . powerful aid of the Government , supposing that aid could be secured . The limit of exploration in the depths has probably been reached , and all that remains is to clear up the material left behind in the progress downward . The significance of *this is that unless some more effective way of combating the forces of nature is devised . than any now in operation , the productive capacity of the Comstock mines has been fully gauged and . they will soon be practically abandoned . There are no more bonanzas to look forward to , and the miner must -- .shoulder his pick and seek new fields for work . With the failure of the mines must necessarily come the depopulation of this part of Nevada , for mining 7,8 the sole industry upon which the people depend , and the sagebrush fields and mountains offer no encouragement to agriculture . It would be strange if Virginia City , the home of Senator FAIR , and . Gold Hill , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ map of Nevada , except as spots marking the location of Pinto villages .
