txt An evening newspaper yesterday printed a sensational story , apparently from a correspondent in Montreal , to the effect that Henry D. Purroy , the President of the Board of Fire Commissioners , and James Lyons , the stenographer in Police Justice White 's court , on a re-. cent visit to Montreal , had arranged that one of the exiled boodlers should come to this city and give evidence against Jacob Sharp . It is said that Mr. Purroy and Stenog rapher Lyons arrived in Montreal at 11:30 o'clock last Friday night . They ' went at once to the Windsor Hotel and were assigned to Room 313 . At 2 A. M. , messages having been sent to all the exiled noodlers , John Keeuan called on the New-Yorkers , and when going away at dawn Keenan is alleged to have said : " All right , Hen . I see the point you make and will remember it . " Then , it is graphically remarked . one of the occupants of 313 opened the door for ex-Aldermen Sayles and De Lacy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be convoyed that Keenan had determined to pay a secret visit to New-York in the company of Mr. Purroy . The story as printed is vague and contradictory , the alleged correspondent admitting his information was obtained from one of the Africo-Franco Canadian hall boys of the hotel . In it iS'a puff for District Attorney Fellows . A TIMES reporter asked the public prosecutor what he thought of the story . " f have nothing to say one way or the other , " he replied . " You have read the article , I suppose I " the eporter asked . " Yes , I saw it , but I have nothing to say about it , " was the answer . Mr. Purroy was not about the places where he is usually to be found , last evening . When seen , however , he declined to talk on the subject further than to say that he had certainly been in Montreal , although he had carried on no intrigues with either John Keenan , Mr. De Lacy , or Mr. Sayles . The story published was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject . The friends of Mr. Purroy and Mr. Lyons were much stirred up about the story . but they all said that it was absurd . Mr. Purroy 's acquaintance with Keenan and the Aldermen of 1884 was of the slightest , by no menus sufficiently strong to have made him act as agent for Col. Fellows . All his friends knew that he was going to Montreal on Friday last . He announced it publicly , and so did Mr. Lyons , who accompanied him . It is Mr. Purroy 's custom to spend Sunday and often Saturday in different places ; sometimes at Atlantic City or Cape May , and at other times in Philadelphia. , Boston , or other neighboring cities , Not having been in Montreal in over a year , it is looked upon as natural that ho should have gone there last week . MONTREAL , April 2 . ? Ex-Alderman Dempsey says : " It is true that Purroy and Lyons were hare on Friday night , but they came on private business , which had nothing whatever to do with us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or De Lacy did . They have been here once or twice before , and that is all there is about it . " Do Lacy and Sayles could not be seen .
