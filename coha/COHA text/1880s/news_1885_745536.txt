txt " That is the solution of the commercial problem between this country and South America , " remarked Judge SOLON THATCHER of the South American Subsidy Commission to an Associated Press reporter who asked him what he had learned about the policy of subsidizing steamship lines . It occurs to us that the subsidy plan advocated by the Commissioners and by some other persons in this country , notably by ultra-protectionists and owners of steamship property , is incomplete , and we venture to suggest an addition that may be regarded as absolutely indispensable by those who would like to sell North American goods in South American markets . Although this suggestion will doubtless be eagerly seized and used to their own advantage by the subsidy men , we shall not charge a cent for it . Of course the main object of the subsidy plan is to enable our manufacturers to sell their goods in southern countries where British manufacturers now supply the markets . Let us suppose that a new line of steamers to some South American port has been started by the aid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The steamer comes into the distant port with a load of goods , and the people are glad to see her . Of course they are . Why not ? But will they buy the goods ? " I want to sell you this fine article , " says our manufacturer , " and you can have it for a dollar . " The affable but thrifty South American remarks that he can buy the same thing on the British steamer for 60 cents . " But , " says the enterprising North American , " it cost me more than that , and I ca n't afford to let you have it for less than a dollar . And , besides , our people have taxed themselves to pay this steamship company half a million in order that you might have a chance to pay a dollar for it . You should consider the grandeur of our protective tariff that raises the price of this article by a tax on raw materials . " But if the South American has any sense he will not buy . Just at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress that votes the subsidy collect by means of a national tax a fund to be known as " The Fund to Encourage Backward South American Consumers . " Let every subsidized steamer carry a duly accredited and well paid agent appointed by the President and provided with a large slice of the fund . Then , when the manufacturer offers his article for a dollar , let it be the duty of this agent to step forward and hand to the backward South American with the offered article 40 cents , or perhaps 45 cents , impressing upon his mind that this great Nation proposes to prove to the world that it can maintain a high tariff on raw materials and at the same time sell its manufactured goods in all foreign markets with great ease . In most cases it would be easy for the agents to discover the exact difference between our prices and those put upon foreign goods ; but if there should be difficulty in ascertaining what the payment ought to be , a slight excess in the purchaser 's favor would be money wisely thrown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this addition to the subsidy plan will be opposed . Some persons will oppose anything . The wretched doctrinaires and shameless theorists will say that it involves the collection of a triple tax  --  the original tax imposed by the tariff , the tax to provide for subsidy payments , and the tax to create the Fund for Backward South American Consumers . But all this will be only a rehash of old and stale arguments that have been paid for and circulated by British gold . The true ultra-protectionist and the unwavering advocate of subsidies will not be alarmed by this kind of drivel . He has heard it before . Upon second thought , as we more carefully estimate the value of this suggestion . we are inclined to think that we have been too generous . It has the vain which pertains to the true and final sole tion of a great commercial problem . Still we must stick to our original offer an the subsidy men can have it without price .               @ @ @ @ @ @
