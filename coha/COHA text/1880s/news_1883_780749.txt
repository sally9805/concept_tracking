There were also secured a number of counterfeit bonds , almost ready to ho placed on the market , and all the dies : stamps , and other paraphernalia used and intended to be used by the prisoners iu their operations . The prisoners are William E. Brockway , Lew Martin . and Nathaniel B. Foster . all notorious and expert forcers and manufacturers of counterfeit notes and bonds . Two months ago Detective Sergeants Cosgrove and Mangan , while at Thirty-fourth-street and Third-avenue , saw Brockway leave an elevated train at the station there . and they followed him to No. 231 Lexington-avenue , which is a respectable boarding-house . Brockway had been released from custody about 18 months ago . 13o had been convicted in the United States District Court in Brooklyn on two indictments for counterfeiting one-hundretedollar United States Treasury and one-thousand-dollar Government bonds , but on surrenderingall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dies . stamps , &c.,; used in manufacturing the counterfeits sentence was suspended and he was released . He was warned , however , at the time that if he was caught in the business again the sentence of 30 years to which he was liable would be imposed . He was therefore a marked man , and the detectives deemed it their duty to watch him and report the facts . to Inspector Byrnes , who bad full charge of the proceedings which resulted in the arrests . Brockway 's frequent visits to the Lexington-avenue house induced the Inspector to hire a room in a house immediately opposite . and in this room - Detectives Mangan , Cosgrove. and Heard established a regular watch on the occupants of No. 23i . It was discovered that Nathaniel B. Foster , a notorious forger , lived in this house , and was visited there by Brockway and Lew Martin , tnakine a trio of the most export counterfeit . ers in the United States . Brockway was followed from the house in Lexington-avenue to No. 270 West Eleventh-street , where . under tho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the other tenants in the house as Mrs. Gilbert . and who occupied a fiat in the house . Mrs. Gilbert is believed to be Brockway 's wife . Martin was traced to the St. James Hotel , where it was ascertained that he had ( ) coupled Room No. 86 for several months . He was known there as a snorting man , fond of horse racing . - The detectives who wore watching Brook way , following him from place to place all over the City , had not been engaged in this business for many days when they became aware that two men , strangers to them , were also dogging his footsteps . It was at first supposed that they wore associates of Brockway. but their actions did not support this theory , and then it was found that they were Government detectives , under Chief Drummond , of the Secret Service . Mr. Drummond said that he was satisfied that Brockway could not content himself by earning an honest living , and since his release he had been constantly watched by Government officers . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A room was then hired opposite Brockway 's residence . and Detectives McCloskey and Fields were installed to watch the forger 's movements . Detective Slavin had charge of this branch of the case . Detective Al Williamson was posted at the St. James Hotel to note Martin 's movements . Brockway was followed to a number of lithographing and printing establishments in the lower part of the City , - and he also paid visits to several banking houses in Wall-street . Not a single day passed but the three men met at Brockway 's or F , ster 's lodirings , or in Martin 's room at the hotel . There were constant meetings in Martin 's room , whore the conspirators remained for hours . The first trustworthy information that the men were concootina some nefarious scheme was received through a letter . Brockway and Martin were coming down stairs in the hotel from the room of the latter one day and Brockway. after reading a letter . tore it up and threw the nieces away . A detective who was on the watch picked ep ehe ffagments unobserved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the party was engaged in some illegitimate transaction . During the past week it was noticed that small packages : were being entreled from the Lexingtonavenue hotted to the ) 0110 - in West Eleventh-street , and thence to Martin 's room at the ' hotel , and from other Indications it was surmised that the scheme was ripe and it was time for the police to stop in and frustrate it . With this object in view , search warrants were obtained from Recorder Smyth in his private office in Nassau-street early on Saturday morning for the examination of the rooms occupied by the three men . The services were obtainer ' . of two of Cuter Drummond 's most experienced men , who were familiar with the dies , stamps , and other paraphernalia used in counterfeiting . At 11 o'clock on Saturday morning Detective Sergeant Langan was alone in the room in the house opposite No. 231 Lexinaton-avenue . Sergt. Slevin , Detectives hoard and Radford , and one of Drummond 's men were sent to the place to await instructions . Detectives Cosgrove , McCloskey , Minigin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were also accompanied ? by one of Drum . mend 's mon . Detective Williamson was at the hotel . The Inspector was anxious to catch all three of the suspected persons acting in concert , At 1 o'clock in the afternoon Cosgrove reported that the three men had met in Foster 's room . in tho Lexington-avenue house . lie was immediately sent back to tell the officers to make a raid on the house 15 minutes after receiving the instructions , so as to : rive Cosgrove time to reach the house in West Eleventh-street and convoy similar instructions to the officers watching there that the two raids might be made simultaneously and prevent notice being sent from one house to tho other . The officers wore instructed to demand admittance . and , in case of refusal , to burst open the door . Cosgrove delivered his instructions to the Lexington-avenue parte and started for West Eleventh-street . He had - been gone only a few moments when Brockway was seen to leave the house on Lexingtonavenue . Detective Heard followed him down to the Thirty-fourth-street station of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the train was slowing no at the Houstonstreet station . Heard arrested Brockway . He submitted quietly and did not appear ut all discomposed . The officer brought him to Police Headquarters , where he was locked up . Meanwhile . the raids on the two suspected houses were made simultaneously . The detectives had noticed that whenever Brockway or Martin visited the LexIngeon-avenue house they gained immediate admissfbn by two sharp vines at the door bell . This signal was used by the detectives and they were admitted without parley . They found Martin and Foster in the apartments of the la : ter and ' made them prisoners . No resistance was offered . and the men were hurried off to Police Head-quarters , where they were locked up . In the room were found a lot of dies , stamps , Plates , electrotype plates . galvanic batteries , and all the paraphernalia for the counterfeiting of the construction mortgage of the Morris and Essex bonds of the denomination of $1.000. due in 1901 , and bearing 7 per cent . interest , and the bonds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the denomination of $1,000 each . The latter are gold-bearing bonds drawing 6 per cent . intorest . There were also found the seals for these bonds , and also counterfeit dies of the London seal , as the interest on the Central Pacific bonds is payable in London . They found also a fao simile of the English tax stamp of the value of Cs. 3d .

" The figures $1,000 and the scrollwork surrounding it were obtained by Brockway at a down-town establishment , where the pollee subsequently got a drawing of it from the person ' : who sold them to him . Another form contained the trust certificate in typo . Eighteen packages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were also found . The Central Pacific bonds are lithographed and not engraved . A die for the figures 1,000 on the hack of the Morris and Essex Railroad bonds was among the articles found . It is thought proof can be given that the forgers had prepared a counterfeit of the United 4 States internal revenue stamp which was affixed to the genuine bond of the Morris and Essex Road . The genuine bond ' from which the imitation was made is in possession of the police , and a piece had been cut out of it at the spot whore the revenue stamp was affixed , and the counterfeit stamp was fitted in with great nicety . By the aid of a powerful magnifying glass . which was found in possession of Brockway. this discovery was made . This is an offense against the laws of the United States , and renders Brockway to the imposition of the suspended sentence of 30 years . The detectives had no difficulty in entering and searching the apartments of Brockway in West Eleventh-street . Enough was found to connect Brockway with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vignettes on ponds and bank notes . and books of directions for the use of galvanic batteries .
