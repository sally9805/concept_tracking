txt More than half the business blocks of this town are owned by a veritable " BUddensieR , " whose real name is Abraham Burbank . They are all very Poorly constructed , and are built on the very cheapest plan possible . Many of Burbank 's buildings have fallen either during construction or during heavy gales . He lost a large structure id this way 26 years ago , and since then his hotel , the Burbank House , has been partly blown down , and numerous other buildings erected by him have suffered more or less severely from the same cause . The last catastrophe in this line came this afternoon , resulting in the loss of one life , the wounding of four other men , and a Pecuniary loss of about $6,000 . For two months Burbank has had a large force working upon the erection of a business block in the centre of the town . This , it was understood , was to be his final effort , a monument to hts industry and enterprise . The structure was of brick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials used in the building , the thinness of the walls , and the cheap cement caused a great deal of unfavorable comment , but citizens let it pass , simply remarking that it was " a Burbank block . " This afternoon the entire north and west walls , three stories high , fell in , carrying the third and second floors with them and burying a dozen masons and carpenters in the ruins . A great crowd collected and the wounded men were extricated with difficulty . Anthony Murphy , of Chicopee , a bricklayer , was horribly cut and crushed . He was taken to the House of Mercy , where he died . Joseph Sugrue , also of Chicopee , was hurt in the back and suffered internal injuries . His condition is precarious . George had a foot crushed and George Middlebrook had his head cut open . Abraham Burbank , the owner , was in the building when it fell , and suffered a severe scalp wound . How the others escaped unhurt was a mystery . The Selectmen will probably condemn the building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several property owners and relatives of the injured men will bring suits for damages . The affair has created great excitement and condemnation of the methods employed in the construction of the building is heard on every side .
