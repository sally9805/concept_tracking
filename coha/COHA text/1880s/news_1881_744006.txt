txt The principal organ of the Democratic Party in this City , acting on the hint of that eminent Pennsylvania protectionist , Mr. SAMUEL J. RANDALL , raises the cry , " Down with the internal revenue . " Coming from Mr. RANDALL , the demand for the abolition of internal revenue taxes was scarcely more surprising than it would have been if it had come from his Republican fellow-citizen , Mr. WILLIAM D. KELLEY . Mr. RANDALL is equal to the feat of standing on a platform whose only feature of special significance is a demand for a " tariff for revenue only , " but he is at the same time an avowed protectionist . In the interest of Pennsylvania industries he regards it of the utmost importance that high duties should be maintained on a variety of imported merchandise , not for the sake of the revenue derived from them , but for the sake of restricting their importation and sustaining the prices of competing products in this country . The main purpose of a tariff in his mind is not to raise " revenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the profits of Pennsylvania manufacturers . He is willing that " industries " outside of his State shall be protected by the same method , and the question with him is how in the face of a demand for less taxation a high degree of protection shall be maintained . A year ago his notion was that the rate of Government expenditures might be kept up for a long time to come by payment of pensions , a continuous reduction of the national . debt , and liberal public improvements . His argument was that these expenses would make a high tariff necessary for revenue purposes , and it could , therefore , be kept for protective purposes without a very heinous violation of the Democratic platform of 1880 . Now , however , Mr. RANDALL seems to have become impressed with the awful idea that rapid payment of the public debt will in the end be destructive of a high rate of public expenditure and interfere with the excuse for a high tariff . There is more virtue in a plea for economy , and something must be done to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any serious extent . The happy thought has struck him that $135,000,000 or so may be knocked off the receipts of the Treasury at a single blow by a total abolition of the internal revenue . It is nothing to him that this is derived chiefly from whisky and tobacco , and that all nations regard such articles of superfluous luxury , to give them no worse name , as the most legitimate of all objects for taxation . He cares not who pays these taxes or what would be the direct effect of abolishing them . What he wants is to save the tariff as nearly as possible in its present cumbrous and oppressive shape . We give him credit for not caring particularly for cheap whisky and tobacco or wishing to add greatly to the profits of distilleries and groggeries , but he is anxious to compel people to pay high prices for iron and steel and all the implements of industry made from them , and he does want to have the cost of blankets and clothing kept up . However mistaken his view of the interests of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object is very plain . But the World newspaper has not an established reputation as an advocate of a high protective tariff . On the contrary , we have a distinct recollection of laborious arguments in its columns in favor of reducing and simplifying the tariff for the very purpose of getting rid of its protective features . It has exulted in platforms demanding a tariff for revenue only , and descanted upon the burdens imposed upon the country by the oppressive duties which are the offspring of war legislation . It is somewhat surprising , therefore , notwithstanding the known capacity of the Democratic organ for brilliant feats in journalistic gymnastics , to find it joining in Mr. RANDALL 'S demand for the salvation of the tariff by the sacrifice of the internal revenue . It may be moved in some measure by sympathy for the consumers of whisky and tobacco , which are potent agencies in Democratic politics , but it goes too far in assuming that their taxation " oppresses every industry and vexes every household in the land . " A habitual reader of the Democratic organ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward free trade , would naturally suppose when it refers to a system that grew up " under the stress of the war , " and lingers to oppress every industry and vex every household , that it means the tariff which it has so often denounced , but it removes all doubt by giving its name as " internal revenue , " wherein it unaccountably finds something " soothing . " Tile World could always make itself interesting by taking to figures . It resorts to calculations for the purpose ' of demolishing the internal revenue . It states that the receipts of the Government for the last fiscal year amounted to $363 , 250,000 , and then it sets down the " legitimate and necessary items " of expenditure at $194,178,295 , and shows that the Customs receipts are sufficient to cover those . Pensions it treats as not " legitimate and necessary items , " but it does not deign to show how it would get rid of them . But supposing all payments of the principal of the public debt to be suspended , and all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be lopped from the expenses of the Government , reducing the needed revenue to less than $200,000,000 , we are still left , in spite of the imposing figures , to wonder why all taxes should be removed from whisky and tobacco and all should be left on the imported articles which include so many of the necessaries and comforts of life , the prices of which arc kept up by the taxes , whether they are imported or manufactured at home . Surely it is time to " consider the why and the whereunto of all this . "
