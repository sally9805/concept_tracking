IT seems to be a genial pastime for men in various walks of life who know very little about financial affairs , and the methods of doing business in Wall street , to denounce this great centre of the moneyed interests , as the sum of all villainies , a kind of Pandora 's box , but without any hope at the bottom . In opposition to popular delusions of this nature , I propose to show that Wall street is a great civilizer , and the mighty channel through which has flown the enormous wealth that has been powerful and necessary in developing our industrial enterprises . I shall also endeavor to demonstrate that Wall street men , generally , are paragons of personal honor , and that they were chiefly instrumental in providing the means of saving the nation in the hour of its peril . I am sorry to say that the clergy have done a great deal to foster erroneous impressions of the character of the men who do business in this part of the city , and to utterly misrepresent the nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not the knowledge or the means to obtain correct information on this subject . There is no excuse , however , for a man in this enlightened age , who professes to be a spiritual leader of the people , to remain ignorant of an important fact , or to continue to see that fact through a false medium , when he has the opportunity of coming into Wall street and seeing for himself . He has no right to set himself up as a censor , a public detractor , and a public libeller upon a set of men and merchants who are the bone and sinew of the financial , commercial , and industrial interests and prosperity of the country . It is not only a personal wrong , but a public injury . The Rev. T. Dc Witt Talmage has , perhaps , done more than any other clergyman in the attempt to rr**ke speculators , investors , and business men obnoxious in the eyes of the rest of the // community and in the estimation of John Bull , in whose dominion his so-called sermons are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountebank eloquence to bring financial disgrace upon the business methods of the country by the manner in which he has ignorantly vilified Wall street . He went , in person , to the Cremorne Garden , Billy McGlory 's , Harry Hill 's , and other places of dubious reputation , in order to " make himself acquainted with the real condition of things " there . How far he has penetrated into the green rooms and behind the scenes in these places it is not my business to know , but why should he not treat Wall street , where everything is open to inspection , as fairly as he does these dens of vice , where midnight scenes of villainous revelry and reckless dissipation reign supreme ? Why does he misrepresent Wall street without knowing anything about it . He can come here and go wherever he wishes without a bodyguard of detectives or fear of molestation . Why is he so particular about doing justice to the brothel and the gaming den , while he uses his ludicrous eloquence to the highest degree to falsify the respectable business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men in the higher walks of life , and among the higher classes ( if I may use the expression , in opposition to the opinion of the New York Sun , whose editor maintains that we have no classes in this country ) wonld have been ashamed to be seen in Wall street . Now , men in the same sphere are proud of the distinction , both socially and financially . In fact , Wall street has become a necessity , and a healthy stimulant to the rest of the business of the country . Everything looks to this centre as an index of its prosperity . It moves the money that controls the affairs of the world . Take the Clearing-house , for example , with its *50,000,000,000 of transactivns annually . All but a fraction of this wonderful wealth , compared with which the stupendous pile of Cr*sus was a pittance , passes through Wall street , continually adding to its mighty power . This great power , in comparison with which the influence of monarchies is weak , is not , like the riches of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all the industries and productive forces of the country . Wall street is a great distributor . It is also universal in its benevolent effects , practically unlimited by either creed or geography . It has taken greater advantage , for the general good , of scien // tific discovery than all the scientific societies combined . Wherever the electric wires have penetrated the Wall street broker has followed . The members of the Stock Exchange are , through the power of electricity , in closer sympathy with the great heart of civilized humanity than all the missionaries and philanthropic societies in the world . They are the great cosmopolitans of the age . In practical sympathy they outshine the most devoted efforts of the benevolent associations of half the continent . They have the means to do it , and this comes chiefly from their being practical , and from their strong antipathy as a body to cant and hypocrisy . ERROR VERSUS FACT . There are many false ideas outside the ranks of the clergy concerning Wall Street affairs entertained by the general public . It is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where people . who are in the " ring " take something for nothing . No idea could be further away from the mark in regard to Wall street men as a class , however true it may be of individual instances , as in all other departments of business . Wall street gives full value for everything it receives , and the country at large is deeply its debtor . Some people may think this a paradox , but there is nothing more easily demonstrated to those who have observed the commercial and industrial progress of the country and the age . A PIONEER OF PROSPERITY . Wall street has furnished the money that has set the wheels of industry in motion over the vast continent , and in one century has brought us abreast , in the industrial arts , of countries that had from one to two thousand years the start of us . In this respect it has assisted nobly to carry out the ideas of the fathers of the Constitution . Washington , Jefferson , Madison , Franklin , and Hamilton laid down the doctrine that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to limit the productive energies of this country to raw material . With our present experience we may think it strange that this question should ever have been debated , but it was , even after the old tyranny had been obliged to loosen its grasp on the struggling enterprise of the young Republic . The revolutionary sires deserve credit for their foresight but what would have been the fate of their commercial philoso // phy if Wall street had not supplied the sinews of war to develop the forces of nature , to work our mines and build our railroads , and through these and other means to attract the teeming population from every clime to cultivate our virgin soil and develop our wonderful industries and resources ? Apropos of the above observations , I may add that during the debate in the British Parliament , on the recognition of the Confederacy , the great manufacturing power in our industrial , financial , and commercial progress was clearly exhibited and thoroughly appreciated by British statesmen . it was made one of the strongest arguments , too , by some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , side of the ocean , why Great Britain should recognize and aid the South in the war . Lord Salisbury , then Lord Robert Cecil , at present the leader of the Tory party in England , and the advocate of twenty years ' coercion for Ireland , was one of the bitterest foes of the Union , chiefly on this account . He was one of the Vice-Presidents of the " Southern Independent Association , " for the promotion of the cause of the Rebellion , and for supplying the Confederates with money and arms , and for the ultimate object of founding an empire of slavery on this continent . JEALOUS " JINGOES " AS CIVILIZERS . In his speech then , on the Southern blockade , the future Lord Salisbury made the following touching allusion to our dangerous prosperity on this side : " The plain matter of fact is , as every one who watches the current of historv must know , that the Northern States of America never can be our sure friends , for this simple reason , not merely because the newspapers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on beth sides , but because we are rivals ; rivals politically , rivals commercially . We aspire to the same position . We both aspire to the government of the seas . We are both manufacturing people , and in every port aswell as at every court we are rivals to each other . With respect to the Southern Stases the case is entirely reversed . The population are an agricultural people . They furnish the raw material of our industry , and they consume the products which we manufacture from it . With them , therefore , every interest must lead us to cultivate friendly relations , and we have seen that when the war began they at once recurred to England as their natural ally . " Thus we see how anxious Great Britain was to take the place which the North had reserved for itself , and so proudly maintained in commerce and industry . The great " coming man , " // Salisbury , wanted to reduce us all to the position of hewers of wood , drawers of water , and planters and pickers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mighty centre of the world 's manufacturing indnstries . This would have given a set-back to our civilization , and have caused us to make a retrogressive move to the dark ages . Since then we have afforded this noble lord and his nation ample proof that we are very far advanced in the manufacturing arts ourselves , and that in many things we are far ahead of England , and they are no doubt greatly surprised that the arrangement , by which England was to have all the profit and America all the hard work , was not carried out . In this wonderful development of the industrial arts , Wall street money , enterprise , and speculation have played by far the most conspicuous and progressive part , thus enabling us , in a little more than two decades , to outstrip the old nations that were so anxious to enslave us , in spite of the fact that they had centuries upon centuries the start of us . It must be galling to some of these people that we are now the most available candidates for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have attained this position in a great measure through the instrumentality of Wall street as a civilizer . PERSO*AL HOIOR OF WALL STREET MEX . It is true the honor of Wall street is sometimes tarnished , especially in the eyes of those who reside at a great distance , owing to the delinquencies of dishonorable men , who consider Wall street men and Wall street money fair game for swindling operations . These are for the most part outsiders , who pounce upon the Street as their illegitimate prey , after probably making a show of doing business there . There is no place , of course , where confidence men have the opportunity of reaping such a rich harvest when they can succeed in establishing the confidential relations that help them to make their swindles successful . But Wall street proper is no more responsible for such men than the Church , whose sacred precincts are used and abused by the same social pariahs in a similar manner . The Street is the victim of these adventurers , and has no more to do with nurturing and aiding them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a financier who would have the temerity to assert that the Church was an asylum for swindlers , and that // thence they issued forth to commit their lawless depredations upon society ? He would be tabooed by all intelligent people . Yet there would be about as much truth in such a statement as in most of the eloquent anathemas and objurgations launched from the pulpit against Wall street . There is no place on this earth where adventurous thieves have fewer sympathizers than in Wall street , not excepting , perhaps , in Pinkerton 's and Byrnes 's detective bureaux . There is another popular delusion with regard to those who do not succeed in Wall street . Their failure is frequently attributed to sharp practice on the part of the old habitu*s of the street . People forget that the business of speculation requires special training , and every fool who has a few hundred dollars can not begin to deal in stocks and make a fortune . The men who do not succeed are usually those who have spent early life elsewhere , and whose habits have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Wall street requires long and close training in financial affairs , so that the mind may attain a flexible facility with the various ins and outs of speculative methods . If this training is from youth upward , all the better . It is among this class that many of our most successful men are to be found , although there are some eminent examples of success among those who began late in life . It will be found , however , that the latter must have had a special genius for the business , and genius , of course , discounts all the usual conditions and auxiliaries ; but among ordinary intellects early training is generally indispensable to financial success . It seldom happens , moreover , that the early trained man from youth up does any great wrong . A DANGEROUS " GEIiIUS " UW FI*A*CE . Ferdinand Ward may seem an exception to this rule , but he had a born genius for evil , and though he had all the early advantages of Timothy and Samuel the Prophet , with a higher civilization thrown in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls and iron bars could prescribe bounds to his rascality . He is an extraordinary exception , a genius of the other extreme , agt*inst whose subtle operations society must always be on its guard ; but he is only one of the dangerous exceptions that prove the rule for which I am contending  --  the rule that early // training in finance more , perhaps , than in any other field of human energy , is the great desideratum . If such a man is unsuccessful , dishonor seldom accompanies his misfortunes . He may pass through the whole catalogue of financial disasters and their natural results . He may fall to the gutter through over-indulgence in liquor and the despair attendant on a run of bad luck or unfortunate connection with wicked partners , but he is still capable of rising from the ashes of his former self . He will never stoop to swindling no matter how low the rest of his moral condition may fall . No great business can be built up except upon honest and moral principles . It may flourish for a time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which the business of Wall street has grown is a living proof of its moral stamina . It is impossible , in the social and moral nature of things , to unite a large number of men , representing important material interests , except upon principles of equity and fair dealing . A conspiracy to cheat must always be confined to a small number . The most successful men of Wall street , to my personal knowledge , are those who came to the street young , and have " gone through the mill , " so to speak ; those who have received severe training , who have had some sledge-hammer blows applied to their heads to temper them , like the conversion of iron into steel . These are some of the requisites of a successful financial career . One of the most common delusions incident to human nature in every walk of life is that of a man who has been successful in one thing imagining he can succeed in anything and everything he attempts . In general , overweening conceit of this kind can be cured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their mortal condition and limited capacity . When the experiment is tried in Wall street , however , to these healthy admonitions are frequently added irreparable disaster and overwhelming disgrace . I shall note a few examples within the memory of men still active in business life . The brief panic of 1884 brought several instances of this character to the surface . Some of them had fought our battles for national existence , and preserved the Union when this achievement seemed almost hopeless . Their fame as generals was as extensive as history itself . They had planned // and executed projects with success on which . the destiny of a great nation , and perhaps the destiny of other nations , depended ; yet , when they attempted to manage banks , railroads , and financial operations , they became hopelessly entangled . WHY GENERAL GRANT WAS VICTIMIZED . The great captain of the Union 's salvation was as helpless as a babe when Ferdinand Ward and James P. Fish moved upon his works . The eye that took in the whole situation at a glance at Vicksburg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insidious and speculative designs of the " Young Napoleon of finance . " General Grant was a victim , not so much to the sincere , veracious , and unsuspecting attributes which were so largely predominant in that great man , as to his want of early training in financial business affairs , and to the fact that he was unable to appreciate its necessity in dealing with sharp business men of loose morals . Generals Winslow and Porter fell into a similar error of judgment in the West Shore Railroad matter . Their mistake came near being a serious blow to the railroad interests of this country . General Wilson , of the New York &amp; New England , and General Gordon were similarly unfortunate . The common mistake committed by these worthy men , to whom the country owes an inestimable debt of gratitude , was the chief cause of the " general demoralization " to which Treasurer Jordan facetiously , but indignantly , alluded when denouncing railroad methods , and which , from time to time , has played sad havoc with some of the best securities in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have sons destined for a business career , let your cherished offspring have the advantage of early practical training in the particular line of business for which you may consider them best adapted , and do so , even to the partial neglect of their school and college education . Practical business is the best school and college in which they can possibly graduate . HOW WALL STREET SAVED THE COUNTRY . Wall street men were found in the vanguard fully equipped for duty in the early days of the late Civil War . When money was to be raised to enable the North to carry on that terrible struggle it had to be obtained through Wall street . At this momentous // juncture , when there was no eye to pity , and when no *other arm seemed mighty enough to save , the Wall street men were equal to the occasion . They put their heads together , came to the front , and resolved to extricate the Government from its perilous position . It is true they were well paid for it . They charged twelve per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the risk is taken into account . It was then almost impossible to get a loan at any rate of interest . By some of the great nations of Europe the risk then involved in such a loan was regarded in about the same light as the people of this country now estimate the present chance of realizing on Confederate paper money , or Georgia bonds of the old issue . In this state of public feeling Lombard street was not in a favorable mood to negotiate loans with this country , and the whole fraternity of the Rothschilds shut their fists on their shining shekels and shook their heads negatively and ominously at the bare mention of advancing money to the once great but then distressed Republic . Money was dear at the time , and the Government was only obliged to pay for what could not be obtained in other quarters . Curiously enough , private property then was considered better security than the Government indorsement , on the principlewhich was not a very patriotic one , though in reality true-that the country could survive its form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world has yet seen , survived the shock and maintained its autonomy . That it did so was in a large measure due to the prompt action of Wall street men in raising the sinews of war at the incipient stage of the rebellion . Had they failed to do so , it is not improbable that the repulse at Bull Run might have proved a decisive blow to the Union , and plunged the country into a state of anarchy from which nothing but a despotism almost as bad could have succeeded . The negotiation of this loan brought out the twelve per cent . Treasury notes . After this issue the rates fell . Then came the 11 and the 1O* per cent . issues , and subsequently the wellknown and long to be remembered 7 3-10 Treasury notes . After this issue had been popularized , successfully disposed of , and finally taken up at maturity by the 5-20 loan , Jay Cooke was quick to issue , after their pattern , his famous ? 3-10 Northern Pacific Railroad bonds . Evidently he had a patent for negotiating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as almost every clergyman , // Sunday-school teacher , and public benefactor were found to have invested in them when the crash came , and although the road was the means of his financial downfall , with the ruin of an innumerable number of others , besides , who were dragged into the same speculative whirlpool , this unfortunate event was not entirely an unmixed evil . It is true that this was the main and visible cause of precipitating the panic of 1873 , but the Pacific road was the great pioneer in opening up the Far West , and developing its material resources , the great artery of the Western railroad system , conveying vigorous and durable vitality to the industrial life of the expansive regions beyond the Rockies . Thus , in taking a retrospect of my twenty-eight years in Wall street , I find that what sometimes appeared to be great evils have been succeeded by compensating good , fate counterbalancing fate , as the Latin poet has it . It was so after the panic of 1857 . It was so after the convulsion of 1873 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me in regard to the earlier history of the Street , I find it was so after 1837 . So the maxim that history repeats itself has been fully verified in Wall street . A GREAT INCEIkTIYE TO INDUSTRIAL PROGRESS . So , now that I have relapsed into a reflective mood on this subject , a host of important associations connected with the main issue rush upon me . The prominent idea that stands out in bold relief is the rapid and wonderful progress made in Wall street during the period that I have undertaken to chronicle . And not only so , but the rapid strides that have been made in everything , almost universally , during that time , present a vast theme for consideration . The part that Wall street men have taken in this mighty evolution is the topic that concerns me most at present . As I attempt to progress with my subject , I observe this division of it becoming more expansive , so that I find myself in the position of the Irishman when he ascended to the top of a mountain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he exclaimed , " I never thought the world was so large ! " So it is with me . I never thought that Wall street was so big , nor that Wall street affairs were so extensive , until I began to write about them . They expand , as well as improve , surprisingly on closer acquaintance . I only hope I shall be able to impress this idea more vividly on the minds of my clerical friends and // others who have been misguided in this respect , chiefly on hearsay and irresponsible evidence , and who , I am sorry to say , have been the well-meaning , but over-zealous , instruments of misleading others . To come to an approximate deduction of facts , then , it is , I think , a fair estimate of the general progress of humanity , to say that there has been greater material advance in everything that relates to a higher civilization , and the greatest good to the greatest number , during the last thirty years , than in all the previous time that has elapsed since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to chronicle , in his racy style , the real and imaginary events of the human family . The part that Wall street has played in this amazing progress has been comparatively large , and would in itself , if thoroughly investigated and fully discussed , make a very large book . There is one point to which I wish to call particular attention , because it is one which is unknown to the alleged critics of Wall street methods , and it is one which is marked in comparison with the ways of any other branch of the business of this or any other country . In the commercial or manufacturing world , if it becomes desirable for a business man to borrow money , he does so upon notes which bear his own and perhaps the indorsement signatures of other men who are liable in law for the amount . Now , when a Wall street man wants to borrow money , he takes his note to the bank or to the fellow broker from whom the cash is obtained , but attached to the note is collateral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the market value of which is 10 to 20 per cent . above the amount borrowed , and by the terms of the loan these collateral securities can be sold out at any instant upon the failure of the broker to repay his loan . This is the point in difference , namely , that on Wall street loans the collateral can be turned into cash in the Stock Exchange inside of a few minutes7 time , while upon loans made upon the notes of other business men the collateral can not be turned into cash except through process of court , and the loss of months , and sometimes years , of time . Hence , I say , Wall street loans are more safe and less liable to losses , because of depression in values , than are those in any other . section of the business world . This is demonstrated by the . fact that so many of our banks doing a broker 's business threw up their charters two or three years ago , rather than submit to the // law , which prevented the certification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creditable to Wall street business men , and pleasantly reflected upon the ways and means which have obtained here , that the losses through brokers ' loans have been less during the past decade by-well , say 98 per cent. - than in any other line of business .
