txt The trial of SHORT has resulted in an absurd miscarriage of justice . It is very rarely that an . American Judge tells a jury in a criminal case , as Judge VAN BRUNT yesterday in effect told the jury which acquitted the assailant of PHELAN , that it has rendered a verdict against the law and the evidence . Such rebukes , indeed , are not so common as they ought to be from the Bench . When a Judge goes so far as to deliver one the presumption that the failure of justice is outrageous is very strong . An examination of the evidence in this case bears out this presumption . The most charitable view that can be taken of the verdict is that the jury desired by it to give practical effect to their opinion that the object of SHORT 'S assault was not a meritorious person . This is quite true . It is also quite irrelevant to the case . If SHORT and PHELAN had made an end of each other the community would have been well rid of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the least ornamental . But the law does not license good men to kill or wound bad men . This simple proposition seems often to be beyond the comprehension of juries , which seem incapable of applying the law to the facts of a criminal 's case without going into irrelevant consideration of the character of the person to whose injury the law has been violated . The curious point , in the present case is that the jury , while it was indulging in irrelevant speculation , should not have considered the character of SHORT as well as the character of PHELAN . If PHELAN had succeeded in disabling SHORT , there would have been reason for awarding exemplary punishment against him by reason of his generally objectionable character . But there was the same reason for treating SHORT with severity . Even if there had been evidence that the assault was a scuffle in which SHORT happened to get the start of PHELAN , there was no reason why SHORT should have been let off scot free . There is no pretense that he could not have avoided the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it ' is a direct encouragement to the band of blatherskites and blackguards who either are or pretend to be murderous villains as well . The difference between the two blackguards of whom one was the complainant and the other the culprit in this case was that the complainant was regarded as an " informer " upon the wretched gang to which he belonged , and that the culprit was regarded as the minister of the vengeance of the gang upon him . This fact rendered it especially desirable that SHORT should be severely punished . It is not to be supposed that sympathizers with the Irish thugs who rejoiced in the acquittal of SHORT were among the jurymen . The result seems to be attributed to the feeble and halfhearted manner in which the prosecution was conducted . There is no denying that the agitators by dynamite have altogether too much influence in the local politics of this city , and there is no denying that the local politics have altogether too much to do with the administration of justice . The more creditable is it to Judge VAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be the sentiment of every decent person who has followed the course of the trial which has ended in this scandalous failure of justice .
