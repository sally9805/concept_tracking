txt That is rather a queer report which comes from Dublin that a " meeting of the Catholic hierarchy " has adopted resolutions condemning emigration aided by the State , and pointing out that there are large tracts of land in Ireland itself which , if cultivated , would maintain the surplus population . our objection to receiving emigrants aided by Great Britain to emigrate is perfectly simple . It is that the emigrants so aided have already become a burden upon the land of their birth , and that their acceptance of public aid shows them to be already in some degree pauperized and accustomed to rely upon something else than their own exertions to support them . That is , we refuse them because we believe them to be a source of weakness and not of strength . But our reason for refusing them is of itself a reason why Great Britain should desire to be rid of them . If we are right , there is no occasion at all for any Englishman or any Irishman - to put any ; obstacles in the way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Catholic hierarchy " does not profess to be especially Interested on our account . It takes the ground that we can look out for ourselves . But we do not find anything unreasonable in the desire of Great Britain to get rid of her refuse population . We simply insist that she shall not do so at our expense . In fact , the interests of Ireland and the interests of the United States are diametrically opposed , and if we are right in objecting to this ' emigration as Americans the members of the Catholic hierarchy are wrong in objecting to it as Irishmen . Their suggestion about the uncultivated lands is neither novel nor relevant . The people who have been exported are in actual distress . To object to shifting their support upon a foreign country upon the ground that in the course of a few years they may be able to earn their own dinners on land not now cultivated seems very heartless as well as very senseless . The distress is immediate and urgent ; the relief is very remote . Moreover , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring more land under cultivation looks almost like a misplaced joke . The landlords get no rent to speak of from the land already under cultivation . The Catholic hierarchy points them to the alluring prospect that if they will spend vast sums in reclaiming. other land and bringing it under cultivation they will get no rent for that either . In fact , the " Catholic hierarchy " looks . very much like a mere organ of the Land League . The distress and discontent of the Irish peasantry were the moving causes of the Land League , and they still . constitute its political capital . It is equally true that the same discontent and - distress are the reasons why the " Catholic hierarchy " has retained so firm a hold upon the Irish people . We can not blame either the Land League or the church . for the condition of which they are rather results than causes . But we can blame them for opposing any measures proposed by Gov- , ernment to relieve the distress and allay the discontent to which they themselves owe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frivolous and so factious as the opposition of the " Catholic hierarchy " to State-aided emigration .
