txt One of the commonest pitfalls of our artists seems to be their tendency to seek new methods , to try to reach the goal by short cuts . This is probably duo in good part to the unconscious development of the national character , in part to sympathy with the enterprising , inventive minds about them . It is usual , and especially usual in Europe , to condemn the tendency in , lobo . While it may be true that there is one method of procedure fitted for the mechanical and another for the fine arts , and also that Americans excel as inventors and mechanics , yet the well worn sneer of Europeans that in America the one usurps the other has , after all , only a superficial foundation . Enough instances exist , however , to make the charge not without apparent justice Many of our artists have carried inventiveness too far . In their endeavor to find one or other of certain methods by which , so they fancied , the old masters were able to accomplish the works that all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosopher 's stone . Lately a picture has been exposed in Philadelphia which will tend to encourage the belief that American artists are nothing if not experimental . In the new exhibition of the Philadelphia Society of Artists is a curious instance of the way in which a painter of unusual strength can be led astray by a theory based upon a novelty in photography , and attempt to substitute mere mechanics for the higher processes of art . Several years ago some one in California took it into his head to photograph instantaneously a horse in the act of galloping . The result was a curious and , to the student of optics , most important discovery . A series of instantaneous photographs shows , that at different parts of the same minute the legs of the horse take positions which are not registered by the burned ' eye . The photographs of a horse in quick movement seem all but impossible ; one can hardly believe that the beautiful movement of a thee ough-bred , when analyzed by the instantaneous process , is really composed of a series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovery has come to the knowledge of one of the ablest painters of Philadelphia , and he has seen fit to apply it to a work of art . At the outset , indeed , the Californian discoverer claimed that his diagrams would be of the greatest use to artists . But inventors are in the habit of claiming anything and everything for their inventions . Who would have thought that a true artist . such as the painter undoubtedly is. would be ill-judged enough to take him at his word ? The picture chosen for the attempt shows the four-in-hand of a gentleman well known in the societies of Philadelphia and Newport ; it is supposed to be bowling along through Fairmount Park . The coach and its occupants are admirably painted . But the horses ' logs  --  and there are sixteen of these legs , somewhat bunched together , owing to the foreshortening ? have the appearance of being quite without bones , limber like the trunk of an elephant , swinging beyond their natural positions like the legs of dancing-jacks . The effect would be ludicrous if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stamp of serious work , and work of no mean attainment in art . This comes of the discovery of the Californian . The painter is of such a realistic turn of mind that he wants to ? ompete with the photograph . Not content to paint horses as they appear to the unassisted eye , he wishes to be even more exact than nature , and show us how their legs would look ? if we could photograph them instantaneously on the retina I Fortunately , we can not so photograph them . Fortunately , we can see only the results of the various instantaneous positions . ' We see only the fine movements of the sixteen legs . as they bend to their work , not their ugly analysis . Instead of four horses pinned by the middle to the background and vibrating their boneless , india-rubber pasterns like the legs of a transfixed insect , our eyes , as they are given us , can enjoy the fine forward rush of the team . The attempt to outdo nature has ended by making them look as if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another part of the picture the artist gives the theory its deathblow . If the horses are to no shown instantaneously photographed , why not the wheels also ? If the legs " go limber , " after a fashion which the photograph may prove to be absolutely true , but which the eye can not follow , should not the spokes of the wheels be visible ? For it is also absolutely true that the spokes are there , although we do not see them . But the wheels are blurred between hub and tiro just as they are to the normal eye when they revolve very fast . The whcels , then , are painted es we do see them ; the legs as we do not . If the legs are correct , the wheels are wrong ; if the wheels be true , the legs are false . It is well for artists to keep up with the current of modern inventions , and to take fresh ideas wherever and however they may be presented ; but to apply such an odd corner of photography to paintings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and permanent in art .
