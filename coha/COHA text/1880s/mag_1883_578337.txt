August , ACADEMIC SOCIALISM . IT is a striking tribute - and perhaps the most striking when the most reluctant - to the influence and authority of physical science , that the followers of other sciences ( moral , not physical ) are so often compelled , or at least inclined , to borrow its terms , its methods , and even its established principles . This adaptation commonly begins , indeed , in the way of metaphor and analogy . The natural sympathy of men in the pursuit of truth leads the publicist , for example , and the geologist to compare professional methods and results . The publicist is struck with the superiority of induction , and the convenience of language soon teaches him to distinguish the strata of social development ; to dissect the anatomy of the state ; to analyze political substance ; to observe , collect , differentiate , and generalize the various phenomena in the history of government . This practice enriches the vocabulary of political science , and is offensive only to the sterner friends of abstract speculation . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in moral inquiries the rules , the treatment , the logical implements , all the technical machinery , of sciences which have tangible materials and experimental resources constantly at command . And in the next step the very summit of impiety seems to be reached . The political philosopher is no longer content merely to draw on physical science for metaphors , or even to use in his own way its peculiar methods , but boldly adopts the very substance of its results , and explains the sacred mystery of social progress by laws which may first have been used to fix the status of the polyp or the cray-fish . It is true that this practice has not been confined to any age . There is a distinct revelation of dependence on the method , if not on the results , of the concrete sciences in Aristotle 's famous postulate , that man is " by nature " a political being . The uncompromising realism of Macchiavelli would not dishonor a disciple of Comte . And during the past two hundred years , especially , there is scarcely a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , if at all available , has not been at once appropriated by the publicists and applied to their own uses . The circulation of the blood suggests the theory of a similar process in society , comparative anatomy reveals its structure , the geologic periods explain its stages , and the climax was for the time reached when Frederick the Great , whose logic as well as his poetry was that of a king , declared that a state , like an animal or vegetable organism , had its stages of birth , youth , maturity , decay , and death . Yet striking as are these early illustrations , it is above all in recent times , and under the influence of its brilliant achievements in our own days , that physical science has most strongly impressed its methods and principles on social and political investigation . Mr. Freeman can write a treatise on comparative politics , and the term excites no protest . Sir Henry Maine conducts researches in comparative jurisprudence , and even the bigots are silenced by the copiousness and value of his results . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural selection , which Mr. Bagehot undertook , is hardly treated as paradoxical . The ground being thus prepared - unconsciously during the last century - consciously and purposely during this , for a close assimilation between the physical and the moral sciences , it is natural that men should now take up even the contested doctrine of evolution , and apply it to the progress // of society in general , to the formation of particular states , and to the development of single institutions : Now , if it be the part of political science merely to adapt to its own use laws or principles which have been fully established in other fields of research , it would of course be premature for it to accept as an explanation of its own phenomena a doctrine like that of evolution , which is still rejected by a considerable body of naturalists . But may not political science refuse to acknowledge such a state of subordination ? May it not assert its own dignity , and choose its own method of investigation ? And even though that method be also the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publicist employ it in his own way , subject to the limitations of his own material , and even discover laws contrary to , or in anticipation of , the laws of the physical universe ? If these questions be answered in the affirmative , it follows that the establishment of a law of social and political evolution may precede the general acceptance of the same law by students of the animal or vegetable world . At present , however , such a law is only a hypothesis , - a hypothesis supported , indeed , by many striking facts , and yet apparently antagonized by others not less striking . A sweeping glance over the course of the world 's history does certainly reveal a reasonably uniform progress from a simpler to a more complex civilization . This may also be regarded in one sense as a progress from lower to higher forms ; and if the general movement be established , temporary or local interruptions confirm rather than shake the rule . But flattering as is this hypothesis of progressive social perfection to human nature , it is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laymen the authority of a law . The theologians alone have positive information on the subject . If evolution be taken to mean simply the production of new species from a common parent or genus , and without implying the idea of improvement , the history of many political institutions seems to furnish hints of its presence and its action . Let us take , as an example , the institution of parliaments . The primitive parent assembly of the Greeks was probably a body not unlike the council of Agamemnon 's chieftains in the Iliad ; and from this were evolved in time the Spartan Gerousia , the Athenian Ecclesia , and other legislatures as species , each resembling the original type in some of its principles , yet having others peculiar to itself . Out of the early Teutonic assemblies were produced , in the same way , the Parliament of England , the States-General of France , the Diet of Germany , the Congress of the United States . Yet it may he questioned whether even this illustration supports the doctrine of evolution , and in regard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Take , for example , the jury system . he principle of popular participation in trials for crime has striven for recognition , though not always successfully , in many countries and many ages . But from at least one people , the Germans , and through one line , the English , it maybe traced along a fairly regular course down to the present day . Montesquien calls attention to another case , when , speaking of the division of powers in the English government , he exclaims , " Ce beau syst*me est sorti des bois ! " that is , the forests of Germany . But in all such instances it depends upon the point of view , or the method of analysis , whether the student detects the production of new species from a common genus , or original creation by a conscious author . Even this is not , however , the only difficulty . Evolution means the production of higher , not simply of new , forms ; and the term organic growth // implies in social science the idea of im-. provement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discern in operation . It is easy enough to trace the American Congress back historically to the Witenagemot , to derive the American jury from the Teutonic popular courts , to connect the American city with the municipality of feudal Europe , or of Rome , or even of Greece . The organic relation , or at least the historical affinity , iu these and many other cases is clear . But it is a widely different thing to assert that what is evidently political development or evolution must also be upward progress . This might lead to the conclusion that parliamentary institutions have risen to Cameron and Mahone ; that the Saxon courts have been refined into the Uniontown jury ; and that the art of municipal government has culminated in the city of New York . The truth is that there are two leading classes of political phenomena , the one merely productive , the other progressive , which may in time , and by the aid of large generalizations , be made to harmonize with the doctrine of evolution , but which ought at present to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The first class includes the appearance , in different countries and different ages , of institutions or tendencies similar in character , but without organic connection . The other class includes visible movements , but movements in circles , or otherwise than forward and upward . Both classes may be illustrated by cogent American examples , but it is to the latter that the reader 's attention is now specially invoked . Among the phenomena which have appeared in all ages and all countries , with a certain natural bond of sympathy , and yet without a clearly ascertainable order of progress , one of the earliest and latest , one of the most universal and most instructive , is that tendency or aspiration variously termed agrarian , socialistic , or communistic . The movement appear under different forms and different influences . It may be provoked by the just complaints of an oppressed class , by the inevitable inequality of fortunes , or by a base jealousy of superior moral and intellectual worth . To these and other grievances , real or feigned , correspond as many different forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man demands the humiliation of the Ach or the great , and the artificial exaltation of the poor and the ignorant ; another , the constant interference of the state for the benefit of general or individual prosperity ; a third , the equalization of wealth by discriminating measures ; a fourth , perhaps , the abolition of private property , and the substitution for it of corporate ownership by society . But widely as these schemes differ in degree , they may all be reduced to one general type , or at least traced back to one pervading and peremptory instinct of human nature in all races and all ages . It is the instinctive demand that organized society shall serve to improve the fortunes of individuals , and incidentally that those who are least fortunate shall receive the greatest service . Between the two extreme attitudes held toward this demand , - that of absolute compliance , and that of absolute refusal - range the actual policies of all political communities . For the extremes are open to occupation only by theories ; no state can in practice fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Prussia neglects many charges , or , in other words , leaves to private effort much that a rigid application of the prevailing political philosophy would require it to undertake ; while England conducts by governmental action a variety of interests which the utilitarians reserve to the individual citizen . The real issue is therefore one of degree or tendency . Shall the sphere of the // state 's activity be broad or narrow ; shall it maintain toward social interests an attitude of passive , impartial indifference , or of positive encouragement ; shall the presumption in every doubtful case be in favor of calling in the state , or of trusting individual effort ? Such are , the forms in which the issue may be stated , as well by the publicist as by the legislator . And it is rather by the extent to which precept and practice incline toward the one view or the other , than by the complete adoption of either of two mutually exclusive systems , that political schools are to be classified . This gives us on the one hand the utilitarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on the other the paternal or socialistic theory . Now although this country witnessed an early day the apparent triumph of certain great schemes of policy , such as protection and public improvements , which are clearly socialistic , - I use the term in an inoffensive , philosophical sense , - it is noteworthy that the triumph was won chiefly by the aid of considerations of a practical , economical , and temporary nature . The necessity for a large revenue , the advantage of a diversified industry , the desirability of developing our natural resources , the scarcity of home capital , the expediency of encouraging European immigration , and many other reasons of this sort have been freely adduced . But at the same time the fundamental question of the state 's duties and powers , in other words , the purely political aspect of the subject , was neglected . Nay , the friends of these exceptional departures from the non-interference theory of the state have insisted not the less , as a rule , on the theory itself , while even the exceptions have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and economists , that is to say the specialists , of America . If any characteristic system of political philosophy has hitherto been generally accepted in this country , whether from instinct or conviction , it is undoubtedly the system of Ndam Smith , Bentham , and the Manchester school . There are , however , reasons for thinking that this state of things will be changed in the near future , and that the new school of political economists in the United States will be widely different from the present . This change , if it actually take place , will be due to the influence of foreign teachers , but of teachers wholly unlike those under whose influence we have lived for a century . It has been often remarked that our higher education is rapidly becoming Germanized . Fifty years ago it was only the exceptional and favored few - the Ticknors and Motleys - who crossed the ocean to continue their studies under the great masters of German science ; but a year or two at Leipsic or Heidelberg is now regarded as indispensable to a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true of those who intend themselves to teach . The diploma of a German university is not , of course , an instant and infallible passport to employment in American colleges , but it is a powerful recommendation ; and the tendency seems to be toward a time when it will be almost a required condition . The number of Americans studying in Germany is accordingly now reckoned by hundreds , or even thousands , where it used to be reckoned by dozens . It is within my own knowledge that in at least one year of the past decade the Americans matriculated at the University of Berlin outnumbered every other class of foreigners . And " foreigners " included all who were not Prussians , in other words , even nonPrussian Germans . That this state of things is fraught with vast possible consequences for the intellectual future of America is a proposition which seems hardly open to dispute ; and the only question is about the nature , whether good or bad , of those consequences . // August , My own views on this question are not of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critics if I admit at the outset that in my opinion the effects of this scholastic pilgrimage will in general be wholesome . The mere experience of different academic methods and a different intellectual atmosphere seems calculated both to broaden and to deepen the mind ; it corresponds in a measure to the " grand t6ur , " which used to be considered such an essential part of the education of young English noblemen . The substance , too , of German teaching is always rich , and often useful . But in certain cases , or on certain subjects , it may be the reverse of useful ; and the question presents itself , therefore , to every American student on his way to Germany , whether the particular professor whom he has in view is a recognized authority on his subject , or , in a slightly different form , whether the subject itself is anywhere taught in Germany in a way which it is desirable for him to adopt . In regard to many departments of study , doubts like these can indeed hardly ever arise . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends and neighbors and constituents of a young American about the views which he will probably acquire in Germany on the reforms of Servius Tullius , or the formation of the Macedonian phalanx , or the pronunciation of Sanskrit . Here the scientific spirit and the acquired results of its employment are equally good . But there are other branches of inquiry , in which , though the method may be good , the doctrines are at least open to question . One of these is social science , nsing the term in its very broadest sense , and making it include not only what the late Professor von Mohl called **25;581;TOOLONG , that is , social science in the narrower sense , but also finance , the philosophy of the state , and even law in some of its phases . The rise of the new school of economists in Germany is undoubtedly one of the most remarkable phenomena of modern times . The school is scarcely twenty years old . Dr. Rodbertus , the founder of it , had to fight his cause for years against the combined opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the public . Yet his tentative suggestions have grown into an accepted body of doctrine , which is to-day taught by authority in nearly every German university , is fully adopted by Prince Bismarck , and has in part prevailed even with the imperial Diet . The Catheder-Socialisten are not unknown , at least by name , even to the casual reader of current literature . They are men who teach socialism from the chairs of the universities . It is not indeed a socialism which uses assassination as an ally , or has any special antipathy to crowned heads : it is peaceful , orderly , and decorous ; it wears academic robes , and writes learned and somewhat tiresome treatises in its own defense . But it is essentially socialistic , and in one sense even revolutionary . It has displaced , or rather grown out of , the so-called " historical school " of political economists , as this in its time was a revolt against the school of Adam Smith . The " historical " economists charged against the English school that it was too deductive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ application of conclusions which were in fact only locally true . Their dissent was , however , cautious and qualified , and questioned not so much the results of the English school as the manner of reaching them . Their successors , more courageous or less prudent , reject even the English doctrines . This means that they are , above all things , protectionists . It follows , accordingly , that the young Americans who now study political economy in Germany are nearly certain to return protectionists ; and protectionists , too , in a sense in which the term // has not hitherto been understood in this country . They are scientific protectionists ; that is , they believe that protective duties can be defended by something better than the selfish argument of special industries , and have a broad basis of economic truth . The " American system " is likely , therefore , to have in the future the support of American economic science . To this extent , the influence of German teachings will be welcome to American manufacturers . But protection is with the Germans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from their main doctrine ; and this will not , perhaps , find so ready acceptance in this country . For " the socialists of the chair " are not so much economical as political protectionists . They are chiefly significant as the representatives of a certain theory of the state , which has not hitherto found much support in America . This will be better understood after a brief historical recapitulation . The mercantile system found , when it appeared two centuries ago , a ready reception in Prussia , both on economic and on political grounds . It was singularly adapted to the form of government which grew up at Berlin after the forcible suppression of the Diets . Professor Roscher compares Frederick William I. to Colbert ; and it is certain not only that the king understood the economic meaning of the system , but also that the administration which he organized was admirably fitted to carry it out . Frederick the Great was the victim of the same delusion . In his reign , as in the reign of his father , it was considered to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject affecting the social and pecuniary interests of the people , and to regulate such subjects by the light of a superior bureaucratic wisdom . It was , in short , paternal government in its most highly developed form . But in the early part of this century it began , owing to three cobper ating causes , to decline . The first cause was the circumstance that the successors of Frederick were not fitted , like him and his father , to conduct the system with the patient personal attention and the robust intelligence which its success required of the head of the state . The second influence was the rise of new schools of political economy and of political philosophy , and the general diffusion of sounder views of social science . And in the third place , the French Revolution. , the Napoleonic wars , and the complete destruction of the ancient bases of social order in Germany revealed the defects of the edifice itself , and made a reconstruction on new principles not only possible , but even necessary . The consequence was the agrarian reforms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some degree of self-government , the agitation for parliaments , which even the Congress of Vienna had to recognize , and other measures or efforts in the direction of decentralization and popular enfranchisement . King Frederick William III . appointed to the newly created Ministry of Instruction and Public Worship William von Humboldt , the author of a treatise on the limits of the state 's power , which a century earlier would have been burned by the common hangman . In 1818 Prussia adopted a new tariff , which was a wide departure from the previous policy , and in its turn paved the way for the Zollverein , which struck down the commercial barriers between the different German states , and practically accepted the principle of free trade . The course of purely political emancipation was indeed arrested for a time by the malign influence of Metternich , but even this was resumed after 1848 . In respect to commercial policy there was no reaction . That the events of 1866 and 1870 , leading to the formation , first , of the North German Confederation , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not to check , the work of liberation , and down to a certain point did favor it , is matter of familiar recent history . The doctrines of the Manchester school were held by the great body of the people , taught by the professors , and embodied in the national policy , so far as they concerned freedom of trade . On their political side , too , they were accepted by a large and influential class of liberals . Few Germans held , indeed , the extreme " non-interference " theory of government ; but the prevailing tone of thought , and even the general policy of legislation , was , until about ten years ago , in favor of unburdening the state of some of its usurped charges ; of enlarging in the towns and counties the sphere of self-government ; and of granting to individuals a new degree of initiative in respect to economical and industrial interests . But about the middle of the past decade the current began to turn . The revolt from the doctrines of the Manchester school , initiated , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not at first looked on with favor by governments , gradually acquired both numbers and credit . The professors one by one joined the movement . And finally , when Prince Bismarck threw his powerful weight into the scale , the utilitarians were forced upon the defensive . They had to resist first of all the Prussian scheme for the acquisition of private railways by the state , and they were defeated . They were next called upon to defend in the whole Empire the cause of free trade . This battle , too , they lost , and in an incredibly short space of time protection , which had been discredited for half a century , was fully restored . Then the free city of Hamburg was robbed of its ancient privileges , and forced to accept the common yoke . Some minor socialistic schemes of the chancellor have been , indeed , temporarily frustrated by the Diet , but repeated efforts will doubtless break down the re sistance . The policy even attacks the functions of the Diet itself , as is shown both by actual projects and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , so far as protection is concerned , this movement may seem to many Americans to be in principle a return to wisdom . In fact , not even American protectionists enjoy the imposition of heavy duties on their exported products ; but the recognition of their system of commercial policy by another state undoubtedly gives it a new strength and prestige , and they certainly regard it as an unmixed advantage that their sons , who go abroad to pursue the scientific study of political economy , will in Germany imbibe no heresies on the subject of tariff methods . Is this , however , all that they are likely to luarn , and if not , will the rest prove equally commendable to the great body of thoughtful Americans ? This is the same thing as asking whether local self-government , trial by jury , the common law , the personal responsibility of officials , frequent elections , in short , all the priceless conquests of Anglican liberty , all that distinguishes England and America from the continent of Europe , are not as dear to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rails out of iron ore , as to any free-trade professor of political economy . To state this question is to answer it ; for it can be shown that , as a people , we have cause not for exultation , but for grave anxiety , over the class of students whom the German universities are annually sending back to America . If these pilgrims are faithful disciples of their masters , they do not return merely as protectionists , with their original loyalty to Anglo-American theories of government otherwise unshaken , but as the advocates of a political system which , if adopted and literally carried out , would wholly change the spirit of our institutions , and destroy all that is oldest and noblest in our national life . // Protection , it was said above , is not the main doctrine of the German professors , but only an inference from their general system . It is not an economical , much less a financial , expedient . It is a policy which is derived from a theory of the state 's functions and duties ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from that which prevails in this country . It assumes as postulates the ignorance of the individual and the omniscience of the government . The government , in this view , is therefore bound , not simply to abstain from malicious interference with private enterprises , not simply so to adjust taxation that all interests may receive equitable treatment , but positively to exercise a fatherly care over each and every branch of production , and even to take many of them into its own hands . All organizations of private capital are regarded with suspicion ; they are at best tolerated , not encouraged . Large enterprises are to be undertaken by the state ; and even the petty details of the retail trade are to be controlled to an extent which would seem intolerable to American citizens . And this is not the whole , or , perhaps , the worst . The " state , " in this system , means the central government , and , besides that , a government removed as far as possible from parliamentary iri'fiuence and public opinion . The superior wisdom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual sagacity , means , as in the time of Frederick the Great , the wisdom of the bureaucracy . Now it may be freely granted that in Prussia , and even throughout the rest of the Empire , this is generally wisdom of a high order . It is represented by men whose integrity is above suspicion . But the principle of the system is not the less obnoxious , and its tendencies , if introduced in this country , could not be otherwise than deplorable . this proposition , if the German school has been correctly described , needs no further defense . If Americans are prepared to accept the teachings of Wagner , Held , Schmoller , and others , with all which those teachings imply , - a paternal government , a centralized political authority , a bureaucratic administration , Roman law , and trial by executive judges , - the new school of German publicists will be wholly unobjectionable . But before such a system can be welcome , the American nature must first be radically changed . There are , indeed , evidences other than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not commonly defended on political grounds - that this change has already made some progress . One of these is the growing fashion of looking to legislation , that is , to the state , for relief in cases where individual or at least privately organized collective effort ought to suffice . It is a further evil , too , that the worst legislatures are invariably the ones which most promptly respond to such demands . The recent act of the State of New York making the canals free , though not indefensible in some of its aspects , was an innovation the more significant since the leading argument of its supporters was distinctly and grossly socialistic . This was the argument that free canals would make low freights , and low freights would give the poor man cheaper bread . For this end the property of the State is henceforth to be taxed . A movement of the same nature , and on a larger scale , is that for a government telegraph ; and if successful , the next scheme will be to have the railways likewise acquired by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be given , but these show the tendency to which allusion is made . It is significant that such projects can be even proposed ; but that they can he seriously discussed , and some of them actually adopted , shows that the stern jealousy of governmental interference , the di*po // sition rigidly to circumscribe the state 's sphere of action , which once characterized the people of the republic , has lost , though unconsciously , a large part of its force . No alarm or even surprise is now excited by propositions which the founders of the Union would have pronounced fatal to free government . Some other symptoms , though of a more subtle kind , are the multiplication of codes ; the growing use of written pro . cedure , not only in the courts and in civil administration , but even in legislation ; and , generally speaking , the tendency to adopt the dry , formal , pedantic method of the continent , thereby losing the old English qualities of ease , fJexibility , and natural strength . But , as already said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rarely perceived even by their strongest advocates . They are casual expedients , not steps in the development of a systematic theory of the state . Indeed , their authors and friends would be per . haps the first to resent the charge that they were in conflict with the political traditions of America , or likely to prepare the way for the reception of new and subversive doctrines . Yet nothing better facilitates a revolution in a people 's modes or habits of thought than just such a series of practical measures . The time at length arrives when some comprehensive genius , or a school of sympathetic thinkers , calmly codifies these preliminar*4*ough unsuspected concessions , and makes them the basis of a firm , complete , and symmetrical structure . It is then found that long familiarity with some of the details in practice makes it comparatively simple for a people to accept the whole system as a conviction of the mind . Such a school has not hitherto existed in this country . There have of course always been shades of difference between publicists and philosophers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the division between gov Academic &amp;cialism . August , erumental patronage and private exertion has not always been drawn along the same line . But these differences have been neither great nor constant . They distinguished rather varieties of the same system than different and radically hostile systems . The most zealous and advanced of the former champions of state interference would now probably be called utihitarians by the pupils of the new German school . It has been the purpose of this paper to describe briefly the tendencies of that school , and to indicate the effects which its patronage by American youth is likely to have on the future of our political thought . The opinion was expressed that much more is acquired in Germany than a mere belief in the economic wisdom of protection . And it may be added , to make the case stronger , that the German system of socialism may be learned without the doctrine of protection on its economic side . For the university socialists assert only the right , or at most the duty , of the state actively to interfere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise of this right or the fulfillment of this duty may , in a given case , lead to a protective tariff ; in Germany , at pr*sent , it does take that form . But in another case it may lead to free trade . The decision is to be determined by the economic circumstances of the country and the moment ; only it is to be positive and active even if in favor of free trade , and not a merely negative attitude of indifference . In other words , free trade is not assumed to be the normal condition of things , and protection the exception . Both alike require the active intervention of government in the performance of its duty to society . But with or without protection , the body of the German doctrine is full of plausible yet vicious errors , which few reflecting Americans would care to see introduced and become current in their own country . The prevailing idea is // that of the ignorance and wehkness of the individual , the omniscience and omnipotence of the state . This is not yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accepted American view . Now I am not one of those who are likely to condemn a thing because it is foreign . It may be frankly conceded that in the present temper of German politics , and even of German social and political science , there is much that is admirable and worthy of imitation . The selection of trained men alone for administrative office , the great l*sson that individual convenience must often yield to the welfare of society , the conception of the dignity of politics and the majesty of the state , - these are things which we certainly need to learn , and which Germany can both teach and illustrate . But side by side with such fundamental truths stand the most mischievous fallacies , and an enthusiastic student is not always sure to make the proper selection . It seems to me that in political doctrine , as in so many other intellectual concerns of society , this country is now passing through an important crisis . We are engaged in a struggle between the surviving traditions of our English ancestors and the influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continent . It is by no means certain , however desirable , that victory will rest with those literary , e ( lucational , and political instincts which we acquired with our English blood , and long cherished as among our most precious possessions . The tendency now certainly is in a different direction , as has already been discovered by foreign observers . Some of Tocqueville 's acute observations have nearly lost their point . Mr. Frederic Pollock , in an essay recently published by an English periodical , mentions the gradual approach of America toward continental views of law and the state . There is , undoubtedly , among the American people a large conservative element , which , if its attention were once aroused , would show an unconquerable attachment to those principles of society and government common to all the English peoples , under whatever sky they may be found . But at present the current is evidently taking a different course . It would , however , be a grave mistake to regard this hostile movement as a forward one . Not everything new is reform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet it is also not real conservatism . The true American conservatives , in the present crisis , are the men who not only respect the previous achievements of Anglo-Saxon progress , but also wisely adhere to the same order of progress , with a view to continued benefits in the future ; while their enemies , though in one sense radicals , are in another simply the disguised servants of reaction , since they reject both the hopes of the future and the lessons of the past . They bring forward as novelties in scholastic garb the antique errors of remote centuries . The same motives , the same spirit , the same tendency , can be ascribed to the agrarian laws of the Gracchi , the peasant uprisings in the Middle Ages , the public granaries of Frederick the Great , the graduated income - tax of Prussia , the Land League agitation in Ireland , the river and harbor bills in this country . They differ only in die degree in which special circumstances may seem to render a given measure more or less justifiable . The special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manifestations , whether they have an organic connectioii or only an accidental resemblance , reveal no improvement whatever in quality , no progress in social enlightenment . The records of political government from the earliest dawn of civilization will be searched in vain for a more reckless and brutal measure of // class legislation than the Bland silver bill , which an American Congress passed in the year 1878 . It is the same with the pompous syilogisms on which the German professors are trying to build up their socialistic theory of the state . Everything which they have to say was said far better by Plato two thousand years ago . I1* they had absolute control of legislation , they could not surpass the work of Lycurgus . It is useless for them to try to hide their plagiarism under a cloud of pedantic sophistry ; for the most superficial critic will not fail to see that , instead of originating , they are only borrowing , and even borrowing errors of theory and of policy which have been steadily retreating before the advance of political education . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything else distinguishes the modern from the ancient state , and distinguishes it favorably ? the unhesi tating reply from every candid persoa would be , The greater importance conceded to the individual . We have attained this result through a long course of arduous and painful struggles . The progress has not , indeed , been uninterrupted , nor its bearings always perceived ; but the general , and through large periods of time uniform , tendency has been to disestablish and disarm the state , to reduce government to narrow limits , and to assert the dignity of the individual citizen . And now the question is , Shall this line of progress be abruptly abandoned ? Shall we confess that we have been all this time moving only in a circle ; that what we thought was progress in a straight line is only revolution in a fixed orbit ; and that society is doomed to return to the very point from which it started ? The academic socialism invites us to begin the backward march , but must its invitation be accepted ? Herbert Tattle.   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
