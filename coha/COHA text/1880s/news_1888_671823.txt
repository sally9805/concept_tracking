txt The General Term of the Supreme Court in this city last . week handed down a batch of one hundred and forty-four decisions on appeal . In more than fifty of the cases there was a reversal or modification of the decision of the court below . Strictly speaking , there were forty-five reversals and six Modifications . In only ninety-three cases were the decisions appealed from sustained . The great bulk of the reversals , it is also proper to state , were of judgments as distinguished from mere intermediate orders . If this proportion is kept up it will mean that the court below , in the judgment of the General Term bench , errs fatally in every third case appealed from . This percentage , it is needless to say , is altogether too large , and the announcement of the fact of so many reversals should stimulate inquiry as to its cause with a view to providing a remedy . In the fifty-one cases mentioned there is such a serious divergence of opinion between the Judges at Special or Trial Term and those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one or the other set has mistaken the law . There is no middle ground . One set must be right and the other must be wrong . Now , such a series of mistakes is no ' trifling matter , not only to the suitors and other persons directly concerned , but also to the general public . Counting the costs , expenses , fees , &c.,; of the litigants and the public cost of maintaining the Judges and attendants needed to try and re-try the cases , it is a moderate estimate to place the damage caused by the fifty-one reversals at $15,000 . When to this are added the losses caused by delay and the annoyances and deprivations to which the jurors and others indirectly concerned are subjected to , the sum mentioned may be doubled without in anywise being extravagant as a measure of the monetary waste caused by the reversals . . It is also pertinent at this point to consider the further delays , expenses , and annoyances to other suitors and the detriment to the administration of justice involved in the sending back for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided or passed ** in the first instance . Beyond this , too , comes the graver question of the uncertainty of the law , which would seem to be so little understood , even by Judges of the highest court of original jurisdiction in the State that they must needs err in one out of every three cases submitted to them for decision , Here is evidently a fertile lield'of research for the law reformers . The questions that should be decided are apparent . Who or what is to blame ? Are the laws at fault ? Are they too vague and indefinite , or are they so framed as to encourage reversals of judgments on mere quibbles or technicalities not involving the real equities or justice of a ease ? Or , if there is no fault to be found with the laws , does the blame lie with the Judges ? If the latter are culpable is it because they lack knowledge or because they avoid giving duo care and attention to the trial of causes ? These seem to be pertinent questions , audit well behooves @ @ @ @ @ @ @
