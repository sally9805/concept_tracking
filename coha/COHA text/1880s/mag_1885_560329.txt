AFTER reading for the third or fourth time , " George Eliot 's Life , as Related in her Letters and Journals , " arranged and edited by her second husband , J.W. Cross , our first favorable impression of Mr. Cross has deepened with each fresh examination of his work . In no other biography of the kind is there such a complete selfeffacement of the biographer in the subject of his biography . He presents his wife as she lived and labored in her high calling , but he intrudes himself simply to connect the letters and journals into something like a consistent narrative . The reader constantly complains that he has not made his own contributions to the book more voluminons and more luminous . He tells us little or nothing of some matters which he must have thoroughly known , and which he must have felt that his readers ached to know . All the mysteries of George Eliot 's life are left unexplained , or only partially explained . His only aim seems to have been to make his work an autobiography , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With exasperating modesty and diffidence he declines to venture an opinion on some matters as to which the admirers of George Eliot are divided in opinion . He evidently adores his wife , thinks that what she says in defense of her conduct is a final judgment which no courts in Christendom can overrule , and only appears to state the conditions under which a letter was written , and disappears the moment the information is given . Indeed , as far as Mr. Cross enters into this autobiography of George Eliot he leaves the impression of a somewhat shy gentleman , but still a gentleman of unmistakable honor , intelligence , and integrity . If any faults are to be found in his editorial labors , they are faults of omission and not of commission . Indeed , if any admirer of George Eliot 's writings expected to fiud in these volumes much which would throw new light on the // genesis and processes of her genius , he is doomed to disappointment . The letters are genuine letters , without a trace of insincerity or affectation ; but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her creations . The pangs of childbirth are usually considered the most dreadful physical torments entailed on women for the sin or indiscretion of Eve . In reading this biography we are made to believe that they are slight in comparison with the pangs of bookbirth . A third , at least , of her lcttcrs and journals is taken up with distressing accounts of her attacks of headache , dyspepsia , rheumatism , and other miseries connected with a frail and infirm bodily constitution . Throughout the work one gets the general impression that he is following , week after week , month after month , the life of an invalid . He hardly seems competent at any time to produce the great works of genius which bear her name . Her spiritual health , when we recur to her novels , seems strangely at variance with the almost constant physical ill health , which she ruefully records in her letters . We can hardly recall another instance of a mind so strong , broad , hardy , beautiful , heroic , and creative , lodged in a body so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a letter written when she was twentyone years old , she says she can not " attack Mrs. Somerville 's connexion of the Physical Sciences " until she has applied four leeches to her suffering head . It was the noble soul in the weak frame that burst through all these obstructions and overcame all these difficulties . As the world goes , she might , like her weak sisters in invalidism , have been justified in leading the life of an effortless valetudinarian , fearful every moment that activity of any kind would brincr back her headaches , and plaintively demanding of the b healthier members of her family a constant attention to her wants and her whims . It is frightful to think how many inmates of otherwise happy households are cursed by the care they have to bestow on some sick sensitive and selfish relative , who commonly contrives to survive them all . When we say , however , that the correspondence of George Eliot dwells too much on her constantly recurring bodily troubles , we do not mean that her letters , taken as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for they are full of keen observation , weighty thoughts , penetrating glances into the problems of human life , and descriptions of scenery which are as notable for their accuracy as for their vividness and power . When she first appeared // as a novelist she was about thirty-seven years old . We remember that , after reading the first chapters of " Scenes of Clerical Life , " published in " Blackwood 's Magazine , " we were both charmed and puzzled-charmed by the style , and puzzled as to whom , among living celebrities , could the authorship be ascribed ; for the writer was evidently a great master of English prose , and his sentences had the last grace of good prose-that of exquisite rhythm . No novice could have written " Amos Barton , " for on every page was the evidence that it proceeded from the mind of a person long practiced in the art of forcing language to convey thought and feeling with perfect exactness , and , at the same time , with perfect ease and freedom . The private letters and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prose writer , in her correspondence with intimate friends , long before the " Scenes of Clerical Life " were dreamed of ; yet hardly one of these friends discovered that she was the George Eliot who was talked about in all literary circles , until she confided the fact to such persons as she thought would keep the secret as long as she thought it could be kept from the public . It is hardly necessary to dwell at length on the first period of her life . She was the child of a thoroughly practical and a thoroughly honest man of the English middle class , but at the same time a man limited in his conceptions to what are called Tory notions in church and State . Caleb Garth in " Middlemarch " is an idealized yet substantially truthful representation of her father . To this father she was literally true to the death . She was the only genius born in the family . Her brothers and sisters doubtless grew up to be admirable specimens of the average virtue and intelligence of the middle classes of Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plain people " - the people who , in England as in the United States , have done the work which has aided the slow progress of that real civilization which is gradually lifting the lower and dependent classes into a higher rank among the forces which control the politics of the few nations on the globe which have arrived to the dignity of being ruled by constitutional governments . But the one daughter of this excellent family , in whose career we are especially interested , was a thinker from her childhood , and at the same time the most affectionate of human beings . She could not , as a girl , live without love , and could not accept an opinion or a creed which she had // not verified by her own vital experience , whether the experience came from the exercise of her reason or from the feelings of her heart . As she grew up into womanhood , she was overcome by the emotional side of Evangelical Christianity , and her whole soul was absorbed in it . It afforded her what she thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were perfect selfsacrifice for the good of others , and an awful sense of the obligations of duty . In this period of her life she showed all the peculiarities which prophesied a new Protestant saint . She knew enough , as she thought , of the pleasures of the world to appreciate all their value , and to condemn them as valueless . She was overcome by the sense of sin , even in indulging in what the general theological sense of the world has come to consider comparatively sinless . She had , as a woman of genius , an instinctive sense of the splendor and beauty of the great authors she had read and assimilated , and yet she had a fear that her intense appreciation of exceptional but still unsanctified genius might be a grievous violation of her duty . Her letter to Miss Lewis , at the age of twenty , on the bad effects of novels , illustrates her renunciation of even the cherished companions of her youthful years . She had , at the age of eight , a passionate admiration of " Waverley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrendered her delight in the novels of Scott . She read books which taught that the indulgence of her taste for even innocent works of fiction might lead her down to perdition . Her sense of the folly of this extreme creed kept her on the sane path of reasonable evangelicism ; but she persisted in it until she read the works of Isaac Taylor . This good Christian , in his many books , especially in his " Physical Theory of a Future Life , " and in his elaborate discussion of facts connected with " Ancient Christianity , " unsettled , in her mind , that faith in the Christian religion it was designed to establish on an indestructible foundation . The book which completed the work of making her reject all orthodox creeds was Charles Hennell 's " Inquiry Concerning the Origin of Christianity . " When , afterwards , she met , in Lond%Jn , Mackay , Lewes , Herbert Spencer , not to mention others , all her old theological opinions were cast aside by her understanding , while they still held a strange influence over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest efforts in characterization are those which embody men or women of religious genius . As far as we remem // ber , there is not a single character in any of her novels who attracts our sympathies by his skepticism . The intense experience through which she passed as an unquestioning Christian animates all her novels . In her life she never swerved from religion , as she understood it . In all her published letters she expresses something like horror at vulgar irreligion . No novelist or dramatist has approached her in her singular power of embodying religious character ; and the reason is that she had " experienced " religion vitally . All after-addition of skepticism added not any element to her power . To the last she made religion the central part of life , for in religion she found her deepest belief that self-sacrifice for others was the fundamental base of all ethics , and that to give humanity what a Yankee might call " a shove forwards " was the greatest thing that the best and noblest men and women could hope , in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her life is that , in matters regarding religion , she allowed her understanding to adopt opinions which her deepest reason and affections repudiated . Her heart ever gave the lie to her head " The best good Christian she , Although she knew it not . " But the fact remains that in her published wcrks the reader would search in vain for any indication of her private skeptical tendencies . What some liberal critics would call the great mistake of her life , if not , as both English and American matronhood assert , the great blot on her character , was her marriage to George H. Lewes . According to English law the marriage was illegal . The wife of Mr. Lewes abandoned him after committing adultery ; she felt , or pretended to feel , remorse for her conduct , and was received back into the household she had dishonored . Then some new seducer tempted her to fly away from her husband and children . The home became homeless . By a technicality of English law , Lewes had forfeited his right to be divorced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of compassion , he had received her back as his " lawfully " wedded wife . In this condition , as a twice-dishonored husband , he met with Miss Evans . He was fascinated by her , and she gradually became fascinated by him . There was no outward beauty en either side ; Lewes was one of the homeliest men in Great Britain , and Miss Evans had no personal attractions , if we cxcept // the sweetness of her voice and the singular beauty of expression in her eyes . Each saw the visage of the other " in the mind . " Miss Evans , repudiating the technicality of the English law , consented to be united to Mr. Lewes , went abroad with him , was married to him , we think , in some foreign city , and returned to England a kind of social rebel , frowned upon by all women except those intimate friends who knew her motives and never faltered in their friendship . As she never sought " society , " and rather disliked it , she bore with exemplary patience all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Seven years before her union we find in one of her letters this remark about the novel of " Jane Eyre , " then the literary sensation of the season " All self-sacrifice is good , but one would like it to be in a somewhat nobler cause than that of a diabolical law which chains a man soul and body to a putrefying carcass . " After her marriage , she wrote to her friend Mrs. Bray that " any unworldly , unsuperstitious woman who is sufficiently acquainted with the realities of life can pronounce my relations to Mr. Lewes immoral ; I can only understand by remembering how subtile and complex are the influences which mold opinion . " Whatever may be thought of the legality or morality of the connection , there can be no doubt it led to the happiest results to both parties . Lewes had been practically homeless for two years . There was danger that his children would grow up uneducated and uncared for . He was fast drifting into Bohemian habits . Four years after his new marriage , Mrs. Lewes states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more blessed-more and more complete . " A few weeks after , Lewes writes in his journal that he owes an intellectual debt of gratitude to Herbert Spencer . He says : " My acquaintanee with him was the brightest ray in a very dreary , wasted period of my life . . . . I owe him another and deeper debt . It was through him that I learned to know Marion  --  to know her was to love her  --  and since then my life has been a new birth . To her I owe all my prosperity and happiness . God bless her ! " It is curious that on this first introduction he did not make a favorable impression . He was a brilliant converser on all topics that come up for discussion at a dinner table , was one of the best story-tellers in London , was a man of various accomplishments , // seeming to know everything without having thoroughly mastered anything , and with a self-confidence and self-sufficiency which offended many grave people who were not captivated by his wit and pleasantry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party , and in a letter to Doctor Channing records her dislike of him as a flippant , pretentious and irreverent person . Miss Evans , on first seeing him , says that in appearance he was " a miniature Mirabean . " In March , 1853 , he seems to have overcome her repugnance , for she says , " Lewes is always genial and amusing . He has quite won my liking in spite of myself . " A month after he had avanced in her opinion , for she writes to Mrs. Bray : " Lewes especially is kind and attentive to me , and has quite won my regard after having had a good deal of my vituperation . Like a few other peepie in the world , he is much better than he seems  --  a man of heart and conscience wearing a mask of flippancy . " During the next fifteen months he gained her love-love , we think , horn somewhat of compassion in considering his desolate home and neglected children , but which , after their union , ripened into an intensity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completing any of her great books , the manuscript concludes with a dedication of the work to her " dear husband . " The manuscript of " iRomola " may be selected as an example . The inscription runs thus " To the husband whose perfect love has been the best source of her insight and strength , this manuscript is given by his devoted wife and writer . " " Romola " was the novel which , of all her works , most tasked the energies of her mind , and most exhausted her bodily strength . " I began it , " she said to Mr. Cross , " a young woman-I finished it an old woman . " Yet the inscription of " Middlemareh " to Lewes , nine years after , shows that the " 01 ( 1 woman " still glowed with undiminished affection for her " George , " as she lovingly called him : " To my dear husband , George Henry Lewes , in this nineteenth year of our blessed union . " Indeed , the honey-moon , in the case of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband . Lewes himself was also immensely benefited by his marriage . // She was his salvation . All the works for which he will be remembered were written in the years when her ardent sympathy with his labors was at once his inspiration and his guide . His love and reverence for her were unbonnded , and exhibited on all occasions , public as well as private . Mr. Estcott has , since the autobiography was published , given quite a vivid picture of him as he appeared at the Sunday receptions of his wife : " The function , " he says , " was more like a religious ceremonial than a social reunion , and Mr. Lewes played to perfection the part of Hierophant . The gifted lady sat in the center of a crowd of worshipers , of whom some were permitted to hold personal converse with her . But the majority gazed at her reverently and mutely from afar , as if they were looking upon the Beatific Yision . If any one spoke in too loud a tone , or spoke at all . when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once met with a hush ' of reprehension by Mr. Lewes , and was made to feel that he had perpetrated a sort of impiety . " He continues : " George Eliot had unquestionably immeasurable charm of mind , manner , and conversation for those who knew her well ; but I must say that I never advanced beyond the outer circle of worshipers , and that I always felt myself one of the Levites at the gate . " We have heard a number of visitors at these receptions , both those who were in the inner and those who were in the outer circle , relate their experiences , and they all agree in ascribing to Mr. Lewes this devotional air and attitude to his wife , while those who happencd to be in the inner circle on such occasions agree in ascribing to Mrs. Lewes the charm of unpretentious , unassuming modesty of behavior while conversing with such thinkers as Spencer and Mill . But perhaps we owe to this marriage-illegal in a technical point of view , but violating no principle of absolute moralitythe great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eliot illustrions , and which promise to live as long as the English literature of the nineteenth century interests people who speak the English language . When she first thought of writing a story , he doubted whether she had the power of dramatic presentation . Still he urged her to try , and in less than two months she wrote the first of the " Scenes of Clerical Life " - that devoted to the sad fortunes of " Amos Barton . " Lewes at once appreciated it , and sent it to John Blackwood for publication in " Blackwood 's // Magazine . " He was just the person to look after his wife 's interests in dealing with publishers . He saved her from all the annoyances connected with authorship , and finding that she was susceptible to that commonest kind of criticism which ignores the writer 's aim and purpose , he at last selected for her reading all those portions of contemporary comments on her works which would please her , and concealed from her all those which betrayed ignorance , envy , or malice and prejudice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or flattered-she was superior to that iguoble ambitionbut her sensitive nature was hurt by reading a criticism which misconceived the whole spirit of the work on which she had conscientiously expended months of labor , and every page of which represented an expenditure of vitality which her weak physical frame could ill spare . Criticism which indicated an interior glance into the processes of her mind , and proved that the critic had , for the time , assumed her point of view before objecting to her treatment of a subject , was always welcome to her ; but purely external criticism , which condemned without in the least understanding her , had the effect of throwing her into long moods of depression , during which she felt as if the very sources of her creative activity were smitten as by paralysis . Lewes did her great service by not allowing her to be disturbed by reviews which could do her no good , but which might do her much evil . And then , at the time of their union they were poor , and they were called upon not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support the wretched mother of his children  --  the last task one of almost superhuman benevolence . They had to look sharply at every sixpence that was spent , and often deprive themselves of the simplest pleasures . Now Lewes knew , to a farthing , the exact money-value of every drop of ink which flowed from his wife 's pen . It is refreshing to observe that , from the moment the success of the " Scenes of Clerical Life ' * indicated the province of literature that the genius of George Eliot , as distinguished from her talent , was to enrich with new and original works , money poured into the family with almost bewildering rapidity . For " Adam Bede " Blackwood gave her ? 800 for four years ' copyright ; its success was so great that he sent her voluntarily an additional ? 400 before the first year of its publication had elapsed ; and then came another ? 800 for the second year after the agreement . It was evident that Blackwood felt that he had ob // tamed a great prize in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prize by his liberality . For " The Mill on the Floss " he gave ? 2,000 for the first edition of 4,000 copies . When " Romola " was in preparation , Smith , Elder &amp; Co. offered ? 10,000 for the copyright at home and abroad , and they finally paid ? 7,000 for its serial publication in the " Coruhill Magazine . " For " Middlemarch " and " Daniel Deronda " the author must have received much larger sums . The Harpers , of New York , paid ? 1,200 merely for the advance sheets of " Middlemarch . " In November , 1859 , she writes to a friend that the offers made to her by rival publishers are so great , that if she could be seduced by them she might have written three poor novels , and made her fortune in a year . " Happily , " she adds , " I have no need to exert myself when I say , Avaunt thee , Satan ! Satan , in the form of bad writing and good pay , is not seductive to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space prevents us from entering upon an elaborate consideration of many topics that these volumes suggest . We have said that they do not shed so much new light on the interior facts and processes of her mind as the reader could wish . There is one passage , however , in a letter to John Blackwood , while she was engaged in writing " The Mill on the Floss , " which is suggestive of her method . " My stories , " she says , " grow in me like plants , and this is only in the leaf-bud . I have faith that the flower will come . Not enough faith , though , to make me like the idea of beginning to print till the flower is fairly outtill I know the end as well as the beginning . " This indicates her marvelous power of representing character as it grows . Dickens once said that in reading the novels of many of his contemporaries it appeared to him as if the authors lived next door to their characters . " Now , " he added , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eliot might , with even greater truth , have said this of her own creations . She placed herself , by imagination and sympathy , at the inmost core of the natures of her characters , and delineated them from within , not approached them from without . She did not merely look at them , but she looked into them , and also looked through them to the spiritual laws they obeyed or violated . She kept a sort of relentless watch on all the subtle , interior movements of their minds and hearts , and they could not pass into a dreaming sleep without being still subject to this piercing glance into the fantasies and wild incidents of their dreams . // It has always seemed to us that the genius and character of George Eliot widened and deepened as the years passed on , and that " Romolo , " " Middlemarch , " and " Daniel iDeronda " are the greatest of her works . They certainly show that she did not repeat the characters she had once depicted , but enlarged her field of characterization with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there can be no doubt that Lewes , after his union with her , became a much better man and a much abler writer than before . He produced , by patient thought and study , several scientific works of decided merit . The union between the two continued " blessed " up to the day of his unexpected death , which occurred in November , 1878 . The shock to her of this event was terrible . She at last recovered sufficiently to see her intimate friends , and to arrange her husband 's MSS. for publication . In every duty she was called upon to perform she was cordially assisted by Mr. J. W. Cross , with whom and with whose family she had enjoyed an uninterrupted friendship for more than thirteen years . He had such a love and reverence for her that it is hardly a matter of wonder that the friendship ended in marriage , about eighteen months after the death of Mr. Lewes . She lived only a little more than seven months afterwards , dying on the 22d of December , 1880 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well serve as the conclusion of this brief article " The place that may belong to her in the minds and in the hearts of future generations will be finally adjudged on the merits of her works . We who write and we who read to-day will never know that final verdict , but I think that those of us who loved her may trust to it with confidence . " EDWIX P. WHIPPLE.
