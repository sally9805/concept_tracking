txt At noon to-day one of the boldest robberies ever known in Ohio and the largest , measured by the amount taken , ever chronicled in Cleveland , occurred in the Commercial National Bank . The President , Dan P. Eells , was the loser , and $117,000 in railroad bonds was the property taken . At the time Mr. Eells was talking to George H. Ely , a heavy iron and ship owner , in the rear room of the bank , which is situated in the National Bank Building , at Water and Superior streets . The bonds had been brought from the vault in a pasteboard box . and Mr. Eells had been engaged in cutting off coupons . When Mr. Ely came in the bonds were replaced in the box and left on the table . While they were engaged in conversation a quiet and mild-mannered young man came in and , as though waiting for a chance to speak to Mr. Eells , sat down on a chair a few feet away and said . nothing . Howard Eel 's , son of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father 's , but with a high back between the two . What then occurred is told in Howard 's language , as follows : " I was sitting at my desk , talking with a gentleman named Crittenden . I remember the time because , having forgotten to wind up my watch last night I had just set it running . It was 11:45 o'clock . My father was talking to George H. Ely . We were in this position when a well-dressed man came in and took a seat about four feet from my father . I remember that he was a gentlemanly appearing man , but I remarked to Mr. Crittenden that he was rather cheeky , not because he came into father 's office , but because he sat so near my father and Mr. Ely , who naturally did not want their conversation overheard . Mr. Ely stood between father and the man with his back to the latter . Mr. Ely soon changed his position and moved to the desk opposite father and next to the window . Father , in listening to him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stranger . I continued talking to Mr. Crittenden , having first told him that I had a mind to ask the man what he wanted . I was prevented from seeing what was going on by the tall portion of the desk between me and my father . Mr. Crittenden , however , saw the man go out leisurely and hesitate once or twice as it half a mind to come back . When father turned around , after a few minutes ' talk with Mr. Ely , he found that the bonds , which had been laid at his left elbow before turning around , were missing . " Mr. Hells , on finding the bonds gone , rushed into the bank vestibule , but the man was nowhere to be seen . The case was at once reported to the Police , Mr. Eells offering a reward of $5,000 for the recovery of the property , and $2,500 for the arrest of the thief . The bonds all belong to Mr. Eells personally , and not a cent of them to the bank . Descriptions of all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public . They are all negotiable , and consist of $5,000 Milwaukee and St. Paul sinking fund second mortgage bonds , $00,000 first mortgage bonds , $20,000 do . sinking fund , $1,000 consolidated , $11,000 Chicago and Milwaukee first mortgage bonds , $19,000 gold bonds , and $23,000 Chicago and Atchison Bridge Company bonds . The robber was a man of middle age , below medium size , thick set , with a sandy beard , the whiskers being quite thin . Mr. Eells is a prominent railroad man , and is worth $1,000,000 . The robbery has caused great excitement here , as only two weeks ago President Williamson , of the Society of Savings , had $15,000 in bonds taken from his desk in an almost identical manner .
