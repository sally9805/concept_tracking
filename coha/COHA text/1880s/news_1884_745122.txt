txt In its action upon the Consular and Diplomatic Appropriation bill to-day the Senate introduced an innovation in the methods of legislating upon important public measures . The bill was called up at the earliest moment it could be reached under the rules , and Mr. Alliso repeated his tactics of yesterday by demanding a secret session , the only matter not having been acted upon being the mysterious Senate amendment , appropriating $250,000 to carry out the terms of the neutrality act . No sooner were the doors closed than the wrangle , which occupied most of yesterday afternoon , was renewed and kept up until its practical settlement several hours later . Tho appropriation is to be expended under the direction of the President , and this is the only definite information regarding the item which can be obtained from . reading the bill . The Senate had not been long in executive session yesterday before the fact was developed that a few members of the Foreign Relations and Appropriations Committees were the only Senators who knew just what was intended to be done with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appropriation through without letting the other Senators know what it was for . Naturally , the uninformed Senators desired to know what they were voting for , and they tried to find out . The knowing ones pretended to answer , but spoke in such ambiguous terms that the more they explained the less able were the others to understand what it all meant . They gave up trying to find out late in the afternoon and took an adjournment until to-day . This afternoon they learned that the mysterious item really meant the payment of $250.000 by the United States Government for certain concessions from the Nicaraguan Government of such doubtful value that the present holders have been unable to dispose of them , and now seek to unload them upon the Government . ? According to the understanding of some of the Senators , Secrete , y of State Frelinghuysen is in favor er the purchase by the Government , for the sum named , of the concessions made by the Nicaraguan Government , about tour years ago , for the construction of an interoceanic caner in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American citizens , including Gen. Grant . the late Gov . Morgan , . S. L. M. Barlow , , and others , who were joined by certain influential Nicaraguans . An appeal was made to the Forty-sixth Congress by the promoters of the canal scheme to incorporate them , but the request was not granted . Later on an incorporation was effected nosier the laws of Colorado . Since then , it is asserted , efforts have been made in all parts of the world to find a purchaser for the concessions , but no country seemed to care to buy . By the terms of the concessions work must be begun on the canal before the 1st of October next , and at least $2,000,000 must be expended during the first year of construction . For this reason , it is claimed by the opponents of the proposed appropriation , the concessions at this late day are of no value to anybody , and least of all to the American Government , because , under treaties now in force , it would have just as many rights in case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country as it would if it constructed and paid for the canal itself . All this came out in the lively debate in the secret session to-day , together with the assertion that Secretary Frelinghuysen first Induced a majority of the Foreign Relations Committee to favor the proposed purchase , and then , through these Senators , secured the insertion of the item by the Appropriations Committee . The debate showed , however , that a large majority of the Senators were willing to put the item through with no explanation in public . After this had been settled the doors were opened , and the presiding officer announced that the bill was still open to amendment . Mr. Van Wyck , who is warmly opposed to star chamber proceedings , at once offered an amendment to the mysterious item providing that no part of the $250,000 shall be used , directly or indirectly , for the purchase of concessions for a canal in Nicaragua . This , of course ; raised a breeze , and Mr. Allison insisted upon closing the doors again . Mr. Van Wyck protested vehemently against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting a most dangerous precedent , but an overwhelming majority was against him , and the star chamber proceedings were resumed . Behind the locked doors the Senate voted upon and killed Mr. Van Wyck 's amendment and then ordered the whole bill to its third reading . Having thus , by legislating in secret , got the bill beyond the stage where amendments can be offered , the Senators were willing the doors should he opened and the vote on the passage of the bill should he taken in public . The roll-call , however , showed that a quorum was not present , and the Senate then adjourned , leaving the final vote to be taken to-morrow . It was said by a Senator to-night that the action of the Senate in voting upon the bill and amendments to it in secret session was without precedent . He considered it a most dangerous example to set for future Congresses , while in the present case the action was useless , became the whole matter would certainly be exposed and debated in the House , where the rules do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
