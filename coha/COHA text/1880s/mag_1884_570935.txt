ARTICLE 111. - WOMEN 'S SUFFRAGE . AMONG the social questions now under discussion , none is more important or more freighted with principles and issues that outreach present consequences and take hold of the very life of society , than that of Female Suffrage . The frequency and urgency with which this measure is pressed upon our legislative bodies by a certain class of reformers , encouraged by partial success in some of the newer states and territories , and the recent advocacy of it in full or limited form by some who have very largely the ear of the public , and the apparently increasing drift of public sentiment in this direction manifest in many quarters ,  --  call for a sober and reflective revision not only of the reasons and supposed advantages of the so-called reform , but of the very serious issues and consequences involved in it . These issues are not immediate and do not lie on the surface . The question is one which can not be solved on *abstract principles , such as that so often urged , of the right ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the application of abstract theories to practical and political problems . The profound aphorism of Burke is specially applicable here ,  --  that in proportion as such theories are logically true , they are practically and politically false . Nor can it be decided by its immediate advantages , supposing them to be real , such as the effect of women 's vote in temperance legislation and other politico-moral questions . Such temporary good , even if secured , may be purchased at too dear a price if it bring after it evils outweighing and outlasting the evil it is supposed to remedy . Illustrations of immediate advantages purchased at the cost of great and wide-sweeping evils are not wanting in our history . The admission of slavery into our Republic for the sake of union , and its subsequent ravages , ending in the war of the Rebellion , is one signal example . The exclusion of the Bible from our public schools as a concession to Roman Catholics and infidels , resulting in the secularization of our whole system of popular education , is another fearfully 0mm VOL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which is not yet . Before committing ourselves to one more radical and irremediable error , and plunging blindly into this gulf of women 's suffrage , it will be well to pause and see whither we are going , and what this new movement , or reform ' really signifies ; whether it rests on a true principle or a shallow and pleasing fallacy , and whether its results are likely to be beneficial or disastrous . We do not propose to discuss the question exhaustively , or as thoroughly as it really demands , but simply and briefly to expose a few points that seem to us to touch the heart of the subject , and which are very commonly overlooked in its dis cussion. 1 . And first , this reform signzftes nothing less than a radicat and revolutionary change in our whole social system . Society as at present constituted is based upon the Family as the social unit . The State is not an aggregation of individuals , but an organism , of which the family is an integral part . This social unit is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the husband , father , or householder , to whom the care and support and interests of the family are naturally intrusted . Whatever tends to disintegrate this organic family unity is a violation of the divine constitution , and can work only mischief , whether it be enforced celibacy , easy divorce , or female suffrage . Individualism is the bane of our modern social lifer as is but too apparent in the theories and practices respecting marriage , which is fast becoming a mere contract , with reserved individual rights , dissolvable at the will of the parties , instead of that sncred and indissoluble union which is its divine idea . It is , whether applied to marriage , the family , or the State , an essentially infidel theory whose legitimate issue is the destruction of the family , of government , and the church , as divine institutions , and the exaltation and assertion of individual rights ' under the flag of Each one Jbr himself The practical tendency of women 's suffrage , as all must seer is to impair the unity of the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and to create discord and rivalries between husband and wife , who by the divine ordinance are " no more twain but one flesh , " but by this act are legally declared to be not one but two . Besides , such suffrage is a tacit decla // ration that the husband and father can not be trusted to protect the interests of wife and daughter in political as in domestic affairs , which is a sure method of relaxing his sense of responsibility and looser*ing the ties of family affection . Where there is true affection , the wife , if she vote at all , will vote with her husband , even against her own interest ; and where there is not , the multiplying of causes of discord will not remedy but only aggravate the evil . The kind of rivalries that woman suffrage will introduce into the family is strikingly seen in an actual case reported in the papers some months ago . In one place in Wyoming it was stated that " Mr. Horatio Evans and his wife ran on opposite tickets for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The domestic consequences of this political strife in a house thus divided against itself are not reported , but may easily be imagined . In any case , woman suffrage strikes at the root of that which should be the first end of government to protect , the sacred unity of the Family . But , it is said , a great many women are unmarried , and own property on which they pay taxes to the government ; therefore justice requires that the right of suffrage be extended to them . Passing by the question whether the paymeum of taxes involves a right of representation , and this a right of voting ,  --  which , though seemingly taken for granted , is a groundless assumption ,  --  allowing the justness of the plea , we answer , that marriage is the normal status of woman ; singleness is the exception and not the rule , and political institutions should be based on broad and general and not exceptional facts . Especially should great social interests not be sacrificed to those which are special and individual . The anomaly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but is inseparable from any system of law and government . All male persons under twenty-one years of age are excluded from voting , although they have as much natural right ' to the suffrage before as after this age . And many a young man is more capable of exercising this right than multitudes who do possess and abuse it . Again , all minors having property may not legally dispose of it , but are put under guardians till they arrive at mature age ; although many have as much or more business knowledge and discretion at eighteen as others at forty . But government legislates on // general principles for the general good , and not for exceptional cases . If individual right is the question , what greater personal right may any one claim , than that which *t woman has to her own name ? Yet this name is lost or merged by marriage in that of her hnsband-signifying , what few in these days consider , that her person and all that appertains to it , including her political rights , if any such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with whom she is morally and legally one . To be consistent , the female suffragists should demand that the wife retain her maiden name , coupled if need be with that of the husband , and thus declare , what the movement really signifies , that the marriage union is simply a copartnership , with " all rights reserved . " Under the accepted legal and Christian idea of marriage , all talk about the disfranchisement of women , and their degradation to the rank of children , or of idiots and criminals , is sheer nonsense , or the most transparent fallacy . 2 . The demand for woman suffrage is based upon a radically false theory of civil arid political r*qhts . The cry of " woman 's rights , " so shrilly and persistently sounded in our ears , needs to be weighed and analyzed more carefully than it is wont to be by those who raise and listen to it . No human being has any natural rights beyond what nature bestows , nor any political rights except what political expediency and the best interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature which God has given us , and are the claims which that nature asserts in the name of God for fulfilling its true end . A right , as the word itself implies , is first of all a moral claim , implying obligation , as is seen in the highest and most sacred of all rights , those of conscience , which are rights only because it is man s imperative duty to obey its dictates . Our boasted inalienable rights of life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness , ' are not supreme or inalienable , since they may , each and all , be forfeited , and are in fact forfeited by and taken away from criminals and murderers , in the name of justice and for the protection of society . Not so with the really inalienable rights of conscience . Here , and here only , the individual is superior to the State , and is amenable // to God alone . Such natural rights , involving duties or obligations commensurate with them , we recognize as implanted in the nature of man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a right of voting bound up with his other rights ; nowhere an obligation to vote , or to take an active part in civil government ; although Plato and Aristotle and other philosophers bing ago observed that man 's nature is configured to the civil state and the condition of civil obligation . To make the right of suffrage , or any other political right , absolute and grounded on first principles , is to fall into the error of the radical theorists and revolutionists of France , in opposition to the sound English doctrine recently affirmed by Matthew Arnold , " that all political rights are created by law , and are based on expediency and are alterable as the public advantage may require . " The same sound doctrine is expressed by an American writer : " No political right is absolute and of universal application . Each has its conditions , qualifications , and limitations . It is in the concrete and not in the abstract , that rights prevail in every sound and wholesome society . They are applied where they are applicable . Government by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set the example and bore the fruits , involves enormous danger and injustice . " And yet it is upon this false and dangerous doetritie , claimed to be the foundation stone of all our institutions , that the woman suffrage movement is avowedly based . " The strength of the woman suffrage movement in the United States , " says one of its leading advocates , " lies in this , that every axiom , every position claimed originally as applicable to American men , proves on reflection to be applicable to women also . If there is any principle on which all our institutions rest in the popular mind , it is the right of every adult person , not laboring under special natural disqualification , to take part in the government of the country . " Such a right nowhere exists , or ever did exist , save in the brains of theorists . If this be the principle on which our institutions rest in the popular mind , it is by the same sophistry of radicalism that once made slavery to be the corner stone of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation . The sooner the popular . mind is dispossessed of such doctrines , before their // fruits are ripened into revolutions , the better for our peace and safety . Rights , as we have said , are always correlative and commensurate with duties . A right to vote implies the duty to vote , and this carries with it in a free government the right to be elected to office , and a participation in all the duties and responsibilities of government . Indeed this is the avowed aim of the female suffragists , to open the whole sphere of politics and government to women equally with men . This is the issue fairly before us , and a graver and mightier one , or one more fraught with peril to society , to the family , and most of all to woman herself , it is impossible to conceive . And this leads us to say further , 3 . The claim for woman suffrage rests upon a radically false conception of the relations and duties oJ the sexes . If there is any law written in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the human constitution , it is that which assigns different spheres and duties to the two sexes . Woman is made to be the complement and help-mate , not the rival of man . To the man is given physical strength , executive force , mastership , leadership ,  --  in a word , headsldp in the family , in the field , and in the State . Hence government is his prerogative by nature . To the woman is given a finer and more delicate organization , not inferior but different in kind and quality , fitting her as manifestly for private and domes.tic life , and its not less responsible duties . To deny or ignore this law is to deny the plainest facts , and to fly in the face of nature itself . Nature and reason , no less than Scripture , declares man to be the " head of the woman " and of the family , and for the same reason he is the proper bead and ruler of the State . Phe fact of female sovereigns and their often successful reigns , argues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real governing power iii England and other female sovereignties is behind the throne , and is male , and not female . The equality of the sexes , in the only sense in which the term can be properly used , is perfectly cotisistent with subordination of rank and place , as even theology teaches in the doctrine of the Trinity , where the Son is subordinate and obedient to the Father , yet one with Him in all divine attributes . // This whole movement for female suffrage , is , at least in its motive and beginning , a rebellion against the divinely ordained position and duties of woman , and an ambition for independence and the honors of a more public life ; as if any greater and diviner honor could be given to woman than those which God has assigned her ; as if the sanctities of home and the sacred duties of wife and mother , with all their sacrifices , were not a higher sphere and a truer glory  --  a glory she shares with the world 's Redeemer-than the vulgar publicity of the polls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It has been argued by advocates of this reform that the social position of woman is different in this age from what it was in the preceding centuries , when woman was deemed and held subordinate to man . " It is the weakness of the stock - arguments against woman suffrage , " says Mr. Higginson in the North American Review , " that they are , mainly based on the survival of a tradition after social facts are changed . As manners make laws , manners likewise repeal them . ' " But it is not social facts or traditional manners on which our arguments are based , but natural constitution and the laws written by the Creator on the , nature of the two sexes , to which human laws ought to be conformed . St. Paul , in his chapter on the subordination of woman ,  --  upon which so much shallow sophistry and irreverent wit has been expended ,  --  appeals in his argument chiefly to nature and the original constitution of woman , which no social facts or customs can essentially change . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is shorter in stature , weaker in body , lighter and less forcible and less commanding in voice and movement and all that indicates authority and mastery , than man , notwithstanding a few abnormal exceptions . It is not a tradition , but a scientific fact or law , that the average weight of the brain of woman is one-tenth less than that of man , and differs from it also in structure ,  --  indicating not that she is mentally inferior , but that certain spheres of thought and activity are specially adapted , and certain others not adapted to her mental , no less than to her bodily organization . It is a psychological and not a social or traditional fact , that the logical and judicial faculties are in most women subordinate and inferior in strength to the intuitive and spiritual ; that feeling // enters more largely into her opinions and judgments than the lumen siccum of pure reason ,  --  a fact which in some departments makes her a more true and acute discerner , and in others a more partial and prejudiced observer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental , certainly indicates some difference of design and end touching the sphere and functions of the two sexes . What this difference is ; which shall be the head , the primordial and governing force in all things pertaining to public and political life ; and which shall be the heart , the inward and retired , but not less powerful spiritual force which animates and warms and cheers the domestic and social life ; the controller of this interior world within the outer one of business and politics , like the heart in the physical system sustaining , shaping and building the body by its vital chemistry , pouring life and health through all the veins and arteries and so feeding and vitalizing the whole , the head and brain no less than the lowest members ,  --  this surely ought not to be a question in dispute , and can not be to any level and trueseeing mind . Indeed this question whether women shall vote , and the issues connected with it , recalls the old fable of the belly and the memkers . It looks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the function of the head , and assert its right to be at the top instead of at the center of the body ; i. e. whether it shall govern and direct the external movements of the man . or animate and vitali*ze , and so inwardly ccntrol , the man himself . In this view there is a look of absurdity in the claim for woman suffrage which has not escaped the notice of some who have written on the subject . Prof. Phelps speaks in bold and convincing language of " the absurdity of thrusting upon one-half of the human race a privilege which they have never asked for , and their desire for which is a thing not proved ; the absurdity of imposing upon one-half of the race a duty , the gravest that organized society creates , but which they have no power to defend in an emergency ; the absurdity of holding woman to military service , as she must be held if she is to stand on any fair terms of equality with man in the possession of this natural right ; the absurdity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room and the senate chamber with those of the // nursery-these and other like things involved in the proposed revolution and its sequences , we claim to have the look of absurdity to the average sense of mankind . Yet they are commonly treated either flippantly or passionately in the attempt at rejoinder ; and once and again we are told that the revolution is right because it is right ; and it must succeed because it will succeed . We ask for a reverent answer to St. Paul 's reasoning , and we are informed that St. Paul was a bachelor . We ask what to do with the apostle 's inspired command to wives , so marked in its distinction from his commands , to husbands , and we are reminded that the apostle was a Jew . We urge the impossibility of woman 's defending the ballot by force of arms ; and we are answered that woman is a slave . We argue the incongruity of the duties of maternity with those of the jurybox and the bar ; and we are instructed gravely that men are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dignity of marriage , and the sacredness of motherhood ; and we are met with th' discovery that woman has a mission . " 4 . The reform in question is a violation of woman 's truest and deepest instincts , and so is truly a " reforn* against nature . " It is not implied by this there are not women who delight in publicity and who have a talent for affairs , and even for government and leadership in the State ; strong-minded and masculine women , as their very presence and boldness of address declare . Such are most of the leaders in this movement , gener* ally single women thrown out of their true sexual relatiQn by the abnormal force and independence of their nature , and seeking to find or make a place for their uncomfortable and irrepressible energies . The very names of some of these leaders give one an inward shudder when thought of in the relation of wife . But these , happily , are exceptions to the sex and do not represent woman as God made her to be , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own womanly instincts , and not forced out of them by sophistry or ambitior* disclaim all sympathy with the movement , and would not vote if they could . Not assuming to be wiser than St. Paul , or stronger . than nature , they acknowledge the headship of the husband as the ordinance of God , finding in it not tyranny but strength and peace . One of the best and noblest women we ever knew , // whose clearness and strength of intellect was equaled only by her strength and purity of affection-once said , " Women like to be controlled ; it is woman 's nature to he governed , and not to govern ; " giving utterance to what every true woman knows in her inmost heart to be true . Said the late Prof. Maurice to a lady who was protesting against the required promise in the marriage service , to honor and obey her husband , " My dear Madam , you little know the blessedness of obedience . " It is one of the chief mischiefs of the modern woman 's rights doctrine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature , and calls subordination subjection ( as in J. Stuart Mills ' book entitled " The Subjection of Women , " ) obedience servility , and headship tyranny . A most significant and hopeful sign in connection with this woman suffrage agitation , is the fact that so few women are in favor of the reform , or avail themselves of the limited suffrage allowed them in certain states and territories . A recent number of the New York Tribune , speaking of the reported working of woman suffrage in Wyoming Territory , says : " The most striking point in connection with woman suffrage is seen in Wyoming as well as elsewhere  --  the indifference of women themselves to the right . Even in school matters , in which those who do not favor a general suffrage for women would be glad to see them interest themselves , they do not seem to be active . In New York and Massachusetts , where women have a limited suffrage in school matters , the number exercising the right has been very small . In Vermont 15,000 tax-paying women have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ availed themselves of them . Only eight women V3ted in Burlington this year against sixteen the first year of the law , and a similar indisposition to take part even in school politics is reported from other quarters of the state . The advocates of woman suffrage are rejoicing over the probable approval by the G*vernor of Washington Territory of a woman suffrage law already passed , but Dakota , which will probably come first into the family of States , refused to put it into the proposed Constitution . The great obstacle everywhere , however , seems to be , the indifference or unwillingness of women rather than the opposition of men . " // This proves conclusively that woman 's instincts , always wiser than her reasonings , are against this theoretical reform advocated by the few whose instincts have been repressed and conquered by their will . 5 . Apart from all physical disqualification for the duties of government and the so-called right of suffrage-which is too obvious to dwell upon-there is one argument grounded in woman 's mental and moral constitution that is unanswerable . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her nature . Woman is nothing if not a respecter of persons . All questions to her are personal questions . This propensity is so well described by Mr. Hamerton in his Intel . lectual L*fli , that we quote his words : " A woman , " he says , " can rarely detach her mind from questions of persons to apply it to questions of fact . She does not think simply , Is that true of such a thing ? ' but she thinks , Does he love me , or respect me ? ' This feeling in woman is far from being wholly egoistic . They refer everything to persons , but not necessarily to their own persons . Whatever you affirm as a fact , they find means of interpreting as loyalty or disloyalty to some person whom they either venerate or love , to the head of religion , or of the State , or of the family . Hence it is always dangerous to enter upon intellectual discussion of any kind with women , for you are almost certain to offend them by setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they have in great strength , in order to reach accuracy in matters of fact , which they neither have nor care for . " It is easy to see how this characteristic , which all must acknowledge to be true , disqualifies woman for impartial judgment of questions to be decided by the ballot , for sitting on juries , for the bench , and for almost all political action where measures and policies and not men are in question . It is no discredit to woman that this is so . It does not argue an inferior , but only a different type of mind and nature . Being formed for man , and not for the State , for clinging affection , and not for legislation or debate , persons are everything to her , and all questions and policies are of interest only in their mdi. vidual and personal bearings . As Milton truly describes this difference : // " Not equal , as their sex not equal seemed : For contemplation he and valor formed , For softness she , and sweet attractive grace ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A good deal of shallow criticism has been expended on this last line , as well as on the argument of St. Paul touching the subordination of woman . But nowhere does the great poet show more clearly his deep insight into the nature of woman , and the divine philosophy of religion , than here . The attraction of personality of which we have spoken , woman 's natural indifference to the abstract , the absolute , and the remote , and her craving for the personal and the concrete , together with the all-dominating sway of her affections , renders the one object of her love and reverence the natural medium of her religious adoration . This may explain , if not justify the old formula in the English marriage service- " With my body I thee worship , " - taken doubtless from the 45th psalm : " For he is thy lord and worship thou him . " 6 . A last argument against woman suffrage is its practical consequences , or the evil results that will naturally follow such a social revolution . Only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not the least disastrous result would be the intolerable burden thrust upon women 's shoulders by imposing political questions and duties in addition to those already borne . Domestic and social duties , never so onerous and distracting as now , the care and nurture of children , with the high and sacred responsibilities involved in these , are enough , and more than enough for most women in this age . To add to these the cares of public life and the turbulent excitements of politics , * would be indeed to break the bruised reed . As has been well and truly said by a recent writer : " There is no country in which women enjoy such large and various liberty as with us ; but it would be bold to say that American women as a whole are superior to those of other leading nations . In spite of these advantages a vast proportion of them fall immensely short of the influence and consideration that ought to belong to them .. This proceeds from a variety of causes-an overstrained and nervous activity , an incessant tension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incomparably more by the peculiar social conditions of a country where all kinds of competition , spurred by all kinds of stimulus , keep mind and body always on the stretch . The men feel them in the struggles of active life ; the women in the ambitions , anxieties and worries of a social existence - wliere emulation prevails from the highest to the lowest . And they , as the more susceptible , and more easily deranged , suffer more than the men . . . . Worn as many of our women are by this morbid action and reaction of body and mind , it is impossi- - ble for them to reach that full womanhood than which the world has nothing more beneficent or more noble . In this condition *of things what do certain women demand for the good of their sex ? To add to the excitements that are wasting them , other and greater excitements , and to cares too much for their strength , other and greater cares . Because they can not do their own work , to require them to add to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the turmoil where the most robust sometimes fail . It is much as if a man in a state of nervous exhaustion were told by his physician to enter at once for a foot-race or a boxing match . " The result of such a cruel and intolerable burden , if imposed , would be either utter prostration and distraction , or evasion of one or the other class of duties . Which would be evaded would depend on the character and conscience of those compelled to choose . With the increasing disposition on the part of many women to get above domestic duties instead of seeking to rise to a proper discharge of them , and the alarming tendency in the higher circles toward the decay if not the extinction of the family , the effect of this new temptation may be conceived . The secularization of the home by the intrusion of political questions and disputes , is another impending evil consequence . Our home-life can not afford to have any new secularizing or dissipating elements . Politics in the pulpit is more than many good men can endure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of home profaned and its peace disturbed by partizan strifes and political divisions ? What the effect on the strength of the marriage bond , already so fearfully relaxed , of this new disturbing and strife breeding element ? But the effect upon woman herself of the proposed reform is , perhaps , the worst evil to be apprehended . What this effect // will be may be partially inferred from the effect witnessed in some of our female agitators and politicians . That they have proved themselves able and eloquent champions , equal to statesmen of the other sex in all but the moderation of true wisdom , is really an argument against them . For in proportion as women resemble men in masculine traits and abilities , in just that degree are they repulsive as women . A woman with a beard , or of masculine size and muscles , is no more an anomaly to her sex than one loud and positive and even eloquent in debate . Woman 's voice , if nothing else , indicates that she was not made for public speaking ; and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life and government are contrary to her nature . The very qualities which by a perverse culture will fit her for the rostrum and the bar , will unfit her for her true place and influence in the home , and destroy that chivalrous love and devotion which is accorded to a true woncian only as she keeps herself unspotted from the world . Hitherto only the stronger and more capable class of women have pressed into the public arena , and their superior abilities have disguised the anomaly under the charm of novelty . But when the door is fully opened by unlimited female suffrage , we shall see very different exhibitions both of speech and conduct made by the coarser and more unprincipled classes . But we are told that the effect of allowing women s suffrage  --  and this is one great argument of its advocateswill be to purify politics and restrain the coarseness and corruption which now so largely characterize public life . To . a certain extent this may be allowed , so far as outward decency and decorum is concerned , and so far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights . " The presence of a pure and noble woman in a political assembly may act as a restraint on vulgarity , as the presence of a pure and virtuous statesman may do . But moral and political corruption is too deep a malady to be cured by gallantry or sentimental respect in the legislative hall any more than in the parlor or the soiree . The " barbarism " which such statesmen as Adams and Webster and Sumner were unable to repress* but only to provoke and make more violent , will hardly be controlled by a few misplaced women , however wise and good* // But the practical working of the scheme will be vastly different from the theory . It will not be the good , the wise , and virtuous who will chiefly influence politics , or exercise the right of suffrage , but the ignorant , the vulgar and unprincipled classes . From the fact that the reform in question is against nature and in violation of woman 's truest instincts , it will fail to carry those in whom these instincts are most pronounced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those of coarser mould . Some may at first deny their , instincts and go to the polls from principle , as many good women have unsexed themselves by bold and unseemly acts through zeal in the temperance reform . But nature and instinctive modesty will finally prevail , and they will quietly stay at home , and leave voting and politics to those who are less modest and more ambitious . With the prevalence of women 's suffrage a new power will be introduced into politics , and its character and results will be vastly different from what its advocates imagine . With the better class of women refusing to vote , and the lower , the corrupt , and venal class , swarming to swell the majority of their favorites or their patrons , politics instead of being purified will become tenfold more corrupt by the corruption added to it of this new element . The example of the Mormon women voting in a body in the interest of that institution which degrades and enthralls them , shows what the vote of a certain class of women will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this illustrates the fact already mentioned , that women are influenced less by abstract than by personal considerations . Their vote , like their opinions on any question , will be carried not by the truth or reason or wisdom of the measure , but by its effect on certain persons whom they like or dislike , and this even against their own interest . How much more when favor and interest are combined . The working of this principle may be imagined , when favoritism and personal charms and female intrigue on the one hand are met by flattery and reward on the other , and the social corruption of the court is added to that of political ambition . The chief peril to our institutions , it is generally acknowiedged , comes from the overwhelming tide of ignorant and un // principled voters , under our present system of suffrage . When this tide is constantly increasing and thoughtful men are pondering the question whether universal suffrage is not a failure , is it wise or safe to augment this peril by opening still wider the door of suffrage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it anything but blind infatuation to rush headlong into a revolutionary measure which at best is doubtful , and whose possible evil consequences , when once upon us , can neither be measured nor repaired ? It may be urged that the effects here indicated are imaginary , or at most theoretical , and can not be held up as actually or practically true . It is claimed that " in England 600,000 women owning real estate , or paying rent , exercise the right of municipal suffrage without provoking revolution or social disturbance . " But the experiment as yet , both in England and the United States , is too recent and on too limited a scale to exhibit its full grown fruits . The first fruits , however , of the woman 's rights movement and the kind of character produced by it are already too apparent in modern society . The most recent testimony on this subject is the republication in London of the Social Essays written by Mrs. Linton , author of The Girl of the Period . This famous satire has lost none of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Review . The author declares herself now more than ever convinced that she has struck the right chord of condemnation , and advocated the best virtues and most valuable characteristics of women . Says Mrs. Linton : " One of the modern phases of womanhood-hard , unloving , mercenary , ambitious , without domestic faculty and devoid of healthy natural instincts ,  --  is still to me a pitiable mistake and a grave national disaster . And I think now , as I thought when I wrote these papers , that a public and professional life for women is incompatible with the discharge of their highest duties or the cultivation of their noblest qualities . I think now , as I thought then , that the sphere of human action is determined by the fact of sex , and that there does exist both natural limitation and natural direction . This creed which summarizes all that I have said in extenso , I repeat with emphasis , and maintain with the conviction of long years of experi // ence . " And this creed , thus sincerely and courageously uttered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense and culture and of wide experience and observation , we commend to the " shrieking sisterhood " of strong minded women in pursuit of what they call their rights . We have already exceeded our limits in this discussion and have aimed to touch only on fundamental points of the question . But as Mr. Joseph Cook in his " Prelude " to one of his late Boston lectures , has adduced several practical arguments in favor of woman suffrage in the interests of morality and temper . ance , it may be well to notice very briefly some of these so far as they have not been already answered by anticipation . He says , " Women have more reasons for attachment to the home , and hence if they have the power , may be expected to defend the interests of home more carefully than men have done . " The same argument would require woman to build the house , and to furnish all the supplies of the family . The codperation of woman in all that concerns home interests does not imply executive action , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fallacy of this whole style of reasoning rests on the deeper fallacy of individualism . If the head of the family , the husband and father , can not be trusted to protect its domestic interests , much less can the civil government , and all social unity is at an end . How much wiser is the divine constitution which makes man and woman one , and the family an organic unity , whose head being made responsible for its welfare , is thereby , if by any means , made capable and worthy of so sacred a trust . Again , he says : " Women as a class are more free from intemperance and immorality than men , and hence may be expected to cast a purer vote for the reform of cities . " We answer , not among the lower classes , for reasons already shown ; while the better class would generally refrain from voting , thus diminishing instead of increasing the purer vote . Again : " By endowment of heaven , women are more attached to children in their tenderest years than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fathers , sons , brothers and husbands ; *nd so may be expected to purify the vote of cities in the inter . est of its households . " This supposes that woman 's vote out // side of the household can do more for virtue and morality than her legitimate influence within it ,  --  a most preposterous fallacy . Let woman exert the power which is hers by endowment of heaven ' in the training and strengthening of the moral sentiments , and her vote will be needless , as now it would be ineffectual in most cases . Again , be tells us : " Municipal suffrage for tax-paying women has worked well for many years in England ; and a general right of female suffrage has worked well , for fourteen years in Wyoming . " There are doubtless two sides , or two verdicts on this question-an outside and an inside view . We hear only , or chiefly , from the former , from parties interested to report success . Other and very different reports have also come . Besides , the experiment is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially among a different class of population yet to come . " Voting , " we are informed , b* would increase the intelligence of women , and be a powerful stimulus to female education . It is the opinion of some judicious persons ,  --  educators and physicians included ,  --  that women in this age and country are receiving all the stimulus to education which they can safely bear ; and that the kind and quality of intelligence that voting would promote , would not be in the line most needful or most useful to women . The principles of civil government are already taught , or should be , in all our schools and seminaries , but the newspaper discussions of party politics and rival candidates , which with the daily list of crimes and casualties , form the chief reading , if not education , of most male voters , are a wretched substitute for the intellectual and literary culture which many women do and all might attain , if no additional stimulus of political duties and ambitions were thrust upon them . Again , he tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own industrial , social , moral and educational rights . " It is here assumed that the rights of women are not and can not be sufficiently protected by men ; an assumption disproved by the recent history of legislation in behalf of women , and by the admission of Mr. Cook himself , who says : " The industria1* educational and social rights of women have been advanced // immensely in the last generation ; "  --  and this without women 's suffrage ! There is not one legitimate right of woman sought to be secured or protected by her ballot , which can not be more effectually secured by petition . Where then is the need of taking the law into her own hands and asserting her political independence ? *Limited municipal suffrage , he admits , " would be an experiment , and if this experiment should not work well , it could be discontinued . " Such experiment , as all must see , is designed as an entering wedge to draw after it the whole reform and revolution . Suffrage once granted to any class would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His supreme argument is the last . " The whisky rings and other corrupt classes fear nothing so much as municipal suffrage for women ; and that points out the most effective weapon that can be used against them . " They fear it because they look only at immediate possible results . But the true legislator is bound to look beyond these to the ultimate effect on society and the family , which have interests outweighing and outlasting even the cause of temperance legislation . Two fundamental errors underlie this whole movement , the correction of which would forestall and answer all arguments for women 's suffrage yet adduced . The first is an exaggerated idea of the power of the ballot and of legislation to remedy moral and social evils . These evils are deeper than the outward surface of life , which is all that the law can reach , and can be remedied only by moral and spiritual agencies . What the law can not do both for individuals and for society , can be done and is done by Christianity with its slow working grace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a power in society before it can be embodied in law , or enforced by civil authority . And to form this sentiment , to exercise this moral and spiritual sway , is pre-iminently the work and privilege of woman . Here is her true sovereignty . The second error is a false conception of the nature and sphere and true glory of woman , and of what are called her political rights . This is connected with the false doctrine of individualism already mentioned , or the denial of the divine idea of the family and the State . The nature and constitution of // woman is before the modern doctrines respecting her , and will survive them and determine her place and duties in society , however for the time she may lose her true dignity and the respect which belongs to her by blindly striving against them . The family , too , is before civil government ; and its constitutive idea , its organic unity , and its sacred interests , must not be sacrificed to it , or practically violated in blind obedience to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
