txt Mr. HENRY D. LLOYD , in his very forcible and effective article in the Atlantic on " The Political Economy of Seventy-three Millions , " finds a good deal of not undeserved fault with the political economy of RICARDO and MILL and ADAM SMITH , On the ground that its principles are too rigid , its basis of fact too narrow , and its conclusions inapplicable to the present condition of affairs . He particularly objects to the importance in the old system given to competition as a regulating force . " By excluding all forces but those of competition , " says Mr. LLOYD , " these economists shut themselves out from the consideration of the gravest problems of the day , which are questions of combination and not of competition . " - And lie refers approvingly to Sir HENRY MAINE 'S hint that " economists should study the aberrations , accidents , friction of political economy . " The suggestion is a wise one , but the outcome of such studies in Mr. LLOYD 'S case might be worth even less than the theory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner in which he treats his selected " exemplification of the principles of the competitive political economy , " who is no other than the gentleman who the other day made an exhibition to his friends of $53,000,000 of bonds and offered to show $20,000,000 more if desired . This man , says Mr. LLOYD , is " the most successful of practical political economists . His career illustrates what may be accomplished by a scientific devotion to the principles of competition , laissez faire , desire of wealth , and self-interest if not the harmony of interests . " asked to deal with it . It does not fall within the domain of that science . But it is only reasonable to remark that any remedy for these evils which can be had from extending the field of Government and undertaking to limit the freedom of men to injure or benefit themselves as they choose would only make existing evils a thousand times worse . If the Government can be corrupted , or any branch of it , as it has been in the case of Mr. LLOYD 'S specimen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more monstrous the wrongs that would follow corruption . A paternal Government which can be bought and sold and wrested to the dishonest purposes of a shameless adventurer would be in public life what a wicked and unprincipled father is in private life . It would be pernicious , disgraceful , burdensome , or intolerable just in proportion to the sway it was allowed to exercise . Undoubtedly the political economy of which Mr. MILL is the most eminent teacher of the last half century was too positive in its applications of the general principles on which it was based , but in criticising its fitness to explain facts as they are we must remember that it did not undertake to predict that the operations of a society left to itself would be always fortunate , or wise , or beneficent . It did not attempt to explain how such a society could be made universally or uniformly happy , or equal , or even comfortable . On what may be called its moral side , the most that it claimed was that liberty , bad as some of its workings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see , would , on the whole , and in the ion run , work better than any other known principle . We do not understand Mr. LLOYD to contest this claim , but the vigor with which he portrays the abuses that have sprung up in our own society , and the protest that he makes against the theory of competition as a " science of assassination , " give the Impression that ho contem plates some sort of principle that might work better than that of free competition . But we repeat that many of the most shameful facts to which he alludes are not traceable to freedom of competition at all , but to the most outrageous interference with it . BARNARD and WESTBROOK , CARDOZO and WARD are instrumentalities not of freedom but of despotism , and of the most subtle , dangerous , and outrageous despotism , which steals the livery of justice to serve rascality in . It is an essential part of the system of free government that the laws shall protect individual rights , and that justice shall be promptly , honestly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed , after the preservation of peace and order , the highest function of the State . When it is not only not performed , but perverted , find in justice is done in the name of justice ; when conspiracy moves the machinery of the courts , and the rights of individuals and of the public become the traffic of unprincipled lawyers and Stock Exchange thieves , the consequences arc not to be charged to the principle of freedom . The remedy certainly is not in substituting for free government one which , with longer arms to protect and stronger bonds with which to restrain , may be found plunging deeper in private purses and leaving the people more helpless than now to defend themselves . We have not an ideal human society , and the freest and purest government conceivable can not give us one ; but it might be very easy to bestow on the Government , for purposes of reform , powers that would ultimately make our condition a great deal worse than it is . But is Mr. JAY GOULD , with his $73,000 , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the principles of competition ? Notoriously , and according to Mr. LLOYD 'S own statements , a large part of this ill-gotten fortune is due to the corruption of Judges , the inalconduct of public officers , the aid of lawyers in perverting the law , and of Directors or Trustees in betraying their trusts . Another considerable part is due to the co-operation of men as greedy , but not as shrewd , as the arch-speculator , who have staked their money , in hopes of enormous gains , on the success of his ventures without questioning whether they were honest or rascally . These are forces with which no science of political economy can deal . Dishonesty , corruption , and greed will elude any law based on the study of the actions of the average man who is fairly honest and prudent and self-controlled . If business men , who recognize the authority of the common requirements of honesty and caution in affairs , will take to laying heavy wagers , against great odds , that a notorious rogue will carry through his schemes of pilfer or plunder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain . True , this is not a happy result of leaving men their liberty , but there is no way of preventing such a result so far as it flows from the abuse of liberty . So far as it flows from the corruption of Judges and Legislatures , political economy can not be 2nd column missing
