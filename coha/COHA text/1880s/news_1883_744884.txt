txt For seven years a law of the United States has forbidden the carrying of letters or circulars concerning lotteries in the mails . The existence of this law seems to have been discovered . not long . ago . by the United States District Attorney in Chicago , and on Monday last four men , who had been acting as agents for the Louisiana , Kentucky , Henry College , and Little Havana Lottery Companies , respectively , were tried in the United States District Court in that city , and found guilty . The law is explicit . It provides that " no letter or circular concerning lotteries , socalled gift concerts , or other similar enterprises offering prizes , * * * shall be carried in the mail . " When Originally enacted ; 11 years ago , it contained the word " illegal " before the word " lotteries , " but in 1876 this word was stricken out . Since that time , therefore , every person who has placed in the mails any letter or circular concerning a lottery has exposed himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine of not less than $100 and not more than $500 , with costs . The Postmaster-General is not required by this law to take any action . It is in obedience to another law that he has tried to prevent the Louisiana Company from using the mail-bags of the United States . This law should be enforced by the Government 's prosecuting officers . It ought to have been enforced by them years ago , but it is announced that the Chicago cases are the first of the kind ever tried in this country . If this be true , why has this statute been so long ignored ? A strict enforcement of its provisions in the last seven years would have prevented hundreds of thousands of deluded men and women from throwing away their money , and might have broken up the business of lottery companies in the United States . Now that its power has been shown in Chicago , it should hereafter be rigidly enforced wherever men are disobeying its provisions .
