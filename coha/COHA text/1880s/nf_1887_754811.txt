txt // , to deserve the name of civilization , must be an embodiment of order , or must at least tend toward a social equilibrium . I take , as an illustration of my meaning , the development of the domestic relations of our race . I assume it to be generally admitted , that possibly man 's first and probably his greatest advance toward order  --  and , therefore , toward civilization  --  was the creation of the family as the social nucleus . As Napoleon said , when the lawyers were drafting his Civil Code , " Make the family responsible to its head , and the head to me , and I will keep order in France . " And yet although our dependence on the family system has been recognized in every age and in every land , there has been no restraint on personal liberty which has been more resented , by both men and women alike , than has been this bond which , when perfect , constrains one man and one woman to live a joint life until death shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defence of their children . The result is that no civilization has , as yet , ever succeeded , and none promises in the immediate future to succeed , in enforcing this primary obligation , and we are thus led to consider the cause , inherent in our complex nature , which makes it impossible for us to establish an equilibrium between mind and matter . A difficulty which never has been even partially overcome , which wrecked the Roman Empire and the Christian Church , which has wrecked all systems of law , and which has never been more lucidly defined than by Saint Paul , in the Epistle to the Romans , " For we know that the law is spiritual : but I am carnal , sold under sin . For that which I do , I allow not : for what I would , that do I not ; but what I hate , that do I .... Now then it is no more I that do it , but sin that dwelleth in me .... For the good that I would , I do not : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do .... For I delight in the law of God after the inward man : ... But I see another law in my members , warring against the law of my mind , and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members . O wretched man that I am ! who shall deliver me from the body of this death ? " Footnote : Romans vii , 14-24 . And so it has been since a time transcending the limits of imagination . Here in a half-a-dozen sentences Saint Paul exposes the ceaseless conflict between mind and matter , whose union , though seemingly the essence of life , creates a condition which we can not comprehend and to which we could not hope to conform , even if we could comprehend it . In short , which indicates chaos as being the probable core of an universe from which we must evolve order , if ever we are to cope with violence , fraud , crime , war , and general brutality . Wheresoever we turn the prospect is the same . If we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ globules of matter , to which our earth seems to be more or less akin , but all plunging , apparently , both furiously and aimlessly , from out of an infinite past to an equally immeasurable future . Whence this material mass comes , or what its wild flight portends , we neither know nor could we , probably , comprehend even were its secret divulged to us by a superior intelligence , always conceding that there be such an intelligence , or any secret to disclose . These latter speculations lie , however , beyond the scope of my present purpose . It suffices if science permits me to postulate ( a concession by science which I much doubt if it could make ) that matter , as we know it , has the semblance of being what we call a substance , charged with a something which we define as energy , but which at all events simulates a vital principle resembling heat , seeking to escape into space , where it cools . Thus the stars , having blazed until their vital principle is absorbed in space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astronomers say , die . The trees and plants diffuse their energy in the infinite , and , at length , when nothing but a shell remains , rot . Lastly , our fleshly bodies , when the union between mind and matter is dissolved , crumble into dust . When the involuntary partnership between mind and matter ceases through death , it is possible , or at least conceivable , that the impalpable soul , admitting that such a thing exists , may survive in some medium where it may be free from material shackles , but , while life endures , the flesh has wants which must be gratified , and which , therefore , take precedence of the yearnings of the soul , just as Saint Paul points out was the case with himself ; and herein lies the inexorable conflict between the moral law and the law of competition which favors the strong , and from whence comes all the abominations of selfishness , of violence , of cruelty and crime . Approached thus , perhaps no historical fragment is more suggestive than the exodus of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great optimist , nor one which is seldomer read with an eye to the contrast which it discloses between Moses the law-giver , the idealist , the religious prophet , and the visionary ; and Moses the political adventurer and the keen and unscrupulous man of the world . And yet it is here at the point at which mind and matter clashed , that Moses merits most attention . For Moses and the Mosaic civilization broke down at this point , which is , indeed , the chasm which has engulfed every progressive civilization since the dawn of time . And the value of the story as an illustration of scientific history is its familiarity , for no Christian child lives who has not been brought up on it . We have all forgotten when we first learned how the Jews came to migrate to Egypt during the years of the famine , when Joseph had become the minister of Pharaoh through his acuteness in reading dreams . Also how , after their settlement in the land of Goshen ,  --  which is the Egyptian province lying at the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading from Palestine to the banks of the Nile , and which had been the trade route , or path of least resistance , between Asia and Africa , probably for ages before the earliest of human traditions ,  --  they prospered exceedingly . But at length they fell into a species of bondage which lasted several centuries , during which they multiplied so rapidly that they finally raised in the Egyptian government a fear of their domination . Nor , considering subsequent events , was this apprehension unreasonable . At all events the Egyptian government is represented , as a measure of self-protection , as proposing to kill male Jewish babies in order to reduce the Jewish military strength ; and it was precisely at this juncture that Moses was born , Moses , indeed , escaped the fate which menaced him , but only by a narrow chance , and he was nourished by his mother in an atmosphere of hate which tinged his whole life , causing him always to feel to the Egyptians as the slave feels to his master . After birth the mother hid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceal the infant no longer she platted a basket of reeds , smeared it with pitch , and set it adrift in the Nile , where it was likely to be found , leaving her eldest daughter , named Miriam , to watch over it . Presently Pharaoh 's daughter came , as was her habit , to the river to bathe , as Moses 's mother expected that she would , and there she noticed the " ark " floating among the bulrushes . She had it brought her , and , noticing Miriam , she caused the girl to engage her mother , whom Miriam pointed out to her , as a nurse . Taking pity on the baby the kind-hearted princess adopted it and brought it up as she would had it been her own , and , as the child grew , she came to love the boy , and had him educated with care , and this education must be kept in mind since the future of Moses as a man turned upon it . For Moses was most peculiarly a creation of his age and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be considered as an incarnation of Jewish thought gradually shaped during many centuries of priestly development . According to tradition , Moses from childhood was of great personal beauty , so much so that passers by would turn to look at him , and this early promise was fulfilled as he grew to be a man . Tall and dignified , with long , shaggy hair and beard , of a reddish hue tinged with gray , he is described as " wise as beautiful . " Educated by his foster-mother as a priest at Heliopolis , he was taught the whole range of Chaldean and Assyrian literature , as well as the Egyptian , and thus became acquainted with all the traditions of oriental magic : which , just at that period , was in its fullest development . Consequently , Moses must have been familiar with the ancient doctrines of Zoroaster . Men who stood thus , and had such an education , were called Wise Men , Magi , or Magicians , and had great influence , not so much as priests of a God , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daniel , for example , belonged to this class . He was one of three captive Jews whom Nebuchadnezzar , King of Babylon , gave in charge to the master of his eunuchs , to whom he should teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans . Daniel , very shortly , by his natural ability , brought himself and his comrades into favor with the chief eunuch , who finally presented them to Nebuchadnezzar , who conversed with them and found them " ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm . " The end of it was , of course , that Nebuchadnezzar dreamed a dream which he forgot when he awoke and he summoned " the magicians , and the astrologers , and the sorcerers , and the Chaldeans , for to shew the king his dreams , " but they could not unless he told it them . This vexed the king , who declared that unless they should tell him his dream with the interpretation thereof , they should be cut in pieces . So the decree went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be slain , and they sought Daniel and his fellows to slay them . Therefore , it appears that together with its privileges and advantages the profession of magic was dangerous in those ages . Daniel , on this occasion , according to the tradition , succeeded in revealing and interpreting the dream ; and , in return , Nebuchadnezzar made Daniel a great man , chief governor of the province of Babylon . Precisely a similar tale is told of Joseph , who , having been sold by his brethren to Midianitish merchantmen with camels , bearing spices and balm , journeying along the ancient caravan road toward Egypt , was in turn sold by them to Potiphar , the captain of Pharaoh 's guard . And Joseph rose in Potiphar 's service , and after many alternations of fortune was brought before Pharaoh , as Daniel had been before Nebuchadnezzar , and because he interpreted Pharaoh 's dream acceptably , he was made " ruler over all the land of Egypt " and so ultimately became the ancestor whom Moses most venerated and whose bones he took with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is true also that Josephus has preserved an idle tale that Moses was given command of an Egyptian army with which he made a successful campaign against the Ethiopians , but it is unworthy of credit and may be neglected . His bringing up was indeed the reverse of military . So much so that probably far the most important part of his education lay in acquiring those arts which conduce to the deception of others , such deceptions as jugglers have always practised in snake-charming and the like , or in gaining control of another 's senses by processes akin to hypnotism ;  - -  processes which have been used by the priestly class and their familiars from the dawn of time . In especial there was one miracle performed by the Magi , on which not only they , but Moses himself , appear to have set great store , and on which Moses seemed always inclined to fall back , when hard pressed to assert his authority . They pretended to make fire descend onto their altars by means of magical ceremonies . Footnote : Lenormant , Chaldean Magic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the strongest hold which the priests or sorcerers held over , and the greatest influence which they exercised upon , others , lay in their relations to disease , for there they were supposed to be potent . For example , in Chaldea , diseases were held to be the work of demons , to be feared in proportion as they were powerful and malignant , and to be restrained by incantations and exorcisms . Among these demons the one , perhaps most dreaded , was called Namtar , the genius of the plague . Moses was , of course , thoroughly familiar with all these branches of learning , for the relations of Egypt were then and for many centuries had been , intimate with Mesopotamia . Whatever aspect the philosophy may have , which Moses taught after middle life touching the theory of the religion in which he believed , Moses had from early childhood been nurtured in these Mesopotamian beliefs and traditions , and to them  --  or , at least , toward them  --  he always tended to revert in moments of stress . Without bearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can hardly be understood , for it was on this foundation that his theories of cause and effect were based . As M. Lenormant has justly and truly observed , go back as far as we will in Egyptian religion , we find there , as a foundation , or first cause , the idea of a divine unity ,  --  a single God , who had no beginning and was to have no end of days ,  --  the primary cause of all . Footnote : Chaldean Magic , 79 . It is true that this idea of unity was early obscured by confounding the energy with its manifestations . Consequently a polytheism was engendered which embraced all nature . Gods and demons struggled for control and in turn were struggled with . In Egypt , in Media , in Chaldea , in Persia , there were wise men , sorcerers , and magicians who sought to put this science into practice , and among this fellowship Moses must always rank foremost . Before , however , entering upon the consideration of Moses , as a necromancer , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or as a commander , we should first glance at the authorities which tell his history . Scholars are now pretty well agreed that Moses and Aaron were men who actually lived and worked probably about the time attributed to them by tradition . That is to say , under the reign of Ramses II , of the Nineteenth Egyptian dynasty who reigned , as it is computed , from 1348 to 1281 B.C. , and under whom the exodus occurred . Nevertheless , no very direct or conclusive evidence having as yet been discovered touching these events among Egyptian documents , we are obliged , in the main , to draw our information from the Hebrew record , which , for the most part , is contained in the Pentateuch , or the first five books of the Bible . Possibly no historical documents have ever been subjected to a severer or more minute criticism than have these books during the last two centuries . It is safe to say that no important passage and perhaps no paragraph has escaped the most searching and patient analysis by the acutest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far as the science of history is concerned , the results have been disappointing . The order in which events occurred may have been successfully questioned and the sequence of the story rearranged hypothetically ; but , in general , it has to be admitted that the weight of all the evidence obtained from the monuments of contemporary peoples has been to confirm the reliability of the Biblical narrative . For example , no one longer doubts that Joseph was actually a Hebrew , who rose , through merit , to the highest offices of state under an Egyptian monarch , and who conceived and successfully carried into execution a comprehensive agrarian policy which had the effect of transferring the landed estates of the great feudal aristocracy to the crown , and of completely changing Egyptian tenures . Nor does any one question , at this day , the reality of the power which the Biblical writers ascribed to the Empire of the Hittites . Under such conditions the course of the commentator is clear . He should treat the Jewish record as reliable , except where it frankly accepts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard the miracle as an important and most suggestive part of the great Jewish epic , which always has had , and always must have , a capital influence on human thought . The Pentateuch has , indeed , been demonstrated to be a compilation of several chronicles arranged by different writers at different times , and blended into a unity under different degrees of pressure , but now , as the book stands , it is as authentic a record as could be wished of the workings of the Mosaic mind and of the minds of those of his followers who supported him in his pilgrimage , and who made so much of his task possible , as he in fact accomplished . Moses , himself , but for the irascibility of his temper , might have lived and died , contented and unknown , within the shadow of the Egyptian court . The princess who befriended him as a baby would probably have been true to him to the end , in which case he would have lived wealthy , contented , and happy and would have died overfed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise . The Hebrews were harshly treated after the death of Joseph , and fell into a quasi-bondage in which they were forced to labor , and this species of tyranny irritated Moses , who seems to have been brought up under his mother 's influence . At all events , one day Moses chanced to see an Egyptian beating a Jew , which must have been a common enough sight , but a sight which revolted him . Whereupon Moses , thinking himself alone , slew the Egyptian and hid his body in the sand . Moses , however , was not alone . A day or so later he again happened to see two men fighting , whereupon he again interfered , enjoining the one who was in the wrong to desist . Whereupon the man whom he checked turned fiercely on him and said , " Who made thee a prince and a judge over us ? Intendest thou to kill me , as thou killedst the Egyptian ? " When Moses perceived by this act of treachery on the part of a countryman , whom he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he started in the direction of southern Arabia , toward what was called the Land of Midian , and which , at the moment , seems to have lain beyond the limits of the Egyptian administrative system , although it had once been one of its most prized metallurgical regions . Just at that time it was occupied by a race called the Kenites , who were more or less closely related to the Amalekites , who were Bedouins and who relied for their living upon their flocks , as the Israelites had done in the time of Abraham . Although Arabia Patrea was then , in the main , a stony waste , as it is now , it was not quite a desert . It was crossed by trade routes in many directions along which merchants travelled to Egypt , as is described in the story of Joseph , whose brethren seized him in Dothan , and as they sat by the side of the pit in which they had thrown him , they saw a company of Ishmaelites who came from Gilead and who journeyed straight down from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old caravan road , toward Egypt , with camels bearing spices and myrrh , as had been their custom since long beyond human tradition , and which had been the road along which Abraham had travelled before them , and which was still watered by his wells . This was the famous track from Beersheba to Hebron , where Hagar was abandoned with her baby Ishmael , and if the experiences of Hagar do not prove that the wilderness of Shur was altogether impracticable for women and children it does at least show that for a mixed multitude without trustworthy guides or reliable sources of supply , the country was not one to be lightly attempted . It was into a region similar to this , only somewhat further to the south , that Moses penetrated after his homicide , travelling alone and as an unknown adventurer , dressed like an Egyptian , and having nothing of the nomad about him in his looks . As Moses approached Sinai , the country grew wilder and more lonely , and Moses one day sat himself down , by the side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to water . For shepherds came there , and also shepherdesses ; among others were the seven daughters of Jethro , the priest of Midian , who came to water their father 's flocks . But the shepherds drove them away and took the water for themselves . Whereupon Moses defended the girls and drew water for them and watered their flocks . This naturally pleased the young women , and they took Moses home with them to their father 's tent , as Bedouins still would do . And when they came to their father , he asked how it chanced that they came home so early that day . " And they said , an Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds , and also drew water enough for us , and watered the flock . " And Jethro said , " Where is he ? Why is it that ye have left the man ? Call him that he may eat bread . " " And Moses was content to dwell with " Jethro , who made him his chief shepherd and gave him Zipporah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Seemingly , time passed rapidly and happily in this peaceful , pastoral life , which , according to the tradition preserved by Saint Stephen , lasted forty years , but be the time long or short , it is clear that Moses loved and respected Jethro and was in return valued by him . Nor could anything have been more natural , for Moses was a man who made a deep impression at first sight  --  an impression which time strengthened . Intellectually he must have been at least as notable as in personal appearance , for his education at Heliopolis set him apart from men whom Jethro would have been apt to meet in his nomad life . But if Moses had strong attractions for Jethro , Jethro drew Moses toward himself at least as strongly in the position in which Moses then stood . Jethro , though a child of the desert , was the chief of a tribe or at least of a family , a man used to command , and to administer the nomad law ; for Jethro was the head of the Kenites , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israelites were destined to wage mortal war . And for Moses this was a most important connection , for Moses after his exile never permitted his relations with his own people in Egypt to lapse . The possibility of a Jewish revolt , of which his own banishment was a precursor , was constantly in his mind . To Moses a Jewish exodus from Egypt was always imminent . For centuries it had been a dream of the Jews . Indeed it was an article of faith with them . Joseph , as he sank in death , had called his descendants about him and made them solemnly swear to " carry his bones hence . " And to that end Joseph had caused his body to be embalmed and put in a coffin that all might be ready when the day came . Moses knew the tradition and felt himself bound by the oath and waited in Midian with confidence until the moment of performance should come . Presently it did come . Very probably before he either expected or could have wished it , and actually , as almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bones of Joseph with him when he crossed the Red Sea . Moses held the tradition to be a certainty . He never conceived it to be a matter of possible doubt , nor probably was it so . There was in no one 's mind a question touching Joseph 's promise nor about his expectation of its fulfilment . What Moses did is related in Exodus XIII , 19 : " And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him ; for he had straitly sworn the children of Israel , saying , God will surely visit you ; and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you . " In fine , Moses , in the solitude of the Arabian wilderness , in his wanderings as the shepherd of Jethro , came to believe that his destiny was linked with that of his countrymen in a revolution which was certain to occur before they could accomplish the promise of Joseph and escape from Egypt under the guidance of the god who had befriended and protected him . Moreover , Moses was by no means exclusively a religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ideas of that age . Moses had a high degree of education and he was familiar with the Egyptian and Chaldean theory of a great and omnipotent prime motor , who had had no beginning and should have no end . He was also aware that this theory was obscured by the intrusion into men 's minds of a multitude of lesser causes , in the shape of gods and demons , who mixed themselves in earthly affairs and on whose sympathy or malevolence the weal or woe of human life hinged . Pondering deeply on these things as he roamed , he persuaded himself that he had solved the riddle of the universe , by identifying the great first cause of all with the deity who had been known to his ancestors , whose normal home was in the promised land of Canaan , and who , beside being all-powerful , was also a moral being whose service must tend toward the welfare of mankind . For Moses was by temperament a moralist in whom such abominations as those practised in the worship of Moloch created horror . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wickedness as this , because of the fate of Sodom on much less provocation , and he believed that were he to lead the Israelites , as he might lead them , he could propitiate such a deity , could he but by an initial success induce his congregation to obey the commands of a god strong enough to reward them for leading a life which should be acceptable to him . All depended , therefore , should the opportunity of leadership come to him , on his being able , in the first place , to satisfy himself that the god who presented himself to him was verily the god of Abraham , who burned Sodom , and not some demon , whose object was to vex mankind : and , in the second place , assuming that he himself were convinced of the identity of the god , that he could convince his countrymen of the fact , and also of the absolute necessity of obedience to the moral law which he should declare , since without absolute obedience , they would certainly merit , and probably suffer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the very eyes of Abraham , and in spite of his prayers for mercy . There was one other apprehension which may have troubled , and probably did trouble , Moses . The god of the primitive man , and certainly of the Bedouin , is usually a local deity whose power and whose activity is limited to some particular region , as , for instance , a mountain or a plain . Thus the god of Abraham might have inhabited and absolutely ruled the plain of Mamre and been impotent elsewhere . But this , had Moses for a moment harbored such a notion , would have been dispelled when he thought of Joseph . Joseph , when his brethren threw him into the pit , must have been under the guardianship of the god of his fathers , and when he was drawn out , and sold in the ordinary course of the slave-trade , he was bought by Potiphar , the captain of the guard . " And the Lord was with Joseph and he was a prosperous man . " Thenceforward , Joseph had a wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the weather was to be for seven years to come . And by this dream he was able to formulate a policy for establishing public graineries like those which were maintained in Babylon , and by means of these graineries , ably administered , the crown was enabled to acquire the estates of the great feudatories , and thus the whole social system of Egypt was changed . And Joseph , from being a poor waif , cast away by his brethren in the wilderness , became the foremost man in Egypt and the means of settling his compatriots in the province of Gotham , where they still lived when Moses fled from Egypt . Such facts had made a profound impression upon the mind of Moses , who very reasonably looked upon Joseph as one of the most wonderful men who had ever lived , and one who could not have succeeded as he succeeded , without the divine interposition . But if the god who did these things could work such miracles in Egypt , his power was not confined by local boundaries , and his power could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be on the plain of Mamre or elsewhere . The burning of Sodom was a miracle equally in point to prove the stern morality of the god . And that also , was a fact , as incontestable , to the mind of Moses , as was the rising of the sun upon the morning of each day . He knew , as we know of the battle of Great Meadows , that one day his ancestor Abraham , when sitting in the door of his tent toward noon , " in the plain of Mamre , " at a spot not far from Hebron and perfectly familiar to every traveller along the old caravan road hither , on looking up observed three men standing before him , one of whom he recognized as the " Lord . " Then it dawned on Abraham that the " Lord " had not come without a purpose , but had dropped in for dinner , and Abraham ran to meet them , " and bowed himself toward the ground . " And he said , " Let a little water be fetched , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree : And I will fetch a morsel of bread , and comfort ye your hearts ; after that you shall pass on . " " And Abraham ran unto the herd , and fetcht a calf tender and good , and gave it unto a young man ; and he hasted to dress it . And he took butter , and milk , and the calf which he had dressed , and set it before them ; and he stood by them under the tree , and they did eat . " Meanwhile , Abraham asked no questions , but waited until the object of the visit should be disclosed . In due time he succeeded in his purpose . " And they said unto him , Where is Sarah thy wife ? And he said , Behold , in the tent . And he the Lord said , ... Sarah thy wife shall have a son .... Now Abraham and Sarah were old , and well stricken in age . " At this time Abraham was about one hundred years old , according to the tradition , and Sarah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This mirth vexed " the Lord , " who did not treat his words as a joke , but asked , " Is anything too hard for the Lord ? " Then Sarah took refuge in a lie , and denied that she had laughed . But the lie helped her not at all , for the Lord insisted , " Nay , but thou didst laugh . " And this incident broke up the party . The men rose and " looked toward Sodom " : and Abraham strolled with them , to show them the way . And then the " Lord " debated with himself whether to make a confidant of Abraham touching his resolution to destroy Sodom utterly . And finally he decided that he would , " because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great and because their sin is very grievous . " Whereupon Abraham intervened , and an argument ensued , and at length God admitted that he had been too hasty and promised to think the matter over . And finally , when " the Lord " had reduced the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten , Abraham allowed him to go " his way ... and Abraham returned to his place . " In the evening of the same day two angels came to Sodom , who met Lot at the gate , and Lot took them to his house and made them a feast and they did eat . Then it happened that the mob surrounded Lot 's house and demanded that the strangers should be delivered up to them . But Lot successfully defended them . And in the morning the angels warned Lot to escape , but Lot hesitated , though finally he did escape to Zoar . " Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven . " " And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the Lord : " And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah , and toward all the land of the plain , and beheld , and , lo , the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace . " We must always remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditions were not matters of possible doubt to Moses , or indeed to any Israelite . They were as well established facts to them as would be the record of volcanic eruptions now . Therefore it would not have astonished Moses more that the Lord should meet him on the slope of Horeb , than that the Lord should have met his ancestor Abraham on the plain of Mamre . Moses ' doubts and perplexities lay in another direction . Moses did not question , as did his great ancestress , that his god could do all he promised , if he had the will . His anxiety lay in his doubt as to God 's steadiness of purpose supposing he promised ; and this doubt was increased by his lack of confidence in his own countrymen . The god of Abraham was a requiring deity with a high moral standard , and the Hebrews were at least in part somewhat akin to a horde of semi-barbarous nomads , much more likely to fall into offences resembling those of Sodom than to render obedience to a code which would strictly conform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposing he accepted a task which , after all , without divine aid , might prove to be impossible to perform . When the proposition which Moses seems , more or less confidently , to have expected to be made to him by the Lord , came , it came very suddenly and very emphatically . " Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law , the priest of Midian : and he led the flock to the backside of the desert , and came to the mountain of God , even to Horeb . " And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush : and he looked , and , behold , the bush burned with fire , and the bush was not consumed . " And Moses , not , apparently , very much excited , said , " I will now turn aside , and see this great sight . " But God called unto him out of the midst of the bush , and said , " Moses , Moses . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice commanded him to put off his shoes from off his feet , for the place he stood on was holy ground . " Moreover , " said the voice , " I am the God of thy father , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob . " And Moses hid his face ; for he was afraid to look upon God . And the Lord said , " I have surely seen the affliction of my people ... and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters ; for I know their sorrows . " And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians , and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land and a large , unto a land flowing with milk and honey ; unto the place of the Canaanites , and the Hittites , and the Amorites , and the Perizzites .... " Come now , therefore , and I will send thee unto Pharaoh , that thou mayest bring forth my people , the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unto God , " Who am I , that I should go unto Pharaoh , and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt ? ... " And Moses said unto God , " Behold , when I am come unto the children of Israel , and shall say unto them , The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you ; and they shall say to me , What is his name ? what shall I say unto them ? " And God said unto Moses , " I am That I Am ; " and he said , " Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel , I Am hath sent me unto you . " " And God said , moreover , unto Moses , Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel , The Lord God of your fathers , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , and the God of Jacob , hath sent me unto you : this is my name forever , and this is my memorial unto all generations . " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promises , assuring Moses that he would bring him and his following out of the land of affliction of Egypt and into the land of the Canaanites , and the Hittites , and the Amorites , and others , unto a land flowing with milk and honey . In a word to Palestine . And he insisted to Moses that he should gain an entrance to Pharaoh , and that he should tell him that " the Lord God of the Hebrews hath met with us : and now let us go , we beseech thee , three days ' journey into the wilderness , that we may sacrifice to the Lord our God . " Also God did not pretend to Moses that the King of Egypt would forthwith let them go ; whereupon he would work his wonders in Egypt and after that Pharaoh would let them go . Moreover , he promised , as an inducement to their avarice , that they should not go empty away , for that the Lord God would give the Hebrews favor in the sight of the Egyptians , " so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her that sojourneth in her house , jewels of silver , jewels of gold , and raiment , " and that they should spoil the Egyptians . But all this time God did not disclose his name ; so Moses tried another way about . If he would not tell his name he might at least enable Moses to work some wonder which should bring conviction to those who saw it , even if the god remained nameless . For Moses appreciated the difficulty of the mission suggested to him . How was he , a stranger in Egypt , to gain the confidence of that mixed and helpless multitude , whom he was trying to persuade to trust to his guidance in so apparently desperate an enterprise as crossing a broad and waterless waste , in the face of a well-armed and vigorous foe . Moses apprehended that there was but one way in which he could by possibility succeed . He might prevail by convincing the Israelites that he was commissioned by the one deity whom they knew , who was likely to have both the will and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had visited Abraham on the plain of Mamre , who had destroyed Sodom for its iniquity , and who had helped Joseph to become the ruler of Egypt . Joseph above all was the man who had made to his descendants that solemn promise on whose faith Moses was , at that very moment , basing his hopes of deliverance ; for Joseph had assured the Israelites in the most solemn manner that the god who had aided him would surely visit them , and that they should carry his bones away with them to the land he promised . That land was the land to which Moses wished to guide them . Now Moses was fully determined to attempt no such project as this unless the being who spoke from the bush would first prove to him , Moses , that he was the god he purported to be , and should beside give Moses credentials which should be convincing , by which Moses could prove to the Jews in Egypt that he was no impostor himself , nor had he been deceived by a demon . Therefore Moses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Moses answered and said , But behold they will not believe me , nor hearken to my voice ; for they will say , the Lord hath not appeared unto thee . " Then the being in the bush proceeded to submit his method of proof , which was of a truth feeble , and which Moses rejected as feeble . A form of proof which never fully convinced him , and which , in his judgment could not be expected to convince others , especially men so educated and intelligent as the Egyptians . For the Lord had nothing better to suggest than the ancient trick of the snake-charmer , and even the possessor of the voice seems implicitly to have admitted that this could hardly be advanced as a convincing miracle . So the Lord proposed two other tests : the first was that Moses should have his hand smitten with leprous sores and restored immediately by hiding it from sight in " his bosom . " And in the event that this test left his audience still sceptical , he was to dip Nile water out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Moses at all these three proposals remained cold as before . And with good reason , for Moses had been educated as a priest in Egypt , and he knew that Egyptian " wise men " could do as well , and even better , if it came to a magical competition before Pharaoh . And Moses had evidently no relish for a contest in the presence of his countrymen as to the relative quality of his magic . Therefore , he objected once more on another ground : " I am not eloquent , neither heretofore nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant : but I am slow of speech , and of a slow tongue . " This continued hesitancy put the Lord out of patience ; who retorted sharply , " Who hath made man 's mouth ? or who maketh the dumb , or deaf , or the seeing , or the blind ? Have not I the Lord ? " Now therefore go , and I will be with thy mouth , and teach thee what thou shalt say . " Then Moses made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I pray thee , by the hand of him whom thou wilt send . " Which was another way of saying , Send whom you please , but leave me to tend Jethro 's flock in Midian . " And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Moses ; and he said , Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother ? I know that he can speak well . And also , behold , he cometh forth to meet thee ; and when he seeth thee , he will be glad in his heart . " And he shall be , ... to thee instead of a mouth , and thou shalt be to him instead of God . " Then Moses , not seeming to care very much what Aaron might think about the matter , went to Jethro , and related what had happened to him on the mountain , and asked for leave to go home to Egypt , and see how matters stood there . And Jethro listened , and seems to have thought the experiment worth trying , for he answered , " Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moses , "  --  but where is not stated , probably in Midian ,  --  " Go , return into Egypt , " which you may do safely , for all the men are dead which sought thy life . " And Moses took his wife and his sons , and set them upon an ass , and he returned to the land of Egypt . And Moses took the rod of God in his hand . " It was after this , apparently , that Aaron travelled to meet Moses in Midian , and Moses told Aaron what had occurred , and performed his tests , and , seemingly , convinced him ; for then Moses and Aaron went together into Egypt and called the elders of the children of Israel together , " and did the signs in the sight of the people . And the people believed : and ... bowed their heads and worshipped . " Meanwhile God had not , as yet , revealed his name . But as presently matters came to a crisis between Moses and Pharaoh , he did so . He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I appeared unto Abraham , unto Isaac , and unto Jacob , by the name of God Almighty ; but by my name Jehovah was I not known to them .... " Wherefore say unto the children of Israel , I am the Lord .... And I will bring you in unto the land , concerning the which I did swear to give it to Abraham , to Isaac , and to Jacob ; and I will give it you for an heritage : I am the Lord . " And Moses spake so unto the children of Israel : but they hearkened not unto Moses , for anguish of spirit , and for cruel bondage .... " And Moses spake before the Lord , saying , Behold the children of Israel have not hearkened unto me ; how then shall Pharaoh hear me ? " And from this form of complaint against his countrymen until his death Moses never ceased . Certain modern critics have persuaded themselves to reject this whole Biblical narrative as the product of a later age and of a maturer civilization , contending that it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primitive Bedouins like the patriarchs or like the Jews who followed Moses into the desert . Setting aside at once the philological discussion as to whether the language of the Pentateuch could have been used by Moses , and admitting for the sake of argument that Moses did not either himself write , or dictate to another , any part of the documents in question , it would seem that the application of a little common sense would show pretty conclusively that Moses throughout his whole administrative life acted upon a single scientific theory of the application of a supreme energy to the affairs of life , and upon the belief that he had discovered what that energy was and understood how to control it . His syllogism amounted to this : Facts , which are admitted by all Hebrews , prove that the single dominant power in the world is the being who revealed himself to our ancestors , and who , in particular , guided Joseph into Egypt , protected him there , and raised him to an eminence never before or since reached by a Jew . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this being is a moral being , who can be placated by obedience and by attaining to a certain moral standard in life , and by no other means . That this standard has been disclosed to me , I can prove to you by sundry miraculous signs . Therefore , be obedient and obey the law which I shall promulgate " that ye may prosper in all that ye do . " Indeed , the philosophy of Moses was of the sternly practical kind , resembling that of Benjamin Franklin . He did not promise his people , as did the Egyptians , felicity in a future life . He confined himself to prosperity in this world . And to succeed in his end he set an attainable standard . A standard no higher , certainly than that accepted by the Egyptians , as it is set forth in the 125th chapter of the Book of the Dead , a standard to which the soul of any dead man had to attain before he could be admitted into Paradise . Nor did Moses , as Dr. Budde among others assumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barbarous Bedouins , like the Amalekites , to whom indeed the Hebrews were antagonistic and with whom they waged incessant war . The Jews , for the most part , differed widely from such barbarians . They had become sedentary at the time of the exodus , whatever they may have been when Abraham migrated from Babylon . They were accustomed in Egypt to living in houses , they cultivated and cooked the cereals , and they fed on vegetables and bread . They did not live on flesh and milk as do the Bedouins ; and , indeed , the chief difficulty Moses encountered in the exodus was the ignorance of his followers of the habits of desert life , and their dislike of desert fare . They were forever pining for the delights of civilization . " Would to God we had died by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt , when we eat by the flesh-pots , and when we did eat bread to the full ! for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness , to kill this whole assembly with hunger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We remember the fish , which we did eat in Egypt freely ; the cucumbers , and the melons , and the leeks , and the onions , and the garlick . " These were the wants of sedentary and of civilized folk , not of barbarous nomads who are content with goat 's flesh and milk . And so it was with their morality and their conceptions of law . Moses was , indeed , a highly civilized and highly educated man . No one would probably pretend that Moses represented the average Jew of the exodus , but Moses understood his audience reasonably well , and would not have risked the success of his whole experiment by preaching to them a doctrine which was altogether beyond their understanding . If he told them that the favor of God could only be gained by obeying the laws he taught , it was because he thought such an appeal would be effective with a majority of them . Dr. Budde , who is a good example of the modern hypercritical school , takes very nearly the opposite ground . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ god , and that he discovered such a god , in the god of the Bedouin tribe of the Kenites whose acquaintance he first made when dwelling with his father-in-law Jethro at Sinai . The morality of such a god he insists coincided with the morality which Moses may have at times countenanced , but which was quite foreign to the spirit of the decalogue . Doubtless this is , in a degree , true . The religion of the pure Bedouin was very often crude and shocking , not to say disgusting . But to argue thus is to ignore the fact that all Bedouins did not , in the age of Moses , stand on the same intellectual or moral level , and it is also to ignore the gap that separated Moses and his congregation intellectually and morally from such Bedouins as the Amalekites . Dr. Budde , in his Religion of Israel to the Exile , insists that the Kenite god , Jehovah , demanded " The sacred ban by which conquered cities with all their living beings were devoted to destruction , the slaughter of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire animal , wholly or half raw , was devoured , without leaving a remnant , between sunset and sunrise ,  --  these phenomena and many others of the same kind harmonise but ill with an aspiring ethical religion . " He also goes on to say : " We are further referred to the legislation of Moses , ... comprising civil and criminal , ceremonial and ecclesiastical , moral and social law in varying compass . This legislation , however , can not have come from Moses .... Such legislation can only have arisen after Israel had lived a long time in the new home . " To take these arguments in order ,  --  for they must be so dealt with to develop any reasonable theory of the Mosaic philosophy ,  --  Moses , doubtless , was a ruthless conqueror , as his dealings with Sihon and Og sufficiently prove . " So the Lord our God delivered into our hands Og also , the king of Bashan , and all his people : and we smote him until none was left to him remaining .... " And we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king of Heshbon , utterly destroying the men , women , and children of every city . " Footnote : Deut . III , 3-6 . There is nothing extraordinary , or essentially barbarous , in this attitude of Moses . The same theory of duty or convenience has been held in every age and in every land , by men of the ecclesiastical temperament , at the very moment at which the extremest doctrines of charity , mercy , and love were practised by their contemporaries , or even preached by themselves . For example : At the beginning of the thirteenth century the two great convents of Cluny and Citeau , together , formed the heart of monasticism , and Cluny and Citeau were two of the richest and most powerful corporations in the world , while the south of France had become , by reason of the eastern trade , the wealthiest and most intelligent district in Europe . It suffices to say here that , just about this time , the people of Languedoc had made up their minds , because of the failure of the Crusades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by their results , and accordingly Count Raymond of Toulouse , in sympathy with his subjects , did seriously contemplate secularization . To the abbots of these great convents , it was clear that if this movement spread across the Rhone into Burgundy , the Church would face losses which they could not contemplate with equanimity . At this period one Arnold was Abbot of Citeau , universally recognized as perhaps the ablest and certainly one of the most unscrupulous men in Europe . Hence the crusade against the Albigenses which Simon de Montfort commanded and Arnold conducted . Arnold 's first exploit was the sack of the undefended town of Beziers , where he slaughtered twenty thousand men , women , and children , without distinction of religious belief . When asked whether the orthodox might not at least be spared , he replied , " Kill them all ; God knows his own . " This sack of Beziers occurred in 1209 . Exactly contemporaneously Saint Francis of Assisi was organizing his order whose purpose was to realize Christ 's kingdom upon earth , by the renunciation of worldly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and obedience . Soon after , Arnold was created Archbishop of Narbonne and became probably the greatest and richest prelate in France , or in the world . This was in 1225 . In 1226 the first friars settled in England . They multiplied rapidly because of their rigorous discipline . Soon there were to be found among them some of the most eminent men in England . Their chief house stood in London in a spot called Stinking Lane , near the Shambles in Newgate , and there , amidst poverty , hunger , cold , and filth , these men passed their lives in nursing horrible lepers , so loathsome that they were rejected by all but themselves , while Arnold lived in magnificence in his palace , upon the spoil of those whom he had immolated to his greed . In the case of Moses the contrast between precept and practice in the race for wealth and fortune was not nearly so violent . Moses , it is true , according to Leviticus , declared it to be the will of the Lord that the Israelites should love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 18. while on the other hand in Deuteronomy he insisted that obedience was the chief end of life , and that if the Israelites were to thoroughly obey the Lord 's behests , they were to " consume all the people which the Lord thy God shall deliver thee ; thine eye shall have no pity upon them : neither " should thou serve their gods , " for the Lord thy God is a jealous God . " Footnote : Deut . VII , 16 . And the penalty for slackness was " lest the anger of the Lord thy God be kindled against thee , and destroy thee from off the face of the earth . " Footnote : Deut . VI , 15 . There is , nevertheless , this much to be said in favor of the morality of Moses as contrasted with that of thirteenth-century orthodox Christians like Arnold ; Moses led a crusade against a foreign and hostile people , while Arnold slaughtered the Albigenses , who were his own flock , sheep to whom he was the shepherd , communicants in his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What concerns us , however , is that the same stimulant animated Moses and Arnold alike . The stimulant , pure and simple , of greed . On these points Moses was as outspokenly , one may say as brutally , frank as was Arnold . In the desert Moses commanded his followers to exterminate the inhabitants of the kingdom of Bashan in order that they might appropriate their possessions , which he enumerated , and Moses had no other argument to urge but the profitableness of it by which to secure obedience to his moral law . Arnold stood on precisely the same platform . He did not accuse Count Raymond of heresy or any other crime , nor did Pope Innocent III consider Raymond as morally guilty of a criminal offence , or worthy of punishment . Indeed , the pope would have protected the Count had it been possible , and summoned him before the Fourth Lateran Council for that purpose . But Arnold told his audience that were Raymond allowed to escape there would be an end of the Catholic faith in France . Or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps he was right . At all events , this argument prevailed , and Raymond and his family and people were sacrificed . Moses promised his congregation that , if they would spare nothing they should enjoy abundance of good things , without working for them . He was much more pitiless than such a man as King David thought it necessary to be , but Moses was not a soldier like David . He could not promise to win victories himself , he could but promise what he had in hand , and that was the spoil of those they massacred . Moses never had but one appeal to make for obedience , one incentive to offer to obey . In this he was perfectly honest and perfectly logical . His congregation and he , finding Egypt untenable , were engaged in a common land speculation to improve their condition ; a speculation in which Moses believed , but which could only be brought to a successful end by obtaining control of the dominant energy of the world . This energy , he held , could be handled by no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who acted with him were absolutely obedient to his commands , which , taken together , were equivalent to a magical exorcism or spell . Then only could they hope that the Lord of Abraham and Isaac would give them " great and goodly cities , which thou buildedst not , And houses full of all good things , which thou filledst not , and wells digged , which thou diggedst not , vineyards and olive trees , which thou plantedst not . " Footnote : Deut . VI , 10 , 11 . Very obviously , if the theory which Moses propounded were sound the assets which he offered as an inducement for docility could be obtained , at so cheap a rate , in no other way . All Moses ' moral teaching amounted , therefore , to this  --  " It pays to be obedient and good . " No argument could have been better adapted to Babylonish society , and it seems to have answered nearly as well with the Israelites , which proves that they stood on nearly the same intellectual plane . The chief difficulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not thoroughly believe in him , nor in the efficacy of his motor . They always were tempted to try experiments with other motors which were operated by other prophets and by other peoples who were , apparently , as prosperous as they , or even more so . His trouble was not that his followers were nomads unprepared for a sedentary life or a moral law like his , or unable to appreciate the value of the property of a people further advanced in civilization than they were . The Amalekites would have responded to no such system of bribery as Moses offered the Israelites , who did respond with intelligence , if not always with enthusiasm . The same is true of the Mosaic legislation which Dr. Budde curtly dismisses as impossible to have come from Moses , Footnote : Religion of Israel to the Exile , 31. as presupposing a knowledge of a settled agricultural life , which " Israel did not reach until after Moses ' death . " All this is an assumption of fact unsupported by evidence ; but quite the contrary , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question . Whatever may have been the date of the establishment of the cities of refuge , I suppose that it will not be seriously denied that the law of the covenant as laid down in Exodus XX , 1 , Numbers XXXV , 6 , is at least as old as the age of Moses , in principle , if not in words ; and this legal principle is quite inconsistent with , if not directly antagonistic to , all the prejudices and regulations , moral , religious , or civil , of a pure nomadic society , since it presupposes a social condition which , if adopted , would be fatal to a nomad society . The true nomad knows no criminal law save the law of the blood feud , which is the law of revenge , and which prevailed among the Hebrews much earlier . In the early Saxon law it was expressed by the apothegm " Factum reputabitur pro volunte . " The act implies the intent . That is to say , the tribe is an enlarged family who , since they have no collective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organized police , and courts with power to enforce process , have no option but to protect each other . Therefore , it is incumbent on each member of the tribe or family to avenge an injury to any other member , whether the injury be accidental or otherwise ; and to be himself the judge of what amounts to an injury . Such a condition prevailed among the Hebrews at a very early period ; " And God blessed Noah and his sons , and said unto them : ... at the hand of every man 's brother will I require the life of man . Whoso sheddeth man 's blood , by man shall his blood be shed . " Footnote : Gen. IX , 1 , 5 , 6 . These customs and the type of thought which sustain them are very tenacious and change slowly . Moses could not have altered the nomadic customs of thought and of blood revenge , had he tried , more than could Canute . It would have been impossible . The advent of a civilized conception of the law is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We know not how long ago it was that the law of the blood feud was fully recognized in England , but it had already been shaken at the conquest , and its death-blow was given it by the Church , which had begun to tire of the responsibility entailed by the trial by ordeal or miracle , and the obloquy which it involved , at a relatively early date . For the purposes of the Church and the uses of confession it was more convenient to regard crime or tort , as did the Romans ; as a mental condition , dependent altogether upon the state of the mind or " animus . " Malice in the eye of the Church was the virus which poisoned the otherwise innocent act , and made the thought alone punishable . Indeed , this conception is one which has not yet been completely established even in the modern law . The first signs of such a revolution in jurisprudence only began to appear in England some seven centuries ago . As Mr. Maitland has observed in his History of English Law , Footnote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shock of surprise when we meet with a maxim which has troubled our modern lawyers , namely , Reum nonfacit nisi mens rea , in the middle of the Leges Henrici . " That is to say somewhere about the year 1118 A.D. This maxim was taken bodily out of a sermon of Saint Augustine , which accounts for it , but at that time the Church had another process to suggest by which she asserted her authority . She threw the responsibility for detecting guilt , in cases of doubt , upon God . By the ordeal , if a homicide , for example , were committed , and the accused denied his guilt , he was summoned to appear , and then , after a solemn reference to God by the ecclesiastics in charge , he was caused either to carry a red-hot iron bar a certain distance or to plunge his arms in boiling water . If he were found , after a certain length of time , during which his arms were bandaged , to have been injured , he was held to have been guilty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gradually , however , the ordeal began to fall into ridicule . William Rufus gibed at it , for of fifty men sent to the ordeal of iron , under the sacred charge of the clerks , all escaped , which certainly , as Mr. Maitland intimates , looks as if the officiating ecclesiastics had an interest in the result . Footnote : History of English Law , II , 599 , note 2 . At length , by the Lateran Council of 1215 , the Church put an end to the institution , but long afterward it found its upholders . For example , the Mirror , written in the reign of Edward I ( circa 1285 ) complained , " It is an abuse that proofs and compurgations be not by the miracle of God where other proof faileth . " Nor was the principle that " attempts " to commit indictable offences are crimes , established as law , until at least the time of the Star Chamber , before its abolition in the seventeenth century . Though doubtless it is the law to-day . Footnote : Stephen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , although the means used may have been impossible . Moreover , the doctrine is still in process of enlargement the inception of the process of breaking down the right of enforcing the blood feud be fixed provisionally toward the middle of the tenth century ,  --  and this date is early enough ,  --  the movement of thought can not be said to have attained anything like ultimate results before at least the year 1321 when a case is cited wherein a man was held guilty because he had attempted to kill his master , and the " volunias in isto casu reputabitur pro facto . " Measuring by this standard five hundred years is a short enough period to estimate the time necessary for a community to pass from the stage when the blood feud is recognized as unquestioned law , to the status involved in the administration of the cities of refuge , for in these cities not only the mental condition is provided for as a legitimate defence , but the defence of negligence is made admissible in a secular court . " These six cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israel , and for the stranger , and for the sojourner among them ; that every one that killeth any person unawares may flee thither .... " If he thrust him of hatred , or hurl at him by laying of wait that he die ; " Or in enmity smite him with his hand , that he die : he that smote him shall surely be put to death ; for he is a murderer : the revenger of blood shall slay the murderer , when he meeteth him . " But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity , or have cast upon him anything without laying of wait , " Or with any stone , wherewith a man may die , seeing him not , and cast it upon him , that he die , and was not his enemy , neither sought his harm : " Then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the revenger of blood according to these judgments : " And the congregation shall deliver the slayer out of the hand of the revenger of blood , and the congregation shall restore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fled . " ... Footnote : Numbers XXXV , 15 , 20-25 . Here we have a defendant in a case of homicide setting up the defence that the killing happened through an accident , but an accident not caused by criminal negligence , and this defence is to be tried by the congregation , which is tantamount to trial by jury . It is not left to God , under the oversight of the Church ; and this is precisely our own system at the present day . We now come to the inferences to be drawn from these facts . Supposing that the Israelites when they migrated to Egypt , in the time of Joseph , were in the condition of pure nomads among whom the blood feud was fully recognized as law , an interval of four or five hundred years , such as they are supposed to have passed in Goshen would bring them to the exodus . Now , assuming that the Israelites during those four centuries , when they lived among civilized neighbors and under civilized law , made an intellectual movement corresponding in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they would have been , about the time when the cities of refuge were created , in the position described in Numbers , which is what we should expect assuming the Biblical tradition to be true . To us the important question is not whether a certain piece of the supposed Mosaic legislation actually went into effect during the life of Moses , for that is relatively immaterial , but whether the Biblical narrative is , on the whole , worthy of credence , and this correlation of dates gives the strongest possible evidence in its favor . Very possibly , perhaps it may even be said certainly , the order in which events occurred may have been transposed , but , taken as a whole , it is impossible to resist the inference that the Bible story is excellent history and that , due allowance being made for the prejudice of the various scribes who wrote the Pentateuch in favor of the miraculous , where Moses was concerned , the Biblical record is good and trustworthy history , and frank at that ;  --  much superior to quantities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the achievements of Moses ' life none equals the exodus itself , either in brilliancy or success . How it was possible for Moses , with the assistance he had at command , to marshal and move a column of a million or a million and a half of men , women , and children , without discipline or cohesion , and encumbered with their baggage , beside their cattle , is an insoluble mystery . " And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses ; and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver , and jewels of gold , and raiment : ... And they spoiled the Egyptians . And the children of Israel journeyed from Ramses to Succoth , about six hundred thousand on foot that were men , beside children . And a mixed multitude went up also with them ; and flocks and herds , even very much cattle . " They started from Ramses and Succoth . The position of Ramses has been identified ; that of Succoth is more questionable . Ramses and Pithom were fortified places , built by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but apparently Succoth was the last halting-place before coming to the difficult ground which was overflowed by the sea . The crossing was made at night , but it is hard to understand how , even under the most favorable conditions of weather , such a vast and confused multitude of women and children could have made the march in darkness with an active enemy pursuing , without loss of life or material . Indeed , even at that day the movement seemed to the actors so unparalleled that it always passed for a miracle , and its perfect success gave Moses more reputation with the Israelites and more practical influence over them than anything else he ever did , or indeed than all his other works together . " And Israel saw that great work which the Lord did upon the Egyptians : and the people feared the Lord and believed the Lord and his servant Moses . " " And Miriam , the prophetess , the sister of Aaron ; and all the women went after her with timbrels and with dances . " Now Miriam was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that day , or rather night , she did proclaim Moses as a conqueror ; which was a great concession from her , and meant much . And Moses exulted openly , as he had good cause to do , and gave vent to his exultation in a song which tradition has ever since attributed to him , and has asserted to have been sung by him and his congregation as they stood by the shore of the sea and watched the corpses of the Egyptians lying in the sand . And , if ever man had , Moses then had , cause for exultation , for he had seemingly proved by the test of war , which is the ultimate test to which a man can subject such a theory as his , that he had indeed discovered the motor which he sought , and , more important still , that he knew how to handle it . Therefore , he was master of supreme energy and held his right to command by the title of conquest . This was the culminating moment of his life ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow and gradual decline began . And , indeed , great as had been the momentary success of Moses , his position was one of extreme difficulty , and probably he so understood it , otherwise there would be no way to account for his choosing the long , difficult , and perilous journey by Sinai , instead of approaching the " Promised Land " directly by way of Kadesh-Barnea , which was , in any event , to be his ultimate objective . It may well have been because Moses felt himself unable alone to cope with the difficulties confronting him that he decided at any cost to seek Jethro in Midian , who seems to have been the only able , honest , and experienced man within reach . Joshua , indeed , might be held to be an exception to this generalization , but Joshua , though a good soldier , was a man of somewhat narrow understanding , and quite unfit to grapple with questions involving jurisprudence and financial topography . And at this juncture Moses must have felt his own deficiencies keenly . As a captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he well knew , at this moment lying in wait for him , and forthwith he recognized that he had no alternative but to retire into the background himself and surrender the active command of the army to Joshua , a fatal concession had Joshua been ambitious or unscrupulous . And this was but the beginning . Before he could occupy Palestine he had to encounter and overcome numbers of equally formidable foes , a defeat by any one of whom might well be fatal . A man like Jethro , therefore , would be invaluable in guiding the caravan to spots favorable for action , from whence retreat to a place of safety would be open in case of a check . A reverse which happened on a later occasion gave Moses a shock he never forgot . Furthermore , though Moses lived many years with Jethro , as his chief servant , he never seems to have travelled extensively in Arabia , and to have been ignorant of the chief trade routes along which wells were dug , and of the oases where pasture was to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guide , and this was a species of knowledge in which Jethro , according to Moses ' own statement , excelled . Meanwhile , the lives of all his followers depended on such knowledge . And Moses , when he reached Sinai , left no stone unturned to overcome Jethro 's reluctance to join him and to instruct him on the march north . More important and pressing than all , Moses was ignorant of how , practically , to administer the law which he taught . His only idea was to do all in person , but this , with so large a following , was impossible . And here also his hope lay in Jethro . For when he got to Sinai , and Jethro remonstrated with him upon his methods , pointing out that they were impracticable , all Moses had to say in reply was that he sat all day to hear disputes and " I judge between one and another ; and I do make them know the statutes of God , and his laws . " Further than this he had nothing to propose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the whole , upon this analysis , it appears that in all those executive departments in which Moses , by stress of the responsibilities which he had assumed , was called upon , imperatively , to act , there was but one , that of the magician or wise man , in which , by temperament and training , he was fitted to excel , and the functions of this profession drove him into to intolerably irksome and distressing position , yet a position from which throughout his life he found it impossible to escape . No one who attentively weighs the evidence can , I apprehend , escape the conviction that Moses was at bottom an honest man who would have conformed to the moral law he laid down in the name of the Lord had it been possible for him to do so . Among these precepts none ranked higher than a regard for truth and honesty . " Ye shall not steal , neither deal falsely , neither lie one to another . " Footnote : Leviticus XIX , 11 . And this text is but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these particular words of Leviticus , or any similar phrases , were ever used by Moses is immaterial . No one can doubt that , in substance , they contained the gist of his moral doctrine and that he enforced the moral duty which they convey to the best of his power . And here the burden lay , which crushed this man , from which he never thenceforward could , even for an instant , free himself , and which Saint Paul avers to be the heaviest burden man can bear . Moses , to fulfil what he conceived to be his destiny and which at least certainly was his ambition , was condemned to lead a life of deceit and to utter no word during his long subsequent march which was not positively or inferentially a lie . And the bitterest of his trials must have been the agony of anxiety in which he must have lived lest some error in judgment on his part , some slackness in measuring the exact credulity of his audience , should cause his exposure and lead to his being cast out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a false prophet : a fate which more than once nearly overtook him . Indeed , as he aged and his nerves lost their elasticity under the tension , he became obsessed with the fixed idea that God had renounced him and that some horror would overtake him should he attempt to cross the Jordan and enter the " Promised Land . " Defeated at Hormah , he dared not face another such check and , therefore , dawdled away his time in the wilderness until further dawdling became impossible . Then followed his mental collapse which is told in Deuteronomy , together with his suicide on Mount Nebo . And thus he died because he could not gratify at once his lust for power and his instinct to live an honest man . CHAPTER II . The interval during which Moses led the exodus falls , naturally , into three parts of unequal length . The first consists of the months which elapsed between the departure from Ramses and the arrival at Sinai . The second comprises the halt at Sinai , while the third contains the story of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His trials began forthwith . The march was hardly a week old before the column was in quasi-revolt because he had known so little of the country , that he had led the caravan three days through a waterless wilderness where they feared to perish from thirst . And matters grew steadily worse . At Rephidim , " And the people murmured against Moses , and said , Wherefore is this that thou hast brought us up out of Egypt , to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst ? " Not impossibly Moses may still , at this stage of his experiences , have believed in himself , in the God he pretended to serve , and in his mission . At least he made a feint of so doing . Indeed , he had to . Not to have done so would have caused his instant downfall . He always had to do so , in every emergency of his life . A few days later he was at his wits ' end . He cried unto the Lord , " What shall I do unto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In short , long before the congregation reached Sinai , and indeed before Moses had fought his first battle with Amalek , the people had come to disbelieve in Moses and also to question whether there was such a god as he pretended . " And he called the name of the place Massah , and Meribah , because of the chiding of the children of Israel , and because they tempted the Lord , saying , Is the Lord among us , or not ? " " Then came Amalek , and fought with Israel in Rephidim . " Footnote : Exodus xvii , 7 , 8 . Under such conditions it was vital to Moses to show resolution and courage ; but it was here that Moses , on the contrary , flinched ; as he usually did flinch when it came to war , for Moses was no soldier . " And Moses said unto Joshua , Choose us out men and go out , fight with Amalek : to-morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do as he proposed , nor did he even have the endurance to stand . He made Aaron and Hur fetch a stone on which he should sit and then hold up his hands for him , pretending the while that when Moses held up his hands the Hebrews prevailed and when he lowered them Amalek prevailed . Notwithstanding , Joshua won a victory . But it may readily be believed that this performance of his functions as a captain , did little to strengthen the credit of Moses among the fighting men . Nor evidently was Moses satisfied with the figure that he cut , nor was he confident that Joshua approved of him , for the Lord directed Moses to make excuses , promising to do better the next time , by assuring Joshua that " I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven . " This was the best apology Moses could make for his weakness . However , the time had now come when Moses was to realize his plan of meeting Jethro . " And Jethro ... came with his sons and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encamped at the mount of God : ... And Moses went out to meet his father-in-law , and did obeisance , and kissed him ; and they asked each other of their welfare ; and they came into the tent . " And Moses told his father-in-law all that the Lord had done unto Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel 's sake , and all the travail that had come upon them by the way , and how the Lord had delivered them .... " And Jethro said , Blessed be the Lord , who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians .... Now I know that the Lord is greater than all gods .... And Aaron came , and all the elders of Israel , to eat bread with Moses ' father-in-law before God . " It is from all this very plain that Jethro had a controlling influence over Moses , and was the proximate cause of much that followed . For the next morning Moses , as was his custom , " sat to judge the people : and the people stood by Moses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jethro saw how Moses proceeded he remonstrated , " Why sittest thou thyself alone , and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even ? " And Moses replied : " Because the people come unto me to enquire of God . " And Jethro protested , saying " The thing thou doest is not good . Thou wilt surely wear away , both thou and this people that is with thee : for this thing is too heavy for thee ; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone . " Hearken , ... I will give thee counsel , and God shall be with thee ; Be thou for the people to God-ward , that thou mayest bring the causes unto God . " Then it was that Moses perceived that he must have a divinely promulgated code . Accordingly , Moses made his preparations for a great dramatic effect , and it is hard to see how he could have made them better . For , whatever failings he may have had in his other capacities as a leader , he understood his part as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the third day , for on the third day the Lord would come down in the sight of all upon Mount Sinai . But , " Take heed to yourselves that ye go not up into the mount , or touch the border of it : whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death : " There shall not an hand touch it , but he shall surely be stoned or shot through ; whether it be beast or man , it shall not live : when the trumpet soundeth long , they shall come up to the mount . " It must be admitted that Moses either had wonderful luck , or that he had wonderful judgment in weather , for , as it happened in the passage of the Red Sea , so it happened here . At the Red Sea he was aided by a gale of wind which coincided with a low tide and made the passage practicable , and at Sinai he had a thunder-storm . " And it came to pass on the third day , in the morning , that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mount , and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud ; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled . " Moses had undoubtedly sent some thoroughly trustworthy person , probably Joshua , up the mountain to blow a ram 's horn and to light a bonfire , and the effect seems to have been excellent . " And Mount Sinai was altogether on a smoke , because the Lord descended upon it in fire : and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace , and the whole mount quaked greatly . " And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long , and waxed louder and louder , Moses spake , and God answered him by a voice . " And the Lord came down upon Mount Sinai , on the top of the mount ; and the Lord called Moses up to the top of the mount ; and Moses went up . " And the first thing that Moses did on behalf of the Lord was to " charge the people , lest they break through unto the Lord to gaze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied to God 's enquiry , " The people can not come up to Mount Sinai : for thou chargedst us , saying , Set bounds about the mount . " And the Lord said unto him , Away , get thee down , and thou shalt come up , thou , and Aaron with thee : but let not the priests and the people break through to come up unto the Lord , lest he break forth upon them . " So Moses went down unto the people , and spake unto them . " Whether the decalogue , as we know it , was a code of law actually delivered upon Sinai , which German critics very much dispute as being inconsistent with the stage of civilization at which the Israelites had arrived , but which is altogether kindred to the Babylonish law with which Moses was familiar , is immaterial for the present purpose . What is essential is that beside the decalogue itself there is a considerable body of law chiefly concerned with the position of servants or slaves , the difference between assaults or torts committed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the regulation of the lex talionis . There are beside a variety of other matters touched upon all of which may be found in the 21st , 22d , and 23d chapters of Exodus . Up to this point in his show Moses had behaved with discretion and had obtained a complete success . The next day he went on to demand an acceptance of his code , which he prepared to submit in form . But as a preliminary he made ready to take Aaron and his two sons , together with seventy elders of the congregation up the mountain , to be especially impressed with a sacrifice and a feast which he had it in his mind to organize . In the first place , " Moses ... rose up early in the morning , and builded an altar , ... and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen unto the Lord .... " And he took the book of the covenant , and read in the audience of the people : and they said , All that the Lord hath said will we do , and be obedient . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to return to the camp with his book of the covenant duly accepted as law , all might have been well . But success seems to have intoxicated him , and he conceived an undue contempt for the intelligence of his audience , being , apparently , convinced that there were no limits to their credulity , and that he could do with them as he pleased . It was not enough for him that he should have them accept an ordinary book admittedly written by himself . There was nothing overpoweringly impressive in that . What he wanted was a stone tablet on which his code should be engraved , as was the famous code of Hammurabi , which he probably knew well , and this engraving must putatively be done by God himself , to give it the proper solemnity . To have such a code as this engraved either by himself or by any workman he could take into the mountain with him , would be a work of time and would entail his absence from the camp , and this was a very serious risk . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than be baulked of his purpose , " And Moses rose up , and his minister Joshua ; and Moses went up into the mount of God . " And he said unto the elders , Tarry you here for us , until we come again unto you : and , behold , Aaron and Hur are with you : and if any man have matters to do , let him come unto them . And Moses went into the midst of the cloud , and gat him up into the mount : and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights . " But Moses had made the capital mistake of undervaluing the intelligence of his audience . They had , doubtless , been impressed when Moses , as a showman , had presented his spectacle , for Moses had a commanding presence and he had chosen a wonderful locality for his performance . But once he was gone the effect of what he had done evaporated and they began to value the exhibition for what it really was . As men of common sense , said they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Moses has played this trick upon us ? Why not go back to Egypt , where at least we can get something to eat ? So they decided to bribe Aaron , who was venal and would do anything for money . " And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount , the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron , and said unto him , Up , make us gods , which shall go before us ; for as for this Moses , the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt , we wot not what is become of him . " When Aaron heard this proposition he showed no objection to accept , provided the people made it worth his while to risk the wrath of Moses ; so he answered forthwith , " Break off the golden earrings , which are in the ears of your wives , of your sons , and of your daughters , and bring them unto me . " These were the ornaments of which the departing Israelites had spoiled the Egyptians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At all events , Aaron took them and melted them and made them into the image of a calf , such as he had been used to see in Egypt . The calf was probably made of wood and laminated with gold . Sir G. Wilkinson thinks that the calf was made to represent Mnevis , with whose worship the Israelites had been familiar in Egypt . Then Aaron proclaimed a feast for the next day in honor of this calf and said , " To-morrow is a feast to the Lord , " and they said , " These be thy gods , O Israel , which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt . " " And they rose up early on the morrow , and offered burnt offerings , and brought peace offerings : and the people sat down to eat and to drink , and rose up to play . " It was not very long before Moses became suspicious that all was not right in the camp , and he prepared to go down , taking the two tables of testimony in his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides , which must have taken a long time to engrave considering that Moses was on a bare mountainside with probably nobody to help but Joshua . Of course all that made this weary expedition worth the doing was that , as the Bible says , " the tables were " to pass for " the work of God , and the writing was the writing of God . " Accordingly , it is not surprising that as Moses " came nigh unto the camp , " and he " saw the calf , and the dancing " : that his " anger waxed hot , and he cast the tables out of his hands , and brake them beneath the mount . " And he took the calf which they had made , and burnt it in the fire , and ground it to powder , and strewed it upon the water , and made the children of Israel drink of it . " And Moses said unto Aaron , What did this people unto thee , that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them ? " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wax hot : thou knowest the people , that they are set on mischief . " For they said unto me , Make us gods , which shall go before us : for as for this Moses , the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt , we wot not what is become of him . " And I said unto them , Whosoever hath any gold , let them break it off . So they gave it me : then I cast it into the fire , and there came out this calf . " And when Moses saw that the people were naked ; ( for Aaron had made them naked unto their shame among their enemies : ) " that is to say , the people had come to the feast unarmed , and without the slightest fear or suspicion of a possible attack ; then Moses saw his opportunity and placed himself in a gate of the camp , and said : " Who is on the Lord 's side ? Let him come unto me . And all the sons of Levi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unto them , Thus saith the Lord God of Israel , Put every man his sword by his side , and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp , and slay every man his brother , and every man his companion , and every man his neighbour . " And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses : and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men . " There are few acts in all recorded history , including the awful massacres of the Albigenses by Simon de Montfort and the Abbot Arnold , more indefensible than this wholesale murder by Moses of several thousand people who had trusted him , and whom he had entrusted to the care of his own brother , who participated in their crime , supposing that they had committed any crime saving the crime of tiring of his dictatorship . The effect of this massacre was to put Moses , for the rest of his life , in the hands of the Levites with Aaron at their head , for only by having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his fortunes could Moses thenceforward hope to carry his adventure to a good end . Otherwise he faced certain and ignominious failure . His preliminary task , therefore , was to devise for the Levites a reward which would content them . His first step in this direction was to go back to the mountain and seek a new inspiration and a revelation more suited to the existing conditions than the revelation conveyed before the golden calf incident . Up to this time there is nothing in Jewish history to show that the priesthood was developing into a privileged and hereditary caste . With the consecration of Aaron as high priest the process began . Moses spent another six weeks in seclusion on the mount . And as soon as he returned to the camp he proclaimed how the people should build and furnish a sanctuary in which the priesthood should perform its functions . These directions were very elaborate and detailed , and part of the furnishings of the sanctuary consisted in the splendid and costly garments for Aaron and his sons " for glory and for beauty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garments , and anoint him , and sanctify him ; that he may minister unto me in the priest 's office . And thou shalt bring his sons , and clothe them with coats : And thou shalt anoint them , as thou didst anoint their father , that they may minister unto me in the priest 's office : for their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood , throughout their generations . " Thus did Moses : according to all that the Lord commanded him , so did he . " It followed automatically that , with the creation of a great vested interest centred in an hereditary caste of priests , the pecuniary burden on the people was correspondingly increased and that thenceforward Moses became nothing but the representative of that vested interest : as reactionary and selfish as all such representatives must be . How selfish and how reactionary may readily be estimated by glancing at Numbers XVIII , where God 's directions are given to Aaron touching what he was to claim for himself , and what the Levites were to take as their wages for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal more than much of the congregation thought such services worth . In the first place , Aaron and the Levites with him for their service " of the tabernacle " were to have " all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance . " But this was a small part of their compensation . There were beside perquisites , especially those connected with the sacrifices which the people were constrained to make on the most trifling occasions ; as , for example , whenever they became unclean , through some accident , as by touching a dead body : " This shall be thine of the most holy things , reserved from the fire : every oblation of their 's , every meat offering of their 's , and every sin offering of their 's , and every trespass offering of their 's , which they shall render unto me , shall be most holy for thee and thy sons . " In the most holy place shalt thou eat it ; every male shall eat it ; it shall be holy unto thee . " And this is thine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best of the wine , and of the wheat , the first fruits of them which they shall offer unto the Lord , them have I given thee ; ... every one that is clean in thine house shall eat of it . " Everything devoted in Israel shall be thine .... " All the heave offerings of the holy things , which the children of Israel offer unto the Lord , have I given thee , and thy sons and thy daughters with thee , by a statute forever : it is a covenant of salt forever before the Lord unto thee and to thy seed with thee . " Also , on the taking of a census , such as occurred at Sinai , Aaron received a most formidable perquisite . The Levites were not to be numbered ; but there was to be a complicated system of redemption at the rate of " five shekels by the poll , after the shekel of the sanctuary . " " And Moses took the redemption money of them that were over and above them that were redeemed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took he the money ; a thousand three hundred and three score and five shekels , after the shekel of the sanctuary ; And Moses gave the money of them that were redeemed unto Aaron and to his sons . " Assuming the shekel of those days to have weighed two hundred and twenty-four grains of silver , its value in our currency would have been about fifty-five cents , but its purchasing power , twelve hundred years before Christ , would have been , at the very most moderate estimate , at least ten for one , which would have amounted to between six and seven thousand dollars in hard cash for no service whatever , which , considering that the Israelites were a wandering nomadic horde in the wilderness , was , it must be admitted , a pretty heavy charge for the pleasure of observing the performances of Aaron and his sons , in their gorgeous garments . Also , under any sedentary administration it followed that the high priest must become the most considerable personage in the community , as well as one of the richest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Levites during the massacre of the golden calf , Moses created a theocratic aristocracy headed by Aaron and his sons , and comprising the whole tribe of Levi , whose advancement in fortune could not fail to create discontent . It did so : a discontent which culminated very shortly after in the rebellion of Korah , which brought on a condition of things at Kadesh which contributed to make the position of Moses intolerable . Moses was one of those administrators who were particularly reprobated by Saint Paul ; Men who " do evil , " as in the slaughter of the feasters who set up the golden calf , " that good may come , " and " whose damnation , " therefore , " is just . " Footnote : Romans III , 8 . And Moses wrought thus through ambition , because , though personally disinterested , he could not endure having his will thwarted . Aaron had nearly the converse of such a temperament . Aaron appears to have had few or no convictions ; it mattered little to him whether he worshipped Jehovah on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , provided he were paid at his own price . And he took care to exact a liberal price . Also the inference to be drawn from the way in which Moses behaved to him is that Moses understood what manner of man he was . Jethro stood higher in the estimation of Moses , and Moses did his best to keep Jethro with him , but , apparently , Jethro had watched Moses closely and was not satisfied with his conduct of the exodus . On the eve of departure from Sinai , just as the Israelites were breaking camp , Moses sought out Jethro and said to him ; " We are journeying unto the place of which the Lord said , I will give it you ; come thou with us , and we will do thee good ; for the Lord has spoken good concerning Israel . " And he said unto him , I will not go ; but I will depart to mine own land , and to my kindred . " Not discouraged , Moses kept on urging : " Leave us not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to encamp in the wilderness , and thou mayest be to us instead of eyes . " And it shall be , if thou go with us , yea , it shall be , that what goodness the Lord shall do unto us , the same will we do unto thee . " It has been inferred from a passage in Judges , Footnote : Judges I , 16. that Moses induced Jethro to reconsider his refusal and that he did accompany the congregation in its march to Kadesh , but , on the whole , the text of the Bible fails to bear out such inference , for there is no subsequent mention of Jethro in the books which treat directly of the trials of the journey , although there would seem to have been abundant occasion for Moses to have called upon Jethro for aid had Jethro been present . In his apparent absence the march began , under the leadership of the Lord and Moses , very much missing Jethro . They departed from the mount : " And the cloud of the Lord was upon them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to search out a resting-place . " Certainly , on this occasion , the Lord selected a poor spot for the purpose , quite different from such an one as Jethro would have been expected to have pointed out ; for the children of Israel began complaining mightily , so much so that it displeased the Lord who sent fire into the uttermost parts of the camp , where it consumed them . " And the people cried unto Moses , and when Moses prayed unto the Lord , the fire was quenched . " This suggestion of a divine fire under the control of Moses opens an interesting speculation . The Magi , who were the priests of the Median religion , greatly developed the practices of incantation and sorcery . Among these rites they " pretended to have the power of making fire descend on to their altars by means of magical ceremonies . " Footnote : Lenormant , Chaldean Magic , 226 , 238 . Moses appears to have been very fond of this particular miracle . It is mentioned as having been effective here at Taberah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's rebellion . Moses was indeed a powerful enchanter . His relations with all the priestcraft of central Asia were intimate , and if the Magi had secrets which were likely to be of use to him in maintaining his position among the Jews , the inference is that he would certainly have used them to the utmost ; as he did the brazen serpent , the ram 's horns at Sinai , and the like . But in spite of all his miracles Moses found his task too heavy , and he frankly confessed that he wished himself dead . " Then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families ... and the anger of the Lord was kindled greatly ; Moses also was displeased . " And Moses said unto the Lord , Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy servant ? ... that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me ? " Have I conceived all this people ? have I begotten them , that thou shouldest say unto me , Carry them in thy bosom , as a nursing father beareth the sucking child , unto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people ? for they weep unto me saying , Give us flesh that we may eat . " I am not able to bear all this people alone , because it is too heavy for me . " And if thou deal thus with me , kill me , I pray thee , out of hand , if I have found favour in thy sight ; and let me not see my wretchedness . " Leaving aside for the moment all our childish preventions , and considering this evidence in the cold light of history , it becomes tolerably evident that Moses had now reached the turning-point in his career , the point whither he had inexorably tended since the day on which he bid good-bye to Jethro to visit Egypt and attempt to gain control of the exodus , and the point to which all optimists must come who resolve to base a religious or a political movement on the manipulation of the supernatural . However pure and disinterested the motives of such persons may be at the outset , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their mission , sooner or later , to compass their purpose , they must resort to deception and thus become impostors who flourish on the credulity of their dupes . Moses , from the nature of the case , had to make such demands on the credulity of his followers that even those who were bound to him by the strongest ties of affection and self-interest were alienated , and those without such commanding motives to submit to his claim to exact from them absolute obedience , revolted , and demanded that he should be deposed . The first serious trouble with which Moses had to contend came to a head at Hazeroth , the second station after leaving Sinai . The supposed spot is still used as a watering-place . There Miriam and Aaron attacked Moses because they were jealous of his wife , whom they decried as an " Ethiopian . " And they said , " Hath the Lord indeed spoken only by Moses ? hath he not spoken also by us ? " Instantly , it became evident to Moses that if this denial of his superior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must end . Accordingly the Lord came down " in the pillar of the cloud , and stood in the door of the tabernacle , and called Aaron and Miriam : and they both came forth . " And the Lord explained that he had no objection to a prophet ; if any one among the congregation had an ambition to be a prophet he would communicate with him in a dream ; but there must always be a wide difference between such a man or woman and Moses with whom he would " speak mouth to mouth , even apparently , and not in dark speeches . " And then God demanded irritably , " Wherefore , then , were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses ? " " Afterward the cloud , " according to the Bible , departed and God with it . Ever since the dawn of time the infliction of or the cure of disease has been the stronghold of the necromancer , the wise man , the magician , the saint , the prophet and the priest , and Moses was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no occasion to display his powers of this kind . Nevertheless , among the Hebrews of the exodus , the field for this form of miracle was large . Leprosy was very prevalent , so much so that in Egypt the Jews were called a nation of lepers . And in the camp the regulations touching them were strict and numerous . But the Jews were always a dirty race . In chapter XIII of Leviticus , elaborate directions are given as to how the patient shall be brought before Aaron himself , or at least some other of the priests , who was to examine the sore and , if it proved to be a probable case of leprosy , the patient was to be excluded from the camp for a week . At the end of that time the disease , if malignant , was supposed to show signs of spreading , in which case there was no cure and the patient was condemned to civil death . On the contrary , if no virulent symptoms developed during the week , the patient was pronounced clean and returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was this : When the cloud departed from off the tabernacle , Miriam was found to be " leprous , white as snow , " just as Moses ' hand was found to be white with leprosy after his conversation with the Lord at the burning bush . Upon this Aaron , who had been as guilty as Miriam , and was proportionately nervous , made a prayer to Moses : " Alas , my lord , I beseech thee , lay not the sin upon us , wherein we have done foolishly .... Let her not be as one dead . " And Moses cried unto the Lord , saying , Heal her now , O God , I beseech thee . " But the Lord replied : " If her father had but spit in her face , should she not be ashamed seven days ? Let her be shut out from the camp seven days , and after that let her be received in again . " This was the Mosaic system of discipline . And it was serious for all parties concerned . Evidently it was very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and be exiled to some spot in the desert , where she had to shift for herself . We all know the almost intolerable situation of those unfortunates who , in the East , are excluded from social intercourse , and sit without the gate , and are permitted to approach no one . But it was also a serious infliction for the congregation , since Miriam was a personage of consequence , and had to be waited for . That is to say , a million or two of people had to delay their pilgrimage until Moses had determined how much punishment Miriam deserved for her insubordination , and this was a question which lay altogether within the discretion of Moses . In that age there were at least seven varieties of eruptions which could hardly , if at all , be distinguished , in their early stages , from leprosy , and it was left to Moses to say whether or not Miriam had been attacked by true leprosy or not . There was no one , apparently , to question his judgment , for , since Jethro had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mosaic opinion on matters such as these . Doubtless Moses was content to give Aaron and Miriam a fright ; but also Moses intended to make them understand that they lay absolutely at his mercy . After this outbreak of discontent had been thus summarily suppressed and Miriam had been again received as " clean , " the caravan resumed its march and entered into the wilderness of Paran , which adjoined Palestine , and from whence an invasion of Canaan , if one were to be attempted , would be organized . Accordingly Moses appointed a reconnaissance , who in the language of the Bible are called " spies , " to examine the country , report its condition , and decide whether an attack were feasible . On this occasion Moses seems to have remembered the lesson he learned at Sinai . He did not undertake to leave the camp himself for a long interval . He sent the men whom he supposed he could best trust , among whom were Joshua and Caleb . These men , who corresponded to what , in a modern army , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacture a report which they might have reason to suppose would be pleasing to Moses , but to state precisely what they saw and heard together with their conclusions thereon , that they might aid their commander in an arduous campaign ; and this duty they seem , honestly enough , to have performed . But this was very far from satisfying Moses , who wanted to make a strenuous offensive , and yet sought some one else to take the responsibility therefor . The spies were absent six weeks and when they returned were divided in opinion . They all agreed that Canaan was a good land , and , in verity , flowing with milk and honey . But the people , most of them thought , were too strong to be successfully attacked . " The cities were walled and very great , " and moreover " we saw the children of Anak there . " " The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south ; and the Hittites , and the Jebusites , and the Amorites , dwell in the mountains ; and the Canaanites dwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And Caleb stilled the people before Moses , and said , Let us go up at once , ... for we are well able to overcome it . " But the men that went up with him said , We be not able to go up against the people ; for they are stronger than we . " And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched , ... saying , ... all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature . " And there we saw the giants , the sons of Anak , ... and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers , and so were we in their sight . " Had Moses been gifted with military talent , or with any of the higher instincts of the soldier , he would have arranged to have received this report in private and would then have acted as he thought best . Above all he would have avoided anything like a council of war by the whole congregation , for a vast popular meeting of that kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their command , upon a difficult question of policy . Moses did just the opposite . He convened the people to hear the report of the " spies . " And immediately the majority became dangerously depressed , not to say mutinous . " And all the congregation lifted up their voice , and cried ; and the people wept that night . " And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron : and the whole congregation said unto them , Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt ! Or would God we had died in this wilderness ! ... " And they said one to another , Let us make a captain , and let us return into Egypt . " Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel . " But Joshua , who was a soldier , when Moses thus somewhat ignominiously collapsed , retained his presence of mind and his energy . He and Caleb " rent their clothes , " and reiterated their advice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children of Israel , saying , The land which we passed through to search it , is an exceeding good land . " If the Lord delight in us , then he will bring us into this land , and give it us ; a land which floweth with milk and honey . " Only rebel not ye against the Lord , neither fear ye the people of the land ; for they are bread for us : their defence is departed from them ... fear them not . " But all the congregation bade stone them with stones . " By this time Moses seems to have recovered some composure . Enough , at least , to repeat certain violent threats of the " Lord . " Nothing is so impressive in all this history as the difference between Moses when called upon to take responsibility as a military commander , and Moses when , not to mince matters , he acted as a quack . On the one hand , he was all vacillation , timidity , and irritability . On the other , all temerity and effrontery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Moses vented his disappointment and vexation in a number of interviews which he pretended to have had with the " Lord , " and which he retailed to the congregation , just at the moment when they needed , as Joshua perceived , to be steadied and encouraged . " How long , " vociferated the Lord , when Moses had got back his power of speech , " will this people provoke me ? and how long will it be ere they believe me , for all the signs which I have shewed among them ? " I will smite them with the pestilence , and disinherit them , and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they . " But when Moses had cooled a little and came to reflect upon what he had made the " Lord " say , he fell into his ordinary condition of hesitancy . Supposing some great disaster should happen to the Jews at Kadesh , which lay not so very far from the Egyptian border , the Egyptians would certainly hear of it , and in that case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a contingency was not to be contemplated , and accordingly Moses began to make reservations . It must be remembered that all these ostensible conversations with the " Lord " went on in public ; that is to say , Moses proffered his advice to the Lord aloud , and then retailed his version of the answer he received . " Now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man , then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak , saying , " Because the Lord was not able to bring this people into the land which he sware unto them , therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness .... " Pardon , I beseech thee , the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy mercy , and as thou hast forgiven this people from Egypt even until now . " And the Lord said , I have pardoned according to thy word . " Had Moses left the matter there it would not have been so bad , but he could not contain his vexation , because his staff had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had done their strict duty only , must be punished , so he thought , to maintain his ascendancy . Of the twelve " spies " whom Moses had sent into Canaan to report to him , ten had incurred his bitter animosity because they failed to render him such a report as would sustain him before the people in making the campaign of invasion to which he felt himself pledged , and on the success of which his reputation depended . Of these ten men , Moses , to judge by the character of his demands upon the Lord , thought it incumbent on him to make an example , in order to sustain his own credit . To simply exclude these ten spies from Palestine , as he proposed to do with the rest of the congregation , would hardly be enough , for the rest of the Hebrews were , at most , passive , but these ten had wilfully ignored the will of Moses , or , as he expressed it , of the Lord . Therefore it was the Lord 's duty , as Moses saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Lord should do in a prompt and awful manner : the lesson being pointed by the immunity of Joshua and Caleb , the two spies who had had the wit to divine the will of Moses . Therefore , all ten of these men died of the plague while the congregation lay encamped at Kadesh , though Joshua and Caleb remained immune . Moses , as the commanding general of an attacking army , took a course diametrically opposed to that of Joshua , and calculated to be fatal to victory . He vented his irritation in a series of diatribes which he attributed to the " Lord , " and which discouraged and confused his men at the moment when their morale was essential to success . Therefore , the Lord , according to Moses , went on : " But as truly as I live , all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord . " Because all those men which have seen my glory , and my miracles , which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness , have tempted me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my voice ; " Surely they shall not see the land which I swear unto their fathers , neither shall any of them that provoked me see it : " But my servant Caleb , because he had another spirit with him , and hath followed me fully , him will I bring into the land whereinto he went ; ... " Having said all this , and , as far as might be , disorganized the army , Moses surrendered suddenly his point . He made the " Lord " go on to command : " Tomorrow turn you , and get you into the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea . " But , not even yet content , Moses assured them that this retreat should profit them nothing . " And the Lord spake unto Moses and unto Aaron , saying , How long shall I bear with this evil congregation , which murmur against me ? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel , which they murmur against me . " And the Lord continued : " Say unto them , As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mine ears , so will I do to you . " Your carcases shall fall in this wilderness ; and all that were numbered of you , ... from twenty years old and upward , which have murmured against me , " Doubtless ye shall not come into the land .... " But as for you , your carcases , they shall fall in this wilderness .... " And the men which Moses sent to search the land , who returned , and made all the congregation to murmur against him , by bringing up a slander upon the land ,  --  " Even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land , died by the plague before the Lord . " But Joshua ... and Caleb , ... which were of the men that went to search the land , lived still . " And Moses told these sayings unto all the children of Israel and the people mourned greatly . " The congregation were now completely out of hand . They knew not what Moses wanted to do , nor did they comprehend what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had in mind some dire mischief . Accordingly , the people decided that the best thing for them was to go forward as Joshua and Caleb proposed . So , early in the morning , they went up into the top of the mountain , saying , " We be here , and will go up unto the place which the Lord hath promised : for we have sinned . " But Moses was more dissatisfied than ever . " Wherefore now do you transgress the commandment of the Lord ? But it shall not prosper . " Notwithstanding , " they presumed to go up unto the hilltop : nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the Lord , and Moses , departed not out of the camp . " Then the Amalekites came down , and the Canaanites , which dwelt in that hill , and smote them , and discomfited them , even unto Hormah " ; which was at a very considerable distance ,  --  perhaps not less than thirty miles , though the positions are not very well established . This is the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , said the best that could be said for Moses . But he makes a sorry tale of it . According to him , Moses , having been disappointed with the report made by his officers on the advisability of an immediate offensive , committed the blunder of summoning the whole assembly of the people to listen to it , and then , in the midst of the panic he had created , he lost his self-possession and finally his temper . Whereupon his soldiers , not knowing what to do or what he wanted , resolved to follow the advice of Joshua and advance . But this angered Moses more than ever , who committed the unpardonable crime in the eyes of the soldier ; he abandoned his men in the presence of the enemy and by this desertion so weakened them that they sustained the worst defeat the Israelites suffered during the whole of their wanderings in the wilderness . Such a disaster brought on a crisis . The only wonder is that it had been so long delayed . Moses had had since the exodus a wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had asserted that the universe was the expression of a single and supreme mind , which operated according to a fixed moral law . That he alone , of all men , understood this mind , and could explain and administer its law , and that this he could and would do were he to obtain absolute obedience to the commands which he uttered . Were he only obeyed , he would win for his followers victory in battle , and a wonderful land to which they should march under his guidance , which was the Promised Land , and thereafter all was to be well with them . The disaster at Hormah had demonstrated that he was no general , and even on that very day the people had proof before their eyes that he knew nothing of the desert , and that the Lord knew no more than he , since there was no water at Kadesh , and to ask the congregation to encamp in such a spot was preposterous . Meanwhile Moses absorbed all the offices of honor and profit for his family . Aaron and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grievance to other equally ambitious Levites . In short , the Mosaic leadership was vulnerable on every hand . Attack on Moses was , therefore , inevitable , and it came from Korah , who was leader of the opposition . Korah was a cousin of Moses , and one of the ablest and most influential men in the camp , to whom Dathan and Abiram and " two hundred and fifty " princes of the assembly , famous in the congregation , men of renown , joined themselves . " And they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron , and said unto them , Ye take too much upon you , seeing all the congregation are holy , every one of them , and the Lord is among them : wherefore then lift you up yourselves above the congregation of the Lord ? " Koran 's grievance was that he had been , although a Levite , excluded from the priesthood in favor of the demands of Aaron and his sons . " And when Moses heard it , he fell upon his face . " And yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger . His life hung upon the issue . As between him and Korah he had to demonstrate which was the better sorcerer or magician , and he could only do this by challenging Korah to the test of the ordeal : the familiar test of the second clause of the code of Hammurabi ; " If the holy river makes that man to be innocent , and has saved him , he who laid the spell upon him shall be put to death . He who plunged into the holy river shall take to himself the house of him who wove the spell upon him . " Footnote : Code of Laws promulgated by Hammurabi , King of Babylon . Translated by C. H. W. Johns , M.A. , Section 2 . And so with Elijah , to whom Ahaziah sent a captain of fifty to arrest him . And Elijah said to the captain of fifty , " If I be a man of God , then let fire come down from heaven , and consume thee and thy fifty . And there came down fire from heaven , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 Kings I , 10 . In a word , the ordeal was the common form of test by which the enchanter , the sorcerer , or the magician always was expected to prove himself . Moses already had tried the test by fire at least once , and probably oftener . So now Moses reproached Korah because he was jealous of Aaron ; " and what is Aaron , that ye murmur against him ? ... This do ; Take you censers , Korah , and all his company ; and put fire therein , and put incense in them before the Lord to-morrow ; and ... whom the Lord doth choose , he shall be holy : ye take too much upon you , ye sons of Levi . " But it was not only about the priesthood that Moses had trouble on his hands . He had undertaken , with the help of the Lord , to lead the Israelites through the wilderness . But at every step of the way his incompetence became more manifest . Even there , at that very camp of Kadesh , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , therefore , Dathan and Abiram taunted him with failure , and with his injustice to those who served him . And Moses had no reply , except that he denied having abused his power . " And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram , the sons of Eliab : which said , We will not come up : " Is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land that floweth with milk and honey , to kill us in the wilderness , except thou make thyself altogether a prince over us ? " Moreover , thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey , or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards : wilt thou put out the eyes of these men probably alluding to the " spies " ? We will not come up . " This was evidently an exceedingly sore spot . Moses had boasted that , because the " spies " had rendered to the congregation what they believed to be a true report instead of such a report as he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plague . And it is pretty evident that the congregation believed him . It could hardly have been by pure accident that out of twelve men , the ten who had offended Moses should have died by the plague , and the other two alone should have escaped . Moses assumed to have the power of destroying whom he pleased by the pestilence through prayer to the " Lord , " and he , indeed , probably had the power , in such a spot as an ancient Jewish Nomad camp , not indeed by prayer , but by the very human means of communicating so virulent a poison as the plague : means which he very well understood . Therefore it is not astonishing that this insinuation should have stung Moses to the quick . " And Moses was very wroth , and said unto the Lord , Respect not thou their offering : I have not taken one ass from them , neither have I hurt one of them . " Then Moses turned to Korah , " Be thou and all thy company before the Lord , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And take every man his censer , and put incense in them , and bring ye before the Lord every man his censer , two hundred and fifty censers . " And Korah , on the morrow , gathered all the congregation against them unto the door of the tabernacle . And the " Lord " then as usual intervened and advised Moses to " separate yourselves from among this congregation , that I may consume them in a moment . " And Moses did so . That is to say , he made an effort to divide the opposition , who , when united , he seems to have appreciated , were too strong for him . What happened next is not known . That Moses partially succeeded in his attempt at division is admitted , for he persuaded Dathan and Abiram and their following to " depart ... from the tents of these wicked men , and touch nothing of theirs , lest ye be consumed in all their sins . " Exactly what occurred after this is unknown . The chronicle , of course , avers that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , and their houses , and all the men that appertained unto Korah , and all their goods . " But it could not have been this or anything like it , for the descendants of Korah , many generations after , were still doing service in the Temple , and at the time of the miracle the spectators were not intimidated by the sight , although all " Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them : for they said , Lest the earth swallow us up also . " And there came out a fire from the Lord , and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense . " Notwithstanding all which , the congregation next day were as hostile and as threatening as ever . " On the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron , saying , Ye have killed the people of the Lord .... " And they fell upon their faces . " In this crisis of his fate , when it seemed that nothing could save Moses from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had renounced him , Moses showed that audacity and fertility of resource , which had hitherto enabled him , and was destined until his death to enable him , to maintain his position , at least as a prophet , among the Jewish people . The plague was always the most dreaded of visitations among the ancient Jews : far more terrible than war . It was already working havoc in the camp , as the death of the " spies " shows us . Moses always asserted his ability to control it , and at this instant , when , apparently , he and Aaron were lying on their faces before the angry people , he conceived the idea that he would put his theurgetic powers to the proof . Suddenly he called to Aaron to " take a censer and put fire therein from off the altar , and put on incense , and go quickly unto the congregation , and make an atonement for them : for there is wrath gone out from the Lord ; the plague is begun . " " And Aaron took as Moses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and , behold , the plague was begun among the people : ... and made an atonement for the people . " And he stood between the dead and the living ; and the plague was stayed . " Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred , beside them that died about the matter of Korah . " Even this was not enough . The discontent continued , and Moses went on to meet it by the miracle of Aaron 's rod . Moses took a rod from each tribe , twelve rods in all and on Aaron 's rod he wrote the name of Levi , and Moses laid them out in the tabernacle . And the next day Moses examined the rods and showed the congregation how Aaron 's rod had budded . And Moses declared that Aaron 's rod should be kept for a token against the rebels : and that they must stop their murmurings " that they die not . " This manipulation of the plague by Moses , upon what seems to have been a sudden inspiration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was , indeed , in this way almost portentous . It had a great and terrifying effect upon the people , who were completely subdued by it . Against corporeal enemies they might hope to prevail , but they were helpless against the plague . And they all cried out with one accord , " Behold we die , we perish , we all perish . Whosoever cometh anything near unto the tabernacle of the Lord shall die : shall we be consumed with dying ? " As I have already pointed out , Moses was a very great theurgist , as many saints and prophets have been . When in the actual presence of others he evidently had the power of creating a belief in himself which approached the miraculous , so far as disease was concerned . And he presumed on this power and took correspondingly great risks . The case of the brazen serpent is an example . The story is  --  and there is no reason to doubt its substantial truth  --  that the Hebrews were attacked by venomous serpents probably in the neighborhood of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up a large brazen serpent on a pole , and declared that whoever would look upon the serpent should live . Also , apparently , it did produce an effect upon those who believed : which , of course , is not an unprecedented phenomenon among faith healers . But what is interesting in this historical anecdote is not that Moses performed certain faith cures by the suggestion of a serpent , but that the Israelites themselves , when out of the presence of Moses , recognized that he had perpetrated on them a vulgar fraud . For example , King Hezekiah destroyed this relic , which had been preserved in the Temple , calling it " Nehushtan , " " a brazen thing , " as an expression of his contempt . And what is more remarkable still is that although Hezekiah reigned four or five centuries after the exodus , yet science had made no such advance in the interval as to justify this contempt . Hezekiah seems to have been every whit as credulous as were the pilgrims who looked on the brazen serpent and were healed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to see him , and told him to set his house in order ; for thou shalt die , and not live .... And Hezekiah wept sore . " Then , like Moses , Isaiah had another revelation in which he was directed to return to Hezekiah , and tell him that he was to live fifteen years longer . And Isaiah told the attendants to take " a lump of figs . " " And they took it and laid it on the boil , and he recovered . " Afterward Hezekiah asked of Isaiah how he was to know that the Lord would keep his word and give him fifteen additional years of life . Isaiah told him that the shadow should go back ten degrees on the dial . And Isaiah " cried unto the Lord , " and he brought the shadow ten degrees backward " by which it had gone down in the dial of Ahaz . " Footnote : 2 Kings xx , 11 . And yet this man Hezekiah , who could believe in this marvellous cure of Isaiah , repudiated with scorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrast between Moses , who hesitated not to take all risks in matters of disease with which he felt himself competent to cope , and his timidity and hesitation in matters of war , is astounding . But it is a common phenomenon with the worker of miracles and indicates the limit of faith at which the saint or prophet has always betrayed the impostor . For example : Saint Bernard , when he preached in 1146 the Second Crusade , made miraculous cures by the thousand , so much so that there was danger of being killed in the crowds which pressed upon him . And yet this same saint , when chosen by the crusaders four years later , in 1150 , to lead them because of his power to constrain victory by the intervention of God , wrote , after the crusaders ' defeat , in terror to the pope to protect him , because he was unfit to take such responsibility . But even with this reservation Moses could not gain the complete confidence of the congregation and the insecurity of his position finally broke him down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and the people chode with Moses because there was no water for the congregation . " Footnote : Numbers xx , 8 . Moses thereupon withdrew and , as usual , received a revelation . And the Lord directed him to take his rod , " and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes ; and it shall give forth his water . " And Moses gathered the congregation and said unto them , " Hear now , ye rebels ; must we fetch you water out of this rock ? " " And he smote the rock twice : and the water came out abundantly . " But Moses felt that he had offended God , " Because ye believed me not , to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel , therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them . " Moses had become an old man , and he felt himself unequal to the burden he had assumed . He recognized that his theory of cause and effect had broken down , and that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed to be an actual and efficient power to be dominated by him , either could not or would not support him in emergency . In short , he had learned that he was an adventurer who must trust to himself . Hence , after Hormah he was a changed man . Nothing could induce him to lead the Jews across the Jordan to attack the peoples on the west bank , and though the congregation made a couple of campaigns against Sihon and Og , whose ruthlessness has always been a stain on Moses , the probability is that Moses did not meddle much with the active command . Had he done so , the author of Deuteronomy would have given the story in more detail and Moses more credit . All that is attributed to Moses is a division of the conquests made together with Joshua , and a fruitless prayer to the Lord that he might be permitted to cross the Jordan . Meanwhile life was ending for him . His elder sister Miriam died at Kadesh , and Aaron died somewhat later at Mount Hor , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Kadesh as Hormah is to the west , but there are circumstances about the death of Aaron which point to Moses as having had more to do with it than of having been a mere passive spectator thereof . The whole congregation is represented as having " journeyed from Kadesh and come unto Mount Hor ... by the coast of the land of Edom , " and there the " Lord " spoke unto Moses and Aaron , and explained that Aaron was to be " gathered unto his people , ... because ye rebelled ... at the water of Meribah . " Therefore Moses was to " take Aaron and Eleazar his son , and bring them up unto Mount Hor : and strip Aaron of his garments , and put them upon Eleazar , " ... and that Aaron ... shall die there . " And they went up into Mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation . And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments , and put them upon Eleazar his son ; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount : and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Footnote : Numbers xx , 22-28 . Now it is incredible that all this happened as straightforwardly as the chronicle would have us believe . Aaron was an old man and probably failing , but his death was not imminent . On the contrary , he had strength to climb Mount Hor with Moses , without aid , and there is no hint that he suffered from any ailment likely to end his life suddenly . Moses took care that he and Eleazar should be alone with Aaron so that there should be no witness as to what occurred , and Moses alone knew what was expected . Moses had time to take off the priestly garments , which were the insignia of office and to put them on Eleazar , and then , when all was ready , Aaron simply ceased to breathe at the precise moment when it was convenient for Moses to have him die , for the policy of Moses evidently demanded that Aaron should live no longer . Under the conditions of the march Moses was evidently preparing for his own death , and for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his leadership had broken down and that the system he had created was collapsing , he had dawdled as long on the east side of the Jordan as the patience of the congregation would permit . An advance had become inevitable , but Moses recognized his own inability to lead it . The command had to be delegated to a younger man and that man was Joshua . Eleazar , on the other hand , was the only available candidate for the high priesthood , and Moses took the opportunity of making the investiture on Mount Hor . So Aaron passed away , a sacrifice to the optimism of Moses . Next came the turn of Moses himself . The whole story is told in Deuteronomy . Within , probably , something less than a year after Aaron 's death the " Lord " made a like communication to Moses . " Get thee up ... unto Mount Nebo , which is in the land of Moab , that is over against Jericho ; " And die in the Mount whither thou goest up , and be gathered unto thy people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " Because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah-Kadesh , in the wilderness of Zin , because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel . " And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of Nebo , ... And the Lord showed him all the land of Gilead , unto Dan . " And Moses the servant of the Lord died there in the land of Moab , according to the word of the Lord .... But no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day . " And Moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died : his eye was not dim , nor his natural force abated . " The facts , as preserved by Josephus , appear to have been these : Moses ascended the mountain with only the elders , the high priest Eleazar , and Joshua . At the top of the mountain he dismissed the elders , and then , as he was embracing Joshua and Eleazar and still speaking , a cloud covered him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words , he killed himself . Such is the story of Moses , a fragment of history interesting enough in itself , but especially material to us not only because of the development of the thought dealt with in the following volumes , but of the inferences which , at the present time , it permits us to draw touching our own immediate future . Moses was the first great optimist of whom any record remains , and one of the greatest . He was the prototype of all those who have followed . He was a visionary . All optimists must be visionaries . Moses based the social system which he tried to organize , not on observed facts , but on a priori theories evolved out of his own mind , and he met with the failure that all men of that cast of mind must meet with when he sought to realize his visions . His theory was that the universe about him was the expression of an infinite mind which operated according to law . That this mind , or consciousness , was intelligent and capable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so communicate through him , as a medium , and that other men had only to receive humbly and obey implicitly his revelations to arrive at a condition nearly approaching , if not absolutely reaching , perfection , while they should enjoy happiness and prosperity in the land in which they should be permitted , by an infinite and supernatural power and wisdom , to dwell . All this is not alien to the attitude of scientific optimists at the present day , who anticipate progressive perfection . Let us consider , for a moment , whither these a priori theories led , when put in practice upon human beings , including himself . And , in the first place , it will probably be conceded that no optimist could have , or ever hope to have , a fairer opportunity to try his experiment than had Moses on that plastic Hebrew community which he undertook to lead through Arabia . Also it must be admitted that Moses , as an expounder of a moral code , achieved success . The moral principles which he laid down have been accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still written up in our churches , as a standard for men and women , however slackly they may be observed . But when we come to mark the methods by which Moses obtained acceptance of his code by his contemporaries , and , above all , sought to constrain obedience to himself and to it , we find the prospect unalluring . To begin with , Moses had only begun the exodus when he learned from his practical father-in-law that the system he employed was fantastic and certain to fail : his notion being that he should sit and judge causes himself , as the mouthpiece of the infinite , and that therefore each judgment he gave would demand a separate miracle or imposture . This could not be contemplated . Therefore Moses was constrained to impose his code in writing , once for all , by one gigantic fraud which he must perpetrate himself . This he tried at Sinai , unblushingly declaring that the stone tablets which he produced were " written with the finger of God " ; wherefore , as they must have been written by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and deliberately lied . His good faith was obviously suspected , and this suspicion caused disastrous results . To support his lie Moses caused three thousand unsuspecting and trusting men to be murdered in cold blood , whose only crime was that they would have preferred another leadership to his , and because , had they been able to effect their purpose , they would have disappointed his ambition . To follow Moses further in the course which optimism enforced upon him would be tedious , as it would be to recapitulate the story which has already been told . It suffices to say shortly that , at every camp , he had to sink to deeper depths of fraud , deception , lying , and crime in order to maintain his credit . It might be that , as at Meribah , it was only claiming for himself a miracle which he knew he could not work , and for claiming which , instead of giving the credit to God , he openly declared he deserved and must receive punishment ; or it might be some impudent quackery , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or it might have been complicated combinations which suggest a deeper shade ; as , for example , the outbreak of the plague , after Korah 's rebellion , which bears the aspect of a successful effort at intimidation to support his own wavering credit . But the result was always the same . Moses had promised that the supernatural power he pretended to control should sustain him and give victory . Possibly , when he started on the exodus he verily believed that such a power existed , was amenable and could be constrained to intervene . He found that he had been mistaken on all these heads , and when he accepted these facts as final , nothing remained for him but suicide , as has been related . It only remains to glance , for a single moment , at what befell , when he had gone , the society he had organized on the optimistic principle of the approach of human beings toward perfection . During the period of the Judges , when " there was no king in Israel , but every man did that which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judges xvii , 6. anarchy supervened , indeed , but also the whole Mosaic system broke down because of the imbecility of the men on whom Moses relied to lift the people toward perfection . Eli , a descendant of Aaron , was high priest , and a judge , being the predecessor of Samuel , the last of the judges . Now Eli had two sons who " were sons of Belial ; they knew not the Lord . " Eli , being very old , " heard all that his sons did unto all Israel ; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the door of the tabernacle .... " And Eli argued with them ; " notwithstanding they harkened not unto the voice of their father . " Samuel succeeded Eli . He was not a descendant of Aaron , but became a judge , apparently , upon his own merits . But as a judge he did not constrain his sons any better than Eli had his , for " they took bribes , and perverted judgment . " So the elders of Israel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king to judge us . " " And Samuel prayed unto the Lord , " though he disliked the idea . Yet the result was inevitable . The kingdom was set up , and the Mosaic society perished . Nothing was left of Mosaic optimism but the tradition . Also there was the Mosaic morality , and what that amounted to may best , perhaps , be judged by David , who was the most perfect flower of the perfection to which humanity was to attain under the Mosaic law , and has always stood for what was best in Mosaic optimism . David 's morality is perhaps best illustrated by the story of Uriah the Hittite . One day David saw Uriah 's wife taking a bath on her housetop and took a fancy to her . The story is all told in the Second of Samuel . How David sent for her , took her into the palace , and murdered Uriah by sending him to Joab who commanded the army , and instructing Joab to set Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle , and " retire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And Uriah was killed . Then came the famous parable by Nathan of the ewe lamb . " And David 's anger was greatly kindled against the man ; and he said to Nathan , As the Lord liveth , the man who hath done this thing shall surely die . " And Nathan said to David , Thou art the man . " And Nathan threatened David with all kinds of disaster and even with death , and David was very repentant and " he fasted and lay all night upon the earth . " But for all that , when assured that nothing worse was to happen to him than the loss of the son Bathsheba had borne him , David comforted Bathsheba . He by no means gave her up . On the contrary , " he went in unto her ... and she bare him a son , and he called his name Solomon : and the Lord loved him . " Again the flesh had prevailed . And so it has always been with each new movement which has been stimulated by an idealism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generating an impulse which would overcome the flesh and which could cause men to move toward perfection along any other path than the least resistant . And this because man is an automaton , and can move no otherwise . In this point of view nothing can be more instructive than to compare the Roman with the Mosaic civilization , for the Romans were a sternly practical people and worshipped force as Moses worshipped an ideal . As Moses dreamed of realizing the divine consciousness on earth by introspection and by prayer , so the Romans supposed that they could attain to prosperity and happiness on earth by the development of superior physical force and the destruction of all rivals . Cato the Censor was the typical Roman landowner , the type of the class which built up the great vested interest in land which always moved and dominated Rome . He expressed the Roman ideal in his famous declaration in the Senate , when he gave his vote for the Third Punic War ; " Delenda est Carthago , " Carthage must be destroyed . And Carthage was destroyed because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessity . Subsequently , the Romans took the next step in their social adjustment at home . They deified the energy which had destroyed Carthage . The incarnation of physical force became the head of the State ;  --  the Emperor when living , the Divus , when dead . And this conception gained expression in the law . This godlike energy found vent in the Imperial will ; " Quod principi placuit , legis habet vigorem . " Footnote : Inst. l , 2 , 6 . Nothing could be more antagonistic to the Mosaic philosophy , which invoked the supernatural unity as authority for every police regulation . Moreover , the Romans carried out their principle relentlessly , to their own destruction . That great vested interest which had absorbed the land of Italy , and had erected the administrative entity which policed it , could not hold and cultivate its land profitably , in competition with other lands such as Egypt , North Africa , or Assyria , which were worked by a cheaper and more resistant people . Therefore the Roman landowners imported this competitive population from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cultivated their own Italian fields with them after the eviction of the original native peasants , who could not survive on the scanty nutriment on which the eastern races throve . Footnote : I have dealt with this subject at length in my Law of Civilization and Decay , chapter II , to which I must refer the reader . More fully still in the French translation . " This unceasing emigration gradually changed the character of the rural population , and a similar alteration took place in the army . As early as the time of Caesar , Italy was exhausted ; his legions were mainly raised in Gaul , and as the native farmers sank into serfdom or slavery , and then at last vanished , recruits were drawn more and more from beyond the limits of the empire . " I can not repeat my arguments here , but I am not aware that they have been seriously controverted . The Roman law , the Romana lex , was as gigantic , as original , and as comprehensive a structure as was the empire which gave to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thereof . The Roman law attained perfection , as I conceive , about the time of the Antonines , through the great jurists who then flourished . If one might name a particular moment at which so vast and complex a movement culminated , one would be tempted to suggest the reign of Hadrian , who appointed Salvius Julianus to draw up the edictum perpetuum , or permanent edict , in the year 132 A.D. Thenceforward the magistrate had to use his discretion only when the edict of Julianus did not apply . I am not aware that any capital principle of municipal law has been evolved since that time , and the astonishing power of the Roman mind can only be appreciated when it is remembered that the whole of this colossal fabric was original . Modern European law has been only a servile copy . But , regard being had to the position of the emperor in relation to the people , and more especially in relation to the vast bureaucracy of Rome , which was the embodiment of the vested interest which was Rome itself , the adherence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute . " So far as the cravings of Stoicism found historical and political fulfilment , they did so in the sixty years of Hadrian and the Antonines , and so far again as an individual can embody the spirit of an age , its highest and most representative impersonation is unquestionably to be found in the person of Marcus Antoninus .... Stoicism faced the whole problem of existence , and devoted as searching an investigation to processes of being and of thought , to physics and to dialectic , as to the moral problems presented by the emotions and the will . " Footnote : Marcus Aurelius Antoninus , in English , by Gerald H. Rendall , Introduction , xxvii . Such was stoicism , of which Marcus Aurelius was and still remains the foremost expression . He admitted that as emperor his first duty was to sacrifice himself for the public and he did his duty with a constancy which ultimately cost him his life . Among these duties was the great duty of naming his successor . The Roman Empire never became strictly hereditary . It hinged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the personality of the emperor , who incarnated the administrative bureaucracy which gave effect to the Pax Romana and the Romana lex from the Euphrates to the Atlantic and from Scotland to the Tropic of Cancer . Of all men Marcus Aurelius was the most conscientious and the most sincere , and he understood , as perhaps no other man in like position ever understood , the responsibility which impinged on him , to allow no private prevention to impose an unfit emperor upon the empire But Marcus had a son Commodus , who was nineteen when his father died , and who had already developed traits which caused foreboding . Nevertheless , Marcus associated Commodus with himself in the empire when Commodus was fourteen and Commodus attained to absolute power when Marcus died . Subsequently , Commodus became the epitome of all that was basest and worst in a ruler . He was murdered by the treachery of Marcia , his favorite concubine , and the Senate decreed that " his body should be dragged with a hook into the stripping room of the gladiators , to satiate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chap . iv . From that day Rome entered upon the acute stage of her decline , and she did so very largely because Marcus Aurelius , the ideal stoic , was incapable of violating the great law of nature which impelled him to follow not reason , but the path of least resistance in choosing a successor ; or , in other words , the instinct of heredity . Moreover , this instinct and not reason is or has been , among the strongest which operate upon men , and makes them automata . It is the basis upon which the family rests , and the family is the essence of social cohesion . Also the hereditary instinct has been the prime motor which has created constructive municipal jurisprudence and which has evolved religion . With the death of Marcus Aurelius individual competition may be judged to have done its work , and presently , as the population changed its character under the stress thereof , a new phase opened : a phase which is marked , as such phases usually are , by victory in war . Marcus Aurelius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 312 , Constantine won the battle of the Milvian Bridge with his troops fighting under the Labarum , a standard bearing a cross with the device " In hoc signo vinces " ; By this sign conquer . Probably Constantine had himself scanty faith in the Labarum , but he speculated upon it as a means to arouse enthusiasm in his men . It served his purpose , and finding the step he had taken on the whole satisfactory , he followed it up by accepting baptism in 337 A.D. From this time forward the theory of the possibility of securing divine or supernatural aid by various forms of incantation or prayer gained steadily in power for about eight centuries , until at length it became a passion and gave birth to a school of optimism , the most overwhelming and the most brilliant which the world has ever known and which evolved an age whose end we still await . The Germans of the fourth century were a very simple race , who comprehended little of natural laws , and who therefore referred phenomena they did not understand to supernatural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and thus the invasions caused a rapid rise in the influence of the sacred class . The power of every ecclesiastical organization has always rested on the miracle , and the clergy have always proved their divine commission as did Moses . This was eminently the case with the mediaeval Church . At the outset Christianity was socialistic , and its spread among the poor was apparently caused by the pressure of servile competition ; for the sect only became of enough importance to be persecuted under Nero , contemporaneously with the first signs of distress which appeared through the debasement of the denarius . But socialism was only a passing phase , and disappeared as the money value of the miracle rose , and brought wealth to the Church . Under the Emperor Decius , about 250 , the magistrates thought the Christians opulent enough to use gold and silver vessels in their service , and by the fourth century the supernatural so possessed the popular mind that Constantine , as we have seen , not only allowed himself to be converted by a miracle , but used enchantment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Milvian Bridge , fought in 312 , by which Constantine established himself at Rome , was probably the point whence nature began to discriminate decisively against the vested interest of Western Europe . Capital had already abandoned Italy ; Christianity was soon after officially recognized , and during the next century the priest began to rank with the soldier as a force in war . Meanwhile , as the population sank into exhaustion , it yielded less and less revenue , the police deteriorated , and the guards became unable to protect the frontier . In 376 , the Goths , hard pressed by the Huns , came to the Danube and implored to be taken as subjects by the emperor . After mature deliberation the Council of Valens granted the prayer , and some five hundred thousand Germans were cantoned in Moesia . The intention of the government was to scatter this multitude through the provinces as coloni , or to draft them into the legions ; but the detachment detailed to handle them was too feeble , the Goths mutinied , cut the guard to pieces , and having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Hadrianople . In another generation the disorganization of the Roman army had become complete , and Alaric gave it its death-blow in his campaign of 410 . Alaric was not a Gothic king , but a barbarian deserter , who , in 392 , was in the service of Theodosius . Subsequently he sometimes held imperial commands , and sometimes led bands of marauders on his own account , but was always in difficulty about his pay . Finally , in the revolution in which Stilicho was murdered , a corps of auxiliaries mutinied and chose him their general . Alleging that his arrears were unpaid , Alaric accepted the command , and with this army sacked Rome . During the campaign the attitude of the Christians was more interesting than the strategy of the soldiers . Alaric was a robber , leading mutineers , and yet the orthodox historians did not condemn him . They did not condemn him because the sacred class instinctively loved the barbarians whom they could overawe , whereas they could make little impression on the materialistic intellect of the old centralized society . Under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to obey the power which paid the police ; and as long as a revenue could be drawn from the provinces , the Christian hierarchy were subordinate to the monied bureaucracy who had the means to coerce them . Yet only very slowly , as the empire disintegrated , did the theocratic idea take shape . As late as the ninth century the pope prostrated himself before Charlemagne , and did homage as to a Roman emperor . Footnote : Perz , Annales Lauressenses , I , 188 . Saint Benedict founded Monte Cassino in 529 , but centuries elapsed before the Benedictine order rose to power . The early convents were isolated and feeble , and much at the mercy of the laity , who invaded and debauched them . Abbots , like bishops , were often soldiers , who lived within the walls with their wives and children , their hawks , their hounds , and their men-at-arms ; and it has been said that , in all France , Corbie and Fleury alone kept always something of their early discipline . Only in the early years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decentralization culminated , and the imagination began to gain its fullest intensity , did the period of monastic consolidation open with the foundation of Cluny . In 910 William of Aquitaine draw a charter Footnote : Bruel , Recueil des Chartes de l'Abbaye de Cluny , I , 124. which , so far as possible , provided for the complete independence of his new corporation . There was no episcopal visitation , and no interference with the election of the abbot . The monks were put directly under the protection of the pope , who was made their sole superior . John XI confirmed this charter by his bull of 932 , and authorized the affiliation of all converts who wished to share in the reform . Footnote : Bull . Clun. p. 2 , col. 1 . Also Luchaire , Manuel des Institutions Francaises , 93 , 95 , where the authorities are collected . The growth of Cluny was marvellous ; by the twelfth century two thousand houses obeyed its rule , and its wealth was so great , and its buildings so vast , that in 1245 Innocent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all lodged together within its walls , and with them all the attendant trains of prelates and nobles with their servants . In the eleventh century no other force of equal energy existed . The monks were the most opulent , the ablest , and the best organized society in Europe , and their effect upon mankind was proportioned to their strength . They intuitively sought autocratic power , and during the centuries when nature favored them , they passed from triumph to triumph . They first seized upon the papacy and made it self-perpetuating ; they then gave battle to the laity for the possession of the secular hierarchy , which had been under temporal control since the very foundation of the Church . According to the picturesque legend , Bruno , Bishop of Toul , seduced by the flattery of courtiers and the allurements of ambition , accepted the tiara from the emperor , and set out upon his journey to Italy with a splendid retinue , and with his robe and crown . On his way he turned aside at Cluny , where Hildebrand was prior . Hildebrand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with having seized upon the seat of the vicar of Christ by force , and accepted the holy office from the sacrilegious hand of a layman . He exhorted Bruno to cast away his pomp , and to cross the Alps humbly as a pilgrim , assuring him that the priests and people of Rome would recognize him as their bishop , and elect him according to canonical forms . Then he would taste the joys of a pure conscience , having entered the fold of Christ as a shepherd and not as a robber . Inspired by these words , Bruno dismissed his train , and left the convent gate as a pilgrim . He walked barefoot , and when after two months of pious meditations he stood before Saint Peter 's , he spoke to the people and told them it was their privilege to elect the pope , and since he had come unwillingly he would return again , were he not their choice . He was answered with acclamations , and on February 2 , 1049 , he was enthroned as Leo IX . His first act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the triumph of Cluny as no historical facts could do . Ten years later , in the reign of Nicholas II , the theocracy made itself self-perpetuating through the assumption of the election of the pope by the college of cardinals , and in 1073 Hildebrand , the incarnation of monasticism , was crowned under the name of Gregory VII . With Hildebrand 's election , war began . The Council of Rome , held in 1075 , decreed that holy orders should not be recognized where investiture had been granted by a layman , and that princes guilty of conferring investiture should be excommunicated . The Council of the next year , which excommunicated the emperor , also enunciated the famous propositions of Baronius  --  the full expression of the theocratic idea . The priest had grown to be a god on earth . " So strong in this confidence , for the honour and defence of your Church , on behalf of the omnipotent God , the Father , the Son , and the Holy Ghost , by your power and authority , I forbid the government of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the son of the Emperor Henry , who , with unheard-of arrogance , has rebelled against your Church . I absolve all Christians from the oaths they have made or may make to him , and I forbid that any one should obey him as king . " Footnote : Migne , CXLVIII , 790 . Henry marched on Italy , but in all European history there has been no drama more tremendous than the expiation of his sacrilege . To his soldiers the world was a vast space , peopled by those fantastic beings which are still seen on Gothic towers . These demons obeyed the monk of Rome , and his army , melting from about the emperor under a nameless horror , left him helpless . Gregory lay like a magician in the fortress of Canossa : but he had no need of carnal weapons , for when the emperor reached the Alps he was almost alone . Then his imagination also took fire , the panic seized him , and he sued for mercy . On August 7 , 1106 , Henry died at Liege , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his body lay at the church door , an accursed thing which no man dared to bury . Gregory prevailed because , to the understanding of the eleventh century , the evidence at hand indicated that he embodied in a high degree the infinite energy . The eleventh century was intensely imaginative and the evidence which appealed to it was those phenomena of trance , hypnotism , and catalepsy which are as mysterious now as they were then , but whose effect was then to create an overpowering demand for miracle-working substances . The sale of these substances gradually drew the larger portion of the wealth of the community into the hands of the clergy , and with wealth went temporal power . No vested interest in any progressive community has probably ever been relatively stronger , for the Church found no difficulty , when embarrassed , in establishing and operating a thorough system for exterminating her critics . Under such a pressure modern civilization must have sunk into some form of caste had the mediaeval mind resembled any antecedent mind , but the middle age , though superficially imaginative , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed . At Canossa the laity conceded as a probable hypothesis that the Church could miraculously control nature ; but they insisted that if the Church possessed such power , she must use that power for the common good . Upon this point they would not compromise , nor would they permit delay . During the chaos of the ninth century turmoil and violence reached a stage at which the aspirations of most Christians ended with self-preservation ; but when the discovery and working of the Harz silver had brought with it some semblance of order , an intense yearning possessed both men and women to ameliorate their lot . If relics could give protection against oppression , disease , famine , and death , then relics must be obtained , and , if the cross and the tomb were the most effective relics , then the cross and the tomb must be conquered at any cost . In the north of Europe especially , misery was so acute that the people gladly left their homes upon the slenderest promise of betterment , even following a vagrant like Peter the Hermit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a passage in William of Tyre which has been often quoted to explain a frenzy which is otherwise inexplicable , and in the old English of Caxton the words still glow with the same agony which makes lurid the supplication of the litany ,  --  " From battle and murder , and from sudden death , Good Lord deliver us " : " Of charyte men spack not , debates , discordes , and warres were nyhe oueral , in suche wyse , that it seemed , that thende of the world was nyghe , by the signes that our lord sayth in the gospell , ffor pestylences and famynes were grete on therthe , ferdfulness of heuen , tremblyng of therthe in many places , and many other thinges there were that ought to fere the hertes of men ....

" Footnote : Godeffroy of Bologne , by William , Archbishop of Tyre , translated from the French by William Caxton , London , 1893 , 21 , 22 . Throughout the eleventh century the excitement touching the virtues of the holy places in Judea grew , until Gregory VII , about the time of Canossa , perceived that a paroxysm was at hand , and considered leading it , but on the whole nothing is so suggestive of the latent scepticism of the age as the irresolution of the popes at this supreme moment . The laity were the pilgrims and the agitators . The kings sought the relics and took the cross ; the clergy hung back . Robert , Duke of Normandy , for example , the father of William the Conqueror , died in 1035 from hardship at Nicaea when returning from Palestine , absorbed to the last in the relics which he had collected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have said in private , neither Hildebrand nor Victor nor Urban moved officially until they were swept forward by the torrent . They shunned responsibility for a war which they would have passionately promoted had they been sure of victory . The man who finally kindled the conflagration was a half-mad fanatic , a stranger to the hierarchy . No one knew the family of Peter the Hermit , or whence he came , but he certainly was not an ecclesiastic in good standing . Inflamed by fasting and penance , Peter followed the throng of pilgrims to Jerusalem , and there , wrought upon by what he saw , he sought the patriarch . Peter asked the patriarch if nothing could be done to protect the pilgrims , and to retrieve the Holy Places . The patriarch replied , " Nothing , unless God will touch the heart of the western princes , and will send them to succor the Holy City . " The patriarch did not propose meddling himself , nor did it occur to him that the pope should intervene . He took a rationalistic view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was logical , arguing from eleventh-century premises . If he could but receive a divine mandate , he would raise an invincible army . He prayed . His prayer was answered . One day while prostrated before the sepulchre he heard Christ charge him to announce in Europe that the appointed hour had come . Furnished with letters from the patriarch , Peter straightway embarked for Rome to obtain Urban 's sanction for his design . Urban listened and gave a consent which he could not prudently have withheld , but he abstained from participating in the propaganda . In March , 1095 , Urban called a Council at Piacenza , nominally to consider the deliverance of Jerusalem , and this Council was attended by thirty thousand impatient laymen , only waiting for the word to take the vow , but the pope did nothing . Even at Clermont eight months later , he showed a disposition to deal with private war , or church discipline , or with anything in fact rather than with the one engrossing question of the day , but this time there was no escape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clermont but the adjacent towns and villages , even sleeping in the fields , although the weather was bitterly cold , who demanded to know the policy of the Church . Urban seems to have procrastinated as long as he safely could , but , at length , at the tenth session , he produced Peter on the platform , clad as a pilgrim , and , after Peter had spoken , he proclaimed the war . Urban declined , however , to command the army . The only effective force which marched was a body of laymen , organized and led by laymen , who in 1099 carried Jerusalem by an ordinary assault . In Jerusalem they found the cross and the sepulchre , and with these relics as the foundation of their power , the laity began an experiment which lasted eighty-eight years , ending in 1187 with the battle of Tiberias . At Tiberias the infidels defeated the Christians , captured their king and their cross , and shortly afterward seized the tomb . If the eleventh-century mind had been as rigid as the Roman mind of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collapse of the crusades , have failed to degenerate as Roman civilization degenerated after the defeat of Varus . Being more elastic , it began , under an increased tension , to develop new phases of thought . The effort was indeed prodigious and the absolute movement possibly slow , but a change of intellectual attitude may be detected almost contemporaneously with the fall of the Latin kingdom in Palestine . It is doubtless true that the thirteenth century was the century in which imaginative thought reached its highest brilliancy , when Albertus Magnus and Saint Thomas Aquinas taught , when Saint Francis and Saint Clara lived , and when Thomas of Celano wrote the Dies Irae . It was then that Gothic architecture touched its climax in the cathedrals of Chartres and Amiens , of Bourges and of Paris ; it was then also that Blanche of Castile ruled in France and that Saint Louis bought the crown of thorns , but it is equally true that the death of Saint Louis occurred in 1270 , shortly after the thorough organization of the Inquisition by Innocent IV in 1252 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roger Bacon of his Opus Majus . The establishment of the Inquisition is decisive , because it proves that sceptical thought had been spread far enough to goad the Church to general and systematic repression , while the Opus Majus is a scientific exposition of the method by which the sceptical mind is trained . Roger Bacon was born about 1214 , and going early to Oxford fell under the influence of the most liberal teachers in Europe , at whose head stood Robert Grosseteste , afterward Bishop of Lincoln . Bacon conceived a veneration for Grosseteste , and even for Adam de Marisco his disciple , and turning toward mathematics rather than toward metaphysics he eagerly applied himself , when he went to Paris , to astrology and alchemy , which were the progenitors of the modern exact sciences . In the thirteenth century a young man like Bacon could hardly stand alone , and Bacon joined the Franciscans , but before many years elapsed he embroiled himself with his superiors . His friend , Grosseteste , died in 1253 , the year after Innocent IV issued the bull Ad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The general of his order , Saint Bonaventura , withdrew him from Oxford where he was prominent , and immured him in a Parisian convent , treating him rigorously , as Bacon intimated to Pope Clement IV . There he remained , silenced , for some ten years , until the election of Clement IV , in 1265 . Bacon at once wrote to Clement complaining of his imprisonment , and deploring to the pope the plight into which scientific education had fallen . The pope replied directing Bacon to explain his views in a treatise , but did not order his release . In response Bacon composed the Opus Majus . The Opus Majus deals among other things with experimental science , and in the introductory chapter to the sixth part Bacon stated the theory of inductive thought quite as lucidly as did Francis Bacon three and a half centuries later in the Novum Organum . Footnote : Positis radicibus sapientiae Latinorum penes Linguas et Mathematicam et Perspectivam , nunc volo revolvere radices a parte Scientiae Experimentalis , quia sine experientia nihil sufficienter scire protest . Duo enim simt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concludit et facit nos concedere conclusionem , sed non certificat neque removet dubitationem ut quiescat animus in intuitu veritatis , nisi eam inveniat via experientiae ; quia multi habent argumenta ad scibilia , sed quia non habent experientiam , negligunt ea , nee vitant nociva nex persequuntue bona . J. H. Bridges , The Opus Majus of Roger Bacon ( Oxford , 1897 ) , II , 167 . Clement died in 1268 . The papacy remained vacant for a couple of years , but in 1271 Gregory X came in on a conservative reaction . Bacon passed most of the rest of his life in prison , perhaps through his own ungovernable temper , and ostensibly his writings seem to have had little or no effect on his contemporaries , yet it is certain that he was not an isolated specimen of a type of intelligence which suddenly bloomed during the Reformation . Bacon constantly spoke of his friends , but his friends evidently did not share his temperament . The scientific man has seldom relished martyrdom , and Galileo 's experience as late as 1633 shows what risks men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Church . After the middle of the thirteenth century the danger was real enough to account for any degree of secretiveness , and a striking case of this timidity is related by Bacon himself . No one knows even the name of the man to whom Bacon referred as " Master Peter , " but according to Bacon , " Master Peter " was the greatest and most original genius of the age , only he shunned publicity . The " Dominus experimentorum , " as Bacon called him , lived in a safe retreat and devoted himself to mathematics , chemistry , and the mechanical arts with such success that , Bacon insisted , he could by his inventions have aided Saint Louis in his crusade more than his whole army . Footnote : Emile Charles , Roger Bacon . Sa vie et ses ouvrages , 17 . Nor is this assertion altogether fantastic . Bacon understood the formula for gunpowder , and if Saint Louis had been provided with even a poor explosive he might have taken Cairo ; not to speak of the terror which Greek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a naval battle fought in 1250 , for the command of the Nile , by which he drew supplies from Damietta , and he met it , according to Matthew Paris , because his ships could not withstand Greek fire . Gunpowder , even in a very simple form , might have changed the fate of the war . Scepticism touching the value of relics as a means for controlling nature was an effect of experiment , and , logically enough , scepticism advanced fastest among certain ecclesiastics who dealt in relics . For example , in 1248 Saint Louis undertook to invade Egypt in defence of the cross . Possibly Saint Louis may have been affected by economic considerations also touching the eastern trade , but his ostensible object was a crusade . The risk was very great , the cost enormous , and the responsibility the king assumed of the most serious kind . Nothing that he could do was left undone to ensure success . In 1249 he captured Damietta , and then stood in need of every pound of money and of every man that Christendom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chiefly of making what it could in cash out of the war , the inference being that the hierarchy suspected that even if Saint Louis prevailed and occupied Jerusalem , little would be gained from an ecclesiastical standpoint . At all events , Matthew Paris has left an account , in his chronicle of the year 1249 , of how the pope and the Franciscans preached this crusade , which is one of the most suggestive passages in thirteenth-century literature : " About the same time , by command of the pope , whom they obeyed implicitly , the Preacher and Minorite brethren diligently employed themselves in preaching ; and to increase the devotion of the Christians , they went with great solemnity to the places where their preaching was previously indicated , and granted many days of indulgence to those who came to hear them .... Preaching on behalf of the cross , they bestowed that symbol on people of every age , sex and rank , whatever their property or worth , and even on sick men and women , and those who were deprived of strength by sickness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even directly afterwards , receiving it back from them , they absolved them from their vow of pilgrimage , for whatever sum they could obtain for the favour . What seemed unsuitable and absurd was , that not many days afterwards , Earl Richard collected all this money in his treasury , by the agency of Master Bernard , an Italian clerk , who gathered in the fruit ; whereby no slight scandal arose in the Church of God , and amongst the people in general , and the devotion of the faithful evidently cooled . " Footnote : Matthew Paris , English History , translated by the Rev. J. A , Giles , II , 309 . When the unfortunate Baldwin II became Emperor of the East in 1237 , the relics of the passion were his best asset . In 1238 , while Baldwin was in France trying to obtain aid , the French barons who carried on the government at Constantinople in his absence were obliged to pledge the crown of thorns to an Italian syndicate for 13,134 perpera , which Gibbon conjectures to have been besants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrange for its redemption . He met with no difficulty . He confidently addressed himself to Saint Louis and Queen Blanche , and " Although the king felt keen displeasure at the deplorable condition of Constantinople , he was well pleased , nevertheless , with the opportunity of adorning France with the richest and most precious treasure in all Christendom . " More especially with " a relic , and a sacred object which was not on the commercial market . " Footnote : Du Cange , Histoire de L'empire de Constantinople sous les empereurs Francais , edition de Buchon , I , 259 . Louis , beside paying the loan and the cost of transportation which came to two thousand French pounds ( the mark being then coined into L2 , 15 sous and 6 pence ) , made Baldwin a present of ten thousand pounds for acting as broker . Baldwin was so well contented with this sale which he closed in 1239 , that a couple of years later he sent to Paris all the contents of his private chapel which had any value . Part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross , but the authenticity of this relic was doubtful ; there was beside , however , the baby linen , the spear-head , the sponge , and the chain , beside several miscellaneous articles like the rod of Moses . Louis built the Sainte Chapelle at a cost of twenty thousand marks as a shrine in which to deposit them . The Sainte Chapelle has usually ranked as the most absolutely perfect specimen of mediaeval religious architecture . Footnote : On this whole subject of the inter-relation of mediaeval theology with architecture and philosophy the reader is referred to Mont-Saint-Michel et Chartres , by Henry Adams , which is the most philosophical and thorough exposition of this subject which ever has been attempted . When Saint Louis bought the Crown of Thorns from Baldwin in 1239 , the commercial value of relics may , possibly , be said to have touched its highest point , but , in fact , the adoration of them had culminated with the collapse of the Second Crusade , and in another century and a half the market had decisively broken and the Reformation had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outbreak of Wat Tyler 's Rebellion in 1381 . For these social movements have always a common cause and reach a predetermined result . In the eleventh century the convent of Cluny , for example , had an enormous and a perfectly justified hold upon the popular imagination , because of the sanctity and unselfishness of its abbots . Saint Hugh won his sainthood by a self-denial and effort which were impossible to ordinary men , but with Louis IX the penitential life had already lost its attractions and men like Arnold rapidly brought religion and religious thought into contempt . The famous Grosseteste , Bishop of Lincoln , born , probably , in 1175 , died in 1253 . He presided over the diocese of Lincoln at the precise moment when Saint Louis was building the Sainte Chapelle , but Grosseteste in 1250 denounced in a sermon at Lyons the scandals of the papal court with a ferocity which hardly was surpassed at any later day . To attempt even an abstract of the thought of the English Reformation would lead too far , however fascinating the subject might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little or nothing to do with it . Wycliffe denounced the friars as lazy , profligate impostors , who wrung money from the poor which they afterwards squandered in ways offensive to God , and he would have stultified himself had he admitted , in the same breath , that these reprobates , when united , formed a divinely illuminated corporation , each member of which could and did work innumerable miracles through the interposition of Christ . Ordinary miracles , indeed , could be tested by the senses , but the essence of transubstantiation was that it eluded the senses . Thus nothing could be more convenient to the government than to make this invisible and intangible necromancy a test in capital cases for heresy-Hence Wycliffe had no alternative but to deny transubstantiation , for nothing could be more insulting to the intelligence than to adore a morsel of bread which a priest held in his hand . The pretension of the priests to make the flesh of Christ was , according to Wycliffe , an impudent fraud , and their pretension to possess this power was only an excuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what amounted to extortionate taxes , from the people . Footnote : Nowhere , perhaps , does Wycliffe express himself more strongly on this subject than in a little tract called The Wicket , written in English , which he issued for popular consumption about this time . But , in the main , no dogma , however incomprehensible , ever troubled Protestants , as a class . They easily accepted the Trinity , the double procession , or the Holy Ghost itself , though no one had the slightest notion what the Holy Ghost might be . Wycliffe roundly declared in the first paragraph of his confession Footnote : Fasciculi Zizaniorum , 115. that the body of Christ which was crucified was truly and really in the consecrated host , and Huss , who inherited the Wycliffian tradition , answered before the Council of Constance , " Verily , I do think that the body of Christ is really and totally in the sacrament of the altar , which was born of the Virgin Mary , suffered , died , and rose again , and sitteth on the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foxe , Acts and Monuments , III , 452 . That which has rent society in twain and has caused blood to flow like water , has never been abstract opinions , but that economic competition either between states or classes , that lust for power and wealth , which makes a vested interest . Thus by 1382 the eucharist had come to represent to the privileged classes power and wealth , and they would have repudiated Wycliffe even had they felt strong enough to support him . But they were threatened by an adversary equally formidable with heresy in the person of the villeins whom the constantly increasing momentum of the time had raised into a position in which they undertook to compete for the ownership of the land which they still tilled as technical serfs . CHAPTER III . Now the courts may say what they will in support of the vested interests , for to support vested interests is what lawyers are paid for and what courts are made for . Only , unhappily , in the process of argument courts and lawyers have caused blood to flow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to the contrary , men have practically proved that they do own all the property they can defend , all the courts in Christendom notwithstanding , and this is an issue of physical force and not at all of words or of parchments . And so it proved to be in England in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries , alike in Church and State . It was a matter of rather slow development . After the conquest villeins could neither in fact nor theory acquire or hold property as against their lord , and the class of landlords stretched upwards from the owner of a knight 's fee to the king on his throne , who was the chief landlord of all , but by so narrow a margin that he often had enough to do to maintain some vestige of sovereignty . So , to help himself , it came to pass that the king intrigued with the serfs against their restive masters , and the abler the king , the more he intrigued , like Henry I , until the villeins gained very substantial advantages . Thus it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the epoch when men like Grosseteste began to show restlessness under the extortionate corruption of the Church , the villein was discovered to be able to defend his claim to some portion of the increment in the value of the land which he tilled and which was due to his labor : and this title the manorial courts recognized , because they could not help it , as a sort of tenant right , calling it a customary tenancy by base service . A century later these services in kind had been pretty frequently commuted into a fixed rent paid in money , and the serf had become a freeman , and a rather formidable freeman , too . For it was largely from among these technical serfs that Edward III recruited the infantry who formed his line at Crecy in 1346 , and the archers of Crecy were not exactly the sort of men who take kindly to eviction , to say nothing of slavery . As no one meddled much with the villeins before 1349 , all went well until after Crecy , but in 1348 the Black Death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of farming property by hired hands exceeded the value of the rent which the villeins paid . Then the landlords , under the usual reactionary and dangerous legal advice , tried coercion . Their first experiment was the famous Statute of Laborers , which fixed wages at the rates which prevailed in 1347 , but as this statute accomplished nothing the landlords repudiated their contracts , and undertook to force their villeins to render their ancient customary services . Though the lay landlords were often hard masters , the ecclesiastics , especially the monks , were harder still , and the ecclesiastics were served by lawyers of their own cloth , whose sharp practice became proverbial . Thus the law declined to recognize rights in property existing in fact , with the inevitable result of the peasant rising in 1381 , known as Wat Tyler 's Rebellion . Popular rage perfectly logically ran highest against the monks and the lawyers . Both the Archbishop of Canterbury , Simon de Sudbury , the Lord Chancellor , and the Chief Justice were killed , and the insurgents wished to kill , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned ony law . " Finally the rebellion was suppressed , chiefly by the duplicity of Richard II . Richard promised the people , by written charters , a permanent tenure as freemen at reasonable rents , and so induced them to go home with his charters in their hands ; but they were no sooner gone than vengeance began . Though Richard had been at the peasants ' mercy , who might have killed him had they wished , punitive expeditions were sent in various directions . One was led by Richard himself , who travelled with Tresilian , the new Chief Justice , the man who afterward was himself hanged at Tyburn . Tresilian worked so well that he is said to have strung up a dozen villeins to a single beam in Chelmsford because he had no time to have them executed regularly . Stubbs has estimated that seven thousand victims hardly satisfied the landlords ' sense of outraged justice . What concerns us , chiefly , is that this repression , however savage , failed altogether to bring tranquillity . After 1381 a full century of social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until , in 1485 , Henry Tudor came in after his victory at Bosworth , pledged to destroy the whole reactionary class which incarnated feudalism . For the feudal soldier was neither flexible nor astute , and allowed himself to be caught between the upper and the nether millstone . While industrial and commercial capital had been increasing in the towns , capitalistic methods of farming had invaded the country , and , as police improved , private and predatory warfare , as a business , could no longer be made to pay . The importance of a feudal noble lay in the body of retainers who followed his banner , and therefore the feudal tendency always was to overcharge the estate with military expenditure . Hence , to protect themselves from creditors , the landlords passed the Statute De Donis Footnote : 13 Edw . I , c . I ( A.D. 1284 ) . which made entails inalienable . Toward the end of the Wars of the Roses , however , the pressure for money , which could only be raised by pledging their land , became too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a very able man , perceived , pretty early in his reign , that his class could not maintain themselves unless their land were put upon a commercial basis . Therefore he encouraged the judges , in the collusive litigation known to us as Taltarum 's Case , decided in 1472 , to set aside the Statute De Donis , by the fiction of the Common Recovery . The concession , even so , came too late . The combination against them had grown too strong for the soldiers to resist . Other classes evolved by competition wanted their property , and these made Henry Tudor king of England to seize it for them . Henry 's work was simple enough . After Bosworth , with a competent police force at hand to execute process , he had only to organize a political court , and to ruin by confiscatory fines all the families strong enough , or rash enough , to maintain garrisoned houses . So Henry remodelled the Star Chamber , in 1486 , Footnote : 3 Henry 7 , C 1. to deal with the martial gentry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kingdom . The feudal soldiers being disposed of , it remained to evict the monks , who were thus left without their natural defenders . No matter of faith was involved . Henry VIII boasted that in doctrine he was as orthodox as the pope . There was , however , an enormous monastic landed property to be redistributed This was confiscated , and appropriated , not to public purposes , but , as usually happens in revolutions , to the use of the astutest of the revolutionists . Among these , John Russell , afterward Earl of Bedford , stood preeminent . Russell had no particular pedigree or genius , save the acquisitive genius , but he made himself useful to Henry in such judicial murders as that of Richard Whiting , Abbot of Glastonbury . He received in payment , among much else , Woburn Abbey , which has since remained the Bedford country seat , and Covent Garden or Convent Garden , one of the most valuable parcels of real estate in London . Covent Garden the present duke recently sold , anticipating , perhaps , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fortune . As for the monks whom Henry evicted , they wandered forth from their homes beggars , and Henry hanged all of them whom he could catch as vagrants . How many perished as counterpoise for the peasant massacres and Lollard burnings of the foregoing two centuries can never be known , nor to us is it material . What is essential to mark , from the legal standpoint , is that while this long and bloody revolution , of one hundred and fifty years , displaced a favored class and confiscated its property , it raised up in their stead another class of land monopolists , rather more greedy and certainly quite as cruel as those whom they superseded . Also , in spite of all opposition , labor did make good its claim to participate more or less fully in the ownership of the property it cultivated , for while the holding of the ancient villein grew to be well recognized in the royal courts as a copyhold estate , villeinage itself disappeared . Yet , unless I profoundly err , in the revolution of the sixteenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of moderating competition , for I am persuaded that competition of another kind sharpened , and shortly caused a second civil war bloodier than the Wars of the Roses . Fifteen years before the convents were seized , Sir Thomas More wrote Utopia , in whose opening chapter More has given an account of a dinner at Cardinal Morton 's , who , by the way , presided in the Star Chamber . At this dinner one of the cardinal 's guests reflected on the thievish propensities of Englishmen , who were to be found throughout the country hanged as felons , sometimes twenty together on a single gallows . More protested that this was not the fault of the poor who were hanged , but of rich land monopolists , who pastured sheep and left no fields for tillage . According to More , these capitalists plucked down houses and even towns , leaving nothing but the church for a sheep-house , so that " by covin and fraud , or by violent oppression , ... or by wrongs and injuries , " the husbandmen " be thrust out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , poor , wretched souls , men , women , husbands , wives , fatherless children , widows . " The dissolution of the convents accelerated the process , and more and more of the weaker yeomanry were ruined and evicted . It is demonstrated that the pauperization of the feebler rural population went on apace by the passage of poor-laws under Elizabeth , which , in the Middle Ages , had not been needed and , therefore , were unknown . This movement , described by More , was the beginning of the system of enclosing common lands which afterward wrought havoc among the English yeomen , and which , I suppose , contributed more than any other single cause to the Great Rebellion of the seventeenth century . In the mediaeval village the owners of small farms enjoyed certain rights in the common land of the community , affording them pasturage for their cattle and the like , rights without which small farming could not be made profitable . These commons the land monopolists appropriated , sometimes giving some shadow of compensation , sometimes by undisguised force , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enclosure of the commons must rank as confiscation . Also this seizure of property would doubtless have caused a convulsion as lasting as that which followed the insurrection of 1381 , or as did actually occur in Ireland , had it not been for an unparalleled contemporaneous territorial and industrial expansion . Thorold Rogers always insisted that between 1563 , the year of the passage of the Statute of Apprentices , Footnote : 5 Eliz. c. 4. and 1824 , a regular conspiracy existed between the lawyers " and the parties interested in its success ... to cheat the English workman of his wages , ... and to degrade him to irremediable poverty . " Footnote : Work and Wages , 398 . Certainly the land monopolists resorted to strong measures to accumulate land , for something like six hundred and fifty Enclosure Acts were passed between 1760 , the opening of the Industrial Revolution , and 1774 , the outbreak of the American War . But without insisting on Rogers 's view , it is not denied that the weakest of the small yeomen sank into utter misery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those stronger some emigrated to America , others , who were among the ablest and the boldest , sought fortune as adventurers over the whole earth , and , like the grandfather of Chatham , brought home from India as smugglers or even as pirates , diamonds to be sold to kings for their crowns , or , like Clive , became the greatest generals and administrators of the nation . Probably , however , by far the majority of those who were of average capacity found compensation for the confiscated commons in domestic industry , owning their houses with lots of land and the tools of their trade . Defoe has left a charming description of the region about Halifax in Yorkshire , toward the year 1730 , where he found the whole population busy , prosperous , healthy , and , in the main , self-sufficing . He did not see a beggar or an idle person in the whole country . So , favored by circumstances , the landed oligarchy met with no effective resistance after the death of Cromwell , and achieved what amounted to being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversion of the House of Commons into their own personal property , about the beginning of the eighteenth century , with all the guaranties of law . In the Middle Ages the chief towns of England had been summoned by the king to send burgesses to Westminster to grant him money , but as time elapsed the Commons acquired influence and , in 1642 , became dominant . Then , after the Restoration , the landlords conceived the idea of appropriating the right of representation , as they had appropriated and were appropriating the common lands . Lord John Russell one day observed in the House of Commons that the burgesses were originally chosen from among the inhabitants of the towns they represented , but that , in the reign of Anne , the landlords , to depress the shipping interest , opened the borough representation to all qualified persons without regard to domicile . Footnote : 36 Hansard , Third Series , 548 . Lord John was mistaken in his date , for the change occurred earlier , but he described correctly enough the persistent animus of the landlords . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Determination Acts of 1696 and 1729 , which defined the franchises and which had the effect of confirming the titles of patrons to borough property , Footnote : Porritt , Unreformed House of Commons , I , 9 , et seq. thus making a seat in the House of Commons an incorporeal hereditament fully recognized by law . On this point so high an authority as Lord Eldon was emphatic . Footnote : 12 Hansard , Third Series , 396 . By the time of the American War the oligarchy had become so narrow that one hundred and fifty-four peers and commoners returned three hundred and seven members , or much more than a majority of the House as then organized . Footnote : Grey 's motion for Reform , 30 Parl . Hist. 795 ( A.D. 1793 ) With the privileged class reduced to these contemptible numbers a catastrophe necessarily followed . Almost impregnable as the position of the oligarchy appeared , it yet had its vulnerable point . As Burke told the Duke of Portland , a duke 's power did not come from his title , but from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their ability to draw a double rent from their estates , one rent for themselves , and another to provide for the farmer to whom they let their acres . Evidently British land could not bear this burden if brought in competition with other equally good land that paid only a single rent , and from a pretty early period the landlords appear to have been alive to this fact . Nevertheless , ocean freights afforded a fair protection , and as long as the industrial population remained tolerably self-supporting , England rather tended to export than to import grain . But toward 1760 advances in applied science profoundly modified the equilibrium of English society . The new inventions , stimulated by steam , could only be utilized by costly machinery installed in large factories , which none but considerable capitalists could build , but once in operation the product of these factories undersold domestic labor , and ruined and evicted the population of whole regions like Halifax . These unfortunate laborers were thrust in abject destitution into filthy and dark alleys in cities , where they herded in masses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value , so much so that in 1766 prayers were offered touching its price . Thenceforward England imported largely from America , and in 1773 Parliament was constrained to reduce the duty on wheat to a point lower than the gentry conceded again , until the total repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846 . Footnote : John Morley , The Life of Richard Cobden , 167 , note 5 . The situation was well understood in London . Burke , Governor Pownall , and others explained it in Parliament , while Chatham implored the landlords not to alienate America , which they could not , he told them , conquer , but which gave them a necessary market ,  --  a market as he aptly said , both of supply and demand . And Chatham was right , for America not only supplied the grain to feed English labor , but bought from England at least one third of all her surplus manufactures . This brings us to the eighteenth century , which directly concerns us , because the religious superstition , which had previously caused men to seek in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had waned , and the problem presented was reduced to the operation of that acceleration of movement by the progress of applied science which always has been , and always must be , the prime cause of the quickening of economic competition either as between communities or as between individuals . And this is the capital phenomenon of civilization . For it is now generally admitted that war is nothing but economic competition in its acutest form . When competition reaches a certain intensity it kindles into war or revolution , precisely as when iron is raised to a certain heat it kindles into flame . And , for the purposes of illustration , possibly the best method of showing how competition was quickened , and how it affected adjacent communities during the eighteenth century , is to take navigation , not only because navigation was much improved during the first three quarters of that period , but because both England and France competed for control in America by means of ships . It suffices to mention , very succinctly , a few of the more salient advances which were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by which longitude could be determined at sea , making the ship independent in all parts of the world . At the same time more ingenious rigging increased her power of working to windward . With such advantages Captain Cook became a mighty discoverer both in the southern and western oceans , charted New Zealand and much else , and more important than all , in 1759 he surveyed the Saint Lawrence and piloted ships up the river , of which he had established the channel . Speaking of Cook naturally leads to the solution of the problem of the transportation of men , sailors , soldiers , and emigrants , on long voyages , thereby making population fluid . Cook , in his famous report , read before the Royal Society in March , 1776 , after his second voyage , established forever the hygienic principles by observing which a ship 's company may safely be kept at sea for any length of time . Previously there had always been a very high mortality from scurvy and kindred diseases , which had , of course , operated as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same class of phenomena were even more marked . In England the Industrial Revolution is usually held to date from 1760 , and , by common consent , the Industrial Revolution is attributed altogether to applied science , or , in other words , to mechanical inventions . In 1760 the flying-shuttle appeared , and coal began to replace wood for smelting . In 1764 Hargreaves invented the spinning-jenny ; in 1779 Crompton contrived the mule ; and in 1768 Watt brought the steam-engine to maturity . In 1761 the first boat-load of coals sailed over the Barton viaduct , which James Brindley built for the Duke of Bridgewater 's canal , to connect Worsley with Manchester , thus laying the foundation of British inland navigation , which before the end of the century had covered England ; while John Metcalf , the blind road-builder , began his lifework in 1765 . He was destined to improve English highways , which up to that time had been mostly impossible for wheeled traffic . In France the same advance went on . Arthur Young described the impression made on him in 1789 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built since the administration of Colbert , as well as by the canal which connected the Mediterranean with the Atlantic . In the midst of this activity Washington grew up . Washington was a born soldier , engineer , and surveyor with the topographical instinct peculiar to that temperament . As early as 1748 he was chosen by Lord Fairfax , who recognized his ability , though only sixteen years old , to survey his vast estate west of the Blue Ridge , which was then a wilderness . He spent three years in this work and did it well . In 1753 Governor Dinwiddie sent Washington on a mission to the French commander on the Ohio , to warn him to cease trespassing on English territory , a mission which Washington fulfilled , under considerable hardship and some peril , with eminent success . Thus early , for he was then only twenty-two , Washington gained that thorough understanding of the North American river system which enabled him , many years afterward , to construct the Republic of the United States upon the lines of least resistant intercommunication . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were , in substance , this : The American continent , west of the mountains and south of the Great Lakes , is traversed in all directions by the Mississippi and its tributaries , but we may confine our attention to two systems of watercourses , the one to the west , forming by the Wisconsin and the main arm of the Mississippi , a thoroughfare from Lake Michigan to the Gulf ; and the other by French Creek and the Allegheny , broken only by one easy portage , affording a perfect means of access to the Ohio , a river which has always operated as the line of cleavage between our northern and southern States . The French starting from Quebec floated from Lake Erie down the Allegheny to Pittsburgh , the English ascended the Potomac to Cumberland , and thence , following the most practicable watercourses , advanced on the French position at the junction of the Allegheny and the Monongahela . There Washington met and fought them in 1754 , and ever after Washington maintained that the only method by which a stable union among the colonies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transportation along the line of the Ohio and the Potomac . This was to be his canal which should bind north and south , east and west , together by a common interest , and which should carry the produce of the west , north , and south , to the Atlantic coast , where it should be discharged at the head of deep-water navigation , and which should thus stimulate industry adjacent to the spot he chose for the Federal City , or , in our language , for the City of Washington . Thus the capital of the United States was to become the capital of a true nation , not as a political compromise , but because it lay at the central point of a community made cohesive by a social circulation which should build it up , in his own words , into a capital , or national heart , if not " as large as London , yet of a magnitude inferior to few others in Europe . " Footnote : Washington to Mrs. Fairfax , 16 May , 1798 ; Sparks , xi , 233 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in coal and iron . His canal passing through this region would stimulate industry , and these States would thus become the focus of exchanges . Manufacturing is incompatible with slavery , hence slavery would gradually and peacefully disappear , and the extremities of the Union would be drawn together at what he described as " the great emporium of the United States . " To crown all , a national university was to make this emporium powerful in collective thought . Doubtless Grenville and Townshend had not considered the American problem as maturely as had Washington , but nevertheless , most well-informed persons now agree that Englishmen in 1763 were quite alive to the advantages which would accrue to Great Britain , by holding in absolute control a rich but incoherent body of colonies whose administrative centre lay in England , and were as anxious that London should serve as the heart of America as Washington was that America should have its heart on the Potomac . Accordingly , England attempted to isolate Massachusetts and pressed an attack on her with energy , before the whole thirteen colonies should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand , Washington , and most sensible Americans , resisted this attack as resolutely as might be under such disadvantages , not wishing for independence , but hoping for some compromise like that which Great Britain has since effected with her remaining colonies . The situation , however , admitted of no peaceful adjustment , chiefly because the imbecility of American administration induced by her incapacity for collective thought , was so manifest , that Englishmen could not believe that such a society could wage a successful war . Nor could America have done so alone . She owed her ultimate victory altogether to Washington and France . It would occupy too much space for me to undertake to analyze , even superficially , the process by which , after the Seven Years ' War , competition between America and England reached an intensity which kindled the American Revolution , but , shortly stated , the economic tension arose thus : As England was then organized , the estates of the English landlords had to pay two rents , one to the landlord himself , the other to the farmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do were it brought into direct competition with equally good land which paid but one profit , and which was not burdened by an excessive cost of transportation in reaching its market . As freights between England and America fell because of improved shipping and the greater safety of the seas , England had to have protection for her food and she proposed to get it thus : If competing Continental exports could be excluded from America , and , at the same time , Americans could be prevented from manufacturing for themselves , the colonists might be constrained to take what they needed from England , at prices which would enable labor to buy food at a rate which would yield the double profit , and thus America could be made to pay the cost of supporting the landlords . As Cobden afterward observed , the fortunes of England have turned on American competition . A part of these fortunes were represented by the Parliamentary boroughs which the landlords owned and which were confiscated by the Reform Bill , and these boroughs were held by Lord Eldon to be incorporeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the gentry who owned them as church advowsons , or the like . And the gentry held to their law-making power which gave them such a privilege with a tenacity which precipitated two wars before they yielded ; but this was naught compared to the social convulsion which rent France , when a population which had been for centuries restrained from free domestic movement , burst its bonds and insisted on levelling the barriers which had immobilized it . The story of the French Revolution is too familiar to need recapitulation here : indeed , I have already dealt with it in my Social Revolutions ; but the effects of that convulsion are only now beginning to appear , and these effects , without the shadow of a doubt , have been in their ultimate development the occasion of that great war whose conclusion we still await . France , in 1792 , having passed into a revolution which threatened the vested interests of Prussia , was attacked by Prussia , who was defeated at Valmy . Presently , France retaliated , under Napoleon , invaded Prussia , crushed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and imposed on her many hardships . To obtain their freedom the Prussians found it needful to reorganize their social system from top to bottom , for this social system had descended from Frederic William , the Great Elector of Brandenburg ( 1640-1688 ) , and from Frederic the Great ( 1740-1786 ) , and was effete and incapable of meeting the French onset , which amounted , in substance , to a quickened competition . Accordingly , the new Prussian constitution , conceived by Stein , put the community upon a relatively democratic and highly developed educational basis . By the Emancipating Edict of 1807 , the peasantry came into possession of their land , while , chiefly through the impulsion of Scharnhorst , who was the first chief of staff of the modern army , the country adopted universal military service , which proved to be popular throughout all ranks . Previous to Scharnhorst , under Frederic the Great , the qualification of an officer had been birth . Scharnhorst defined it as education , gallantry , and intelligence . Similarly , Gneisenau 's conception of a possible Prussian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its administration . But the civil service was intended to incarnate science , and was the product of the modernized university , exemplified in the University of Berlin organized by William von Humboldt . Herein lay the initial advantage which Germany gained over England , an advantage which she long maintained . And the advantage lay in this : Germany conceived a system of technical education matured and put in operation by the State . Hence , so far as in human affairs such things are possible , the intelligence of Germans was liberated from the incubus of vested interests , who always seek to use education to advance themselves . It was so in England . The English entrusted education to the Church , and the Church was , by the necessity of its being , reactionary and hostile to science , whereas the army , in the main , was treated in England as a social function , and the officers , speaking generally , were not technically specially educated at all . Hence , in foreign countries , but especially in Germany which was destined to be ultimately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather more than a suspicion of weakness , and indeed , when it came to a test , England found herself standing , for several years of war , at a considerable disadvantage because of the lack of education in those departments wherein Germany had , by the attack of France , been forced to make herself proficient . This any one may see for himself by reading the addresses of Fichte to the German nation , delivered in 1807 and 1808 , when Berlin was still occupied by the French . In fine , it was with Prussia a question of competition , brought to its ultimate tension by war . Prussia had no alternative as a conquered land but to radically accelerate her momentum , or perish . And so , at the present day , it may not improbably be with us . Competition must grow intenser . With England the situation in 1800 was very different . It was less strenuous . Nothing is more notable in England than to observe how , after the Industrial Revolution began , there was practically no means by which a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . For instance , in February 1815 , four months before Waterloo , George Stephenson took out a patent for the locomotive engine which was to revolutionize the world . But George Stephenson was a common laborer in the mines , who had no state instruction available , nor had he even any private institution at hand in which the workmen whom he employed in practical construction could be taught . He and his son Robert , had to organize instruction for themselves and their employees independently . So it was even with a man like Faraday , who began life as an errand boy , and later on who actually went abroad as a sort of valet to Sir Humphry Davy . Davy himself was a self-made man . In short , England , as a community , did little or nothing by education for those who had no means , and but little to draw any one toward science . It was at this precise moment that Germany was cast into the furnace of modern competition with England , who had , because of a series of causes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a century the start of her . Against this advantage Germany had to rely exclusively upon civil and military education . At first this competition by Germany took a military complexion , and very rapidly wrought the complete consolidation of Germany by the Austrian and the French wars . But this phase presently passed , and after the French campaign of 1870 the purely economic aspect of the situation developed more strenuously still , so much so that intelligent observers , among whom Lord Roberts was conspicuous , perceived quite early in the present century that the heat generated in the conflict must , probably , soon engender war . Nor could it either theoretically or practically have been otherwise , for the relations between the two countries had reached a point where they generated a friction which caused incandescence automatically . And , moreover , the inflammable material fit for combustion was , especially in Germany , present in quantity . From the time of Fichte and Scharnhorst downward to the end of the century , the whole nation had learned , as a sort of gospel , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whereas the slack education and frivolous amusements of English civil and military life alike , had gradually created a society apt to crumble . And it is only needful for any person who has the curiosity , to glance at the light literature of the Victorian age , which deals with the army , to see how dominant a part such an amusement as hunting played in the life of the younger officers , especially in the fashionable regiments , to be impressed with the soundness of much of this German criticism . Assuming , then , for the sake of argument , that these historical premises are sound , I proceed to consider how they bear on our prospective civilization . This is eminently a scientific age , and yet the scientific mind , as it is now produced among us , is not without tendencies calculated to cause uneasiness to those a little conversant with history or philosophy . For whereas no one in these days would dream of utilizing prayer , as did Moses or Saint Hugh , as a mechanical energy , nevertheless the search for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it accomplishes nothing to the purpose . On the contrary , the effect is one which could neither be expected nor desired . Instead of being an aid to social coordination , it stimulates disintegration to a high degree as the war has shown . It has stimulated disintegration in two ways . First , it has enormously quickened physical movement , which has already been discussed , and secondly , it has stimulated the rapidity with which thought is diffused . The average human being can only absorb and assimilate safely new forms of thought when given enough time for digestion , as if he were assimilating food . If he be plied with new thought too rapidly he fails to digest . He has a surfeit , serious in proportion to its enormity . That is to say , his power of drawing correct conclusions from the premises submitted to him fails , and we have all sorts of crude experiments in sociology attempted , which end in that form of chaos which we call a violent revolution . The ordinary result is infinite waste fomented by fallacious hopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by loss of life . The experience is an old one , and the result is almost invariable . For example , during the Middle Ages , men like Saint Hugh and Peter the Venerable , and , most of all , Saint Francis , possessed by dreams of attaining to perfection , by leading lives of inimitable purity , self-devotion , and asceticism , inspired the community about them with the conviction that they could work miracles . They thereby , as a reward , drew to the Church they served what amounted to being , considering the age they lived in , boundless wealth . But the effect of this economic phenomenon was far from what they had hoped or expected . Instead of raising the moral standard of men to a point where all the world would be improved , they so debased the hierarchy , by making money the standard of ambition within it , that , as a whole , the priesthood accepted , without any effective protest , the fires of the Council of Constance which consumed Huss , and the abominations of the Borgias @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this orgy of crime and bestiality , the wars of the Reformation swept away many , many thousands of human beings , wasted half of Europe , and only served to demonstrate the futility of ideals . And so it was with the Puritans , who were themselves the children of the revolt against social corruption . They fondly believed that a new era was to be ushered in by the rule of the Cromwellian saints . What the Cromwellian saints did in truth usher in , was the carnival of debauchery of Charles II , in its turn to be succeeded by the capitalistic competitive age which we have known , and which has abutted in the recent war . Man can never hope to change his physical necessities , and therefore his moral nature must always remain the same in essence , if not in form . As Washington truly said , " The motives which predominate most in human affairs are self-love and self-interest , " and " nothing binds one country or one state to another but interest . " If , then , it be true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paths of least resistance toward predetermined ends , it can not fail to be useful to us in the present emergency to mark , as distinctly as we can , the causes which impelled Germany , at a certain point in her career , to choose the paths which led to her destruction rather than those which , at the first blush , promised as well , and which seemed to be equally as easy and alluring . And we may possibly , by this process , expose certain phenomena which may profit us , since such an examination may help us to estimate what avenues are like to prove ultimately the least resistant . Throughout the Middle Ages North Germany , which is the region whereof Berlin is the capital , enjoyed relatively little prosperity , because Brandenburg , for example , lay beyond the zone of those main trade routes which , before the advent of railways , served as the arteries of the eastern trade . Not until after the opening of the Industrial Revolution in England , did that condition alter . Nor even then did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian people . Nevertheless , as the Russian railway system developed , Berlin one day found herself standing , as it were , at the apex of a vast triangle whose boundaries are , roughly , indicated by the position of Berlin itself , Petersburg , Warsaw , Moscow , Kiev , and the Ukraine . Beyond Berlin the stream of traffic flowed to Hamburg and thence found vent in America , as a terminus . Great Britain , more especially , demanded food , and food passed by sea from Odessa . Hence Russia served as a natural base for Germany , taking German manufactures and offering to Germany a reservoir capable of absorbing her redundant population . Thus it had long been obvious that intimate relations with Russia were of prime importance to Germany since all the world could perceive that the monied interests of Russia must more and more fall into German hands , because of the intellectual limitations of the Russians . Also pacification to the eastward always was an integral part of Bismarck 's policy . Notwithstanding which other influences conflicted with , and ultimately overbalanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years before written history began , the economic capital of the world , the seat for the time being of opulence and of splendor , and at once the admiration and the envy of less favored rivals , has been a certain ambulatory spot upon the earth 's surface , at a point where the lines of trade from east to west have converged . And always the marked idiosyncrasy of this spot has been its unrest . It has constantly oscillated from east to west according as the fortunes of war have prevailed , or as the march of applied science has made one or another route of transportation cheaper or more defensible . Thus Babylon was conquered and robbed by Rome , and Rome , after a long heyday of prosperity , yielded to Constantinople , while Constantinople lost her supremacy to Venice , Genoa , and North Italy , following the sack of Constantinople by the Venetians in 1202 A.D. The Fairs of Champaign in France , and the cities of the Rhine and Antwerp were the glory of the Middle Ages , but these great markets faded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threw the route by the Red Sea and Cairo into eccentricity , and caused Spain and Portugal to bloom . Spain 's prosperity did not , however , last long . England used war during the sixteenth century as an economic weapon , pretty easily conquering . And since the opening of the Industrial Revolution , at least , London , with the exception of the few years when England suffered from the American revolt of 1776 , has assumed steadily more the aspect of the great international centre of exchanges , until with Waterloo her supremacy remained unchallenged . It was this brilliant achievement of London , won chiefly by arms , which more than any other cause impelled Germany to try her fortunes by war rather than by the methods of peace . Nor was the German calculation of chances unreasonable or unwarranted . For upwards of two centuries Germany had found war the most profitable of all her economic ventures ; especially had she found the French war of 1870 a most lucrative speculation . And she felt unbounded confidence that she could win as easy a triumph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twentieth as in the nineteenth century . But , could she penetrate to Paris and at the same time occupy the littoral of the Channel and Antwerp , she was persuaded that she could do to the commerce of England what England had once done to the commerce of Spain , and that Hamburg and Berlin would supplant London . And this calculation might have proved sound had it not been for her oversight in ignoring one essential factor in the problem . Ever since North America was colonized by the English , that portion of the continent which is now comprised by the Republic of the United States , had formed a part of the British economic system , even when the two fragments of that system were competing in war , as has occurred more than once . And as America has waxed great and rich these relations have grown closer , until of recent years it has become hard to determine whether the centre of gravity of this vast capitalistic mass lay to the east or to the west of the Atlantic . One fact , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that was that the currents of movement flowed with more power from America to England than from America to Germany . And this had from before the outbreak of hostilities affected the relations of the parties . Should Germany prevail in her contest with England , the result would certainly be to draw the centre of exchanges to the eastward , and thereby to throw the United States , more or less , into eccentricity ; but were England to prevail the United States would tend to become the centre toward which all else would gravitate . Hence , perfectly automatically , from a time as long ago as the Spanish War , the balance , as indicated by the weight of the United States , hung unevenly as between Germany and England , Germany manifesting something approaching to repulsion toward the attraction of the United States while Great Britain manifested favor . And from subsequent evidence , this phenomenon would seem to have been thus early developed , because the economic centre of gravity of our modern civilization had already traversed the Atlantic , and by so doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greater struggle about to come . Consider attentively what has happened . In April , 1917 , when the United States entered the conflict , Germany , though it had suffered severely in loss of men , was by no means exhausted . On the contrary , many months subsequently she began her final offensive , which she pushed so vigorously that she penetrated to within some sixty miles of Paris . But there , at Chateau Thierry , on the Marne , she first felt the weight of the economic shift . She suddenly encountered a division of American troops advancing to oppose her . Otherwise the road to Paris lay apparently open . The American troops were raw levies whom the Germans pretended to despise . And yet , almost without making a serious effort at prolonged attack , the Germans began their retreat , which only ended with their collapse and the fall of the empire . A similar phenomenon occurred once before in German history , and it is not an uncommon incident in human experience when nature has already made , or is on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the economic centre of the world . In the same way , when Constantine won the battle of the Milvian Bridge , with his men fighting under the standard of the Labarum , it was subsequently found that the economic capital of civilization had silently migrated from the Tiber to the Bosphorus , where Constantine seated himself at Constantinople , which was destined to be the new capital of the world for about eight hundred years . So in 1792 , when the Prussians and the French refugees together invaded France , they never doubted for an instant that they should easily disperse the mob , as they were pleased to call it , of Kellermann 's " vagabonds , cobblers , and tailors . " Nevertheless the Germans recoiled on the slope of Valmy from before the republican army , almost without striking a blow , nor could they be brought again to the attack , although the French royalists implored to be allowed to storm the hill alone , provided they could be assured of support . Then the retreat of the Duke of Brunswick began , and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Austerlitz , to Jena , to the dismemberment and to the reorganization of Prussia and to the evolution of modern Germany : in short , to the conversion of the remnants of mediaeval civilization into the capitalistic , industrial , competitive society which we have known . And all this because of the accelerated movement caused by science . If it be , indeed , a fact that the victory of Chateau Thierry and the subsequent retreat of the German army together with the collapse of the German Empire indicate , as there is abundant reason to suppose that they may , a shift in the world 's social equilibrium , equivalent to the shift in Europe presaged by Valmy , or to that which substituted Constantinople for Rome and which was marked by the Milvian Bridge , it follows that we must prepare ourselves for changes possibly greater than our world has seen since it marched to Jerusalem under Godfrey de Bouillon . And the tendency of those changes is not so very difficult , perhaps , roughly to estimate , always premising that they are hardly compatible with undue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in certain of their simpler aspects , some of the relations of Great Britain toward ourselves , since Great Britain is not only our most important friend , assuming that she remain a friend , but our most formidable competitor , should competition strain our friendship . Also Great Britain has the social system nearest akin to our own , and most likely to be influenced by the same so-called democratic tendencies . For upwards of a hundred years Great Britain has been , and she still is , absolutely dependent on her maritime supremacy for life . It was on that issue she fought the Napoleonic wars , and when she prevailed at Trafalgar and Waterloo she assumed economic supremacy , but only on the condition that she should always be ready and willing to defend it , for it is only on that condition that economic supremacy can be maintained . War is the most potent engine of economic competition . Constantinople and Antwerp survived and flourished on the same identical conditions long before the day of London . She must keep her avenues of communication with all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So long as America competed actively with England on the sea , even for her own trade , her relations with Great Britain were troubled . The irritation of the colonies with the restrictions which England put upon their commerce materially contributed to foment the revolution , as abundantly appears in the famous case of John Hancock 's sloop Liberty , which was seized for smuggling . So in the War of 1812 , England could not endure the United States as a competitor in her contest with France . She must be an ally , or , in other words , she must function as a component part of the British economic system , or she must be crushed . The crisis came with the attack of the Leopard on the Chesapeake in 1807 , after which the possibility of maintaining peace , under such a pressure , appeared , in its true light , as a phantasm . After the war , with more or less constant friction , the same conditions continued until the outbreak of the Rebellion , and then Great Britain manifested her true animus as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commerce of the United States , building , equipping , arming , manning , and succoring a navy for the South , which operated none the less effectively because its action was officially repudiated . And in this secret warfare England prevailed , since when the legislation of the United States has made American competition with England on the sea impossible . Wherefore we have had peace with England . We have supplied Great Britain with food and raw materials , abandoning to England the carrying trade and an undisputed naval supremacy . Consequently Great Britain feels secure and responds to the full force of that economic attraction which makes America naturally , a component part of the British economic system . But let American pretensions once again revive to the point of causing her to attempt seriously to develop her sea power as of yore , and the same friction would also revive which could hardly , were it pushed to its legitimate end , eventuate otherwise than in the ultimate form of all economic competition . If such a supposition seems now to be fanciful , it is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national relations vary under competition , to be assured that it is real . As Washington said , the only force which binds one nation to another is interest . The rise of Germany , which first created jealousy in England , began with the attack on Denmark in 1864 . Then Russia was the power which the British most feared and with whom they were on the worst of terms . About that period nothing would have seemed more improbable than that these relations would be reversed , and that Russia and England would jointly , within a generation , wage fierce war on Germany . We are very close to England now , but we may be certain that , were we to press , as Germany pressed , on British maritime and industrial supremacy , we should be hated too . It is vain to disguise the fact that British fortunes in the past have hinged on American competition , and that the wisest and most sagacious Englishmen have been those who have been most alive to the fact . Richard Cobden , for example , was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most eminent of British economists and statesmen of the middle of the nineteenth century . He was a democrat by birth and education , and a Quaker by religion . In 1835 , just before he entered public life , Cobden visited the United States and thus recorded his impressions on his return : " America is once more the theatre upon which nations are contending for mastery ; it is not , however , a struggle for conquest , in which the victor will acquire territorial dominion  --  the fight is for commercial supremacy , and will be won by the cheapest .... It is from the silent and peaceful rivalry of American commerce , the growth of its manufactures , its rapid progress in internal improvements , ... it is from these , and not from the barbarous policy or the impoverishing armaments of Russia , that the grandeur of our commercial and national prosperity is endangered . " Footnote : John Morley , The Life of Richard Cobden , 107 , 108 . It is not , however , any part of my contention that nature should push @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us in war with Great Britain , at least at present , for nature has various and most unlooked-for ways of arriving at her ends , since men never can determine , certainly in advance , what avenue will , to them , prove the least resistant . They very often make an error , as did the Germans , which they can only correct by enduring disaster , defeat , and infinite suffering . Nature might very well , for example , prefer that consolidation should advance yet another step before a reaction toward chaos should begin . This last war has , apparently , been won by a fusion of two economic systems which together hold and administer a preponderating mass of fluid capital , and which have partially pooled their resources to prevail . They appear almost as would a gigantic lizard which , having been severed in an ancient conflict , was now making a violent but only half-conscious effort to cause the head and body to unite with the tail , so that the two might function once more as a single organism , governed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life there would seem to be no reason why this fluid capital should not fuse and by its energy furnish the motor which should govern the world . Rome , for centuries , was governed by an emperor , who represented the landed class of Italy , under the forms of a republic . It is not by any means necessary that a plutocratic mass should have a recognized political head . And America and England , like two enormous banking houses , might in effect fuse and yet go on as separate institutions with nominally separate boards of directors . But it is inconceivable that even such an expedient as this , however successful at the outset , should permanently solve the problem , which resolves itself once more into individual competition . It is not imaginable that such an enormous plutocratic society as I have supposed could conduct its complex affairs upon the basis of the average intelligence . As in Rome , a civil service would inevitably be organized which would contain a carefully selected body of ability . We have seen such a process , in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a civil service , however selected and however trained , would , to succeed , have to be composed of men who were the ablest in their calling , the best educated , and the fittest : in a word , the representatives of what we call " the big business " of the country . Such as they might handle the railroads , the telegraph lines , the food supply , the question of competitive shipping , and finally prices , as we have seen it done , but only on condition that they belonged to the fortunate class by merit . But supposing , in the face of such a government , the unfortunate class should protest , as they already do protest in Russia , in Germany , and even in England and here at home , that a legal system which sanctions such a civilization is iniquitous . Here , the discontented say , you insist on a certain form of competition being carried to its limit . That is , you demand intellectual and peaceful competition for which I am unfit both by education , training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those walks in life which make a man a freeman . I become a slave to capital . I must work , or fight , or starve according to another man 's convenience , caprice , or , in fine , according to his will . I could be no worse off under any despot . To such a system I will not submit . But I can at least fight . Put me on a competitive equality or I will blow your civilization to atoms . To such an argument there is no logical answer possible except the answer which all extreme socialists have always advanced . The fortunate man should be taxed for all he earns above the average wage , and the State should confiscate his accumulations at death . Then , with a system of government education , obligatory on all , children would start equal from birth . Here we come against the hereditary instinct , the creator and the preserver of the family : the instinct which has made law and order possible , so far as our ancestors or we have known order , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming world must strive with this question , or abandon the " democratic ideal , " the future promises to be stormy . But even assuming that this problem of individual competition be overcome , we are as far as ever from creating a system of moral law which shall avail us , for we at once come in conflict with the principle of abstract justice which demands that free men shall be permitted to colonize or move where they will . But supposing England and America to amalgamate ; they now hold or assume to control all or nearly all the vacant regions of the earth which are suited to the white man 's habitation . And the white man can not live and farm his land in competition with the Asiatic ; that was conclusively proved in the days of Rome . But it is not imaginable that Asiatics will submit to this discrimination in silence . Nothing can probably constrain them to resignation but force , and to apply force is to revert to the old argument of the savage or the despot , who admits that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the system , however much we have disguised it and , in short , lied about it , under which we have lived and under which our ancestors have lived ever since the family was organized , and under which it is probable that we shall continue to live as long as any remnant of civilization shall survive . Nevertheless , it seems to be far from improbable that the system of industrial , capitalistic civilization , which came in , in substance , with the " free thought " of the Reformation , is nearing an end . Very probably it may have attained to its ultimate stages and may dissolve presently in the chaos which , since the Reformation , has been visibly impending . Democracy in America has conspicuously and decisively failed , in the collective administration of the common public property . Granting thus much , it becomes simply a question of relative inefficiency , or degradation of type , culminating in the exhaustion of resources by waste ; unless the democratic man can supernaturally raise himself to some level more nearly approaching perfection than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the democrat can not change himself from a competitive to a non-competitive animal by talking about it , or by pretending to be already or to be about to become other than he is ,  --  the victim of infinite conflicting forces . BROOKS ADAMS , QUINCY , July 20 , 1919 . THE EMANCIPATION OF MASSACHUSETTS . CHAPTER I. THE COMMONWEALTH . The mysteries of the Holy Catholic Church had been venerated for ages when Europe burst from her mediaeval torpor into the splendor of the Renaissance . Political schemes and papal abuses may have precipitated the inevitable outbreak , but in the dawn of modern thought the darkness faded amidst which mankind had so long cowered in the abject terrors of superstition . Already in the beginning of the fifteenth century many of the ancient dogmas had begun to awaken incredulity , and sceptics learned to mock at that claim to infallibility upon which the priesthood based their right to command the blind obedience of the Christian world . Between such adversaries compromise was impossible ; and those who afterward revolted against the authority of the traditions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they grew to reverence with a passionate devotion , believing it to have been not only directly and verbally inspired by God , but the only channel through which he had made known his will to men . Thus the movement was not toward new doctrines ; on the contrary , it was the rejection of what could no longer be believed . Calvin was no less orthodox than St. Augustine in what he accepted ; his heresy lay in the denial of enigmas from which his understanding recoiled . The mighty convulsion of the Reformation , therefore , was but the supreme effort of the race to tear itself from the toils of a hierarchy whose life hung upon its success in forcing the children to worship the myths of their ancestral religion . Three hundred years after Luther nailed his theses to the church door the logical deduction had been drawn from his great act , and Christendom had been driven to admit that any concession of the right to reason upon matters of faith involved the recognition of the freedom of individual thought . But though this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bloodshed passed before the victory was won ; and from the outset the attitude of the clergy formed the chief obstacle to the triumph of a more liberal civilization ; for howsoever bitterly Catholic and Protestant divines have hated and persecuted each other , they have united like true brethren in their hatred and their persecution of heretics ; for such was their inexorable destiny . Men who firmly believe that salvation lies within their creed alone , and that doubters suffer endless torments , never can be tolerant . They feel that duty commands them to defend their homes against a deadly peril , and even pity for the sinner urges them to wring from him a recantation before it is too late ; and then , moreover , dissent must lessen the power and influence of a hierarchy and may endanger its very existence ; therefore the priests of every church have been stimulated to crush out schism by the two strongest passions that can inflame the mind  --  by bigotry and by ambition . In England the Reformation was controlled by statesmen , whose object was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no changes except such as they thought necessary for their purpose . They repudiated the papal supremacy , and adopted articles of religion sufficiently evangelical in form , but they retained episcopacy , the liturgy , and the surplice ; the cross was still used in baptism , the people bowed at the name of Jesus , and knelt at the communion . Such a compromise with what they deemed idolatry was offensive to the stricter Protestants , and so early as 1550 John Hooper refused the see of Gloucester because he would not wear the robes of office ; thus almost from its foundation the church was divided into factions , and those who demanded a more radical reform were nicknamed Puritans . As time elapsed large numbers who could no longer bring themselves to conform withdrew from the orthodox communion , and began to worship by themselves ; persecution followed , and many fled to Holland , where they formed congregations in the larger towns , the most celebrated of them being that of John Robinson at Leyden , which afterward founded Plymouth . But the intellectual ferment was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church was shaking the foundations of the state : power was passing into the hands of the people , but a century was to elapse before the relations of the sovereign to the House of Commons were fully adjusted . During this interval the Stuarts reigned and three of the four kings suffered exile or death in the fierce contest for mastery . The fixed determination of Charles I. was to establish a despotism and enforce conformity with ritualism ; and the result was the Great Rebellion . Among the statesmen who advised him , none has met with such scant mercy from posterity as Laud , who has been gibbeted as the impersonification of narrowness , of bigotry , and of cruelty . The judgment is unscientific , for whatever may be thought of the humanity or wisdom of his policy , he only did what all have done who have attempted to impose a creed on men . The real grievance has never been that an observance has been required , or an indulgence refused , but that the right to think has been denied . Provided a boundary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the line drawn by Laud is as reasonable as that of Calvin ; Geneva is no more infallible than Canterbury or Rome . Comprehension is the dream of visionaries , for some will always differ from any confession of faith , however broad ; and where there are dogmas there will be heretics till all have perished . But in their fear and hatred of individual free thought regarding the mysteries of religion , Laud , Calvin , and the Pope agreed . With the progress of the war , the Puritans , who had at first been united in their opposition to the crown , themselves divided ; one party , to which most of the peers and of the non-conforming clergy belonged , being anxious to reestablish the monarchy , and set up a rigid Presbyterianism ; the other , of whose spirit Cromwell was the incarnation , resolving each day more firmly to crush the king and proclaim freedom of conscience ; and it was this doctrine of toleration which was the snare and the abomination in the eyes of evangelical divines . Robert Baillie , the Scotch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the power of the Independents in Parliament , with each victory of their armies in the field wrote , " Liberty of conscience , and toleration of all and any religion , is so prodigious an impiety that this religious parliament can not but abhor the very meaning of it . " Nor did his reverend brethren of the Westminster Assembly fall any whit behind him when they rose to expound the word . In a letter of 17th May , 1644 , he thus described their doctrine : " This day was the best that I have seen since I came to England .... After D. Twisse had begun with a brief prayer , Mr. Marshall prayed large two hours , most divinely , confessing the sins of the members of the assembly , in a wonderful , pathetick , and prudent way . After , Mr. Arrowsmith preached an hour , then a psalm ; thereafter , Mr. Vines prayed near two hours , and Mr. Palmer preached an hour , and Mr. Seaman prayed near two hours , then a psalm ; after , Mr. Henderson brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the assembly , and other seen faults to be remedied , and the conveniency to preach against all sects , especially Anabaptists and Antinomians . Dr. Twisse closed with a short prayer and blessing . " Footnote : Baillie 's Letters and Journals , ii . 18 . But Cromwell , gifted with noble instincts and transcendent political genius , a layman , a statesman , and a soldier , was a liberal from birth till death . " Those that were sound in the faith , how proper was it for them to labor for liberty , ... that men might not be trampled upon for their consciences ! Had not they labored but lately under the weight of persecution ? And was it fit for them to sit heavy upon others ? Is it ingenuous to ask liberty and not to give it ? What greater hypocrisy than for those who were oppressed by the bishops to become the greatest oppressors themselves , so soon as their yoke was removed ? I could wish that they who call for liberty now also had not too much of that spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Footnote : Speech at dissolution of first Parliment , Jan. 22 , 1655 .

If , on the other side , those of the Anabaptist shall be censuring the godly ministers of the nation who profess under that of Independency ; or if those that profess under Presbytery shall be reproaching or speaking evil of them , traducing and censuring of them , as I would not be willing to see the day when England shall be in the power of the Presbytery to impose upon the consciences of others that profess faith in Christ ,  --  so I will not endure any reproach to them . " Footnote : Speech made September , 1656 . Carlyle 's Cromwell , iv . 234 . The number of clergymen among the emigrants to Massachusetts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who formed the colony was influenced by them to an extraordinary degree . Many able pastors had been deprived in England for non-conformity , and they had to choose between silence or exile . To men of their temperament silence would have been intolerable ; and most must have depended upon their profession for support . America , therefore , offered a convenient refuge . The motives are less obvious which induced the leading laymen , some of whom were of fortune and consequence at home , to face the hardships of the wilderness . Persecution can not be the explanation , for a government under which Hampden and Cromwell could live and be returned to Parliament was not intolerable ; nor does it appear that any of them had been severely dealt with . The wish of the Puritan party to have a place of retreat , should the worst befall , may have had its weight with individuals , but probably the influence which swayed the larger number was the personal ascendancy of their pastors , for that ascendancy was complete . In a community so selected , men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the stamp of Cromwell , and in point of fact their minds were generally cast in the ecclesiastical mould and imbued with the ecclesiastical feeling . Governor Dudley represented them well , and at his death some lines were found in his pocket in which their spirit yet glows in all the fierceness of its bigotry . " Let men of God in Courts and Churches watch O 're such as do a Toleration hatch , Lest that Ill Egg bring forth a Cockatrice , To poison all with heresie and vice . " Footnote : Magnalia , bk. 2 , ch. v. section 1 . In former ages churches had been comprehensive to this extent : infants had been baptized , and , when the child had become a man , he had been admitted to the communion as a matter of course , unless his life had given scandal ; but to this system the Congregationalist was utterly opposed . He believed that , human nature being totally depraved , some became regenerate through grace ; that the signs of grace were as palpable as any other traits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world ; therefore , none should be admitted to the sacrament who had not the marks of the elect ; and as in a well-ordered community the godly ought to rule , it followed that none should be enfranchised but members of the church . To suppose such a government could be maintained in England was beyond the dreams even of an enthusiast , and there can be little doubt that the controlling incentive with many of those who sailed was the hope , with the aid of their divines , of founding a religious commonwealth in the wilderness which should harmonize with their interpretation of the Scriptures . The execution of such a project was , however , far from easy . It would have been most unsafe for the emigrants to have divulged their true designs , since these were not only unlawful , but would have been highly offensive to the king , and yet they were too feeble to exist without the protection of Great Britain , therefore it was necessary to secure for themselves the rights of English subjects , and to throw some semblance at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their new state . Accordingly , a patent Footnote : March 4 , 1629. was obtained from the crown , by which twenty-five persons were incorporated under the name of the Governor and Company of Massachusetts Bay in New England ; and as the extent of the powers therein granted has given rise to a controversy which is not yet closed , it is necessary to understand the nature of that instrument in order to comprehend the bearings of the bitter strife which darkens the history of the first fifty years of the colony . The germ of the written charter is so ancient as to be lost in obscurity . During the Middle Ages , oppression was , speaking generally , the accepted condition of society , no man not noble having the right in theory , or the power in practice , to control his own actions without interference from his feudal superior . Under such circumstances the only hope for the weak was to combine , and most of the early triumphs of freedom were won by combinations of commons against some noble , or of nobles against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but easy for burghers , and from the outset these seem to have united for their common defense against the neighboring barons ; and thus was born the mediaeval guild . The ancient townsmen were not usually strong enough to fight for their liberties , so they generally resorted to purchase ; they agreed with their lord upon a price to be paid for a privilege , and were given for their money a grant , which , because it was written , was called a charter . The following charter of the Merchants ' Guild of Leicester is very early and very simple . It presupposes that there could be no doubt about the local customs , which are therefore not enumerated , and it shows that the guild of Leicester existed as a corporation at the Conquest , and must already have held property in succession and been liable to suit through two reigns :  --  " Robert , Earl of Mellent , to Ralph , and all his barons , French and English , of all his land in England , greeting : Know ye , that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with all customs which they held in the time of King William , of King William his son , and now hold in the time of Henry the king . " Witness : R. , the son of Alcitil . " The object of these ancient writings was only to record the fact of corporate existence ; the popular custom by which the guilds were regulated was taken for granted ; but obviously they must have had succession , been liable to suit , able to contract , and , in a word , to do all those acts which were afterward set forth . And such has uniformly been the process by which English jurisprudence has been shaped ; a usage grows up that courts recognize , and , by their decisions , establish as the common law ; but judicial decisions are inflexible , and , as they become antiquated , they are themselves modified by legislation . Lawyers observed these customary companies for some centuries before they learned what functions were universal ; but , with the lapse of time , the patents became more elaborate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was held necessary to create a new corporation . A merchants ' guild , like the one of Leicester , was an association of the townsmen for their common welfare . Every trader was then called a merchant , and as almost every burgher lived by trade , and was also a landowner , to the extent at least of his dwelling , it followed that the guild practically included all free male inhabitants ; the guild hall was used as the town hall , the guild ordinances were the town ordinances , and the corporation became the government of the borough , and as such chose persons to represent it in Parliament , when summoned by the king 's writ to send burgesses to Westminster . London is a corporation by prescription and not by virtue of any particular charter , and to this day its city hall is called by the ancient name , Guild Hall . But with the growth of wealth and population the original fraternity divided into craft organizations ( so long ago , indeed , that no record of its existence remains ) , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own ; and thus it came to pass that the twelve livery companies  --  the Mercers , the Grocers , the Goldsmiths , the Drapers , the Fishmongers , and the rest  --  became the government of the capital of England . All mediaeval institutions tended to aristocracy and monopoly , and , accordingly , after the merchant guilds had split into these corporate trade unions , boroughs waxed exclusive , and membership , instead of being an incident of citizenship , grew to confer citizenship itself ; thus the franchise , being confined to freemen , and freedom or membership having come to depend on birth , marriage , election , or purchase , the constituencies which returned a majority of the House of Commons grew so petty and corrupt as to threaten the existence of parliamentary government itself , and the abuse at last culminated in the agitation which produced the Reform Bill . When legal forms had taken shape , the land upon which a town stood was not unusually granted to the mayor and commonalty by metes and bounds , Footnote : See Charter of Plymouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The incorporation was by statute. to them and their successors forever , upon payment of a rent ; and the mayor and common council were empowered to make laws and ordinances for the local government , and to fine , imprison , and sometimes whip and otherwise punish offenders , so as their statutes , fines , pains , and penalties were reasonable and not repugnant to law . Footnote : History of Tiverton , App. 5 . The foreign trading company was an offshoot of the guild , and was intended to protect commerce . Obviously some such organization must have been necessary , for , if property was insecure within the realm , it was far more exposed without ; and , indeed , in the fourteenth century , English merchants domiciled on the Continent could hardly have been safer than Europeans are now who garrison the so-called factories upon the coast of Africa . At the Conquest , the Hanse merchants had a house in London , which was afterward famous as the Steel Yard . They lived a strange life ,  --  a combination of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their fortified warehouse , exposed to the attacks of the ferocious mob , was occasionally taken and sacked ; and the garrison shut up within was subject to an iron discipline . They were forbidden to marry , no woman passed the gates , nor did they ever sleep a night without the walls ; but , always on the watch , they lay in their cells ready to repulse a storm . For many years these Germans seem to have monopolized the carrying trade , for it was not till the thirteenth century that Englishmen appear to have made an effort at competition . However , about 1296 certain London mercers are said to have obtained a grant of privileges from John , Duke of Brabant , and to have established a wool market at Antwerp . Footnote : Andersen 's History of Commerce . The recognition of the Flemish government was of course necessary ; but they could hardly have maintained themselves without some support at home ; for , although their warehouse was abroad , they were English merchants , and they must have relied upon English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elaborate charter , granted by Edward IV . in 1463 , proves that the corporation had then had a long legal existence . Footnote : Hakluyt 's Voyages , i. 230 . The crown thereby confirmed one Obrey , the governor , in his office during pleasure , with the wages theretofore enjoyed ; existing laws were approved ; the governor and merchants were empowered to elect twelve Justicers , who were to hold courts for all merchants and mariners in those parts ; and the company was authorized to regulate the trade and control the traders , provided no laws were passed contrary to the intent of that charter . Here , as in the Merchant Guild , the inevitable aristocratic revolution took place , and the old democratic brotherhood became a strict monopoly . The oppression was so flagrant that a petition was presented to Parliament in 1497 against the exactions of the Merchant Adventurers , as the association was then called , by which it appeared that interlopers , trading to Holland and Flanders , were fined L40 , whereas any subject might have become a freeman in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8d. ; Footnote : 12 Henry VII . ch. vi. and the scandal was so great that the fine was fixed at 10 marks , or L6 l3s. 4d. , by statute . During the stagnation of the Middle Ages few traces of such commercial enterprises are to be found , but with the sixteenth century Europe awoke to a new life and thrilled with a new energy . Trade shared in the impulse . In 1554 Philip and Mary incorporated the Russia Company in regular modern form ; in 1581 the Turkey Company was organized ; in 1600 the East India Company received its charter ; and , to come directly to what is material , in 1629 Charles I. signed the patent of the Governor and Company of Massachusetts Bay in New England . Stripped of its verbiage , the provisions are simple . The stockholders , or " freemen , " as they were then called , were to meet once a quarter in a " General Court . " This General Court , or stockholders ' meeting , chose the officers , of which there were twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or directors , on the last Wednesday in each Easter Term . The assistants were intrusted with the business management , and were to meet once a month or oftener ; while the General Court was empowered to admit freemen , and " to make laws and ordinances for the good and welfare of the said company , and for the government and ordering of the said lands and plantation , and the people inhabiting and to inhabit the same , as to them from time to time shall be thought meet ,  --  so as such laws and ordinances be not contrary or repugnant to the laws and statutes of this our realm of England . " The criminal jurisdiction was limited to the " imposition of lawful fines , mulcts , imprisonment , or other lawful correction , according to the course of other corporations in this our realm of England . " The " course of corporations " referred to was well established . The Master and Wardens of the Guild of Drapers in London , for example , could make " such ... pains , punishments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amercements , " ... " as shall seem ... necessary , " provided their statutes were reasonable and not contrary to the laws of the kingdom . Footnote : Herbert 's Livery Companies , i. 489 . In like manner , boroughs such as Tiverton might " impose and assess punishments by imprisonments , etc. , and reasonable fines upon offenders . " Footnote : See History of Tiverton , App. 5 . But all lawyers knew that such grants did not convey full civil or criminal jurisdiction , which , when thought needful , was specially conferred , as was done in the case of the East India Company upon their petition in 1624 , Footnote : Bruce , Annals , i. 252. and in that of Massachusetts by the charter of William and Mary . Such was the undoubted theory , and evidently there must always have been some practical means of checking the abuse of power by these strong organizations . In semi-barbarous ages the sovereign took matters into his own hands by seizing the franchise , and even the Plantagenets repeatedly suspended or revoked the liberties of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but sometimes also to make money by a resale ; and a succession of these arbitrary forfeitures demonstrated that charters to be of value must be beyond the grantor 's control . Resort was had to the courts , as a matter of course , and finally it was settled that relief should be given by a writ of quo warranto , upon which the question of the violation of privileges could be tried ; and curious records still remain of ancient litigations of this nature . In 1321 complaint was made against the London Weavers for injuring the public by passing regulations tending to raise the price of cloth . Footnote : Liber Customarum , i. 416-424 . It was alleged that the guild , with this intent , had limited the working hours in the day , the working days in the year , and the number of apprentices the freemen might employ ; and the prayer was that for these abuses the charter should be annulled . The cause was tried before a jury , who found the truth of some of the charges ; but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was danger , moreover , to the citizen from the oppression of these powerful bodies , as well as to the public from their usurpations ; and were authority wholly wanting , argument would be almost unnecessary to prove that some appellate tribunal must always have had jurisdiction to pass upon the validity of corporate legislation ; for otherwise any summary punishment might have been inflicted upon an individual , though notoriously unlawful , and the only redress possible would have been subsequent proceedings to vacate the charter . Through appeals , corporations could be controlled ; and by none was this control so stubbornly disputed , or its necessity so clearly demonstrated , as by the Governor and Company of Massachusetts Bay in New England . A good illustration is the trial of the Quaker , Wenlock Christison , for his life in 1661 . " William Leddra being thus dispatch 'd , it was resolved to make an end also of Wenlock Christison . He therefore was brought from the prison to the court at Boston , where the governor John Indicot , and the deputy governor Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' Unless you will renounce your religion , you shall surely die . ' But instead of shrinking , he said with an undaunted courage , ' Nay , I shall not change my religion , nor seek to save my life ; neither do I intend to deny my Master ; but if I lose my life for Christ 's sake , and the preaching of the gospel , I shall save my life . ' ... John Indicot asked him ' what he had to say for himself , why he should not die ? ' ... Then Wenlock asked , ' By what law will you put me to death ? ' The answer was , ' We have a law , and by our law you are to die . ' ' So said the Jews of Christ , ' ( reply 'd Wenlock ) ' we have a law , and by our law he ought to die . Who empowered you to make that law ? ' To which one of the board answered , ' We have a patent , and are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws . ' Hereupon Wenlock asked again , ' How , have you power to make laws repugnant to the laws of England ? ' ' No , ' said the governor . ' Then , ' ( reply 'd Wenlock , ) ' you are gone beyond your bounds , and have forfeited your patent ; and that is more than you can answer . ' ' Are you , ' ask 'd he , ' subjects to the king , yea or nay ? ' ... To which one said , ' Yea , we are so . ' ' Well , ' said Wenlock , ' so am I. ' ... ' Therefore seeing that you and I are subjects to the king , I demand to be tried by the laws of my own nation . ' It was answered , ' You shall be tried by a bench and a jury . ' For it seems they began to be afraid to go on in the former course , of trial without a jury ... But Wenlock said , ' That is not the law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor read of any law that was in England to hang Quakers . ' To this the governor reply 'd ' that there was a law to hang Jesuits . ' To which Wenlock return 'd , ' If you put me to death , it is not because I go under the name of a Jesuit , but of a Quaker . Therefore , I appeal to the laws of my own nation . ' But instead of taking notice of this , one said ' that he was in their hands , and had broken their law , and they would try him . ' " Footnote : Sewel , pp. 278 , 279 . Yet , though the ecclesiastical party in Massachusetts obstinately refused to admit appeals to the British judiciary up to the last moment of their power , for the obvious reason that the existence of the theocracy depended upon the enforcement of such legislation as that under which the Quakers suffered , there was no principle in the whole range of English jurisprudence more firmly established . By a statute of Henry VI . passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the judges for approval ; and the Court of King 's Bench always set aside such as were bad , whenever the question of their validity was presented for adjudication . Footnote : Stat. 15 H. VI . ch. 6 . Stat 19 H. VII . ch. 7 . Clark 's Case , 5 Coke , 633 , decided A. D. 1596 . See Kyd on Corporations , ii . 107-110 , where authorities are collected . Child v. Hudson Bay Co. , 2 P. W. 207 . But discussion is futile ; the proposition is self-evident , that an association endowed with the capacity of acting like a single man , for certain defined objects , which shall attempt other objects , or shall seek to compass its ends by unlawful means , violates the condition upon which its life has been granted , transcends the limits of its existence , and forfeits its privileges ; and that under such circumstances its ordinances are void , and none are bound to yield them their obedience . Approached thus from the standpoint of legal history , no doubt can exist concerning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Massachusetts colony . The instrument obtained from Charles I. embodied certain of their number in an English corporation , whose only lawful business was the American trade , as the business of the East India Company was trade in Hindostan . To enable them to act effectively , a tract of land in New England , between the Merrimack and the Charles , was conveyed to them , as the soil upon which a town stood was conveyed to the mayor and commonalty . Within this territory they were authorized to established their plantations and forts , which they were empowered to defend against attack , as the Hanse merchants defended the Steel Yard in London . They were also permitted to govern the country within their grant by reasonable regulations calculated to preserve the peace , and of much the same character as the municipal ordinances of towns , subject , of course , to judicial supervision . The corporation itself was created subject to the municipal laws of England , and could have no existence without the realm ; and though perhaps even then the American wilderness might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it formed no part of the kingdom , Footnote : Blackstone 's Commentaries , i. 109. and was altogether beyond the limits of that jurisdiction from whose customs and statutes the life of this imaginary being sprang . Therefore , the governing body could legally exercise its functions only when domiciled in some English town . Footnote : On this subject see the able paper of Mr. Deane , in Massachusetts Historical Society Proceedings , December , 1869 , p. 166 . Sir Richard Sheldon , the solicitor-general , advised the king that he was signing a charter containing " such ... clauses for ye electing of Governors and Officers here in England , ... and powers to make lawes and ordinances for setling ye governement and magistracye for ye plantacon there , ... as ... are usuallie allowed to Corporacons in England . " Footnote : Mass . Hist . Soc . Proc. 1869-70 , p. 173 . And there can be no question that his opinion was sound . Nothing can be imagined more ill-suited to serve as the organic law of a new commonwealth than this instrument . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a representative assembly , for the incorporation of counties and towns , for police or taxation . In short , hardly a step could be taken toward founding a territorial government based upon popular suffrage without working a forfeiture of the charter by abuse of the franchise . The colonists , it is true , afterward advanced very different theories of construction ; but that they were well aware of their legal position is demonstrated by the fact that after some hesitation from apprehension of consequences , they ventured on the singularly bold and lawless measure of secretly removing their charter to America and establishing their corporation in a land which they thought would be beyond the process of Westminster Hall . Footnote : 1629 , Aug. 29 . The details of the settlement are related in many books , and require only the briefest mention here . In 1628 an association of gentlemen bought the tract of country lying between the Merrimack and Charles from the Council of Plymouth , and sent Endicott to take charge of their purchase . A royal patent was , however , thought necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having been obtained , the Company of Massachusetts Bay was at once organized in England , Endicott was appointed governor in America , and six vessels sailed during the spring of 1629 , taking out several hundred persons and a " plentiful provision of godly ministers . " In August the church of Salem was gathered and Mr. Higginson was consecrated as their teacher . In that same month Winthrop , Saltonstall , and others met at Cambridge and signed an agreement binding themselves upon the faith of Christians to embark for the plantation by the following March ; " Provided always that before the last of September next , the whole government , together with the patent , ... be first by an order of court legally transferred and established to remain with us and others which shall inhabite upon the said plantation . " Footnote : Hutch . Coll . , Prince Soc. ed. i. 28 . The Company accepted the proposition , Winthrop was chosen governor , and he anchored in Salem harbor in June . Footnote : 1630 More than a thousand settlers landed before winter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ October ; nor did the emigration thus begun entirely cease until the meeting of the Long Parliament . From the beginning the colonists took what measures they thought proper , without regarding the limitations of the law . Counties and towns had to be practically incorporated , taxes were levied upon inhabitants , and in 1634 all pretence of a General Court of freemen was dropped , and the towns chose delegates to represent them , though the legislature was not divided into two branches until ten years later . When the government had become fully organized supreme power was vested in the General Court , a legislature composed of two houses ; the assistants , or magistrates , as they were called , and the deputies . The governor , deputy governor , and assistants were elected by a general vote ; but each town sent two deputies to Boston . For some years justice was dispensed by the magistrates according to the Word of God , but gradually a judicial system was established ; the magistrate 's local court was the lowest , from whence causes went by appeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always an assistant , and probate jurisdiction was given to the two held at Ipswich and at Salem . From the judgments entered here an appeal lay to the Court of Assistants , and then to the General Court , which was the tribunal of last resort . The clergy and gentry pertinaciously resisted the enactment of a series of general statutes , upon which the people as steadily insisted , until at length , in 1641 , " The Body of Liberties " was approved by the legislature . This compilation was the work of the Rev. Mr. Ward , pastor of Ipswich , and contained a criminal code copied almost word for word from the Pentateuch , but apart from matters touching religion , the legislation was such as English colonists have always adopted . A major-general was elected who commanded the militia , and in 1652 money was coined . The social institutions , however , have a keener interest , for they reflect that strong cast of thought which has stamped its imprint deep into the character of so much of the American people . The seventeenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of New England were divided into three classes , the commonalty , the gentry , and the clergy . Little need be said of the first , except that they were a brave and determined race , as ready to fight as Cromwell 's saints , who made Rupert 's troopers " as stubble to their swords ; " that they were intelligent , and would not brook injustice ; and that they were resolute , and would not endure oppression . All know that they were energetic and shrewd . The gentry had the weight in the community that comes with wealth and education , and they received the deference then paid to birth , for they were for the most part the descendants of English country-gentlemen . As a matter of course they monopolized the chief offices ; and they were not sentenced by the courts to degrading punishments , like whipping , for their offences , as other criminals were . They even showed some wish at the outset to create legal distinctions , such as a magistracy for life , and a disposition to magnify the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled ; but the action of the people was determined though quiet , a chamber of deputies was chosen , and such schemes were heard of no more . Yet notwithstanding the existence of this aristocratic element , the real substance of influence and power lay with the clergy . It has been taught as an axiom of Massachusetts history , that from the outset the town was the social and political unit ; but an analysis of the evidence tends to show that the organization of the Puritan Commonwealth was ecclesiastical , and the congregation , not the town , the basis upon which the fabric rested . By the constitution of the corporation the franchise went with the freedom of the company ; but in order to form a constituency which would support a sacerdotal oligarchy , it was enacted in 1631 " that for time to come noe man shalbe admitted to the freedome of this body polliticke , but such as are members of some of the churches within ... the same . " Footnote : Mass . Records , i. 87 . Thus though communicants were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was not a communicant ; therefore the town-meeting was in fact nothing but the church meeting , possibly somewhat attenuated , and called by a different name . By this insidious statute the clergy seized the temporal power , which they held till the charter fell . The minister stood at the head of the congregation and moulded it to suit his purposes and to do his will ; for though he could not when opposed admit an inhabitant to the sacrament , he could peremptorily exclude therefrom all those of whom he disapproved , for " none are propounded to the congregation , except they be first allowed by the elders . " Footnote : Winthrop 's reply to Vane , Hutch . Coll . , Prince Soc. ed. i. 101 . In such a community the influence of the priesthood must have been overwhelming . Not only in an age without newspapers or tolerable roads were their sermons , preached several times each week to every voter , the most effective of political harangues ; but , unlike other party orators , they were not forced to stimulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a people glowing with fanaticism , each elder picked his band of devoted servants of the church , men passionately longing to do the will of Christ , whose commands concerning earth and heaven their pastor had been ordained to declare . Nor was their power bounded by local limits ; though seldom holding office themselves , they were solemnly consulted by the government on every important question that arose , whether of war or peace , and their counsel was rarely disregarded . They gave their opinion , no matter how foreign the subject might be to their profession or their education ; and they had no hesitation in passing upon the technical construction of the charter with the authority of a bench of judges . An amusing example is given by Winthrop : " The General Court assembled again , and all the elders were sent for , to reconcile the differences between the magistrates and deputies . When they were come the first question put to them was , ... whether the magistrates are , by patent and election of the people , the standing council of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have power accordingly to act in all cases subject to government , according to the said patent and the laws of this jurisdiction ; and when any necessary occasions call for action from authority , in cases where there is no particular express law provided , there to be guided by the word of God , till the General Court give particular rules in such cases . The elders , having received the question , withdrew themselves for consultation about it , and the next day sent to know , when we would appoint a time that they might attend the court with their answer . The magistrates and deputies agreed upon an hour " and ... their answer was affirmative , on the magistrates behalf , in the very words of the question , with some reasons thereof . It was delivered in writing by Mr. Cotton in the name of them all , they being all present , and not one dissentient . " Then the magistrates propounded four more questions , the last of which is as follows : " Whether a judge be bound to pronounce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it be apparently above or beneath the merit of the offence ? " To which the elders replied at great length , saying that the penalty must vary with the gravity of the crime , and added examples : " So any sin committed with an high hand , as the gathering of sticks on the Sabbath day , may be punished with death when a lesser punishment may serve for gathering sticks privily and in some need . " Footnote : Winthrop , ii . 204 , 205 . Yet though the clerical influence was so unbounded the theocracy itself was exposed to constant peril . In monarchies such as France or Spain the priests who rule the king have the force of the nation at command to dispose of at their will ; but in Massachusetts a more difficult problem was presented , for the voters had to be controlled . By the law requiring freemen to be church-members the elders meant to grasp the key to the suffrage , but experience soon proved that more stringent regulation was needed . According to the original Congregational theory each church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and conducted its own worship , free from interference from without , except that others of the same communion might offer advice or admonition . Under the theocracy no such loose system was possible , for heresy might enter in three different ways ; first , under the early law , " blasphemers " might form a congregation and from thence creep into the company ; second , an established church might fall into error ; third , an unsound minister might be chosen , who would debauch his flock by securing the admission of sectaries to the sacrament . Above all , a creed was necessary by means of which false doctrine might be instantly detected and condemned . Accordingly , one by one , as the need for vigilance increased , laws were passed to guard these points of danger . First , in 1635 it was enacted , Footnote : 1635-6 , March 3 . " Forasmuch as it hath bene found by sad experience , that much trouble and disturbance hath happened both to the church &; civill state by the officers &; members of some churches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... it is ... ordered that ... this Court doeth not , nor will hereafter , approue of any such companyes of men as shall henceforthe ioyne in any pretended way of church fellowshipp , without they shall first acquainte the magistrates , &; the elders of the greater parte of the churches in this jurisdiction , with their intenctions , and have their approbaction herein . And ffurther , it is ordered , that noe person , being a member of any churche which shall hereafter be gathered without the approbaction of the magistrates , &; the greater parte of the said churches , shallbe admitted to the ffreedome of this commonwealthe . " Footnote : Mass . Rec. i. 168 . In 1648 all the elders met in a synod at Cambridge ; they adopted the Westminster Confession of Faith and an elaborate " Platform of Church Discipline , " the last clause of which is as follows : " If any church ... shall grow schismatical , rending itself from the communion of other churches , or shall walk incorrigibly and obstinately in any corrupt way of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such case the magistrate , ... is to put forth his coercive power , as the matter shall require . " Footnote : Magnalia , bk. 5 , ch. xvii . Section 9 . In 1658 the General Court declared : " Whereas it is the duty of the Christian magistrate to take care the people be fed with wholesome &; sound doctrine , &; in this houre of temptation , ... it is therefore ordered , that henceforth no person shall ... preach to any company of people , whither in church society or not , or be ordeyned to the office of a teaching elder , where any two organnick churches , councill of state , or Generall Court shall declare theire dissatisfaction thereat , either in refference to doctrine or practize ... and in case of ordination ... timely notice thereof shall be given unto three or fower of the neighbouring organicke churches for theire approbation . " Footnote : Mass . Rec. iv . pt. 1 , p. 328 . And lastly , in 1679 , the building of meeting-houses was forbidden , without leave from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Mass . Rec. v. 213 . But legislation has never yet controlled the action of human thought . All experience shows that every age , and every western nation , produces men whose nature it is to follow the guidance of their reason in the face of every danger . To exterminate these is the task of religious persecution , for they can be silenced only by death . Thus is a dominant priesthood brought face to face with the alternative , of surrendering its power or of killing the heretic , and those bloody deeds that cast their sombre shadow across the history of the Puritan Commonwealth can not be seen in their true bearing unless the position of the clergy is vividly before the mind . Cromwell said that ministers were " helpers of , not lords over , God 's people , " Footnote : Cromwell to Dundass , letter cxlviii .

If the governor of Massachusetts and the leader of the emigration could thus describe his moral growth ,  --  a man of birth , education , and fortune , who had had wide experience of life , and was a lawyer by profession ,  --  the awe and terror felt by the mass of the communicants can be imagined . Jonathan Mitchel , one of the most famous of the earlier divines , thus describes his flock : " They were a gracious , savoury-spirited people , principled by Mr. Shepard , liking an humbling , mourning , heart-breaking ministry and spirit ; living in religion , praying men and women . " And " he would speak with such a transcendent majesty and liveliness , that the people ... would often shake under his dispensations , as if they had heard the sound of the trumpets from the burning mountain , and yet they would mourn to think , that they were going presently to be dismissed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a publick admonition was to be dispensed unto any one that had offended scandalously ... the hearers would be all drowned in tears , as if the admonition had been , as indeed he would with much artifice make it be directed unto them all ; but such would be the compassion , and yet the gravity , the majesty , the scriptural and awful pungency of these his dispensations , that the conscience of the offender himself , could make no resistance thereunto . " Footnote : Magnalia , bk. 4 , ch. iv . Sub-section 9 , 10 . Their arrogance was fed by the submission of the people , and they would not tolerate the slightest opposition even from their most devoted retainers . The Reforming Synod was held in 1679 . " When the report of a committee on ' the evils that had provoked the Lord ' came up for consideration , ' Mr. Wheelock declared that there was a cry of injustice in that magistrates and ministers were not rated ' ( taxed ) , ' which occasioned a very warm discourse . Mr. Stodder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with saying what was not true , and the deputy governor ' ( Danforth ) ' told him he deserved to be laid by the heels , etc .

' The next day ' the deputy owned his being in too great a heat , and desired the Lord to forgive it , and Mr. Stodder did something , though very little , by the deputy . ' " Footnote : Palfrey 's History of New England , in. 330 , note 2 . Extract from Journal of Rev. Peter Thacher . Wheelock was lucky in not having to smart more severely for his temerity , for the unfortunate Ursula Cole was sentenced to pay L5 Footnote : Five pounds was equivalent to a sum between one hundred and twenty-five and one hundred and fifty dollars now .

The daily services in the churches consumed so much time that they became a grievance with which the government was unable to cope . In 1633 the Court of Assistants , thinking " the keepeing of lectures att the ordinary howres nowe obserued in the forenoone , to be dyvers wayes preiudiciall to the common good , both in the losse of a whole day , &; bringing other charges &; troubles to the place where the lecture is kept , " ordered that they should not begin before one o'clock .

But to have the delights of the pulpit abridged was more than the divines could bear . They declared roundly that their privileges were invaded ; Footnote : Idem , i. 325. and the General Court had to give way . A few lines in Winthrop 's Journal give an idea of the tax this loquacity must have been upon the time of a poor and scattered people .

" Footnote : Winthrop , i. 304 . Common men could not have kept this hold upon the inhabitants of New England , but the clergy were learned , resolute , and able , and their strong but narrow minds burned with fanaticism and love of power ; with their beliefs and under their temptations persecution seemed to them not only their most potent weapon , but a duty they owed to Christ  --  and that duty they unflinchingly performed . John Cotton , the most gifted among them , taught it as a holy work : " But the good that is brought to princes and subjects by the due punishment of apostate seducers and idolaters and blasphemers is manifold . " First , it putteth away evill from the people and cutteth off a gangreene , which would spread to further ungodlinesse ....

Yea as these punishments are preventions of like wickednesse in some , so are they wholesome medicines , to heale such as are curable of these eviles .... " Fourthly , the punishments executed upon false prophets and seducing teachers , doe bring downe showers of God 's blessings upon the civill state .... " Fifthly , it is an honour to God 's Justice that such judgments are executed .... " Footnote : Bloody Tenent Washed , pp. 137 , 138 .

" Let the magistrates coercive power in matters of religion ( therefore ) be still asserted , seing he is one who is bound to God more than any other men to cherish his true religion ; ... and how wofull would the state of things soon be among us , if men might have liberty without controll to profess , or preach , or print , or publish what they list , tending to the seduction of others .

The special punishments for Antinomians , Baptists , Quakers , and other sectaries were fine and imprisonment , branding , whipping , mutilation , banishment , and hanging . Nor were the elders men to shrink from executing these laws with the same ferocious spirit in which they were enacted . Remonstrance and command were alike neglected . The Long Parliament warned them to beware ; Charles II . repeatedly ordered them to desist ; their trusted and dearest friend , Sir Richard Saltonstall , wrote from London to Cotton : " It doth not a little grieve my spirit to heare what sadd things are reported dayly of your tyranny and persecution in New England , as that you fyne , whip , and imprison men for their consciences , " Footnote : Hutch .

Like many another political leader , he was forced by his party into measures from which his judgment and his heart recoiled . He tells us how , on a question arising between him and Mr. Haynes , the elders " delivered their several reasons which all sorted to this conclusion , that strict discipline , both in criminal offences and in martial affairs , was more needful in plantations than in a settled state , as tending to the honor and safety of the gospel . Whereupon Mr. Winthrop acknowledged that he was convinced that he had failed in over much lenity and remissness , and would endeavor ( by God 's assistance ) to take a more strict course thereafter .

Footnote : Life and Letters of Winthrop , ii . 393 . Nothing could avail , for the clergy held the state within their grasp , and shrank from no deed of blood to guard the interests of their order . The case of Gorton may serve as an example of a rigor that shocked even the Presbyterian Baillie ; it must be said in explanation of his story that the magistrates condemned Gorton and his friends to death for the crime of heresy in obedience to the unanimous decision of the elders , Footnote : Winthrop , ii . 146. but the deputies refusing to concur , the sentence of imprisonment in irons during the pleasure of the General Court was agreed upon as a compromise . " Only they in New England are more strict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppress , by the power of the magistrate , all who are not of their way , to banishment ordinarily and presently even to death lately , or perpetual slavery ; for one Jortin , sometime a famous citizen here for piety , having taught a number in New England to cast oft the word and sacrament , and deny angels and devils , and teach a gross kind of union with Christ in this life , by force of arms was brought to New Boston , and there with ten of the chief of his followers , by the civil court was discerned perpetual slaves , but the votes of many were for their execution . They lie in irons , though gentlemen ; and out of their prison write to the admiral here , to deal with the parliament for their deliverance . " Footnote : Baillie 's Letters , ii . 17 , 18 . Like all phenomena of nature , the action of the mind is obedient to law ; the cause is followed by the consequence with the precision that the earth moves round the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrought out by man . To the ecclesiastic a deep debt of gratitude is due , for it was by his effort that the first step from barbarism was made . In the world 's childhood , knowledge seems divine , and those who first acquire its rudiments claim , and are believed , to have received it by revelation from the gods . In an archaic age the priest is likewise the law-giver and the physician , for all erudition is concentrated in one supremely favored class  --  the sacred caste . Their discoveries are kept profoundly secret , and yet to perpetuate their mysteries among their descendants they found schools which are the only repositories of learning ; but the time must inevitably come when this order is transformed into the deadliest enemy of the civilization which it has brought into being . The power of the spiritual oligarchy rests upon superstitious terrors which dwindle before advancing enlightenment ; hence the clergy have become reactionary , have sought to stifle the spirit of free inquiry , and have used the schools which they have builded as instruments to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This , then , has been the fiercest battle of mankind ; the heroic struggle to break down the sacerdotal barrier , to popularize knowledge , and to liberate the mind , began ages before the crucifixion upon Calvary ; it still goes on . In this cause the noblest and the bravest have poured forth their blood like water , and the path to freedom has been heaped with the corpses of her martyrs . In that tremendous drama Massachusetts has played her part ; it may be said to have made her intellectual life ; and it is the passion of the combat which gives an interest at once so sombre and so romantic to her story . In the tempest of the Reformation a handful of the sternest rebels were cast upon the bleak New England coast , and the fervor of that devotion which led them into the wilderness inspired them with the dream of reproducing the institutions of God 's chosen people , a picture of which they believed was divinely preserved for their guidance in the Bible . What they did in reality was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were a race in whose bone and blood the spirit of free thought was bred ; the impulse which had goaded them to reject the Roman dogmas was quick within them still , and revolt against the ecclesiastical yoke was certain . The clergy upon their side trod their appointed path with the precision of machines , and , constrained by an inexorable destiny , they took that position of antagonism to liberal thought which has become typical of their order . And the struggles and the agony by which this poor and isolated community freed itself from its gloomy bondage , the means by which it secularized its education and its government , won for itself the blessing of free thought and speech , and matured a system of constitutional liberty which has been the foundation of the American Union , rise in dignity to one of the supreme efforts of mankind . CHAPTER II . THE ANTINOMIANS . Habit may be defined with enough accuracy for ordinary purposes as the result of reflex action , or the immediate response of the nerves to a stimulus , without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and most movements may be made so by constant repetition ; they are then executed independently of the will . It is no exaggeration to say that the social fabric rests on the control this tendency exerts over the actions of men ; and its strength is strikingly exemplified in armies , which , when well organized , are machines , wherein subjection to command is instinctive , and insubordination , therefore , practically impossible . An analogous phenomenon is presented by the church , whose priests have intuitively exhausted their ingenuity in weaving webs of ceremonial , as soldiers have directed their energies to perfecting manuals of arms ; and the evidence leads to the conclusion that increasing complexity of ritual indicates a densening ignorance and a deepening despotism . The Hindoos , the Spaniards , and the English are types of the progression . Within the historic ages unnumbered methods of sacerdotal discipline have been evolved , but whether the means used to compass the end has been the bewildering maze of a Levitical code , or the rosary and the confessional of Rome , the object has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the trooper . And the stupendous power of these amazingly perfect systems for destroying the capacity for original thought can not be fully realized until the mind has been brought to dwell upon the fact that the greatest eras of human progress have begun with the advent of those who have led successful insurrection ; nor can the dazzling genius of these brilliant exceptions be appreciated , unless it be remembered how infinitely small has been the number of those among mankind who , having been once drilled to rigid conformity , have not lapsed into automatism , but have been endowed with the mental energy to revolt . On the other hand , though ecclesiastics have differed widely in the details of the training they have enforced upon the faithful , they have agreed upon this cardinal principle : they have uniformly seized upon the education of the young , and taught the child to revere the rites in which he was made to partake before he could reason upon their meaning , for they understood well that the habit of abject submission to authority , when firmly rooted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after years , and would almost invariably last till death . But this manual of religion , this deadening of the soul by making mechanical prayers and genuflexions the gauge of piety , has always roused the deepest indignation in the great reformers ; and , un-appalled by the most ghastly perils , they have never ceased to exhort mankind to cast off the slavery of custom and emancipate the mind . Christ rebuked the Pharisees because they rejected the commandment of God to keep their own tradition ; Paul proclaimed that men should be justified by faith without the deeds of the law ; and Luther preached that the Christian was free , that the soul did not live because the body wore vestments or prayed with the lips , and he denounced the tyranny of the clergy , who arrogated to themselves a higher position than others who were Christian in the spirit . On their side priesthoods know these leaders of rebellion by an unerring instinct and pursue them to the death . The ministers of New England were formalists to the core , and the society over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manifestation of godliness in the outward man . The sad countenance , the Biblical speech , the sombre garb , the austere life , the attendance at worship , and , above all , the unfailing deference paid to themselves , were the marks of sanctification by which the elders knew the saints on earth , for whom they were to open the path to fortune by making them members of the church . Happily for Massachusetts , there has never been a time when all her children could be docile under such a rule ; and , among her champions of freedom , none have been braver than those who have sprung from the ranks of her ministry , as the fate of Roger Williams had already proved . In such a community , before the ecclesiastical power had been solidified by time , only a spark was needed to kindle a conflagration , and that spark was struck by a woman . So early as 1634 a restless spirit was abroad , for Winthrop was then set aside , and now , in 1636 , young Henry Vane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and had been but a few months in the colony . The future seemed bright and serene , yet he had hardly taken office before the storm burst , which not only overthrew him , but was destined to destroy that unhappy lady whom the Rev. Thomas Welde called the American Jezebel . Footnote : Opinions are divided as to the authorship of the Short Story , but I conclude from internal evidence that the ending at least was written by Mr. Welde . John Cotton , the former rector of St. Botolph 's , was the teacher of the Boston church . By common consent the leader of the clergy , he was the most brilliant , and , in some respects , the most powerful man in the colony . Two years before , Anne Hutchinson , with all her family , had followed him from her home in Lincolnshire into the wilderness , for , " when our teacher came to New England , it was a great trouble unto me , my brother , Wheelwright , being put by also . " Footnote : Hutch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a kind and charitable heart , a vigorous understanding and dauntless courage , her failings were vanity and a bitter tongue toward those whom she disliked . Footnote : Cotton , Way of New England Churches , p. 52 . Unfortunately also for herself , she was one of the enthusiasts who believe themselves subject to divine revelations , for this pretension would probably in any event have brought upon her the displeasure of the church . It is worth while to attempt some logical explanation of the dislike felt by the Massachusetts elders to any suggestion of such supernatural interposition . The half-unconscious train of reasoning on which they based their claim to exact implicit obedience from the people seems , when analyzed , to yield this syllogism : All revelation is contained in the Bible ; but to interpret the ancient sacred writings with authority , a technical training is essential , which is confined to priests ; therefore no one can define God 's will who is not of the ministry . Had the possibility of direct revelation been admitted this reasoning must have fallen ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peasant would have outweighed the sermon of an uninspired divine ; it follows , necessarily , that ecclesiastics so situated would have been jealous of lay preaching , and absolutely intolerant of the inner light . In May , 1636 , the month of Vane 's election , Mrs. Hutchinson had been joined by her brother-in-law , John Wheelwright , the deprived vicar of Bilsby . Her social influence was then at its height ; her amiable disposition had made her popular , and for some time past she had held religious meetings for women at her house . The ostensible object of these gatherings was to recapitulate the sermons of the week ; but the step from discussion to criticism was short , and it soon began to be said that she cast reproach " upon the ministers , ... saying that none of them did preach the covenant of free grace , but Master Cotton , and that they have not the seale of the Spirit , and so were not able ministers of the New Testament . " Footnote : Short Story , p. 36 . Or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being teachers of forms , and said that , of them all , Cotton alone appealed to the animating spirit like Luther or St. Paul . " A company of legall professors , " quoth she , " lie poring on the law which Christ hath abolished . " Footnote : Wonder-Working Providence , Poole 's ed. p. 102 . Such freedom of speech was , of course , intolerable ; and so , as Cotton was implicated by her imprudent talk , the elders went to Boston in a body in October to take him to task . In the hope of adjusting the difficulty , he suggested a friendly meeting at his house , and an interview took place . At first Mrs. Hutchinson , with much prudence , declined to commit herself ; but the Rev. Hugh Peters besought her so earnestly to deal frankly and openly with them that she , confiding in the sacred character of a confidential conversation with clergymen in the house of her own religious teacher , committed the fatal error of admitting that she saw a wide difference between Mr. Cotton 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a covenant of grace so clearly as he , because they had not the seal of the Spirit . The progress of the new opinion was rapid , and it is clear Mrs. Hutchinson had only given expression to a feeling of discontent which was both wide-spread and deep . Before winter her adherents , or those who condemned the covenant of works ,  --  in modern language , the liberals ,  --  had become an organized political party , of which Vane was the leader ; and here lay their first danger . Notwithstanding his eminent ability , he was then but a boy , and the task was beyond his strength . The stronghold of his party was Boston , where , except some half-dozen , Footnote : Winthrop , i. 212. the whole congregation followed him and Cotton : yet even here he met with the powerful opposition of Winthrop and the pastor , John Wilson . In the country he was confronted by the solid body of the clergy , whose influence proved sufficient to hold together a majority of the voters in substantially all the towns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislature . The position was harassing , and his nerves gave way under the strain . In December he called a court and one day suddenly announced that he had received letters from England requiring his immediate return ; but when some of his friends remonstrated he " brake forth into tears and professed that , howsoever the causes propounded for his departure were such as did concern the utter ruin of his outward estate , yet he would rather have hazarded all " ... " but for the danger he saw of God 's judgment to come upon us for these differences and dissensions which he saw amongst us , and the scandalous imputations brought upon himself , as if he should be the cause of all . " Footnote : Winthrop , i. 207 . Such a flight was out of the question . The weight of his name and the protection given his supporters by the power of his family in England could not be dispensed with , and therefore the Boston congregation intervened . After a day 's reflection he seems himself to have become convinced that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " expressed himself to be an obedient child to the church and therefore ... durst not go away . " Footnote : Idem , i. 208 . That a young and untried man like Vane should have grown weary of his office and longed to escape will astonish no one who is familiar with the character and the mode of warfare of his adversaries . In that society a layman could not retort upon a minister who insulted him , nor could Vane employ the arguments with which Cromwell so effectually silenced the Scotch divines . The following is a specimen of the treatment to which he was probably almost daily subjected , and the scene in this instance was the more mortifying because it took place before the assembled legislature . " The ministers had met a little before and had drawn into heads all the points wherein they suspected Mr. Cotton did differ from them , and had propounded them to him , and pressed him to a direct answer ... to every one ; which he had promised . ... This meeting being spoke of in the court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , as being without his privity , &c.,; which this day Mr. Peter told him as plainly of ( with all due reverence ) , and how it had sadded the ministers ' spirits , that he should be jealous of their meetings , or seem to restrain their liberty , &c.; The governour excused his speech as sudden and upon a mistake . Mr. Peter told him also , that before he came , within less than two years since , the churches were in peace .... Mr. Peter also besought him humbly to consider his youth and short experience in the things of God , and to beware of peremptory conclusions which he perceived him to be very apt unto . " Footnote : Winthrop , i. 209 . This coarse bully was the same Hugh Peters of whom Whitelock afterward complained that he often advised him , though he " understood little of the law , but was very opinionative , " Footnote : Memorials , p. 521. and who was so terrified at the approach of death that on his way to the scaffold he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burnet , i. 162 . " Mr. Wilson " also " made a very sad speech to the General Court of the condition of our churches , and the inevitable danger of separation , if these differences ... were not speedily remedied , and laid the blame upon these new opinions ... which all the magistrates except the governour and two others did confirm and all the ministers but two . " Footnote : Winthrop , i. 209 . Those two were John Cotton and John Wheelwright , the preachers of the covenant of grace . Their brethren might well make sad speeches , for their cup of bitterness was full ; but they must be left to describe for themselves the tempest of fear and wrath that raged within them . " Yea , some that had beene begotten to Christ by some of their faithfull labours in this land " ( England , where the tract was published , ) " for whom they could have laid downe their lives , and not being able to beare their absence followed after them thither to New England to enjoy their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were suddenly so altered in their affections toward those their spirituall fathers , that they would neither heare them , nor willingly come in their company , professing they had never received any good from them . " ... " Now the faithfull ministers of Christ must have dung cast on their faces ... must be pointed at as it were with the finger , and reproached by name , such a church officer is an ignorant man , and knows not Christ ; such an one is under a covenant of works : such a pastor is a proud man , and would make a good persecutor ... so that through these reproaches occasion was given to men , to abhorre the offerings of the Lord . " Footnote : Welde 's Short Story , Pref . Sections 7-11 . " Now , one of them in a solemne convention of ministers dared to say to their faces , that they did not preach the Covenant of Free Grace , and that they themselves had not the seale of the Spirit .... Now , after our sermons were ended at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen pistols discharged at the face of the preacher ( I meane ) so many objections made by the opinionists in the open assembly against our doctrine ... to the marvellous weakening of holy truths delivered ... in the hearts of all the weaker sort . " Footnote : Welde 's Short Story , Pref . Sections 7-11 . John Wheelwright was a man whose character extorts our admiration , if it does not win our love . The personal friend of Cromwell and of Vane , with a mind vigorous and masculine , and a courage stern and determined even above the Puritan standard of resolution and of daring , he spoke the truth which was within him , and could neither be intimidated nor cajoled . In October an attempt had been made to have him settled as a teacher of the Boston church in conjunction with Wilson and Cotton , but it had miscarried through Winthrop 's opposition , and he had afterward taken charge of a congregation that had been gathered at Mount Wollaston , in what is now Quincy . On the 19th of January a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on that day Wheelwright preached a great sermon in Boston which brought on the crisis . He was afterward accused of sedition : the charge was false , for he did not utter one seditious word ; but he did that which was harder to forgive , he struck at what he deemed the wrong with his whole might , and those who will patiently pore over his pages until they see the fire glowing through his rugged sentences will feel the power of his blow . And what he told his hearers was in substance this : It maketh no matter how seemingly holy men be according to the law , if ... they are such as trust to their own righteousness they shall die , saith the Lord . Do ye not after their works ; for they say and do not . They make broad their phylacteries and enlarge the borders of their garments ; and love the uppermost rooms at feasts , and the chief seats in the synagogues ; and greetings in the market place and to be called of men , Rabbi , Rabbi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ye shall be saved , for being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ . And the way we must take if so be we will not have the Lord Jesus Christ taken from us is this , we must all prepare a spiritual combat , we must put on the whole armor of God , and must have our loins girt up and be ready to fight , ... because of fear in the night if we will not fight the Lord Jesus Christ may come to be surprised . And when his brethren heard it they sought how they might destroy him ; for they feared him , because all the people were astonished at his doctrine . In March the legislature met , and Wheelwright was arraigned before a court composed , according to the account of the Quaker Groom , of Henry Vane , " twelve magistrates , twelve priests , &; thirty-three deputies . " Footnote : Groom 's Glass for New England , p. 6 . His sermon was produced , and an attempt was made to obtain an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant his brethren . But the accused was one whom it was hard to entrap and impossible to frighten . He defied his judges to controvert his doctrine , offering to prove it by the Scriptures , and as for the application he answered that " if he were shown any that walked in such a way as he had described to be a covenant of works , them did he mean . " Footnote : Wheelwright , Prince Soc. ed. p. 17 , note 27 . Then the rest of the elders were asked if they " did walk in such a way , and they all acknowledged they did , " Footnote : Winthrop , i. 215 . Wheelwright , p. 18. excepting John Cotton , who declared that " brother Wheelwright 's doctrine was according to God in the parts controverted , and wholly and altogether . " Footnote : Groom 's Glass for New England , p. 7 . He received ecclesiastical justice . There was no jury , and the popular assembly that decided law and fact by a partisan vote was controlled by his adversaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a flagrant outrage that the clergy found it impossible to command prompt obedience . For two days the issue was in doubt , but at length " the priests got two of the magistrates on their side , and so got the major part with them . " Footnote : Felt 's Eccl . Hist. ii . 611 . They appear , however , to have felt too weak to proceed to sentence , for the prisoner was remanded until the next session . No sooner was the judgment made known than more than sixty of the most respected citizens of Boston signed a petition to the court in Wheelwright 's behalf , In respectful and even submissive language they pointed out the danger of meddling with the right of free speech . " Paul was counted a pestilent fellow , or a moover of sedition , and a ringleader of a sect , ... and Christ himselfe , as well as Paul , was charged to bee a teacher of New Doctrine .... Now wee beseech you , consider whether that old serpent work not after his old method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Prince Soc. ed. p. 21 . The charge of sedition made against them they repudiated in emphatic words , which deserve attention , as they were afterwards held to be criminal . " Thirdly , if you look at the effects of his doctrine upon the hearers , it hath not stirred up sedition in us , not so much as by accident ; wee have not drawn the sword , as sometimes Peter did , rashly , neither have wee rescued our innocent brother , as sometimes the Israelites did Jonathan , and yet they did not seditiously . The covenant of free grace held forth by our brother hath taught us rather to become humble suppliants to your worships , and if wee should not prevaile , wee would rather with patience give our cheekes to the smiters . " Footnote : Idem . The liberal feeling ran so strongly in Boston that the conservatives thought it prudent to remove the government temporarily to Cambridge , that they might more easily control the election which was to come in May . Vane , with some petulance , refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it was carried . As the time drew near the excitement increased , the clergy straining every nerve to bring up their voters from the country ; and on the morning of the day the feeling was so intense that the Rev. Mr. Wilson , forgetting his dignity and his age , scrambled up a tree and harangued the people from its branches . Footnote : Hutch . Hist. i. 62 , note . Yet , though the freemen were so deeply moved , there was no violence , and Winthrop was peaceably elected governor , with a strong conservative majority in the legislature . It so happened that just at this time a number of the friends of Wheelwright and the Hutchinsons were on their way from England to settle in Massachusetts . The first act of the new government was to exclude these new-comers by passing a law forbidding any town to entertain strangers for more than three weeks without the consent of two of the magistrates . This oppressive statute caused such discontent that Winthrop thought it necessary to publish a defence , to which Vane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have lost its interest had it not been for the theory then first advanced by Winthrop , that the corporation of Massachusetts , having bought its land , held it as though it were a private estate , and might exclude whom they pleased therefrom ; and ever since this plea has been set up in justification of every excess committed by the theocracy . Winthrop was a lawyer , and it is but justice to his reputation to presume that he spoke as a partisan , knowing his argument to be fallacious . As a legal proposition he must have been aware that it was unsound . Although during the reign of Charles I. monopolies were a standing grievance with the House of Commons , yet they had been granted and enforced for centuries ; and had Massachusetts claimed the right to exclude strangers as interlopers in trade , she would have stood upon good precedent . Such , however , was not her contention .

Such arguments as those advanced by Winthrop were only solemn quibbling to cloak an indefensible policy . To banish freemen for demanding liberty of conscience was a still more flagrant wrong . A precisely parallel case would have been presented had the directors of the East India Company declared the membership of a proprietor to be forfeited , and ordered his stock to be sold , because he disapproved of enforcing conformity in worship among inhabitants of the factories in Hindostan . Vane sailed early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the way of vengeance . Proceedings were at once begun by a synod of all the ministers , which was held at Cambridge , for the purpose of restoring peace to the churches .

Some of the church of Boston ... were offended at the producing of so many errors , ... and called to have the persons named which held those errors . " To which the elders answered that all those opinions could be proved to be held by some , but it was not thought fit to name the parties . " Yet this would not satisfy some but they oft called for witnesses ; and because some of the magistrates declared to them ... that if they would not forbear it would prove a civil disturbance ... they objected .... So as he " ( probably meaning Winthrop ) " was forced to tell one of them that if he would not forbear ... he might see it executed . Upon this some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Mr. Hubbard of Ipswich describes with unconscious cynicism . " If he were not convinced , yet he was persuaded to an amicable compliance with the other ministers ; ... for , although it was thought he did still retain his own sense and enjoy his own apprehension in all or most of the things then controverted ( as is manifest by some expressions of his ... since that time published , " ... ) yet .

" Footnote : Hypocrisie Unmasked , p. 76 . Nor to the end of his life did he feel quite at ease ; " yea , such was his ingenuity and piety as that his soul was not satisfied without often breaking forth into affectionate bewailing of his infirmity herein , in the publick assembly , sometimes in his prayer , sometimes in his sermon , and that with tears . " Footnote : Norton 's Funeral Sermon , p. 37 . Wheelwright was made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , the difference of dogma , if any existed , was trivial . The clergy used the cry of heresy to excite odium , just as they called their opponents Antinomians , or dangerous fanatics . To support these accusations the synod gravely accepted every unsavory inference which ingenuity could wring from the tenets of their adversaries ; and these , together with the fables invented by idle gossip , made up the long list of errors they condemned . Though the scheme was unprincipled , it met with complete success , and the Antinomians have come down to posterity branded as deadly enemies of Christ and the commonwealth ; yet nothing is more certain than that they were not only good citizens , but substantially orthodox . On such a point there is no one among the conservatives whose testimony has the weight of Winthrop 's , who says : " Mr. Cotton ... stated the differences in a very narrow scantling ; and Mr. Shepherd , preaching at the day of election , brought them yet nearer , so as , except men of good understanding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of the other party , few could see where the difference was .

While Cotton himself complains bitterly of the falsehoods spread about him and his friends : " But when some of ... the elders of neighbour churches advertised me of the evill report ...

Both shee and they utterly denyed that they held such tenents , or that they had fathered them upon mee . I returned their answer to the elders .... They answered me they had but one witnesse , ... and that one both to be known . " ... Footnote : Cotton , Way of New England Churches , pp. 39 , 40 .

The session opened on November 2 , and Wheelwright was summoned to appear . He was ordered to submit , or prepare for sentence . He replied that he was guilty of neither sedition nor contempt ; that he had preached only the truth of Christ , the application of which was for others , not for him . " To which it was answered by the court that they had not censured his doctrine , but left it as it was ; but his application , by which hee laid the magistrates and ministers and most of the people of God in these churches under a covenant of works . " Footnote : Short Story , p. 24 . The prisoner was then sentenced to be disfranchised and banished .

" Footnote : Wheelwright , Prince Soc. ed . Mercurius Americanus , p. 24 . Nor was banishment by any means the trivial penalty it has been described . On the contrary , it was a punishment of the utmost rigor . The exiles were forced suddenly to dispose of their property , which , in those times , was mostly in houses and land , and go forth among the savages with helpless women and children . Such an ordeal might well appall even a brave man ; but Wheelwright was sacrificing his intellectual life . He was leaving books , friends , and the mental activity , which made the world to him , to settle in the forests among backwoodsmen ; and yet even in this desolate solitude the theocracy continued to pursue him with persevering hate . But there were others beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be devised by which to reach them . The names of most of his friends were upon the petition that had been drawn up after his trial . It is true it was a proceeding with which the existing legislature was not concerned , since it had been presented to one of its predecessors ; it is also true that probably never , before or since , have men who have protested they have not drawn the sword rashly , but have come as humble suppliants to offer their cheeks to the smiters , been held to be public enemies . Such scruples , however , never hampered the theocracy . Their justice was trammelled neither by judges , by juries , nor by laws ; the petition was declared to be a seditious libel , and the petitioners were given their choice of disavowing their act and making humble submission , or exile . Aspinwall was at once disfranchised and banished . Footnote : Mass . Rec. i. 207 .

Footnote : Idem , i. 223 . Thus were the early liberals crushed in Massachusetts ; the bold were exiled , the timid were terrified ; as a political organization they moved no more till the theocracy was tottering to its fall ; and for forty years the power of the clergy was absolute in the land . The fate of Anne Hutchinson makes a fit ending to this sad tale of oppression and of wrong . In November , 1637 , when her friends were crushed , and the triumphant priests felt that their victim 's doom was sure , she was brought to trial before that ghastliest den of human iniquity , an ecclesiastical criminal court . The ministers were her accusers , who came burning with hate to testify to the words she had spoken to them at their own request , in the belief that the confidence she reposed was to be held sacred . She had no jury to whose manhood she could appeal , and John Winthrop , to his lasting shame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was soon to become a mother , and her health was feeble , but she was made to stand till she was exhausted ; and yet , abandoned and forlorn , before those merciless judges , through two long , weary days of hunger and of cold , the intrepid woman defended her cause with a skill and courage which even now , after two hundred and fifty years , kindles the heart with admiration . The case for the government was opened by John Winthrop , the presiding justice , the attorney-general , the foreman of the jury , and the chief magistrate of Massachusetts Bay . He upbraided the prisoner with her many evil courses , with having spoken things prejudicial to the honor of the ministers , with holding an assembly in her house , and with divulging the opinions held by those who had been censured by that court ; closing in these words , which sound strangely in the mouth of a New England judge :  --  * * * * * We have thought good to send for you ... that if you be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you may become a profitable member here among us , otherwise if you be obstinate ... that then the court may take such course that you may trouble us no further , therefore I would entreat you ... whether you do not justify Mr. Wheelwright 's sermon and the petition .

Gov . I would go a little higher with Mrs. Hutchinson .

No , sir , one may preach a covenant of grace more clearly than another , so I said . * * * * * Dudley was faring worse than Winthrop , and the divines , who had been bursting with impatience , could hold no longer . The Rev. Hugh Peters broke in : " That which concerns us to speak unto , as yet we are sparing in , unless the court command us to speak , then we shall answer to Mrs. Hutchinson , notwithstanding our brethren are very unwilling to answer . " And without further urging , that meek servant of Christ went on to tell how he and others had heard that the prisoner said they taught a covenant of works , how they had sent for her , and though she was " very tender " at first , yet upon being begged to speak plainly , she had explained that there " was a broad difference between our Brother Mr. Cotton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She answered ' that he preaches the covenant of grace and you the covenant of works , and that you are not able ministers of the New Testament , and know no more than the apostles did before the resurrection .

An adjournment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to have considered his case against his prisoner as closed . In the morning Mrs. Hutchinson opened her defence by calling three witnesses , Leverett , Coggeshall , and John Cotton . * * * * * Gov . Mr. Coggeshall was not present . Mr. C. Yes , but I was , only I desired to be silent till I should be called . Gov . Will you ... say that she did not say so ? Mr. C. Yes , I dare say that she did not say all that which they lay against her . Mr. Peters . How dare you look into the court to say such a word ? Mr. C. Mr. Peters takes upon him to forbid me . I shall be silent .... Gov . Well , Mr. Leverett , what were the words ? I pray speak . Mr. L. To my best remembrance ... Mr. Peters did with much vehemency and entreaty urge her to tell what difference there was between Mr. Cotton and them , and upon his urging of her she said : " The fear of man is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be safe . " And ... that they did not preach a covenant of grace so clearly as Mr. Cotton did , and she gave this reason of it , because that as the apostles were for a time without the Spirit so until they had received the witness of the Spirit they could not preach a covenant of grace so clearly . * * * * * The Rev. John Cotton was then called . He was much embarrassed in giving his evidence , but , if he is to be believed , his brethren , in their anxiety to make out a case , had colored material facts . He closed his account of the interview in these words : " I must say that I did not find her saying they were under a covenant of works , nor that she said they did preach a covenant of works . " * * * * * Gov . You say you do not remember , but can you say she did not speak so ? Mr. C. I do remember that she looked at them as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affirm that Mrs. Hutchinson did say they were not able ministers of the New Testament . Mr. C. I do not remember it . * * * * * Mrs. Hutchinson had shattered the case of the government in a style worthy of a leader of the bar , but she now ventured on a step for which she has been generally condemned . She herself approached the subject of her revelations . To criticise the introduction of evidence is always simpler than to conduct a cause , but an analysis of her position tends to show not only that her course was the result of mature reflection , but that her judgment was in this instance correct . She probably assumed that when the more easily proved charges had broken down she would be attacked here ; and in this assumption she was undoubtedly right . The alternative presented to her , therefore , was to go on herself , or wait for Winthrop to move . If she waited she knew she should give the government the advantage of choosing the ground , and she would thus be subjected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by hearsay or distorted evidence . If she took the bolder course , she could explain her revelations as monitions coming to her through texts in Scripture , and here she was certain of Cotton 's support . Before that tribunal she could hardly have hoped for an acquittal ; but if anything could have saved her it would have been the sanction given to her doctrines by the approval of John Cotton . At all events , she saw the danger , for she closed her little speech in these touching words : " Now if you do condemn me for speaking what in my conscience I know to be truth , I must commit myself unto the Lord . " Mr. Nowell . How do you know that that was the Spirit ? Mrs. H. How did Abraham know that it was God ? ... Dep . Gov . By an immediate voice . Mrs. H. So to me by an immediate revelation . * * * * * Then she proceeded to state how , through various texts which she cited , the Lord showed her what He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daniel . So far all was well ; she had planted herself on ground upon which orthodox opinion was at least divided ; but she now committed the one grave error of her long and able defence . As she went on her excitement gained upon her , and she ended by something like a defiance and denunciation : " You have power over my body , but the Lord Jesus hath power over my body and soul ; and assure yourselves thus much , you do as much as in you lies to put the Lord Jesus Christ from you , and if you go on in this course you begin , you will bring a curse upon you and your posterity , and the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it . " * * * * * Gov . Daniel was delivered by miracle . Do you think to be delivered so too ? Mrs. H. I do here speak it before the court . I look that the Lord should deliver me by his providence .... Dep . Gov . I desire Mr. Cotton to tell us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she hath laid them down . Mr. C. I know not whether I do understand her , but this I say , if she doth expect a deliverance in a way of providence , then I can not deny it . Gov . ... I see a marvellous providence of God to bring things to this pass .... God by a providence hath answered our desires , and made her to lay open herself and the ground of all these disturbances to be by revelations . . . . Court . We all consent with you . Gov . Ey , it is the most desperate enthusiasm in the world .... Mr. Endicott . I speak in reference to Mr. Cotton .... Whether do you witness for her or against her . Mr. C. This is that I said , sir , and my answer is plain , that if she doth look for deliverance from the hand of God by his providence , and the revelation be ... according to a word of Scripture that I can not deny . Mr. Endicott . You give me satisfaction . Dep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all .... Mr. C. I pray , sir , give me leave to express myself . In that sense that she speaks I dare not bear witness against it . Mr. Nowell . I think it is a devilish delusion . Gov . Of all the revelations that ever I read of I never read the like ground laid as is for this . The enthusiasts and Anabaptists had never the like .... Mr. Peters . I can say the same ... and I think that is very disputable which our brother Cotton hath spoken .... Gov . I am persuaded that the revelation she brings forth is delusion . All the court but some two or three ministers cry out , We all believe it , we all believe it .... * * * * * And then Coddington stood up before that angry meeting like the brave man he was , and said , " I beseech you do not speak so to force things along , for I do not for my own part see any equity in the court in all your proceedings . Here is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any law of the country that she hath broke , and therefore deserves no censure ; and if she say that the elders preach as the apostles did , why they preached a covenant of grace and what wrong is that to them , ... therefore I pray consider , what you do , for here is no law of God or man broken . " * * * * * Mr. Peters . I profess I thought Mr. Cotton would never have took her part . Gov . The court hath already declared themselves satisfied ... concerning the troublesomeness of her spirit and the danger of her course amongst us which is not to be suffered . Therefore if it be the mind of the court that Mrs. Hutchinson ... shall be banished out of our liberties and imprisoned till she be sent away let them hold up their hands . All but three consented . Those contrary minded hold up yours . Mr. Coddington and Colburn only . Gov .

With the ruin of the Antinomians , opposition to the clergy ceased within the church itself , but many causes combined to prevent the bulk of the people from participating in the communion .

It was no light matter for a pious but a sincerely honest man to profess his conversion , and how God had been pleased to work " in the inward parts of his soul , " when he was not absolutely certain that he had indeed been visited by the Spirit . And it is no exaggeration to say that to sensitive natures the initiation was appalling . The applicant had first to convince the minister of his worthiness , then his name was openly propounded , and those who knew of any objection to his character , either moral or religious , were asked to give notice to the presbytery of elders . If the candidate succeeded in passing this private examination as to his fitness the following scene took place in church :  --  " The party appearing in the midst of the assembly ... the ruling elder speaketh in this manner : Brethren of this congregation , this man or woman ... hath beene heretofore propounded to you , desiring to enter into church fellowship with us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of you to the contrary of the parties admittance but that we may goe on to receive him : therefore now , if any of you know anything against him , why he may not be admitted , you may yet speak ....

Footnote : Winthrop , ii . 222 , 223 . Winthrop happened to be deputy governor that year , and the aggrieved officer applied to him for protection ; whereupon , as the defendants seemed inclined to be recalcitrant , several were committed in open court , among whom were three of Mr. Hubbert 's brothers .

Unluckily for Mr. Hubbert he had taken the popular side in this dispute and had thus been sundered from his brethren , who sustained Winthrop , and in the end carried him through in triumph ; and not only this , but he was suspected of Presbyterian tendencies , and a committee of the elders who had visited Hingham to reconcile some differences in the congregation had found him in grave fault . The government was not sorry , therefore , to make him a public example , as appeared not only by these proceedings , but by the way he was treated in the General Court the next autumn . He was accordingly indicted for sedition , tried and convicted in June , fined twenty pounds , and bound over to good behavior in forty pounds more . Footnote : New Eng .

William Vassal had been an original patentee and was a member of the first Board of Assistants , who were appointed by the king . Being , however , a man of liberal views he had not found Massachusetts congenial ; he had returned to England after a stay of only a month , and when he came again to America in 1635 , he had settled at Scituate , the town adjoining Hingham , but in the Plymouth jurisdiction . Having both wealth and social position he possessed great influence , and he now determined to lead an agitation for equal rights and liberty of conscience in both colonies at once , by petitioning the legislatures , and in case of failure there , presenting similar petitions to Parliament . Bradford was this year Footnote : 1645. governor of Plymouth , and Edward Winslow was an assistant . Winslow himself had been governor repeatedly , was a thorough-going churchman , and deep in all the councils of the conservative party . There was , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the complexion of its politics was therefore far more liberal than in Massachusetts ; so Vassal was able to command a strong support when he brought forward his proposition . Winslow , writing to his friend Winthrop at Boston , gives an amusing account of his own and Bradford 's consternation , and the expedients to which they were forced to resort in the legislature to stave off a vote upon the petition , when Vassal made his motion in October , 1645 . " After this , the first excepter Vassal having been observed to tender the view of a scroule from man to man , it came at length to be tendered to myself , and withall , said he , it may be you will not like this .

Samuel Maverick is a bright patch of color on the sad Puritan background . He had a dwelling at Winnisime , that " in the yeare 1625 I fortified with a pillizado and fflankers and gunnes both belowe and above in them which awed the Indians who at that time had a mind to cutt off the English .

When Winthrop landed , he found him keeping open house , so kindly and freehanded that even the grim Johnson relaxes when he speaks of him : " a man of very loving and curteous behaviour , very ready to entertaine strangers , yet an enemy to the reformation in hand , being strong for the lordly prelatical power .

" He was charitable also , and Winthrop relates how , when the Indians were dying of the smallpox , he , " his wife and servants , went daily to them , ministered to their necessities , and buried their dead , and took home many of their children .

Though he had been admitted a freeman in the early days , he was excluded from all offices of importance ; he was taxed to support a church of which he disapproved , yet was forced to attend , though it would not baptize his children ; and he was so suspected that , in March , 1635 , he had been ordered to remove to Boston , and was forbidden to lodge strangers for more than one night without leave from a magistrate . Under such circumstances he could not but sympathize with Vassal in his effort to win for all men equal rights before the law .

This petition was presented to the court on May 19 , 1646 ; but the session was near its close , and it was thought best to take no immediate steps . The elders , however , became satisfied that the moment had come for a thorough organization of the church , and they therefore caused the legislature to issue a general invitation to all the congregations to send representatives to a synod to be held at Cambridge . But notwithstanding the inaction of the authorities , the clergy were perfectly aware of the danger , and they passed the summer in creating the necessary indignation among the voters : they bitterly denounced from their pulpits " the sons of Belial , Judasses , sons of Corah , " " with sundry appellations of that nature ... which seemed not to arise from a gospel spirit .

Winthrop had been chosen governor in May , and , when the legislature met in October , he was made chairman of a committee to draft an answer to Childe . This document may be found in Hutchinson 's Collection . As a state paper devoted to the discussion of questions of constitutional law it has little merit , but it may have been effective as a party manifesto . A short adjournment followed till November , when , on reassembling , the elders were asked for their advice upon this absorbing topic . " Mr. Hubbard of Hingham came with the rest , but the court being informed that he had an hand in a petition , which Mr. Vassall carried into England against the country in general , the governour propounded , that if any elder present had any such hand , &c.,; he would withdraw himself .

" Footnote : Winthrop , ii . 278 . The ministers who remained then proceeded to define the relations of Massachusetts toward England , and the position they assumed was very simple . " I. We depend upon the state of England for protection and immunities of Englishmen .... II . We conceive ... we have granted by patent such full and ample power ... of making all laws and rules of our obedience , and of a full and final determination of all cases in the administration of justice , that no appeals or other ways of interrupting our proceedings do lie against us .

In other words , they were to enjoy the privileges and safeguards of British subjects without yielding obedience to British law . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; under despotisms it is repression . In Massachusetts energetic steps were promptly taken to punish the ring-leaders in what the court now declared to be a conspiracy . The petitioners were summoned , and on being questioned refused to answer until some charge was made . A hot altercation followed , which ended in the defendants tendering an appeal , which was refused ; and they were committed for trial . Footnote : Winthrop , ii . 285 . A species of indictment was then prepared in which they were charged with publishing seditious libels against the Church of Christ and the civil government . The gravamen of the offence was the attempt to persuade the people " that the liberties and privileges in our charter belong to all freeborn Englishmen inhabitants here , whereas they are granted only to such as the governour and company shall think fit to receive into that fellowship . " Footnote : Idem . The appeal was held criminal because a denial of the jurisdiction of the government . The trial resembled Wheelwright 's . Like him the defendants refused to make submission , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " that is to say , they maintained the right of petition and the legality of their course . They were therefore fined : Childe L50 ; Smith L40 ; Maverick , because he had not yet appealed , L10 ; and the others L30 each ; three magistrates dissented . Childe at once began hasty preparations to sail . To prevent him Winthrop called the assistants together , without , however , giving the dissenting magistrates notice , and arranged to have him arrested and searched . One striking characteristic of the theocracy was its love for inflicting mental suffering upon its victims . The same malicious vindictiveness which sent Morton to sea in sight of his blazing home , and which imprisoned Anne Hutchinson in the house of her bitterest enemy , now suggested a scheme for making Childe endure the pangs of disappointment , by allowing him to embark , and then seizing him as the ship was setting sail . And though the plan miscarried , and the arrest had to be made the night before , yet even as it was the prisoner took his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " Footnote : Winthrop , ii . 294 . Nothing criminating was found in his possession , but in Dand 's study , which was ransacked , copies of two petitions were discovered , with a number of queries relating to certain legal aspects of the charter , and intended to be submitted to the Commissioners for the Plantations at London . These petitions were substantially those already presented , except that , by way of preamble , the story of the trial was told ; and how the ministers " did revile them , &c.,; as far as the wit or malice of man could , and that they meddled in civil affaires beyond their calling , and were masters rather than ministers , and ofttimes judges , and that they had stirred up the magistrates against them , and that a day of humiliation was appointed , wherein they were to pray against them . " Footnote : Winthrop , ii . 293 . Such words had never been heard in Massachusetts . The saints were aghast . Winthrop speaks of the offence as " being in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gracious goodness alone quelled this malice against his people . Of course no mercy was shown . It is true that the writings were lawful petitions by English subjects to Parliament ; that , moreover , they had never been published , but were found in a private room by means of a despotic search . Several of the signers were imprisoned for six months and then were punished in May :  --  Doctor Childe , ( imprisonment till paid , ) L200 John Smith , " " " 100 John Dand , " " " 200 Tho .

" Footnote : Winthrop , ii . 294 . But though the government could oppress the men , they could not make their principles unpopular , and the next December after Vassal and his friends had left the colony , the orthodox Samuel Symonds of Ipswich wrote mournfully to Winthrop : " I am informed that coppies of the petition are spreading here , and divers ( specially young men and women ) are taken with it , and are apt to wonder why such men should be troubled that speake as they doe : not being able suddenly to discerne the poyson in the sweet wine , nor the fire wrapped up in the straw . " Footnote : Felt 's Eccl . Hist. i. 593 . The petitioners , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent to London as agent , and in 1648 he was able to write that their " hopes and endeavours ... had been blasted by the special providence of the Lord who still wrought for us . " And Winthrop piously adds : " As for those who went over to procure us trouble , God met with them all . Mr. Vassall , finding no entertainment for his petitions , went to Barbadoes , " Footnote : Winthrop , ii . 321 . ... " God had brought " Thomas Fowle " very low , both in his estate and in his reputation , since he joined in the first petition . " And " God had so blasted " Childe 's " estate as he was quite broken . " Footnote : Winthrop , ii . 322 . Maverick remained some years in Boston , being probably unable to abandon his property ; during this interval he made several efforts to have his fine remitted , and he did finally secure an abatement of one half . He then went to England and long afterward came back as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contest with the theocracy . Dr. Palfrey has described this movement as a plot to introduce a direct government by England by inducing Parliament to establish Presbyterianism . By other than theological reasoning this inference can not be deduced from the evidence . All that is certainly known about the leaders is that they were not of any one denomination . Maverick was an Episcopalian ; Vassal was probably an Independent like Cromwell or Milton ; and though the elders accused Childe of being a Jesuit , there is some ground to suppose that he inclined toward Geneva . So far as the testimony goes , everything tends to prove that the petitioners were perfectly sincere in their effort to gain some small measure of civil and religious liberty for themselves and for the disfranchised majority . Viewed from the standpoint of history and not of prejudice , the events of these early years present themselves in a striking and unmistakable sequence . They are the phenomena that regularly attend a certain stage of human development ,  --  the absorption of power by an aristocracy . The clergy 's rule was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an iron hand . Was it defection from their own ranks , the deserters met the fate of Wheelwright , of Williams , of Cotton , or of Hubbert ; were politicians contumacious , they were defeated or exiled , like Vane , or Aspinwall , or Coddington ; were citizens discontented , they were coerced like Maverick and Childe . The process had been uninterrupted alike in church and state . The congregations , which in theory should have included all the inhabitants of the towns , had shrunk until they contained only a third or a quarter of the people ; while the churches themselves , which were supposed to be independent of external interference and to regulate their affairs by the will of the majority , had become little more than the chattels of the priests , and subject to the control of the magistrates who were their representatives . This system has generally prevailed ; in like manner the Inquisition made use of the secular arm . The condition of ecclesiastical affairs is thus described by the highest living authority on Congregationalism :  --  " Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the will of Christ , and not the will of the major or minor part of a church , ought to govern that church . But somebody must interpret that will . And they quietly assumed that Christ would reveal his will to the elders , but would not reveal it to the church-members ; so that when there arose a difference of opinion as to what the Master 's will might be touching any particular matter , the judgment of the elders , rather than the judgment even of a majority of the membership , must be taken as conclusive . To all intents and purposes , then , this was precisely the aristocracy which they affirmed that it was not . For the elders were to order business in the assurance that every truly humble and sincere member would consent thereto . If any did not consent , and after patient debate remained of another judgment , he was ' partial ' and ' factious , ' and continuing ' obstinate , ' he was ' admonished ' and his vote ' nullified ; ' so that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adding the insult of the apparent but illusive offer of cooperation to the injury of their absolute control . As Samuel Stone of Hartford no more tersely than truly put it , this kind of Congregationalism was simply a ' speaking Aristocracy in the face of a silent Democracy . ' " Footnote : Early New England Congregationalism , as seen in its Literature , p. 429 . Dr. Dexter . It is true that Vassal 's petition was the event which made the ministers decide to call a synod Footnote : Winthrop , ii . 264. by means of an invitation of the General Court ; but it is also certain that under no circumstances would the meeting of some such council have been long delayed . For sixteen years the well-known process had been going on , of the creation of institutions by custom , having the force of law ; the stage of development had now been reached when it was necessary that those usages should take the shape of formal enactments . The Cambridge platform therefore marks the completion of an organization , and as such is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The work was done in August , 1648 : the Westminster Confession was promulgated as the creed ; the powers of the clergy were minutely defined , and the duty of the laity stated to be " obeying their elders and submitting themselves unto them in the Lord . " Footnote : Cambridge Platform , ch. x. section 7 . The magistrate was enjoined to punish " idolatry , blasphemy , heresy , " and to coerce any church becoming " schismatical . " In October , 1649 , the court commended the platform to the consideration of the congregations ; in October , 1651 , it was adopted ; and when church and state were thus united by statute the theocracy was complete . The close of the era of construction is also marked by the death of those two remarkable men whose influence has left the deepest imprint upon the institutions they helped to mould : John Winthrop , who died in 1649 , and John Cotton in 1652 . Winthrop 's letters to his wife show him to have been tender and gentle , and that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affection those bore him who had suffered most at his hands . Williams and Vane and Coddington kept their friendship for him to the end . But these very qualities , so amiable in themselves , made him subject to the influence of men of inflexible will . His dream was to create on earth a commonwealth of saints whose joy would be to walk in the ways of God . But in practice he had to deal with the strongest of human passions . In 1634 , though supported by Cotton , he was defeated by Dudley , and there can be no doubt that this was caused by the defection of the body of the clergy . The evidence seems conclusive , for the next year Vane brought about an interview between the two at which Haynes was present , and there Haynes upbraided him with remissness in administering justice . Footnote : Winthrop , i. 178 . Winthrop agreed to leave the question to the ministers , who the next morning gave an emphatic opinion in favor of strict discipline . Thenceforward he was pliant in their hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life . By leading the crusade against the Antinomians he regained the confidence of the elders and they never again failed him ; but in return they exacted obedience to their will ; and the rancor with which he pursued Anne Hutchinson , Gorton , and Childe can not be extenuated , and must ever be a stain upon his fame . As Hutchinson points out , in early life his tendencies were liberal , but in America he steadily grew narrow . The reason is obvious . The leader of an intolerant party has himself to be intolerant . His claim to eminence as a statesman must rest upon the purity of his moral character , his calm temper , and his good judgment ; for his mind was not original or brilliant , nor was his thought in advance of his age . Herein he differed from his celebrated contemporary , for among the long list of famous men , who are the pride of Massachusetts , there are few who in mere intellectual capacity outrank Cotton . He was not only a profound scholar , an eloquent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organizer , and a natural politician . He it was who constructed the Congregational hierarchy ; his publications were the accepted authority both abroad and at home ; and the system which he developed in his books was that which was made law by the Cambridge Platform . Of medium height , florid complexion , and as he grew old some tendency to be stout , but with snowy hair and much personal dignity , he seems to have had an irresistible charm of manner toward those whom he wished to attract . Comprehending thoroughly the feelings and prejudices of the clergy , he influenced them even more by his exquisite tact than by his commanding ability ; and of easy fortune and hospitable alike from inclination and from interest , he entertained every elder who went to Boston . He understood the art of flattery to perfection ; or , as Norton expressed it , " he was a man of ingenuous and pious candor , rejoicing ( as opportunity served ) to take notice of and testifie unto the gifts of God in his brethren , thereby drawing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Funeral Sermon , p. 37 . No other clergyman has ever been able to reach the position he held with apparent ease , which amounted to a sort of primacy of New England . His dangers lay in the very fecundity of his mind . Though hampered by his education and profession , he was naturally liberal ; and his first miscalculation was when , almost immediately on landing , he supported Winthrop , who was in disgrace for the mildness of his administration , against the austerer Dudley . The consciousness of his intellectual superiority seems to have given him an almost overweening confidence in his ability to induce his brethren to accept the broader theology he loved to preach ; nor did he apparently realize that comprehension was incompatible with a theocratic government , and that his success would have undermined the organization he was laboring to perfect . He thus committed the error of his life in undertaking to preach a religious reformation , without having the resolution to face a martyrdom . But when he saw his mistake , the way in which he retrieved himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men with whom he had to deal . Nor did he ever forget the lesson . From that time forward he took care that no one should be able to pick a flaw in his orthodoxy ; and whatever he may have thought of much of the policy of his party , he was always ready to defend it without flinching . Neither he nor Winthrop died too soon , for with the completion of the task of organization the work that suited them was finished , and they were unfit for that which remained to be done . An oligarchy , whose power rests on faith and not on force , can only exist by extirpating all who openly question their pretensions to preeminent sanctity ; and neither of these men belonged to the class of natural persecutors ,  --  the one was too gentle , the other too liberal . An example will show better than much argument how little in accord either really was with that spirit which , in the regular course of social development , had thenceforward to dominate over Massachusetts . Captain Partridge had fought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the winter of 1645 . He was arrested and examined as a heretic . The magistrates referred the case to Cotton , who reported that " he found him corrupt in judgment , " but " had good hope to reclaim him . " Footnote : Winthrop , ii . 251 . An instant recantation was demanded ; it was of course refused , and , in spite of all remonstrance , the family was banished in the snow . Winthrop 's sad words were : " But sure , the rule of hospitality to strangers , and of seeking to pluck out of the fire such as there may be hope of , ... do seem to require more moderation and indulgence of human infirmity where there appears not obstinacy against the clear truth . " Footnote : Winthrop , ii . 251 . But in the savage and bloody struggle that was now at hand there was no place for leaders capable of pity or remorse , and the theocracy found supremely gifted chieftains in John Norton and John Endicott . Norton approaches the ideal of the sterner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breeding , a ripe scholar , with a keen though polished wit , his sombre temper was deeply tinged with fanaticism . Unlike so many of his brethren , temporal concerns were to him of but little moment , for every passion of his gloomy soul was intensely concentrated on the warfare he believed himself waging with the fiend . Doubt or compassion was impossible , for he was commissioned by the Lord . He was Christ 's elected minister , and misbelievers were children of the devil whom it was his sacred duty to destroy . He knew by the Word of God that all save the orthodox were lost , and that heretics not only perished , but were the hirelings of Satan , who tempted the innocent to their doom ; he therefore hated and feared them more than robbers or murderers . Words seemed to fail him when he tried to express his horror : " The face of death , the King of Terrours , the living man by instinct turneth his face from . An unusual shape , a satanical phantasm , a ghost , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of heresie is of a more horrid aspect than all ... put together , as arguing some signal inlargement of the power of darkness as being diabolical , prodigeous , portentous . " Footnote : Heart of New Eng . Rent , p. 46 . By nature , moreover , he had in their fullest measure the three attributes of a preacher of a persecution ,  --  eloquence , resolution , and a heart callous to human suffering . To this formidable churchman was joined a no less formidable magistrate . No figure in our early history looms out of the past like Endicott 's . The harsh face still looks down from under the black skull-cap , the gray moustache and pointed beard shading the determined mouth , but throwing into relief the lines of the massive jaw . He is almost heroic in his ferocious bigotry and daring ,  --  a perfect champion of the church . The grim Puritan soldier is almost visible as , standing at the head of his men , he tears the red cross from the flag , and defies the power of England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people were hanging breathless on the fate of Christison , when insurrection seemed bursting out beneath his feet , and his judges shrunk aghast before the peril , we yet hear the savage old man furiously strike the table , and , thanking God that he at least dares to do his duty , we see him rise alone before that threatening multitude to condemn the heretic to death . CHAPTER IV . THE ANABAPTISTS . The Rev. Thomas Shepard , pastor of Charlestown , was such an example , " in word , in conversation , in civility , in spirit , in faith , in purity , that he did let no man despise his youth ; " Footnote : Magnalia , bk. 4 , ch. ix . Section 6. and yet , preaching an election sermon before the governor and magistrates , he told them that " anabaptisme ... hath ever been lookt at by the godly leaders of this people as a scab . " Footnote : Eye Salve , p. 24 . While the Rev. Samuel Willard , president of Harvard , declared that " such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be handled over tenderly . " Footnote : Ne Sutor , p. 10 . So early as 1644 , therefore , the General Court " Ordered and agreed , yt if any person or persons within ye iurisdiction shall either openly condemne or oppose ye baptizing of infants , or go about secretly to seduce others from ye app'bation or use thereof , or shall purposely depart ye congregation at ye administration of ye ordinance , ... and shall appear to ye Co't willfully and obstinately to continue therein after due time and meanes of conviction , every such person or persons shallbe sentenced to banishment . " Footnote : Mass . Rec. ii . 85. 13 November , 1644 . The legislation , however , was unpopular , for Winthrop relates that in October , 1645 , divers merchants and others petitioned to have the act repealed , because of the offense taken thereat by the godly in England , and the court seemed inclined to accede , " but many of the elders ... entreated that the law might continue still in force , and the execution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lenity and patience should be used for convincing and reclaiming such erroneous persons . Whereupon the court refused to make any further order . " Footnote : Winthrop , ii . 251 . And Edward Winslow assured Parliament in 1646 , when sent to England to represent the colony , that , some mitigation being desired , " it was answered in my hearing . ' T is true we have a severe law , but wee never did or will execute the rigor of it upon any .... But the reason wherefore wee are loath either to repeale or alter the law is , because wee would have it ... to beare witnesse against their judgment , ... which we conceive ... to bee erroneous . " Footnote : Hypocrisie Unmasked , 101 . Unquestionably , at that time no one had been banished ; but in 1644 " one Painter , for refusing to let his child be baptized , ... was brought before the court , where he declared their baptism to be anti-Christian . He was sentenced to be whipped , which he bore without flinching , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Hutch . Hist. i. 208 , note . Nor was his a solitary instance of severity . Yet , notwithstanding the scorn and hatred which the orthodox divines felt for these sectaries , many very eminent Puritans fell into the errors of that persuasion . Roger Williams was a Baptist , and Henry Dunster , for the same heresy , was removed from the presidency of Harvard , and found it prudent to end his days within the Plymouth jurisdiction . Even that great champion of infant baptism , Jonathan Mitchell , when thrown into intimate relations with Dunster , had doubts . " That day ... after I came from him I had a strange experience ; I found hurrying and pressing suggestions against Paedobaptism , and injected scruples and thoughts whether the other way might not be right , and infant baptism an invention of men ; and whether I might with good conscience baptize children and the like . And these thoughts were darted in with some impression , and left a strange confusion and sickliness upon my spirit . Yet , methought , it was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; ... And it made me fearful to go needlessly to Mr. D. ; for methought I found a venom and poison in his insinuations and discourses against Paedobaptism . " Footnote : Magnalia , bk. 4 , ch. iv . Section 10 . Henry Dunster was an uncommon man . Famed for piety in an age of fanaticism , learned , modest , and brave , by the unremitting toil of thirteen years he raised Harvard from a school to the position which it has since held ; and though very poor , and starving on a wretched and ill-paid pittance , he gave his beloved college one hundred acres of land at the moment of its sorest need . Footnote : Quincy 's History of Harvard , i. 15 . Yet he was a criminal , for he would not baptize infants , and he met with the " lenity and patience " which the elders were not unwilling should be used toward the erring . He was indicted and convicted of disturbing church ordinances , and deprived of his office in October , 1654 . He asked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few months , and his petition in November ought to be read to understand how heretics were made to suffer :  --  " 1st . The time of the year is unseasonable , being now very near the shortest day , and the depth of winter . " 2d . The place unto which I go is unknown to me and my family , and the ways and means of subsistance .... " 3d .

He received that mercy which the church has ever shown to those who wander from her fold ; he was given till March , and then , with dues unpaid , was driven forth a broken man , to die in poverty and neglect .

" Footnote : Magnalia , bk. 4 , ch. iv . Section 16 . Notwithstanding , therefore , clerical promises of gentleness , Massachusetts was not a comfortable place of residence for Baptists , who , for the most part , went to Rhode Island ; and John Clark Footnote : For sketch of Clark 's life see Allen 's Biographical Dictionary. became the pastor of the church which they formed at Newport about 1644 . He had been born about 1610 , and had been educated in London as a physician . In 1637 he landed at Boston , where he seems to have become embroiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fared so ill that , with several others , he left Massachusetts ' resolving , through the help of Christ , to get clear of all chartered companies and be of ourselves . ' In the course of their wanderings they fell in with Williams , and settled near him . Clark was perhaps the most prominent man in the Plantations , filled many public offices , and was the commissioner who afterward secured for the colony the famous charter that served as the State Constitution till 1842 . Obediah Holmes , who succeeded him as Baptist minister of Newport , is less well known . He was educated at Oxford , and when he emigrated he settled at Salem ; from thence he went to Seaconk , where he joined the church under Mr. Newman . Here he soon fell into trouble for resisting what he maintained was an " unrighteous act " of his pastor 's ; in consequence he and several more renounced the communion , and began to worship by themselves ; they were baptized and thereafter they were excommunicated ; the inevitable indictment followed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Footnote : Holmes 's Narrative , Backus , i. 213 . William Witter Footnote : For the following events , see " Ill Newes from New England " Mass . Hist . Coll. fourth series , vol. ii. of Lynn was an aged Baptist , who had already been prosecuted , but , in 1651 , being blind and infirm , he asked the Newport church to send some of the brethren to him , to administer the communion , for he found himself alone in Massachusetts . Footnote : Backus , i. 215 . Accordingly Clark undertook the mission , with Obediah Holmes and John Crandall . They reached Lynn on Saturday , July 19 , 1651 , and on Sunday stayed within doors in order not to disturb the congregation . A few friends were present , and Clark was in the midst of a sermon , when the house was entered by two constables with a warrant signed by Robert Bridges , commanding them to arrest certain " erroneous persons being strangers . " The travellers were at once seized and carried to the tavern , and after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gorton , like many another , had to go through this ordeal , and he speaks of his Sundays with much feeling : " Only some part of those dayes they brought us forth into their congregations , to hear their sermons ... which was meat to be digested , but only by the heart or stomacke of an ostrich . " Footnote : Simplicitie 's Defence , p. 57 . The unfortunate Baptists remonstrated , saying that were they forced into the meeting-house , they should be obliged to dissent from the service , but this , the constable said , was nothing to him , and so he carried them away . On entering , during the prayer , the prisoners took off their hats , but presently put them on again and began reading in their seats . Whereupon Bridges ordered the officers to uncover their heads , which was done , and the service was then quietly finished . When all was over , Clark asked leave to speak , which , after some hesitation , was granted , on condition he would not discuss what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had put on his hat because he could not judge that they were gathered according to the visible order of the Lord ; but here he was silenced , and the three were committed to custody for the night . On Tuesday they were taken to Boston , and on the 31st were brought before Governor Endicott . Their trial was of the kind reserved by priests for heretics . No jury was impanelled , no indictment was read , no evidence was heard , but the prisoners were reviled by the bench as Anabaptists , and when they repudiated the name were asked if they did not deny infant baptism . The theological argument which followed was cut short by a recommitment to await sentence . That afternoon John Cotton exhorted the judges from the pulpit . He expounded the law , and commanded them to do their duty ; he told them that the rejection of infant baptism would overthrow the church ; that this was a capital crime , and therefore the captives were " foul murtherers . " Footnote : Ill Newes , p. 56 . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record recites a number of misdemeanors , such as wearing the hat in church , administering the communion to the excommunicated , and the like , but no attempt was made to prove a single charge . Footnote : Ill Newes , pp. 31-44 . The reason is obvious : the only penalty provided by statute for the offence of being a Baptist was banishment , hence the only legal course would have been to dismiss the accused . Endicott condemned them to fines of twenty , thirty , and five pounds , respectively , or to be whipped . Clark understood his position perfectly , and from the first had demanded to be shown the law under which he was being tried . He now , after sentence , renewed the request . Endicott well knew that in acting as the mouthpiece of the clergy he was violating alike justice , his oath of office , and his honor as a judge ; and , being goaded to fury , he broke out : You have deserved death ; I will not have such trash brought into our jurisdiction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest : " As I went from the bar , I exprest myself in these words ,  --  I blesse God I am counted worthy to suffer for the name of Jesus ; whereupon John Wilson ( their pastor , as they call him ) strook me before the judgement seat , and cursed me , saying , The curse of God ... goe with thee ; so we were carried to the prison . " Footnote : Idem , p. 47 . All the convicts maintained that their liberty as English subjects had been violated , and they refused to pay their fines . Clark 's friends , however , alarmed for his safety , settled his for him , and he was discharged . Crandall was admitted to bail , but being misinformed as to the time of surrender , he did not appear , his bond was forfeited , and on his return to Boston he found himself free . Thus Holmes was left to face his punishment alone . Actuated apparently by a deep sense of duty toward himself and his God , he refused the help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he lay in prison he suffered keenly as he thought of his birth and breeding , his name , his worldly credit , and the humiliation which must come to his wife and children from his public shame ; then , too , he began to fear lest he might not be able to bear the lash , might flinch or shed tears , and bring contempt on himself and his religion . Yet when the morning came he was calm and resolute ; refusing food and drink , that he might not be said to be sustained by liquor , he betook himself to prayer , and when his keeper called him , with his Bible in his hand , he walked cheerfully to the post . He would have spoken a few words , but the magistrate ordered the executioner to do his office quickly , for this fellow would delude the people ; then he was seized and stripped , and as he cried , " Lord , lay not this sin unto their charge , " he received the first blow . Footnote : Ill Newes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a three-thonged whip , of such horrible severity that it was many days before he could endure to have his lacerated body touch the bed , and he rested propped upon his hands and knees . Footnote : Backus , i. 237 , note . MS. of Gov . Jos . Jencks . Yet , in spite of his torture , he stood firm and calm , showing neither pain nor fear , breaking out at intervals into praise to God ; and his dignity and courage so impressed the people that , in spite of the danger , numbers flocked about him when he was set free , in sympathy and admiration . John Spur , being inwardly affected by what he saw and heard , took him by the hand , and , with a joyful countenance , said : " Praised be the Lord , " and so went back with him . That same day Spur was arrested , charged with the crime of succoring a heretic . Then said the undaunted Spur : " Obediah Holmes I do look upon as a godly man : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Christian , under so sad an affliction . " " We will deal with you as we have dealt with him , " said Endicott . " I am in the hands of God , " answered Spur ; and then his keeper took him to his prison . Footnote : Ill Newes , p. 57 . Perhaps no persecutor ever lived who was actuated by a single motive : Saint Dominic probably had some trace of worldliness ; Henry VIII . some touch of bigotry ; and this was preeminently true of the Massachusetts elders . Doubtless there were among them men like Norton , whose fanaticism was so fierce that they would have destroyed the heretic like the wild beast , as a child of the devil , and an abomination to God . But with the majority worldly motives predominated : they were always protesting that they did not constrain men 's consciences , but only enforced orderly living . Increase Mather declared : in " the same church there have been Presbyterians , Independents , Episcopalians , and Antipaedobaptists , all welcome to the same table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Christian charity a work of regeneration in their souls . " Footnote : Vindication of New Eng. p. 19 . And Winslow solemnly assured Parliament , " Nay , some in our churches " are " of that judgment , and as long as they Baptists carry themselves peaceably as hitherto they doe , wee will leave them to God . " Footnote : Hypocrisie Unmasked , p. 101 . A. D. 1646 . Such statements , although intended to convey a false impression , contained this much truth : provided a man conformed to all the regulations of the church , paid his taxes , and held his tongue , he would not , in ordinary circumstances , have been molested under the Puritan Commonwealth . But the moment he refused implicit obedience , or , above all , if he withdrew from his congregation , he was shown no mercy , because such acts tended to shake the temporal power . John Wilson , pastor of Boston , was a good example of the average of his order . On his death-bed he was asked to declare what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ' I have long feared several sins , whereof one , ' he said , ' was Corahism : that is , when people rise up as Corah against their ministers , as if they took too much upon them , when indeed they do but rule for Christ , and according to Christ . ' " Footnote : Magnalia , bk. 3 , ch. iii . Section 17 . Permeated with this love of power , and possessed of a superb organization , the clergy never failed to act on public opinion with decisive effect whenever they saw their worldly interests endangered . Childe has described the attack which overwhelmed him , and Gorton gives a striking account of their process of inciting a crusade :  --  " These things concluded to be heresies and blasphemies .... The ministers did zealously preach unto the people the great danger of such things , and the guilt such lay under that held them , stirring the people up to labour to find such persons out and to execute death upon them , making persons so execrable in the eyes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yea some of them naming some of us in their pulpits , that the people that had not seen us thought us to be worse by far in any respect then those barbarous Indians are in the country .... Whereupon we heard a rumor that the Massachusets was sending out an army of men to cut us off . " Footnote : Simplicitie 's Defence , p. 32 . The persecution of the Baptists lays bare this selfish clerical policy . The theory of the suppression of heresy as a sacred duty breaks down when it is conceded that the heretic may be admitted to the orthodox communion without sin ; therefore the motives for cruelty were sordid . The ministers felt instinctively that an open toleration would impair their power ; not only because the congregations would divide , but because these sectaries listened to " John Russell the shoemaker . " Footnote : Ne Sutor , p. 26 . Obviously , were cobblers to usurp the sacerdotal functions , the superstitious reverence of the people for the priestly office would not long endure : and it was his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas Cobbett cry out in his pulpit " against Gorton , that arch-heretick , who would have al men to be preachers . " Footnote : Simplicities Defence , p. 32 . See Ne Sutor , p. 26 . Therefore , though Winslow solemnly protested before the Commissioners at London that Baptists who lived peaceably would be left unmolested , yet such of them as listened to " foul-murtherers " Footnote : " Ill Newes , " Mass . Hist . Coll. fourth series , vol. ii . p. 56. were denounced by the divines as dangerous fanatics who threatened to overthrow the government , and were hunted through the country like wolves . Thomas Gould was an esteemed citizen of Charles-town , but , unfortunately for himself , he had long felt doubt concerning infant baptism ; so when , in 1655 , a child was born to him , he " durst not " have it christened . " The elder pressed the church to lay me under admonition , which the church was backward to do . Afterward I went out at the sprinkling of children , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they told me of it . But I told them I could not stay , for I lookt upon it as no ordinance of Christ . They told me that now I had made known my judgment I might stay .... So I stayed and sat down in my seat w//
