txt Gov . Hill 's hypocrisy was never better exposed than in the Chemung County Democratic Convention at Horseheads this afternoon , when deals and double hippo-droming were carried out to the letter , although in the face of a thorough exposure of the job . W. L. Muller , Secretary of the Democratic . State Committee and candidate for Chairman of the next committee , has been in the city a few days , and in the absence of the Governor , whose presence was looked for , had hard work to fix things for Hill delegates to the State Convention . Muller claimed Hill 's home county for the Governor , and by considerations which were exposed in the convention contended that the three State delegates should ho solid for him in the meantime , in order to avoid a possibility of defeat , promising that one delegate should be chosen ostensibly to represent the National Administration , but should not attend the State Convention , and there would appear a united delegation from Chemung for the Governor 's interests , the principal one of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judge Mul-ler is slated for Chairman . In the convention ex-District Attorney S. S. Taylor made an effort to carry out the Governor 's programme by moving the election of Muller by acclamation , supplementing his motion by a speech , in which he said : " Gov . Hill 's friends want no uncertain delegation in the State Convention . His wish in the selection of delegates in his own county should be respected . He is at the head of the party in the State , and undoubtedly will soon be the leader of the party in the Nation . " These remarks caused surprise to every one , particularly those who in view of the carrying out of the proposed deal were ready to comply with their part of the programme , but who at this time saw that the promises of the Governor 's friends were only made to be broken . Following Taylor 's speech a tumult arose that beggars description . Ex-County Clerk Eustace made a bitter attack on Taylor , the latter replying in a hostile spirit . Taylor charged Eustace with antagonizing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against him , although the Governor had done so much for him . Eustace entered the fight against Muller , and , although Eutaw is a very light-waisted politician , secured 51 votes to Muller 's SI The result of this ballot was a surprise to every one , and there is no question that if the opponents of Gov . Hill had made an effort Muller would have been defeated by a significant majority . E. W. Mitchel , mentioned as the compromise or stay-a-thome delegate , was next chosen , and Assemblyman Bush was elected by acclamation . The result of the convention has sent terror into the hearts of the Governor 's heelers , who were out in force , nut whose methods have disgusted respectable Democrats , who left the primaries and convention severely alone . Ex-Aldermen William Walsh , William H. Ronan , D. Finley , ex- Afieelliblyinan O.P. Dimon , and J ames Beidelinan were selected Senatorial delegates , and John F. , son of Postmaster E. F. Babcock. was chosen a delegate to the Judicial Convention .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
