txt The election to be held in Jersey City tomorrow will be one of the most important and probably the most exciting held in that city in many years . Voters are expected , on the one ballot , to vote a set of officials in under the present charter , and to vote them out again by executing the new charter . The demand for a less cumbersome and for a more directly responsible form of government has been active in Jersey City for some year back . Mayor Cleveland decided to utilize tub sentiment , and some months ago he prepared a charter vesting him with all municipal preroga . ' Lives . In the hope of catching the support of the Newark members of the Legislature he made a combination with Mayor Haynes of that city , and the bill as originally prepared was intenaed to apply both to Newark and Jersey City . To please the Newark sentiment all the peculiar offices of that city were established by the act , and in deference to Mayor Cleveland 's viewer the act included as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the most wonderful mosaic of municipal offices that a Legislature was ever asked to enact into law . The moment Newark people became acquainted with the features of the new bill they set up a howl of protest that drove every Assemblyman of that city from its support , and their united opposition threatened the bill with overwhelming defeat . There was nothing left to do except ? to make the bill applicable to Jersey City alone ; and to escape the constitutional . requirement of general laws for cities a clause was inserted making it operative only in the cities that accepted it by popular vote . As there was no longer any hope of securing Newark 's support for it , the host of unnecessary municipal offices that had been put into it to inveigle Newark into the scheme were eliminated from the act , and in that shape it has been Put through . Under the existing charter the people elect a Mayor , Aldermen , and six members each of the Boards of Works , Fire ana Police Commissioners , and the Aldermen appoint a Board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more direct responsibility would be secured by the establishment of single-headed commissions appointed by the Mayor , but when Mayor Cleveland came to draw his charter De found that one-neadea commissions would not make room for all the politicians whom he would have to buy off from opposition to his act , and his bill provides for three-headed some Missions . There are to be a Streets and Water Department , to be appointed by Mayor Cleveland ; a Police Board of three , to be appointed by the Mayor ; a Fire Board of three , to be appointed by the Mayor ; a Tax Board of three , to be appointed DS the Mayor ; a Board of Finance , to be appointed by the Mayor ; a Corporation Attorney , to be appointed by the Mayor ; a Corporation Connsel , to be appointed by the Mayor ; a City Controller and a City Collector , both to be appointed by the Mayor . The bill removes every check upon him In the exercise of his extraordinary prerogatives . His Board of Works may go to whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Board of Finance will see to it that the money to meet it is appropriated . The only prerogative left to the people is that of electing a poweriess Board of Aldermen and an Alderman , to be chosen by the people at large , who suall preside over the board . This last office is created by the new act , and , as the new ant can not become operative till the people have approved it Tuesday , it is a question whether tee Alderman at Large can be legally elected this Spring . But at the some time Mayor Cleveland and Sheriff " Bob " Davis were driving all over the city , at midnight of Saturday , in vain . ellorts to had a candidate for the position that would help to make the charter respectablo . They had tried to induce Dr. Leouard J. Gordon , Dr. Benjamin Edge , and exMayor O'Neill to stand , but all had declined , and at 1 o'clock yesterday morning Davis announced that Charles W. Allen , a builder on the Heights , had been selected . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than have none , but the tone of comment throughout Jersey City yesterday showed that nothing but the application of the usual Hudson County metbods to election returns can save it from defeat at the polls to-morrow . The proclamation for the special vote to be taken to-morrow was published only yesterday , and the shortness of the notice with which it is attempted to spring it on the people has aroused suspicion that there is something in it that will bear careful scrutiny . The giving of but two days ' notice of the election is the culmination of a very patent series of moves to choke of a fair and free expression of opinion on the subject . It was at first proposed to have the vote taken at the Fall election . That would have given the people six months to think about it , and the proposition was not entertained . Then , it its earlier acslept:twee by the people were doomed desirable , a special electtion was proposed . That was not listened to by its promoters . And finally it was proposed that , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the voters be directed to show deliberation by voting " for " or " against " on a separate ballot ? another than that containing the names of candidates to be voted for . Even that would not be thought of by the charter'a promoters . The bill at first provided for its submission to tho people in proclamation by the Mayor . No notice was required , and there are reasons for the suspicion that It was designed to make the proclamation one day and force the vote the next day . It is the knowledge of these circumstances , indicating a set purpose to allow as little time as possible for popular discussion of the bill , that threatens it With defeat . Even those who favor its scheme of government are afraid to vote for it because of the suspicion that there 18 more in it than they dream of , and the opposition vote will be largely recruited by those holding this view . The Democratic County Committee has ordered ' the words , " For the Charter " to be printed on their ballots . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the candidates for office under the existing charter , will give the bill the liveliest wrestle at the polls Jersey City has experienced in many ' years .
