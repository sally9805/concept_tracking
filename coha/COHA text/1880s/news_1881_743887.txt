txt " The President 's prospects of complete recovery are every day increasing , " said Dr. Agnew this evening . He had just been shown the S o'clock bulletin , which stated that the favorable symptoms in the President 's case still continued ; he had also read the previous bulletin in the evening papers , . and in addition to this , he had received a telegram from the President 's physicians in Washington , dated 1 o'clock , informing him of the patient 's condition at that hour . All the news has been favorable , and Dr. Agnew , having had opportunity to read the bulletins and reflect on their contents , was ready to give the result of those reflections . " The President has already about passed his greatest danger , " continued the doctor . " He has passed the risk of death from shock ; he has passed the risk of death from hemorrhage ; and he has possibly passed in great measure the risk of peritonitis . This last danger , I think , is about over ; at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every hour of the favorable continuance of his condition adds to the chance of his recovery . His case under the circumstances could not be better . The attending physicians are doing everything that could be required ; his attention is of the best ; if he gets through to-morrow all right , I think there will be little cause for doubt that he will get well . " The Doctor spoke against the policy of newspapers forecasting dangerous contingencies in the President 's case , and said : " I think the less the newspapers go into the discussion of the possibilities of an unfavorable turn the better . It is an error to publish them . The papers from day to day have been discussing possible contingencies , things that may happen for the worst . These papers go into the President 's mansion , and his wife and relatives get hold of them and read all the unfavorable signs , which he hears indirectly , and harm is done . There is not the least doubt in my mind that the publication of these have a tendency to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a sword hung over his head . "
