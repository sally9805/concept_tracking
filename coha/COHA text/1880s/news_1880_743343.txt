txt A political canvass of the members of the Legislature has been made during the past two days , to ascertain preferences on the Presidency . In the benate thre are 16 Republicans to 5 Democrats , and the latter , with one exception , say they are for the man who can win ; the odd one is for Tilden . One Republican Senator is sick , and the other 15 divide as follows : For first choice ? Grant , 6 ; Edmunds and Washburne , 3 each ; Blaine , 2 ; Garfield , 1 . Three each are for Sherman and Blaine as second choice . The House Members are slower about expressing themselves . Fifty per cent . of the Republicans are for Grant . either first or second choice . The next favorite is Blaine. though only by a comparatively small margin as against Sherman . Washburne and Edmunds average about the same strength . There is a very light feeling for Hayes , and a slight expression for Garileld . Outside of Grant , Blaine and Sherman there is a preference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice of many . There is this peculiarity about the canvass , that many of the Grant men say that those who favor Blaine do not represent their constituents , while the Blaine men assert that there is a strong popular feeling against Grant . Yet the returns show an apparent inconsistency in this , that a good proportion of those who favor Blaine name Grant as second choice , and some of the Grant men favor Blaine , second . The Democrats divide up between Bayard , Tilden , and Hancock , with a little diversion in favor of ex-Govs . Hubbard and English . The feeling of the Republicans is , that at the State Convention , to be held early in April , the party should send delegates who will be a unit in their action for what seems to be the best good of the party and country , regardless of personal and partisan leanings , and that the delegates should hold themselves so well together that they may make useful combinations in the right directions .
