txt On Kingsbury Run , at the Willson  --  avenue crossing , is the oil refinery of Thurmer &; Teagle . The oil leaking from one of the stills ran into the run , and as that was unusually high , the oil came up to the boiler-house , where it ignited and went off with a great explosion early this morning . The still also caught fire , and its contents went into the run . In a few minutes the surface of the water was covered with flames from Willson-avenue to Broadway . It made its way in the centre of a stream now 150 feet wide , directly toward the Standard Oil-works , and the Fire Department officers were apprehensive of an immense conflagration . A half-dozen engines were ordered out and stationed on the banks , ready to save any buildings that might be endangered . Up to this time $6,000 worth of oil bad been burned at the works of Thurmer Teagle , and in the Republic works , which had also caught from the running oil . The burning stream then passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small flame was caused , but it was extinguished before any harm was done . All this had occurred before 11 A. M. The oil and water together had now risen to such a height as to cover the alarm-box at the Standard Works and render it useless . The Standard people were ordered by the fire officers to extinguish every fire about their works . a command that was compiled with within 20 minutes . Meanwhile , the oil that had come down stream burned on In close proximity to the Standard tanks . Affairs remained in this condition , with firemen on watch , the run rising and rain pouring down , until 12:80 o'clock , when three heavy and successive explosions scattered as many of the Standard tanks into fragments and spread the oil in every direction . The combined efforts of the firemen and the Standard Comnany'a employes seemed in vain . The flames shot up from the exploded tanks , making a lurid and exciting scene . Tank No. 7 caught fire a moment later , as well as tank No. 2 , both of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tank , containing 3,000 barrels of this highly inflammable fluid , exploded with a report that could be heard for miles . Instantly a number of wooden structures beilonging to the Standard Works caught fire , and a moment later the newly built pump-house , costing $8,000 , was ablaze . In less than 15 minutes two more tanks exploded . The aspect of affairs now grow alarming . A large culvert leads from this basin of burning oil under the New-York , Pennsylvania and Ohio Railroad track into the Cuyahoga River . Owners or property along the river momentarily expected to see the lake of fire dash under the culvert and go rushing down the river on its swollen current to envelop everything in flames . A dozen men plunged into water that reached to their necks at the mouth of the culvert. and with boards and planks furnished by the excited crowd , endeavored to dam up the fierce flood and keep it out of the river . Six exploded tanks were now burning with fury . The flames seemed to reach fully 200 feet in the air . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Three more engines were ordered out , as fears were entertained that the flames would spread to a long line of tasks south of the railroad tracks , A dozen small " sports here and there told of exploded reservoirs or pipes . At 4 o'clock the flames crept up to a tank holding 17,000 barrels of crude oil , and an earnest effort was made to save it , which succeeded . By saving that it was esti ' mated that the fire could be held to its then limits . The river had been rapidly rising , and it was feared that it might strike a blockade near the mouth , but at about 4 o'clock the ice , which was very thin , began to break up and move quietly out into the lake . This relieved all apprehension of a very dangerous flood on the flats , which ure covered with lumber yards and factories of all sorts . From that time till nearly 9 o'clock in the evening the fight went on , the firemen doing what they could to save the property iu the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the culvert into the river . The rain was still pouring down in torrents , the water was rising all the time , and thousands of people were standing in the driving storm and looking from the hills down upon the magnificent scene . At 9 o'clock one of the largest tanks was again in danger , and a hopeless effort was made to save it . But in a short time a tiny flame was noticed upon one side of the tank . Streams of water were at once poured upon It , but without avail , and in 10 minutes it exploded with terrific force . Instantly the flames shot up and lighted the city in every quarter . Scattered about through the ruins could be seen the remains of , the wooden buildings , the pipe-house , tinning shop , and pump-house . The engines were playing upon the storage houses at the east of the yard , while a largo force of workmen were hurriedly roiling away barrels of oil and placing them on cars which were hauled to a place of safety . No accident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grounds ran great risks . Fully 100,000 barrels of oil have been burned . It Is impossible at this hour to state what the loss may be , but it can not figure up less than $250,000 . At this writing the fire is still burning within its proscribed limits , and the danger of it getting down town is momentarily decreasing . The rain is still falling heavily , and reports of minor wash-outs and accidents in all parts of the city are coming in.
