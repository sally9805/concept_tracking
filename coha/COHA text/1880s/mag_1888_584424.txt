Dr. Paley was ardently attached to this amusement : so much so , that when the Bishop of Durham inquired of him when one of his most important works would be finished , he said , with great simplicity and good humour , 31y Lord , I shall work steadily at it when the fly-fishing season is orer. ' - SALMONIA , Sin HUMPIIRY DAVY . THE love of angling , iii like the other virtues , is its own reward . But it has also some collateral advantages , and not the least of these is that it leads a man into the very pleasantest places of this pleasant world . The first salmon that ever I caught is . *ssociated in my mind with the scenery of the Lewis , the northernmost of those enchanted islands that stretch along the west coast of Scotland . We had gone up there not with the main purpose of fishing , but because all three of us ( and the other two , mark you , were undoubtedly eminent divines ) , had fallen properly in love with William Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the home of that wholesome and delicious heroine . The kindness of a hospitable Scot put a salmon-river at our disposal ,  --  a hasty little stream , with brown water , curling and brawling through Sheila 's beloved moorland . The first day that I went out to fish , a long , red-bearded gillie stood by my side and showed me " ta besst way ta casst , whatever : " but in spite of his instructions my fly fell awkwardly upon the pooL As fortune would have it , however , there was one fish there whose ignorance of the proprieties of angling was greater than my own . He rose , hooked himself , and then suddenly it seemed as if the line had been made fast to a flash of chain lightning . He darted up the stream and down the stream , leading me in breathless chase . He circumnavigated the pool in all directions , and by various methods , partly aquatic and partly ai*rial . At length , after a moment of profound meditation , he rushed straight across the river , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four feet up on the opposite bank . It was an instant of agony and wonder . My heart sank like a kite when the string is broken , for it seemed certain that the fish must get away . But instead of that he lay quiet for a moment , and then rolled gently back into the water with the fly still fast in his mouth . Three minutes later he was stretched out in the grass on the right side of the river , shining to my eyes more brightly than silver . And then it was that I remembered that one of Sheila 's salmon had played exactly the same trick and with the same ending . If you doubt it , read the third chapter of the " Princess . " A wonderful man , that William Black , so truthful and so inge-nious ! All this was ten years ago ; and t is a far cry from the treeless moors of the Lewis , to the dark wooded hills of the Restigouche . But a little leap on paper will carry one across the interval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a bright morning of July , at the village of Metapedia , on the border between New Brunswick and Quebec . It is a disconsolate hamlet , scattered along the track of the Intercolonial Railway : twenty houses , three shops , and a discouraged church perched upon a little hillock as if to brave out its evident decay with a bare face . The one comfortable and prosperous feature in the countenance of Metapedia is the house of the Restigouche Salmon Club-an old-fashioned mansion , with broad , white piazza , looking // over rich meadow-lands . Here it was that I found my friend Favonius , president of solemn societies , pillar of church and state , ingenuously arrayed in gray knickerbockers , a flannel shirt , and a soft hat , waiting to take me with him on his horse-yacht for a voyage up the river . " Come on , " he said , after a hearty greeting , " the boat is ready , the summer is passing . " And in almost as short a time as it needs to tell about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the bank and we were embarked for the cruise . Have you ever seen a horse-yacht ? Sometimes it is called a scow ; but that sounds vulgar . Sometimes it is called a house-boat ; but that is too English . What does it profit a man to have a whole dictionary full of language at his service , unless he can invent a new and suggestive name for his friend 's pleasure-craft ? T h e foundation of the horse-yacht-if a thing that sometimes floats can be called fundamental-is a flatbottomed boat , some fifty feet long and ten feet wide , with a draft of about eight inches . The deck is open for fifteen feet aft of the place where the bowsprit ought to be ; behind that it is completely covered by a house , cabin , cottage , or whatever you choose to call it , with straight sides and a peaked roof of a very early Gothic pattern . Looking in at the door you see first of all two cots , one on either side of the passage ; then an open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairs ; beyond that a pantry with shelves , and a great chest for provisions . A door at the back opens into the kitchen , and from that another door opens into a sleeping-room for the boatmen . A huge wooden rudder curves over the stern of the boat , and the helmsman stands upon the roof . Two canoes are floating behind , holding back , at the end of their long tow-ropes , as if re* luctant to follow so clumsy a leader . This is an accurate and duly attested description of the horse-yacht . If necessary it could be sworn to before a notary public . But I am perfectly sure that a man might read this through without skipping a word , and if he had never seen the creature with his own eyes , he would have no idea how absurd it looks and how comfortable it is . While we were stowing away our trunks and bags under the cots , and making an equitable division of the hooks upon the walls , the motive power of the yacht stood patiently upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or shaking a shaggy head in mild protest against the flies . Three more pessimisticlooking horses I never saw . They we r e harnessed abreast , and fastened by a prodigious tow-rope to a short post in the middle of the forward deck . Their driver was a truculent , brigandish , bearded old fellow in long boots , a blue flannel shirt , and a black sombrero . He sat upon the middle horse , and some wild instinct of color had made him tie a big red handkerchief around his shoulder like a sash , so that the eye of the beholder took delight in him . He posed like a bold , bad robber-chief . But in point of fact I believe he was the mildest and most inoffensive of men . We never heard him say anything except at a distance , to his horses , and we did not inquire what that was . Well , as I have said , we were haggling courteously over those hooks in the cabin , when the boat gave a lurch . The bow swung out into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse-shoes on the rough shingle of the bank ; and when we looked out of doors our house was moving up the river with the boat under it . An accurate and duly attested description of the horse-yacht. " // The Hestigouche is a noble stream , stately and swift and strong . lit rises among the dense forests in the northern part of New Brunswick  --  a moist upland region of never-failing springs and innumerable lakes  --  and pours a vast current of clear , cold water one hundred and fifty miles northward and eastward through the hills into the head of the Bay of Chaleurs . There are no falls in its course , but rapids everywhere . It is steadfast , but not impetuous , quick but not turbulent , resolute and eager in its desire to get to the sea , like the life of a man who has a high purpose , " Too great for haste , too strong for rivalry . " The wonder is where all the water comes from . But the river is fed by more than six thousand square miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dashing in with their supply . At intervals a larger stream , reaching away back among the mountains like a hand with many fingers to gather . " The filtered tribute of the rough woodland , " delivers its generous offering to the main current . And this also is like a human life , which receives its wealth and power from hidden sources in other lives , and is fed abundantly from the past in order that it may feed the future . The names of the chief tributaries of the Restigouche are curious . There is the headstrong Metapedia , and the crooked lJpsalquitch , and the Patapedia , and the Quatawamkedgwick . Those are words at which the tongue balks at first , but you soon grow used to them and learn to take anything of five syllables with a rush , as a hunter takes a five-barred gate , trusting to fortune that you will come down with the accent in the right place . For six or seven miles above Metapedia the river has a breadth of about two hundred yards , and the valley slopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here there is a good deal of cultivated land , and scattered farmhouses appear . The soil is excellent . But the climate is unfriendly . Late frosts prolong the winter , and early frosts curtail the summer . The only safe crops are grass , oats , and potatoes . And for half the year all the cattle must be housed and fed to keep them alive . This lends a melancholy aspect to agriculture , and I must confess that most of the farmers look as if they had never seen better days . With few exceptions they are what a New Englander would c a 11 " slack-twisted and shiftless . " Their barns are pervious to the weather , and their fences fail to connect . Sleds and ploughs rust together beside the house , and chickens scratch up the front-door yard . In truth , the people have been somewhat demoralized by the conflicting claims of different occupations ; hunting in the fall , lumbering in the Winter and spring , and working for the American sportsmen in the brief angling season , are so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , that the tedious toil of farm " Their driver was a truculent , brigandish , bearded old fellow . " ing is neglected . But , for all that , in the bright days of midsummer , those green fields sloping down to the water , and pastures high up among the trees on the hillsides , look pleasant enough from a distance , and give an air of placid comfort to the landscape . At the mouth of the llJpsalquitch we // passed the first of the fishing-lodges . Originally the Restigouche Salmon Club leased the whole river from the Canadian Government , but since the establishment of riparian rights a few years ago , a number of gentlemen have bought land commanding good pools , and put up little cottages of a less classical style than Sir Charles Cotton 's lodge on the banks of the River Dove , but better suited to this wilder scenery , and probably more convenient to live in . The prevailing pattern is a very simple one : it consists of a broad piazza with a small house in the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the piazza that the crown of a Gainsborough hat does to the brim . And the cost of the edifice is to the cost of the land as the first price of a share in the Panama Canal is to the subsequent assessments . All the best points have been sold , and real estate on the Bestigouche has been bid up to an absurd figure . In fact the river is over-populated and probably over-fished . But we could hardly find it in our hearts to regret this , for it made the upward trip a very sociable one . At every lodge that was open , Favonius ( who knows everybody ) had a friend , and we must slip ashore in a canoe to leave the mail and refresh the inner man . What a hospitable brotherhood is that of true anglers ! There seems to be something in the craft which inclines the heart to kindness and good-fellowship . Few of them have I seen who were not pleasant to meet and ready to do a good turn to a fellow-fisherman with the gift of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own particular and well-proved favorite , of course , for that is a treasure which no decent man would borrow ; but with that exception the best in their store is at the service of an accredited brother . One of the Restigouche proprietors I remember , whose name bespoke him a descendant of Caledonia 's patron saint . He was fishing in front of his own door-yard when we came up , with our splashing horses , through the pool ; but nothing would do but he must up anchor and have us away with him into the house to taste his go9d cheer . And there were his daughters with their books and needlework , and the photographs which they had taken pinned up on the wooden walls , among Japanese fans and bits of bright-colored stuff in which the soul of woman delights , and , in a passive , silent way , the soul of man also . Then , after we had discussed the year 's fishing , and the mysteries of the camera , and the deep question of what makes some negatives too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see the big salmon which one of the ladies had caught a few days before , and the large trout swimming about in their cold spring . It seemed to me , as we went on our way , that there could hardly be a more wholesome and pleasant summer-life for well-bred young women than this , or two amusements more innocent and sensible than photography and fly-fishing . It must be confessed that the horseyacht as a vehicle of travel is not remarkable in point of speed . Three miles an hour is not a very rapid rate of motion . But then , if you are not in a hurry , why should you care to make haste ? The wild desire to be forever racing against old Father Time is one of the kill-joys of modern life . The ancient traveller is sure to beat you in the long run , and as long as you are trying to rival him he will make your life a burden . But if you will only acknowledge his superiority and profess that you do not approve of racing after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jog along like the most companionable of creatures . That is a pleasant pilgrimage in which the journey itself is part of the destination . As soon as one learns to regard the horseyacht as a sort of moving home , it appears admirable . There is no dust or smoke , no rumble of wheels , or shriek of whistles . You are gliding along steadily through an ever-green world ; skirting the silent hills ; passing from one side of the river to the other as the horses have to swim the current to find a good foothold on the bank . You are on the water , but not at its mercy , for your craft is not disturbed by the heaving of rude waves , and the serene inhabitants do not say " I am sick . " There is room enough to move about without falling overboard . You may sleep , or read , or write in your cottage , or sit // upon the floating piazza in an armchair and smoke the pipe of peace , while the cool breeze blows in your face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was one feature about the boat , which commended itself very strongly to my mind . It was possible to stand upon the forward deck and do a little trout-fishing in motion . By watching your chance , when the corner of a good pool was within easy reach , you could send out a hasty line and cajole a seatrout from his hiding-place . It is true that the tow-ropes and the post made the back-cast a little awkward ; and the wind sometimes blew the fly up on the roof of the cabin ; but then , with patience and a short line the thing could be done . I remember a pair of good trout that rose together just as we were going through a boiling rapid ; and it tried the metal of my six-ounce Imbrie rod to bring those fish to the net against the current and the motion of the boat . When nightfall approached we let go the anchor ( to wit , a rope tied to a large stone on the shore ) , ate our dinner " with gladness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slept the sleep of the just , lulled by the murmuring of the waters , and defended from the insidious attacks of the mosquito by the breeze blowing down the river and the impregnable curtains over the beds . At daybreak , long before Favonius and I had finished our dreams , we were under way again ; and when the trampling of the horses on some rocky shore wakened us , we could see the steep hills gliding past the windows and hear the rapids dashing against the side of the boat , and it seemed as if we were still dreaming . At Cross Point , where the river makes a long loop around a narrow mountain , thin as a saw and crowned on its jagged edge by a rude wooden cross , we stopped for an hour to try the fishing . It was here that I hooked two mysterious creatures , each of which took the fly when it was below the surface , pulled for a few moments in a sullen way and then apparently melted into nothingness . It will always be a source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must remain unknown . While they were on the line it was the general opinion that they were heavy trout ; but no sooner had they escaped unseen , than I became firmly convinced , in accordance with a psychological law which is well known to fishermen , that they were both enormous salmon . No one can alter that conviction , because no one can logically refute it . Our best blessings , like our largest fish , always depart before we have time to measure them . The Slide Pool is in the wildest and most picturesque part of the river , about thirty-five miles above Metapedia . The stream , flowing swiftly down a stretch of rapids between forest-clad hills , runs straight toward the base of an eminence so precipitous that the trees can hardly find a foothold upon it , and seem to be climbing up in haste on either side of the long slide which leads to the summit . The current , barred by the wall of rock , takes a great sweep to the right , dashing up at first in angry waves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until at last it sleeps in a black deep , apparently almost motionless at the foot of the hill . It was here , on the upper edge of the stream , opposite to the slide , that we brought our floating camp to anchor for some days ; and here , if you please , I will try to establish some visible connection between this paper and its title by describing the capture of a IRestigouche salmon in the flesh , or perhaps one ought to say , in the fish . Let us take a " specimen day . " It is early morning , or to be more precise , about eight of the clock , and the white fog is just beginning to curl and drift away from the surface of the river . Sooner than this it would be idle to go out . The preternaturally early bird in his greedy haste may catch the worm ; but the fly is never taken until the fog has lifted ; and in this the scientific angler sees , with gratitude , a remarkable adaptation of the laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are waiting at the front door . We step into them and push off , Favonius going up the stream a couple of miles to the mouth of the Patapedia , and I down , a little shorter distance , to the famous Indian House Pool . The slim boat glides easily on the current , with a // smooth buoyant motion , quickened by the strokes of the paddles in the bow and the stern . We pass around two curves in the river and find ourselves at the head of the pool . Here the man in the stern drops the anchor , just on the edge of the bar where the rapid breaks over into the deeper water . The long rod is lifted ; the fly unhooked from the reel ; a few feet of line pulled through the rings , and the fishing begins . First cast ,  --  to the right , straight across the stream , about twenty feet : the current carries the fly down with a semicircular sweep until it comes in line with the bow of the canoe . Second cast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the same motion : the semicircle is completed , and the fly hangs quivering for a few seconds at the lowest point of the arc . Three or four feet of line are drawn from the reeL Third A quick , sure stroke of the steel l a great splash and the salmon in lifted high and dry spon the shore . // cast , to the right ; fourth cast , to the left . Then a little more line . And so , with widening half-circles , the water is covered , gradually and very carefully , until at length the angler has as much line out as his two-handed rod can lift and swing . Then the first " drop " is finished ; the man in the stern quietly pulls up the anchor and lets the boat drift down a few yards ; the same process is repeated on the second drop ; and so on , until the end of the run is reached and the fly has passed over all the good water . This seems like a very regular and somewhat mechanical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is rendered intensely interesting by the knowledge that , at any moment , it is liable to be interrupted by an agreeable surprise . One can never tell just when or how a " It seemed a picturesque way of travelling although none too safe . " // salmon will rise , or just what he will do when he has risen . This morning the interruption comes early . At the first cast of the second drop , before the fly has fairly lit , a great flash of silver darts from the waves close by the boat . Usually a salmon takes the fly rather slowly , carrying it under water before he seizes it in his mouth . But this one is in no mood for deliberation . He has hooked himself with a rush , and the line goes whirring madly from the reel as he races down the pool . Keep the point of the rod low ; he must have his own way now . Up with the anchor quickly , and send the canoe after him , bowman and sternman paddling with swift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stops to think what has happened to him ; we have passed around and below him ; and now with the current to help us we can begin to reel in . Lift the point of the rod , with a strong , steady pull . Put the force of both arms into it . The tough wood will stand the strain . The fish must be moved ; he must come to the boat if he is ever to be landed . He gives a little and yields slowly to the pressure . Then suddenly he gives too much , and runs straight toward us. iReel in now as swiftly as possible , or else he will get a slack on the line and escape . Now he stops , shakes his head from side to side , and darts away again across the pool , leaping high out of water . Drop the point of the rod quickly , for if he falls on the leader he will surely break it . Another leap , and another ! Truly he is " a merry one , " as Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to hold him . But those great leaps have exhausted his strength , and now he follows the line more easily . The men push the boat back to the shallow side of the pool until it touches lightly on the shore . The fish comes slowly in , fighting a little and making a few short runs ; he is tired and turns slightly on his side ; but even yet he is a heavy weight on the line , and it seems a wonder that so slight a thing as the leader can guide and draw him . Now he is close to the boat . The bowman steps out on a rock with his gaff . Steadily now and slowly , lift the rod , bending it VOL. 111-57 backward . A quick , sure stroke of the steel ! a great splash ! and the salmon is lifted high and dry upon the shore . How he flounces about on the stones . Give him the coup de grace at once , for his own sake as well as for ours . And now look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Broad back ; small head tapering to a point ; clean , shining sides with a few black spots on them ; it is a fish fresh-run from the sea , in perfect condition , and that is the reason why he has given such good sport . We must try for another before we go back . Again fortune favors us , and at eleven o'clock we pole up the river to the camp with two good salmon in the canoe . Hardly have we laid them away in the ice-box , when Favonius comes dropping down from Patapedia with three fish , one of them a twenty-four pounder . And so the morning 's work is done . In the evening , after dinner , it was our custom to sit out on the deck , watching the moonlight as it fell softly over the black hills and changed the river into a pale flood of rolling gold . The fragrant wreaths of smoke floated lazily away on the faint breeze of night . There was no sound save the rushing of the water and the crackling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things in the heavens above , and the earth beneath , and the waters under the earth ; touching lightly here and there as the spirit of vagrant converse led us . Favonius is one of those who believe with the old Roman " Dulce est desipere in loco . " He has the good sense , also , to talk about himself occasionally and tell his own experience . The man who will not do that must always be a dull companion . Modest egoism is the salt of conversation : you do not want too much of it ; but without any everything tastes ; flat . I remember well the evening when i he told me the story of the pet lamb ot the wilderness . " I was ill that summer , " said he , " and the doctor had ordered me to go into the woods , but on no account to go without plenty of fresh meat , which was essential to my recovery . So we set out // into the wild country north of Georgian iBay , taking a live lamb with us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be faithfully followed . It was a gentle and confiding little beast , curling itself up at my feet in the canoe , and following me about on shore like a dog . I gathered grass every day to feed it , and carried it in my arms over the rough portages . It ate out of my hand and rubbed its woolly head against my leggings . To my dismay I found that I was beginning to love it for its own sake and without any ulterior motives . The thought of killing and eating it became more and more painful to me , until at length the fatal fascination was complete , and my trip became practically an exercise of devotion to that Iamb . I carried it everywhere and ministered fondly to its wants . Not for the world would I have alluded to mutton in its presence . And when we returned to civilization I parted from the creature with sincere regret and the consciousness that I had humored my affections at the expense of my digestion . The lamb did not give me so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the grass beside the farm-house with an air of placid triumph . " After hearing this touching tale I was glad that no great intimacy had sprung up between Favonius and the chickens which we carried in a coop on the forecastle head , for there is no telling what inroads his tender-heartedness might have made upon our larder . But perhaps a chicken would not have given such an opening for misplaced affection as a lamb . There is a great difference in animals in this respect . I certainly never heard of any one falling in love with a salmon in such a way as to regard it as a fond companion . And this may be one reason why no sensible person who has tried fishing has ever been able to see any cruelty in it . For suppose the fish is not caught by an angler , what is his alternative fate ? He will either perish miserably in the struggles of the crowded net , or die of old age and starvation like the long , lean stragglers which are sometimes found in the shallow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or torn to pieces by a seal or " Not for the world would I have alluded to mutton in ito preuence. " an otter . Compare with any of these miserable deaths the fate of a salmon who is hooked in a clear stream and after a glorious fight receives the happy dispatch in the moment when he touches the shore . Why , it is a sort of euthanasia . And since the fish was made to be man 's food , the angler who brings him to the table of destiny in the cleanest , quickest , kindest way is , in fact , his benefactor . There were some days , however , when // our benevolent intentions toward the salmon were frustrated ; mornings when they refused to rise , and evenings when they escaped even the skilful endeavors of Favonius . In vain did he try every fly , in his book , from the smallest " Silver Doctor " to the largest " Golden Eagle . " The " Black Dose " would not move them ; the " Durham Ranger " covered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stray fish rose it was hard to land him , for he was usually but slightly hooked . I remember one of these shy creatures which led me a pretty dance at the mouth of Patapedia . He came to the fly just at dusk , rising very softly and quietly , as if he did not really care for it but only wanted to see what it was like . He went down at once into deep water , and began the most dangerous and exasperating of all salmon-tactics , moving around in slow circles and shaking his head from side to side , with sullen pertinacity . This is called " jigging , " and unless it can be stopped , the result is apt to be melancholy . I could not stop it . That salmon was determined to jig . He knew more than I did . The canoe followed him down the pooL He jigged away past all three of the inlets of the Patapedia , and at last in the still , deep water below , after we had labored with him for half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was immense , he calmly opened his mouth and the fly came back to me void . That was a sad evening , in which all the consolations of philosophy were needed . Sunday was a very peaceful day in our camp . In the Dominion of Canada the question " to fish or not to fish " on the first day of the week is not left to the frailty of the individual conscience . The law on the subject is quite explicit , and says that between six o'clock on Saturday evening and six o'clock on Monday morning all nets shall be taken up and no one shall wet a line . The Restigouche Salmon Club has its guardians stationed all along the river , and they are qulte as inflexible in seeing that their employers keep this law as the famous sentinel was in refusing to let Napoleon pass without the countersign . But I do not think that any of these keen sportsmen regard it as a hardship ; they are quite willing that the fish should have " an off day " in every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down at the mouth of the river have brought political influence to bear in their favor and obtained exemp .. tion from the rule . For our part , we were nothing loath to hang up our rods , and make the day different from other days . In the morning we had a service in the cabin of the boat , gathering a little congregation of guardians and boatmen and people from a solitary farm-house up the river . They came in pirogues-long , narrow boats hollowed from the trunk of a tree ; and as they pushed off on their homeward journey , the black-eyed , brown-faced girls sitting back to back in the middle of the boat , and the men standing up and bending to their poles , it seemed a picturesque way of travelling , although none too safe . In the afternoon we sat on deck and looked at the water . What a charm there is in watching a swift stream ! The eye never wearies of following its curls and eddies , the shadow of the waves dancing over the stones , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is a sort of fascination in it , lulling and soothing the mind into a quietude which is even pleasanter than sleep , and making it almost possible to do that of which we so often speak , but which we never qulte accomplish- " think about nothing . " Out on the edge of the pool , we could see five or six huge salmon , moving slowly from side to side , or lying motionless like gray shadows . There was nothing to break the silence except the thin , clear whistle of the " sweetwea-thrr , " and as the sun began to sink , the silver , bell-like notes of the " lost Kennedy " warbling to himself far back in the woods . These are almost the only bird-songs that one ever hears on the river , unless you count the metallic " chr-r-r-r " of the thievish king-fisher as a song . Every now and then one of the salmon in the pool would lazily roll out of water , or spring high into the air and fall back with a heavy splash . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain or pleasure ? Do they do it to escape the attack of another fish , or to shake off a parasite that clings to them , or to // practise jumping so that they can ascend the falls when they reach them , or simply and solely out of exuberant gladness and joy of living ? Any one of these reasons would be enough to account for it on week-days ; but on Sunday I am quite sure they do it for the trial of the fisherman 's faith . But how should I tell all the little incidents which made that inland voyage so delightful ? Favonius was the ideal host , for on water as well as on land , he knows how to provide for the liberty as well as for the wants of his guests . He understands also the fine art of conversation , which consists of silence as well as speech . And when it comes to angling , Izaak Walton himself could not have been a more profitable teacher by precept or example . Indeed , it is a curious thought , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Restigouche " I. W.* ' would have been somewhat at sea , for the beloved father of all fishermen passed through this world without ever catching a salmon . At last the days of idleness were ended . We could not " Fold our tents like the Arabs , And as silently steal away but we took down the long rods , put away the heavy reels , made the canoes fast to the side of the house , embarked the three horses on the front deck , and then dropped down with the current , swinging along through the rapids , and drifting slowly through the still places , now grounding on a hidden rock , and now sweeping around a sharp curve , until at length we saw the roofs of Metapedia and the ugly bridge of the railway spanning the river . There we left our floating-house , uncouth and motionless , like some strange water-monster , stranded on the shore . And as we climbed the bank we looked back and wondered whether Noah was sorry when he said good-by to his ark. @  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
