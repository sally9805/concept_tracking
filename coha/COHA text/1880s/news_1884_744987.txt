txt Nothing more startling than the prospect of a struggle between the management of the Chicago , Rock Island and Pacific Railroad and what is recognized as the Vanderbilt interest has been broached in financial circles in a long time . It was the general theme in Wallstreet yesterday and at the Windsor Hotel last evening . One operator said : " It is the biggest thing on the boards . " Computations were made , and it was said the wealth of the persons composing the opposition party aggregated as much as Mr. Vanderbilt 's individual wealth . If money were used in the fight , in the purchase of stock to carry the election , it was declared that it would be a battle of the giants . In the stock market , yesterday , Rock Island went up 1% on the news of the order secured by Harvey Kennedy to compel the exhibition of the transfer-books , in order to obtain a list of the stockholders . The Directors whose terms expire in June , and whose successors are to be elected then , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Francis H. Tows , and James R. Cowing , of New-York . The order , which is returnable on Monday , has not yet been served on Mr. R. R. Cable , tharesident of the Rock Island . The following was sent out on the " ticker " yesterday as an official statement by the Rook Island officers : " Mr. Vanderbilt 's efforts to acquire control of the road is in the interest of the North-west and can not succeed . While Mr. Vanderbilt is the largest individual stockholder , the present management control a majority of the stock and will not consent to any change . President Cable was the nominee of ex-President Riddle , and the latter gentleman is in accord with the present Policy of the road . " The following was sent out as a statement by Mr. Vanderbilt : " Mr. Vanderbilt stated this morning . that Mr. Kennedy was not acting for him , but he approved of what Mr. Kennedy was coins and did not say- that he would not have done the same thing himself . " The suit was begun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other stockholders . " Mr. Tows was asked if he knew who Mr. Kennedy represented . " Mr. Vanderbilt , of course , " replied Mr. Tows . " He admitted that to me himself . " " What is your explanation of the situation ? ' ' " Mr. Vanderbilt is the heaviest stockholder in Rock Island , it is true , but his interest in the North-western is 20 times larger than that in the Rock Island . The Rock Island has been extending its business and I suppose has trodden on Mr. Vanderbilt 's toes . He wants to get the management of the company . Mr. Kennedy asked for a list of the stockholders . I can not furnish it , because the names are constantly changing . If he had asked to look at the transfer-books he could have seen them . " Mr. Kennedy said , at his office , No. 68 Broadway , that the stockholders of the Rock Island would be applied to for their proxies for the purpose of putting in the directory three or four of the best railroad men in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the board , but they were so much occupied otherwise that they could not give their attention sufficiently to the road , The suit was brought in the name of all the shareholders . The large shareholders would be consulted in regard to the men to be put in the board . Mr. Kennedy did not believe that the present management held enough stock to entitle it to arbitrary sway . One object of the suit was to find out whether the party in power did . If Mr. Kennedy knew that they did he would feel like increasing hisjpresent holdings . He had great faith in the productive ability of the Rock Island , but no faith in its present management . Mr. Kennedy did not want to again become a Director himself . He was a large stockholder . He began the suit on his own responsibility , and not at the instance of Mr. Vanderbilt , with whom he bad had no consultation on the subject . Mr. Kennedy continued : " The road has , since the death of John F. Tracy and the retirement of W. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Daniel flows is an old gentleman and in poor health at this time , and Messrs . H. H. Porter and R. R. Cable are probably two of the most unpopular railroad managers in the North-west , the former being a speculative adventurer and the latter a coaldealer with little experience in the management of railroads . These Iwo men have been a source of untold trouble to the great railroad interests of the North-west . Mr. Hugh Riddle , a modest gentleman and a popular and favorite railroad manager , resigned his office of President in their interest without the knowledge of the stockholders . A few of the speculative Directors of the company will probably try to force upon this system the Minneapolis and St. Louis Railroad Company  --  a miserable and comparatively worthless property ? if by trading with themselves they can do so to their personal benefit . " An officer of the Rock Island said Mr. Kennedy 's holdings were about 1,000 shares , but fluctuated by trading . t was said that David Dows , the First Vice-President , had been SLID ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his attitude on the other side .
