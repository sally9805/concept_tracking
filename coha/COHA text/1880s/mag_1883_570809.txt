ARTICLE I1. - RECENT THEORIES OF WAGES . SOCIAL movements have a doctrinal basis . It is a long step* from a faulty theory of Capital to a communistic revolution ; but the connection is traceable . Society can not , indeed , be overturned by the stroke of a theorist 's pen ; but it may suffer changes through the general acceptance of an abstract principle having an application to the facts of life . It is not mere inequality that is likely to create tumults . The wild partizans of labor talk to the wage workers not merely about sufferings , but about wrongs . Something is said to be unjustly withheld from them ; there is a question of equity involved , and this requires an appeal to abstract principles . The baldest questions of material interest become , thus , moral questions ; and some of the subtlest of these are pre . sented in the theory of wages . They involve the validity of the title to every form of property that is created by the joint action of capital and labor ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is a question concerning wages which , rightly settled , tends to public order , wrongly settled , tends to communism , and unsettled , tends to agitation and uncertainty . The point at issue is the source of the remuneration of labor , or the true relation of wages to capital and to products . One answer to this question has been given by Mr. Henry George , in his suggestive work entitled Progress and Povertq . In this work it is clearly demonstrated that labor creates the value by which it is repaid , and that the laborer , as a rule , receives nothing from his employer until he has transferred something to the employer . The truth thus established is followed by misleading errors respecting the function of capital and the nature of wages . " As the employer generally makes a profit , " says Mr. George , " the payment of wages is , so far as he is concerned , but the return to the laborer of a portion of the capital he has received from the labor . So far as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a portion of the // capital his labor has previously produced . " Some one other than the wage worker must , then , receive a portion of the fruit of the laborer 's efforts . Wages come from the direct product of the labor itself ; and they constitute only one part of that product . An opposite answer to this far-reaching question has been given by Professor W. G. Sumner , in a recent Article in the Princeton Review . This Article maintains that wages are paid solely from capital antecedently accumulated , and that they stand in a relation to products which is remote and not ascertainable . This divorcement of wages and products is made the ground of inferences so important as to justify the closest examination of the principles from which they are derived . It is because wages come from capital and are disconnected from products that it is at once inferred : " ( 1 ) that all questions whether the laborer gets his share of the product or not are , under the wages system , nonsensical. ( 2 ) That the appeals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower wagbs , so that the English products can be sold cheaper in foreign markets , are founded on false conceptions of wages and ought to have no weight . ( 3 ) That the arguments of American protectionists , drawn from comparative rates of wages , are all fallacious. ( 4 ) That the attempt to connect wages with the price of products , by a sliding scale or otherwise , is founded on no true relations and is doomed to failure . " Can , then , this complete separation of wages and products be maintained ? The answer to this question decides the fate of the above inferences and of others , and it will , therefore , be interesting to examine the effective argument by which the theory is supported . It is proposed by Professor Sumner to divide time into intervals termed periods of production , including , in each case , the time required for the completing of a productive operation and the realizing of its returns . In agriculture the interval would be a season ; in manufacturing it would be whatever time might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to transform and sell them . Capital is regarded as fixed , in quantity , at the beginning of the operation , as consumed during the process , and as replaced , with a surplus , which is profits , from the products . Products do not exist until the close of the // Now each of the conclusions above cited has reference to tbat which is permanent , rather than to that which is transient . When the question is raised whether the laborer gets his share of products or not , it is usually intended to consider whether , year after year , he gets his share of the continuous supply of wealth which results from industry . The attempt of the English exporters to retain the control of foreign markets , by lowering wages , and that of the American protectionist to introduce manufactures , in spite of high wages , have in each case , reference to a permanent national policy that shall operate for decades , including an indefinite number of periods of production . If the fallacy of these measures is to be demonstrated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation should be shown to hold true of the aggregate wages and the aggregate products of an indefinite interval . Moreover , the sliding scale of wages sometimes advocated is a permanent arrangement , whereby the workmen may share in the benefits of a time of continuous prosperity , and bear their proportions of the burdens of continuous adversity . It would seem that whatever inferences as to the success of the plan are to be drawn from the relation of wages to products should be based on the relation of continuous wages to continuous products , rather than on that of a particular fraction of the one to a particular fraction of the other . Again , as the employer , during a single month , takes from a reserve of capital the sum which he pays to the workman , in the expectation of replacing it from products , it would seem that the replacement , rather than the mere advance , is the virtual payment . The water drawn from the reservoir of a city comes , in effect , from the river , which is the source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but it is the permanent withdrawal of water from its ultimate source that constitutes the process of supplying the draught , though the particular drops taken from the river may not reach the city for some time . The reservoir contains a more or less constant quantity of hydraulic capital ; it is its function to make advances , to change the time when a draught from the perennial source among the hills shall produce its effect at the hydrants of the city . If we are justified in saying that the // river supplies the city , though every draught come from the reservoir , we are justified in saying , as Mill and others have done , that products are the source of wages , though every payment be from capital . The connection between wages and products is , however , closer and more literal than this . It appears not only when the two are considered in the aggregate , but when they are analyzed into their component parts ; the successive increments of each are as closely connected as the sum total . The ultimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but there is a direct product which is their immediate source . This will appear from an analysis of the process of distribution . When the value created by a joint operation is divided among persons who have acted simultaneously to produce it , the process may be termed simple or direct distribution . It is thus that barrels of oil are shared by the crew of the returned whaling ship . There is a single bargain , including all the parties concerned , before the commencement of the operation , and a single distributing act in fulfillment of the contract , at its close . Both production and distribution ordinarily take place , not by a single operation , but by a succession of many . One producer begins with crude nature , and so modifies it as but partially to prepare it for rendering its service to men ; another and another continue the operation . The ultimate result of the agency of all is a completed product , and the particular change effected by each may be distinguished as a sub.product . The process by which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have acted successively to create it , may be termed complex or indirect distribution . It is thus that the value of finished garments is distributed among tailors , merchants , manufacturers , wool dealers , and farmers . The farmer gets his share in that total value in obtaining the market price for his wool . The manufacturer receives his portion in obtaining the market value of the increment of utility imparted to the wool by its transformation into cloth ; and as the wool and the increment of utility constitute two distinct sub-pro. ducts , this distributing process resolves itself juto a succession of sales , in which , in each case , a producer buys all the anteriver // supplies the city , though every draught come from the reservoir , we are justified in saying , as Mill and others have done , that products are the source of wages , though every pay* ment be from capital .

The manufacturer receives his portion in obtaining the market value of the increment of utility imparted to the wool by its transformation into cloth ; and as the wool and the increment of utility constitute two distinct sub-pro. ducts , this distributing process resolves itself into a succession of sales , in which , in each case , a producer buys all the antecedent // sub-products , with a view to afterwards selling them , with the addition of his own . Each bargain includes , not all the parties in the entire productive operation , but two of them . The farmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturer . In effect , however , each shares with all the others ; and the total amount to be shared is kept constantly in view . The ultimate value of the garment fixes the maximun* value of the cloth , and thus , indirectly , the maximum value of the wool . The increment of value which we have termed a sub-product is always a distinct thing , easily recognized and separated from what may be called the elementary value , which resides in the raw material . It is indifferent whether at any time , the transformation is complete or incomplete ; wool partly woven has received a form value as easily detected as that of the finished cloth . The entire distributing process involves , first , the dividing of the total value of a product , as completed and ready for consumptiou7 among the different agents who have worked successively to create it ; this , as we have seen , is equivalent to assigning to each independent producer or company of producers the market value of a sub-product . It involves , secondly , the dividing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have acted simultaneously to create it . The wage contract and its fulfillment constitute a part of each of these processes . The agents which create the sub-product are labor and fixed capital ; and workmen and employer have each a certain ownership in the joint result . The division of the value of it between them is an act of direct distribution . The relation of the parties is analogous to that of the owner and the crew of the whaling ship ; in each case there is a contract which arranges the division of the product before the product exists ; the actual sharing process takes place when each party receives his portion . It is not practicable , in most industries , to divide the product . in kind , as is done in the whale fishery ; and it is necessary that one of the owners should buy the interest of the other . The employer is , of course , the purchaser . The wage contract arranges the terms of the purchase ; the thing to be transferred is an undivided share in a sub-product , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separating that sub-product into shares , and of arranging for the purchase of one share by the owner of the other . The division is an act of direct distribution , while the purchase of the one share is an act in indirect distribution . It is one of the series of exchanges which , as a whole , divide the value of the ultimate product , in finished garments or otherwise , among all engaged in creating it . The employer becomes virtually , the customer of the workman ; and his relation to him , in this one respect , is analogous to the relation of the wholesale merchant to the employer . The direct reward of each productive operation is the product created ; this has value before it is sold , and the sale only transmutes that value into a form convenient for farther use . The form value imparted to wool repays all parties engaged in manufacturing cloth ; and a share in it repays the laborer . It comes to him in forms adapted for his use , and the particular things which are given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet the transaction , as a whole , causes no diminution of that capital , and does not , therefore , consume it ; the amount taken from the fund by the payment of wages is simultaneously added to it by the transfer from the workman to his employer of the fractional product for which wages are a payment . The workman puts into the fund as much as he withdraws ; and the figure which best indicates the function of capital is not that of a reservoir diminished by draughts representing wage payments , and simultaneously replenished from an ulterior source ; it is rather that of a reservoir into which the laborer himself pumps water , that he may receive , for use , other water which is thus made to overflow from it . If , by wages , we mean the particular commodities which the laborer receives , they come from capital ; the water which , in the figure , is drawn for use comes from the reservoir . If , by wages , we mean a value , an abstract quantum of wealth which repays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from capital , but are an immediate creation of labor itself ; in this more essential meaning of the terms the relation of wages to products is one of identity . In a sense which includes both meanings and accords with curreut use , wages are the immediate j*roduct of labor , transmuted in form by Ike intervention of capital . // They are a value received for a value created and transferred in fulfillment of an antecedent contract . We are now prepared to appreciate the essential truth and to guard against one misleading error contained in the former of the two theories of wages above cited , that , namely , of Mr. George . It is true that a substantial product is the immediate result of labor ; it is not true that that product includes the entire result of the industry . It is true that wages , considered as an abstract value , independently of the form in which they are embodied , are identical with the product of the labor for which they are a payment ; but the identity extends to quantity ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Under the present system wages are the entire market value of the real result of labor . We should neither claim for the laborer too much nor concede to him too little ; it is equally undiscerning to claim for him the total returns of the creative process in which he assists , and to deny his title to the fractional sub-*oduct which is a component element in that total . He is one of two creators , and he sells his share at the prevalent rate and receives its exact value . The practical importance of these principles affords the excuse , if any is needed , for pursuing thus minutely the analy. sis of the nature of wages ; for not only do the particular conclusions above cited depend on it , but the attitude toward each other of the two great classes of modern society is determined by it . The practical question of the present and future is that of justice in the distribution of the rewards of social effort . On the part of the discontented there is a disposition to challenge the justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a principle of ultimate equity . There is a resort to " higher law " doctrines , for the sake of justifying assaults on existing law ; socialism seeks diligently for moral grounds for its action . There is , therefore , on the part of many conservative economists , a disposition to avoid the recognition of moral forces in economic affairs , and even to associate the infusing of an ethical element into political economy , with ultra-progressive tendencies . According to this view there should be no questions of j ustice raised where the law of demand and supply is in control . The theory which separates wages from // May , products affords a ground for such a course ; for if nothing is divided between employers and men , there is , of course , no question as to an equitable division . The Article which we have cited expressly states that " wages do not belong in distribution , " that they " involve no social question , or struggle of class with class , " and that principles of justice , as commonly understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the part of safety to shun moral issues in economic discussion ? Should we refer everything to the law of demand and supply , without attempting to give to that law itself a ground of existence ? Would not such a course render us liable to the accusation of making of demand and supply a Juggernaut car which overrides principles as well as men ? Property may once have existed solely de facto ; a man may once have owned only that which he could conceal or forcibly guard . The institution now exists de jure , and a man owns all that , in the opinion of society , as expressed in its laws , it is just that he should retain . Moral forces which created property have had an increasing minuteness of application in della . ing and enforcing it . They have taken cognizance of the modes of acquiring it . Originally all was left to an unrestricted competitive struggle , in which the contestants spared neither life nor limb . Murder and assault were first inter . dicted , and then injuries of a less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject to progressive restraints , and this process is by no means completed . We may still do that to our competitors which ideal morality condemns , and which positive law may , at some time , interdict . We may not lie unrestrainedly ; the statutes against obtaining property by false pretenses will see to it that mercantile falsehood has limits ; but , by avoiding the statute , we may still deceive . We may not place our competitor in the river and , by frequent submergings , compel him to sell his homestead for half its value ; but we may place him in commercial exigencies , and extort a portion of his property . We may do much that , in an ideal state , we could not do ; and it is not only competent to compare both the methods and the results of the present system with a perfect standard , but our hope lies in the fact that the comparison is constantly made , and that the existing // order is compelled into increasing conformity with the best that human reason can conceive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect , nor as perfect as it will be ; but it is better than any substitute offered , and its continuance is , for that , certain If socialism were to be introduced for a night , competition would return in the morning . Here and there competition works exceptionally ill , something else works unusually well , and voluntary cooperation , or some form of public agency takes a particular industry out of the competitive field . The province of non-competitive industries is real and increasing ; but never , until a moral millennium shall come , can it embrace the entire economic life of a nation . While there is no danger that any theory may establish a permanent reign of practical socialism , there is a general and not unfounded fear of agitations and attempts in this direction ; and systems of economic science must submit to be judged , not merely by their correctness or incorrectness , but by their seeming tendency to strengthen or to weaken the social fabric . In this view can that theory be the one desired which in any way obscures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sustaining the institution of property , and which tends , however remotely , to place that institution again on a defacto basis ? If theories must be judged by their effects , practical measures must certainly be so ; and here , also , are opportunities for differences of view . If mere stability be the object of consideration , opinions will differ as to the best mode of ensuring it . The general principle holds true , in the economic as well as in the political sphere , that , when revolutionary movements are imminent , a sound practical policy takes a middle course between anarchism , on the one hand , and the Bourbonism that learns nothing and forgets nothing , on the other . Progress is imperative , and the choice offered is between different methods of obtaining it . There is one force the agency of which tends both to stability and to progress ; it is the sense of right in men . It is the ultimate socializing power , creating , preserving and perfecting economic society . It should be given the freest play , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory ; and if there is a point in the social system where , more than elsewhere , its action should be recognized , it is in the mode of securing to the laborer the value which he creates ; that is , in the making and fulfilling of the wage contract . If there be socialism enough in the air to seriously unsettle the rights of property , it is necessary that those rights be made clearly demonstrable . Original production and valid transfer afford the only sound basis of tenure of any form of wealth ; and if we are ever to be called on to show our abstracts of title to personal as well real estate , we must be able to show such a chain of free and valid transfers , beginning , in each instance , with the producer . Force or fraud anywhere in the series beclouds the title ; hut a failure to trace the series to an original producer invalidates it . If the laborer be not regarded as having produced , owned and freely sold that portion of manufactured croods which directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how any later title to it can be perfect . It will be difficult to convince the laborer that he can so far dehumanize himself as to lose , otherwise than by a sale for an equivalent , his title to that which he actually creates . It is little less than suicidal to shrink from the application of moral tests to this part of the economic system . If there be a form of teaching not calculated to strengthen the social fabric , it is one that should present the existing order of society with its severer features in the foreground , and , at the same time , obscure the application of the principle on which every valid title to property rests , to the point in the system where titles originate .
