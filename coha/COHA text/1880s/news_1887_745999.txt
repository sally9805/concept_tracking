txt Considering the manner in which Mayor HEWITT was elected , it is perhaps not to be wondered at that the professional tax eaters around the City Hall should be in advance dividing the spoil of the offices in which the terms of the present incumbents are shortly to expire . Among these are a Police Commissioner , a Dock Commissioner , a Commissioner of Charities , and a Fire Commissioner . Even more important than most of these , from the point of view of patronage , is the office of the Commissioner of Street Cleaning , which will become vacant at the end of May by the expiration of Mr. COLEMAN 'S term . Of . course the supposition that these offices will be parceled out as spoils among the professional politicians is an insult to Mr. HEwrrr , and his official conduct has thus far given no excuse for such an insult . The most important office he has had to fill is the Presidency of the Health Department . This was vacated by a man who was not only universally believed to be ineligible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bribes , but who in particular was no more a sanitarian than he was a megalosaurus . The long delay of Gov . HILL in affirming the removal of SEALER was commonly attributed to a desire to secure as SEALER 'S successor a political supporter of his own . In this case there was a fear , again founded upon the manner of the Mayor 's election , that he might be induced to gratify the Governor by the appointment of a Hill " worker . " He hastened to show- that this fear was groundless by appointing a man who had some standing as a sanitarian and no standing at all as a politician . There is no reason to suppose that the Mayor will deal in a different spirit with the appointments that are to fall in a month hence . If the present incumbents of the offices have served the public well it is natural and proper that they should be preferred to new men . This condition is fulfilled by one or two of them but not by all . With regard to the Commissionership of Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reappointment that nobody else should be thought of as his successor if he is willing to keep the place . Nobody who knows how the work is done now and who remembers how it used to be left undone can fail to recognize and to be grateful for the improvement . It is by no means all that it should be even now , but the shortcomings are not attributable to the Commissioner . New-York can never be thoroughly well cleaned until it is better paved . If Commissioner COLEMAN has not done quite all that he could , even - with the means at his command , he has done so much more and better than anybody else has done within the past quarter of a century that it would be at once an indignity to him and a misfortune for the public if he were not offered a reappointment . The whole course of our municipal affairs has improved so much since the removal of the requirement that the Board of Aldermen shall assent to the Mayor 's appointments as to give good hope for the future . Mayor GRACE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used the enlarged powers vested in them for the public benefit . In truth , no Mayor , even of the worst type , would venture to make , when the whole responsibility was put upon him , such appointments as were habitually made when the consent of the Aldermen was required . Even EDSON found it necessary to apologize for some of his most disreputable appointments by saying that if they had been better they could not have been confirmed . Of course a hardened spoilsmen , such as the men who are now speculating upon the chance that Mayor HEWITT will betray the public in their interest , if he attained the Mayoralty , would appoint persons of his own kind . The difficulty is , as even the spoilsmen are aware , that it will not do to nominate one of themselves for Mayor . It is necessary to go outside for a man who has some standing and repute among his fellow-citizens , and no such man will venture to appoint to important places the representatives and creatures even of the spoilsmen who put him in nomination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and integrity is continually rising , and we may confidently expect the administrative work of the city to be better done hereafter than it has been done heretofore.
