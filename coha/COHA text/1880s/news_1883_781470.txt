" At least once a year somebody announces that he has invented  --  a balloon capable of navigatingthe ' air instead of drifting with it , but there always proves to be some slight defect in the invention : : The latest air ship , is the invention of Capt . PETERSON , and it is to be ready next August to- cross the Atlantic in three days . . With this . ship . the inventor assures us that : mankind can " completely discover both ; the South and the Worth Pole of our globe entire . " This prospect is'so much more enticing than that of incompletely . discovering small pieces of the poles-that it ought alone to be a sufficient recommendation of the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inform us of the ship 's " complete adaptability to tack the air in a vertical plane similar to a sailing ship in ' the water . " ' So far as is known there exists no. general demand that the air should be . tacked , and no one has shown any . longing to see a vertical plane similar to a sailing ship . ? . . Capt . PET813 , SON 'S air ship resembles in most of its features a long list of previous airships . It istnerely. a balloon with an elaborate'car and two rudders  --  a vertical rudder at ' the-bow and a horizontal rudder at the stern . It is to be lifted and . kept in the air by gas , and its distinguishing peculiarity is that its progress through the air is . to be a series of gigantic hops . According to the theory of the ' inventor of this aerial . flea , it will rise or descend in an oblique direction , provided . the horizontal rudder at ' the stern is placed . at a proper angle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine six miles , it . *ill advance 400 miles , in consequence of the oblique direction ' given . to it by the rudder . When the elevation of , six miles is reached the volume of gas in ' he balloon , which had previously been expanded by heat , will be reduced by cold , ' and the air ship will descend obliquely , ' advancing 400 more miles . Four jumps ' of this kind will more than carry the ship from here , to England , even without a fair wind to help her On her course . The ingenious inventor compares the flight of his.air ship to that of a kite . The resemblance would be more striking if a ? boy and.astring : Were attached to his invention . Kites , no.matter how light they may be , . have never.been , successfully flown without the help of a string , and the moment a kite 's string ' breaks the kite falls , no matter how carefully ' lts tail may have been constructed. : .

' It can ' easily be made to sail from here to Europe , - provided , the boy who holds the string crosses in a steamer and gives his whole attention-to keeping the Peterson ship in the air and preventing it from " diving " whenever a gust of wind strikes it . The - most marvelous thing in connection with all these schemes of navigating the air . is the Uniform ' . care with which the inventors ignore the fact that a balloon moves with and not through the air , so that the air offers no resistance to the balloon analogous to that which water offers to a ship . Capt . PETERSON 'S scheme , is precisely like all its predecessors in assuming that the air offers a resistance to an . object floating in it so great that it can be used in steering the object . A model of his air ship may seem entirely successful in a room . in which the air is at rest , but it would be the sport of every breeze were it to be tested in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
