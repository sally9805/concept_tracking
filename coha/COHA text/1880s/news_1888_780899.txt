txt A collision occurred Sunday at about 12:15 P.M. 60 miles east by south of CapesEtenry , by which it is thought the larga passenger ship Eureka of the Morgan Line , running from New-York to New-Orleans , Was-sunk with all on board . The British steamShip Benison , Capt . Aitkenhead , bound from Matanzas , Cuba , to Philadelphia with a cargo of sugarin bags was the vessel which was in collision with the Eureka . The Benison arrived here yesterday morning about 10 o'clock in tow of the tugs Edwin Ludlow and Monarch , which had picked her up in Hampton Roads , to which point she had been towed by the steamship Hudson , also bound from New-York to NewOrleans . The Benison 's bow from the rail almost to her keel is crushed in for a distance of 10 feet , and the iron of which her hall was built is twisted and torn out of all semblance to its former shape . The hole , through which the tide now ebbs and flows . wouldalmost admit a coach and , pair to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plates are started for some distance abaft the main break , and the vessel would sink . where she now lies were it not for the fact that she is on bottom and can get no further . None of the crew of the Benison were lost or- hurt by the collision , but the sea which rushed into the break made by It cleared out the foreeastle and many of them lost their kits and all their possessions . Capt . Aitkenhead of the Benison was seen by Tax - Toms 's correspondent soon aftetshis arrival here , and the rest of the story is best told in-his own words . Capt . Aitkenhead says : " The day was close and sultry and fogs hung . heavy and thick , from time-to time euveleping us . At the time for the midday observation for determining our latitude and longitude the fog was so thick that a ' sight ' could not be had . This falling , the next thing was to take a sounding to determine the character of the bottom , and thus fix our position . The steamship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hauled aboard with a good sample of bottom , the steamer was rung ahead slow and I ' went down to look at the chart . By this time the fog had lifted somewhat , and while I was examining the chart I was very much surprised to hear a blast of the steamer 's whistle , as while on deck nothing was seen to make such a thing at all necessary . " I hastened . on , deck and found that while I was below the fog had fallen on us like a cloud , and it was almost impossible to see the length of the ship . I asked the mate what was the matter . He answered that there was a steamer lust ahead . I asked how he knew , and he said that he heard her whistle , and told me to listen . I immediately went to the bridge and ordered the helm hard sport , and the mate sprang to assist the man at the wheeL I caught hold of the whistle rope and gave several sharp blasts and received as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I , of course , in accordance with the regulations , ordered my helm to starboard though I had already swung several points to the eastward , and the unfortunate result of this move was seen in less time than I can tell it . " Just at this moment I heard the throb of the steamer 's engines and saw the line of foam around her how , and rung the engines back full speed , but too late . The steamer was going full speed and crossed our bows like a flash of lightning , and as we swung in obedience to the propellers we struck her bow on , just abaft the bridge on the starboard side . The Benison rounded and spun around from the force of the blow , and the Eureka ? such was the name seen on her bow by . the mate when we struck  --  rushed on into the fog and out of sight . After the Eureka had disappeared in the fog several blasts from her whistle and the sound of escaping steam were heard . On the Benison everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crew into them . But finding that we were not making much water , the crew did not get into the boats and the firemen and engineers were ordered to start the pumps and quiet was restored . " About a half hour after-the collision the fog lifted , and when we looked . around nothing , of the Eureka could be seen . Shortly after this a steamship hove in sight and answered our signals of distress , and coming to us , proved to be the Hudson from New-York . She lay by us until the hole in our bow had been partially covered with tarpaulins and then took us in tow , and we arrived in Hampton Roads , where we were taken in tow by the tugs Ludlow and Bliniarch . During the trip from the scene of the collision to Hampton Roads it was thought that the Benison would go down and all of the crew except the engineers were transferred to the Hudson . " Capt . Aitkenhead noted his preliminary pro-test to-day , and a survey was held , which ordered him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been heard here up to this time from the Eureka , and the signal and life-saving stations along the coast , as far south as Hatteras , report that they have seen nothing of her . It is barely possible that the Eureka may have gone south with the fog which enveloped both boats at the time of the collision , but this is not probable . and it is hardly to be thought that had the Eureka been in condition to float that she would have deserted what might have been a sinking ship and perishing crew ; Taking this view of the matter , shipping men here entertain the gravest fears for her safety . No wreckage of any kind has so far been reported anywhere along the coast . J. T. Van Sickle , agent of Morgan 's Texas and Louisiana Railroad and Steams/ilp Company , to which the Eureka belongs , yesterday said to a Timm reporter that he had received no farther Information than that there had been a collision . The Eureka was a freight steamer under command of Capt . Quick , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 38 men . She carried no passengers . From the fact that he bad received no further advises he inferred that the Eureka was not so badly injured , but that she could proceed upon her way . It was hardly conceivable , he thought , that the vessel could have gone down at once and with all hands and nothing be known of it by the other colliding vesseL There was no especially rough weather , only a dense fog , and if the Eureka had been severely injured her crew would have taken to the boats , and either have been picked sip by the Benison or proceeded- directly to Cape Henry or Norfolk . In the latter possibility nothing would likely be heard from the survivors before today . But it is nothing more than a bare possibility that the crew were compelled to take to the boats , because the dispatch says that the fog lifted in half an hour after the collision and the Benison put in at Norfolk . If the crew of the Eureka had taken to the boats they would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an iron screw steamer now in her fourth year of service . She was built at the yard of William Cramp dr . Sons , Philadelphia , in 1884 . She is 331.8 feet long , 42.6 feet wide , 22.6 feet depth of hold . and has a registered gross tonnage of 3,531.32 tons . Capt . Hawthorne of the steamer El Monte of the Morgan Line yesterday afternoon arrived in port . He reports that at 4:20 o'clock Sunday afternoon , when 20 miles northeast of Hatteras , he passed between the whistles of two steamers . There was a dense fog prevailing at the time , but the sea was smooth . He ' thought at the time that the whistle on his port side was that of the Eureka . The steamers of the Morgan Line all have peculiar ' whistles , and they could be readily distinguished by them at a distance by any one familiar with them . The location , too , accords with the probable location of the Eureka at the time .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
