txt A brief dispatch in the Newport papers to-day refers to a most distressing suicide of a brilliant young man . On Thursday morning a telegram was received at the Newport office of the United , States Geolog-ical Survey to the effect that Bayard T. Putnam , in charge of a surveying party on Hoosac Mount-ain , had been missing from camp for two days , and asking for information . Orders for the in-stitution of an immediate and thorough search were wired back , and a few hours later the sad intelligence that Mr. Putnam 's lifeless body had been found was received , but with no particulars . Later advices , however , gave the facts of his suicide . Mr. Putnam was a brother of G. P. Putnam 's Sons , the New-York publishers , and was well known here , where he had spent much of his , time for several years . He came here when the tenth census was taken , and was sub-sequently in the North Transcontinental Survey Office . He afterward entered the Government service under Prof. Pumpelly , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the country . At the time of his death , although only 30 years of age , Mr. Putnam was at the head of the party at North Adams . He was most highly esteemed in both professional avid social circles , and the news of his untimely end is a great shock to his Newport friends , who speak of him as being the very last person to be thought of as a suicide . He had a severe attack of typhoid fever here about a year ago from which he never fully recovered , and it is thought the exposure among the mountains must have so worked upon his weakened constitution as to cause temporary insanity . Mr. Putnam leaves a widow , who was a Miss Thaoher , of New-York , and one child about 2 years of age . They occupied a cottage during the Summer , and It was only a few days ago that Mr. Putnam was in correspondence with Newport parties for the lease of a cottage for the Winter . The delicate duty of breaking the intelligence of his death to Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D. Taylor , intimate friends of the family , who went to Conanicut Island , just across the bay from Newport , where Mrs. Putnam was staying , onThursday and remained with the afflicted lady until to-day , when she went to New-York to meet the body of her husband .
