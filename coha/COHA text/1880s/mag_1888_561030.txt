IMAGINE a medium sized man in clerical cut clothes , and a dark grayish beard . His sightless eyes are cast upwards , and in a melodious voice and well measured accents he is delivering the morning prayer to the House . To me there is something indescribably solemn in this blind man 's exhortation . Congressmen are not proverbial for their reverence , but their attention at prayers is always respectful , and compares favorably with that of Senators at the other end of the Capitol . Indeed there is only one Senator , I understand , who makes a rule of always being on hand at prayers , and the president of that august body has grown so accustomed to the absence of the rest that instead of calling upon them as a whole , he simply expresses the hope that the Senator from that particular State " will please come to order . " Be this as it may , the anecdote has given time for the prayer of ourchaplain to draw to a close . The Speaker 's gavel descends with a sharp rap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clerk is reading , iu a hard prosaic voice , the doings of the previous day . This concluded , the reports of committees are made , and this in turn over , the House settles down to business . Do I say " settles down , " rather startles up into life . What a hub-bub it is ! To the novice it appears the very realization of the Anarch 's dream ; but gradually , as he watches , studies and observes , he gets hold of the end of the skein and undoes the snarl . Then he begins to appreciate what a wonderful machine the organism of the House is . I say machine , for it is literally a machine . A machine in the highest acceptation of the word , and the noise is but the gyrations and the revolutions of its numberless wheels . To be anything here you must be part of this machinery : the big wheels being the Chairmen of the prominent committees and making in their revolutions the most noise ; the little wheels making not quite so much , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // too , this is cruel . A new member gets up to air his eloquence. because he has not yet had time to become a part of the cosmos of the House , to fit himself into its wonderful system ; the machine falls upon him , crushes him , rolls him out fiat and throwing him to one side goes on in its heartless , pittiless regularity as bc*i'e . For this reason the career of a Randolph Churchill would be a matter of absolute impossibility here , and if you will search the records you will find that not a solitary member has made during his first term quite the mark that precocious young man did in Parliament . In short there is less jumping into sudden prominence with us , and though there are brilliant exceptions to this , as in the cases of Mr. Cockran , Mr. Cummings , Mr. Lodge and Mr. Raynor , in a general way distinction in the House is usefulness in the House , and this usefulness can alone be purchased by a long apprenticeship . The rules of the House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gradually and slowly falls away from about your limbs . Nevertheless new members are apt to think that they know these rules ; they have read them up of course , and probably have learnt them by heart . Three months afterwards it gradually dawns upon them that they are as ignorant of their practical application as they are of the characters of the Chinese grammar . Four years later , if sufficiently fortunate to be occasionally called to the Chair , they may occasionally be detected earnestly conferring as to some vexed question of order with the journal clerk , whose advice , if they are sensible , they will be quick to take and to express accordingly . The last journal clerk used to be of invaluable assistance to a new chairman . He was the arbiter of arbiters on any matter of House regulation when all other arbiters have failed . In a sense Harry Smith was and might even be now considered the very center of the hub of our political system , for he has codified the rules fhat govern the most important branch of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of these rules ? To facilitate the business of law making ? No , decidedly not . Then it is to prevent legislation . Well , I will not go quite so far as to assert that . Their purpose rather is to prevent hasty legislation , and they are resorted to by the minority to protect themselves . // Notice how magnificently the leader on the wrong side of the House employs them . Notice how by means of them he often makes the wrong come right . I must confess I am a great admirer of this gentleman from Maine , in all but his political principles . As regards his qualities of a speaker , I have heard far more eloquent men and far more brilliant men , but never one who spoke more to the point . You are always sure that he is dead wrong , but he makes you think at the moment that he is dead right , for he not only has the talent of knowing just what to say , but the genius of knowing just when to leave off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment the buzz of conversation , penetrating the confused din the way a keen-edged wind will do a fog . His very personality assists his leadership . Heavy and yet not pompous he stands during a debate with head cocked on one side , always attentive . Coming down the aisle , now to the rescue of one of his weaker followers , now to the attack of one of his staunchest adversaries , he is a tower of strength , to which all his party cling . Notice his generalship on the subject of the Speaker 's contested seat . See how skillfully he threw the Democrats into the false position of appearing to try to keep " an honest son of toil " out of his rights . Not a man of the Republicans but knew that Carlisle was duly elected ; not a man of them but recognized his fairness as a Speaker and felt besides a sincere sympathy for him in his illness ; but by a skillful series of manoeuvres these sentimental consideratious were avoided and the onus of responsibility thrown on the Committee of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly when it was decided that the contestant should be heard in his own defense . Up to now Thoebe had been an abstraction , but suddenly he rose from among our very midst , where he had been quietly seated unbeknown to us . " That 's Theobe ; there he is , " and every eye was directed to a medium-sized man standing behind a desk . There was something of the coup de thealre in the abruptness of his appearance , but I must allow I was rather taken with his looks . An earnest face it seemed to me , as I saw it in profile ; a rather low forehead , a slightly turned up nose and a very long goatee like a three-inch stick depending from the end of his chin . Yet it was a sad , care-worn face , a face that never smiled . His black frock coat was buttoned at the last button , and he frequently used his handkerchief to press it to his lips . // His speech , however , was disappointing . With all due allowance for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time-as critical , exacting an audience as perhaps exists in the world-his defense hardly came up to what his looks had led us to hope . It was disconnected and rambling , and this could hardly be excused by embarrassment , since he appeared perfectly cool and self-possessed . Nevertheless , he was every now and then vociferously applauded , even by the Democrats , particularly when I think from a slip of the tongue he said , " that he did not consider it much of an honor to be elected to this House . " Equally with the gentleman from Maine the gentleman from Pennsylvania always attracts the attention of a new member , for equally when he speaks a hush falls over Congress . It is the silent homage the House pays , and it pays it conspicuously to these two men . Both these men inspire confidence in their followers , if not enthusiasm . Comparing them together , I should say the one is a great debater , the other a forcible speaker . The one always having the word , the other sometimes laboring for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for phraseology , carries with it its own peculiar force , for a crowded brain , as a crowded church , emits its inmates slowly . Vigor , power is in Randall 's face , in the nervous twitching of the eyes and mouth ( as if about to smile , but that so often do not smile ) ; in the very movement of the shoulders , and still more so in the index finger now pointed outwards , or again as it is raised to the spectacles to lift them up to the forehead from off the eyes . A great , strong , powerful intellect is in this man 's head , relieved by a subtle smile that comes at last , and at the least expected moment , to light up the sombre face . And yet he can speak fervently at times . What a meaning there was in his remarks , deeper and truer than mere flowers of rhetoric could convey , when a few weeks ago , in behalf of Congress , he accepted the pictures that Massachusetts had presented of her distinguished speakers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their responsibilities , their oft unrecompensed labors , and the scantiness of their reward . Earnest as was his address , however , it offered a striking contrast in style and phraseology to that of Mr. Breckenridge , of Kentucky , who seconded the motion . With a voice as silvery as the silver of his own gray hair he fairly thrilled his hearers , and , passing through all grades of eloquence , he rose to a climax of // oratory at the close that I have never heard equaled , save by Mr. Cockran in his magnificent defense of Mr. White . Alas , the style of Mr. Breckenridge is one that passes away . Everything beautiful is being superseded for the useful , and , fools that we are , we fail to perceive that mere beauty has its purpose . His eloquence is the eloquence of the South , before modern Sheffield and Birmingham came to crush it with their iron wheels . But hurried as the world is , busy as is Congress , it will always make time to listen to the gentleman from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the graceful , the Prince Charming of Debate . Of the leader of the Democratic side , I have had fewer opportunities of judging , for , owing to the overwhelming nature of his committee work , he has been heard but seldom lately on the floor of the House . On the few occasions he has spoken , however , he struck me as a quick , generous , and impulsive man , strikingly handsome , and of a cast of features and carriage reminding one strongly of a beau sabreur  --  a man to head a victorious column , or to lead a forlorn hope in a despera*te assault . Mr. Cox , of New York , too , is a most distinguished speaker . He shines and sparkles , scintillates and shines . Every subject he touches turns to sunshine , and there is a warm spot in every new member 's heart for him . May his " sun 's never " set . " How well I remember the first speech I ever heard in these classic halls . It was just after my election , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The orator was well under way as I entered , and such impassioned fervor as his I never witnessed . Not confining himself to rhetoric , he displayed a physical energy that fairly fascinated me , for his arms and hands were going like the arms of a windmill . I was surprised to notice , however , that in spite of it all no one was paying the slightest heed to him . The gentleman in front of him was gracefully reposing with his feet upon his desk . His immediate neighbor was reading the New York Herald , his friend on the right was munching an apple , while the attention of the whole House was as little occupied with the speaker as if he were a fly buzzing in the northeast corner of the ceiling . I was surprised at this ; I was pained . It argued ill for my own career , since I was perfectly well convinced I could never get up a tithe of the steam this gentleman did . I must have shown ray feelings on my countenance , too , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drowning man a straw . From that moment he addressed his remarks solely to me . He even advanced upon me , increasing the vehemence of his gestures as he did so . I forget now the subject of his discourse ; but I think it had to do with removing the tariff off peannts . At any rate he was terrible in his earnestness , and his long locka rose and fell in sympathetic harmony with his gestnres . It was extremely embarrassing , however , to be thus singled out on my very first appearance , too ; and at last to break the horrid spell he exercised upon me , I ducked behind the screen that circles the chamber . When I gained a safe retreat , I turned to an official who had considerately been acting as my guide . On expressing to him my astonishment that such animated oratory had met with such scant recognition , he smiled condescendingly ; then as we passed out : " You wo n't be here long , " he explained colloquially , " before you find that they 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those on the floor will even know they 're in town . " As regards speaking , or at least the first attempts at speaking by new men , I am reminded of a good story told in my hearing by a distinguished member of the British House of Commons . He had previously served as mayor of a large city and came to Parliament with a great reputation for oratory . On the eve of his maiden effort in the House he was approached by an elderly colleague , who , after explaining that every legislative body had its own little weaknesses , described that of Parliament to be a petty jealousy of reputations earned outside its own halls . " I know it 's very trivial and absurd , " went on the monitor , " bat if you could only recognize this little prejudice and just brealc down in your speech , they 'd feel very kindly towards you , and you 'd gain by it later . " Whether the same " little prejudices " have weight here I can not say ; but of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent in Congress before taking one 's seat are of great utility to the budding statesman . Not that he learns much , but he learns this most useful lesson-how little he does know . He gets permeated with the atmosphere of legislation , and there is just that much less for him to have to absorb when he comes up a f allfledged Congressman . There are fewer demands upon his time , and he has consequently the opportunity to study the workings of things and the men he will subsequently encounter . Some of // these men , however , he will not meet again , for members have been known to fail of re-election . Indeed , the present House has lost two noteworthy men in General Bragg and Colonel Hepburn . I remember them together , in connection with the Dependent Pension Bill . *That powers of debate they possessed : inspired invective in the one ; stern , relentless , pitiless logic of retort in the other . General Bragg , in showing that he had the right to represent the soldier , sketched in glowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture of how , when he reviewed his troops , the cheer would be caught up from man to man , and the word roll down the lines that General Bragg was riding by . " Yes , " answered Colonel Hepburn , " and there was a time when Benedict Arnold rode down the line and received the well merited cheers of his men . Years after his desertion he met a former comrade in arms on British soil , and asked him what would be his ( Benedict Arnold 's ) fate should he ever venture to return to America . Would the wound that I received at Saratoga in my leg save my life ? ' The reply was this : If we ever caught you on American soil , we would cut off the leg you so gloriously had wounded at Saratoga and we would bury it with all the honors of war ; but as for your carcass , if we could only get hold of that , we 'd hang it on the highest gibbet we could find . " ' The records of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career to require any protest from my pen at the calumny of linking merely his name with that of Benedict Arnold . But , how I am running on or rather running back . I began with the present Congress and here I am *ticking at the Fortyninth . Even as I write ( for I am writing at my desk ) a gentleman is " up . " " Mr. Speaker , " he is saying : " Mr. Speaker , I move that the House do now adjourn . " Then a vote is taken , next a division is demanded , and finally , if lie has the requisite number of votes behind him , the ayes and noes are called . To call the ayes and noes consumes exactly thirty-six minutes . After the motion to adjourn has been voted down , he repeats the motion in a slightly different form , and the whole process is gone over again and very likely a third and even a fourth time . This is what is called " filibustering , " and the gentleman employs these tactics quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approve of . The last and most extraordinary case of filibustering is that // of the now famous deadlock . What excitement reigned when it first dawned upon us that the " Direct Tax bill " was to produce a night session , but how little we dreamed that the now memorable " 4th " was to extend into a week . At the demand for a call of the House the great dome of the capital flashes with electric fire , and members hurriedly come flocking back . By midnight the House has assumed the appearance of a battle ground , with gentlemen stretched lifeless here and there over the seats and ottomans , vainly seeking rest . Every now and then the sergeant-at-arms would haul up before the bar of the House a " prisoner , " and we would all rise up in a sort of general resurrection to chaff him-voting to fine him five thousand dollars , perhaps , asking who gave him his iwulonniere , and remarking generally upon the attractiveness of " her society . " Sometimes the haul would consist of several gentlemen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing truant . The most puzzling part of the whole performance was to know alongside of whom you would find yourself in the morning ; thus you would take a place next to a Democrat and wake up alongside of a Republican . A good joke was played upon me the last night of the deadlock . I was sleeping in the lobby , and during my restless slumbers in some manner kicked off one of my boots . On being suddenly called , I slipped on what I supposed was my own shoe , for it was lying alongside of me , and rushed on to the floor to vote . As I gradually regained my senses I became aware of the fact that I was wearing the property of some one else , and was only given a cue by noticing a gentleman hopping about the floor on one foot in all the agony of a tight fit . It seems that he too had kicked off his shoe on retiring to a couch , and this being facetiously changed for mine , he had pulled it on in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully discussed to warrant more than these brief references from me . We broke it by a small majority to adjourn . An amusing illustration of how one is occasionally obliged to rely on others in questions one has had no time to consider appeared the other day in a Washington paper . Mr. A. approaches Mr. B. and inquires why he voted on a certain question in the affirmative . " I voted aye , " was the answer , " because I saw Mr. C. vote aye , and I voted as he did because Mr. C. closely resembles my old Colonel in the war. ** // " That 's an odd reason , " the first speaker replied , somewhat puzzled . " Not so odd as it might seem , " was the retort . " I followed my old Colonel for four years , and he never led me during all that time into a single dangerous position . " The curious manner in which a majority will be had on a rising vote , and this majority melt into a minority when it comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other day , when the matter was under discussion of providing each member with a clerk . Practically *Congress is becoming an unpaid Parliament . Of course , a man can live on his salary , and live well on it , but he can hardly afford to hire a clerk and meet all such demands on his purse as are necessary to be met if he contemplates a continuation in public life . To begin with , the mail of an average Congressman will mount up to forty letters a day , and if he answers all these in his own hand , he has just so much less time and energy to expend on his parliamentary duties . The Senate , with one-third the labor demanded of each member , had set the precedent of voting themselves such assistance ; but somehow , when it came to having one 's name recorded in black and white , the Republican phalanx in the House , which had been energetically supporting the measure , flopped around , and , making of necessity a virtue , voted against the proposal . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had expected the Republicans to pull the coveted chestnuts for us from the fire . They were too sharp . " I would rather be in the Fiftieth Congress without a clerk , " said a gentlenian who viewed the matter from a practical standpoint , " than see my successor enjoying the services of one in the Fifty-first . " Probably he voiced the sentiment of the majority . Leaving aside the question of one 's correspondence , the attendance at the House is long and fatiguing , beginning , if you include committees , at ten and lasting often till past six . In addition , there are occasional night sessions , and certainly an average of four sub-committee meetings per week . These , combined with the preparation of reports and of speeches , visits to the different departments , and efforts to secure places for your constituents , make just thirty-four hours work for the twenty-four . How do you do it then ? We do n't do it ; but the hardest thing to learn is what you can safest leave undone . // An old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the House is required . " Is Mr. B. in his seat ? " some one is said to have onee inquired of a doorkeeper . " Certainly , " answered the official . " But how do you know , you have n't looked . " " I do n't need to look , " was the cynical reply , " for this is Mr. B. s first term . " The continued presentation of cards , too , keep you in a lively state of distractedness . People send in for you on every conceivable pretext , and they always time their visits at the exact moment when you are most particularly engaged . " Three ladies in the waiting room and a constituent at each door , " exclaims a neighbor of mine , pulling his hair in despair , and he goes on with a letter acknowledging a consignment of hay to be sold in Washington for a country neighbor , and this done amiably writes his autograph in the book of a page . Sometimes people call you out to talk over their pension cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of the most touching is that of a man who seeks support from an ungrateful government because of having fallen from a tree during the war while picking cherries ; that of another for having contracted rheumatism by sitting down on a cold , icy stone . All these claims are listened to with deep sympathy and bills in many cases drawn up for their relief . And all the time you are being called upon to sign petitions , to put your name in autograph books and to answer questions you know nothing about ; to see that you do n't vote aye when you ought to vote no , and your ears ringing the while with the reading of bills , the calls of committees and the oft repeated expression Mr. Speaker , I object , " or " I want to say just here- " " The third reading and engrossment of the bill " - " Those in favor of , " etc. , etc. , expressions that rise superior to the general buzz of conversation and unite in producing the noise of a vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast factory for the turning oat of laws .
