txt A triangUlar war has been inaugurated between a Chicago bucket shop , the Mayor of the city , and the Judges of the Civil District Court . Mayor Gull-lotto about a week ago ordered the establish-ment of Campbell &; Nobles closed , objecting to it as a bucket shop . Chief of Police Bachemin obeyed the order . The firm then obtained an injunction , and this was served on the Chief . It prevented him from interfering with Campbell &; Nobles in carrying on their business . Yesterday Acting Mayor Kilpatrick issued an order to the Chief of Police to keep the establishment , closed . It was based on the following opinion of City Attorney Walter H. Rogers : " Campbell &; Nobles have applied to the honorable the Civil District Court , and obtained writ of injunction preventing the*Chief of Police and the police authorities from interfering with them in their business . The injunction has been obtained on a suppression of the real facts of the case , they alleging that they arc doing business us commission merchants in buying and selling grain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on business on speculation and hazard by means of wheels , devices , and tickets , taws , cards , and receipts , contrary to the police regulations of the city and the laws of the State . The Judges have been thus imposed upon . The purpose of the writ when issued is to protect persons from an invasion of legal rights , and not to assist parties , to violate the laws . I therefore Ravi e that you direct the Chief of Police to prevent the carrying on of the business now conducted by the Plaintiffs. , and I have no doubt your Honor 's motion will be sustained by the court , whose orders you can in no manner be construed as violating . " The District Judges do not concur with the City Attorney , claiming the sole right to set aside theft own injunction , and there may be an early arraignment for contempt of court .
