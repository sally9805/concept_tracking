txt The joint discussion between Gen. John 13 . Gordon and Major A. O. Bacon , candidates for the Governorship of Georgia , which opened at Eatonton on Monday and will continue in the leading towns all the week , has already developed features or strong personality . Major Bacon , who was for 10 years Speaker of the Georgiallouso of Representative . was one of the strongest supporters of Gen. Gordon in both his canvasses for the United States Senate . The retirement of Judge Shnmons from the Gubernatorial race left what was supposed to he a walk-over for Bacon . Tho sudden appearance , therefore , of Gorden in the race , backed by his appeal to the soldier element , was a sore trial to Bacon , who regarded Gordon as being under political obligations to him . Bacon has made two previous races for the Governorship . When , therefore , at the Eatonton meeting , Chairman Nesbit , in introducing Bacon , declared himself to be a Gordon man , and further declared his belief that Bacon had the right " to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an insult , which Bacon resented with a warm display of temper . Nesbit tried to explain , when Bacon said . " I have not been accustomed to such treatment at the hands of gentlemen . " Nesbit replied , " Then you are not accustomed to the society of gentlemen . " As eniCii as a flash Bacon retorted , " I have lived among your own blood , and associated with them that are of it . " In Gen. Gordon 's speech he referred to the fact that Bacon resigned from the Ninth Georgia and kept clear of bullets during the war . Bacon , in an excited manner . declaimed , " Who asserts it , who insinuates it . who repeats it after hearing me to-day , that I ever iesigned any public trusts , either in peace or in war , when I was physically able to serve theta , lies . " All through the discussion the greatest feeling was exhibited . When the two gentlemen met in Sparta yesterday there was curiosity to see what Course Gordon would take . Bacon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States Senate . Gordon 's turn now came to hurl the lie , which tie did by saying : " There was a time when I did telt resign . There is a record that is unsullied , even in the estimation of the gentleman who has tried to biaeken my name before you . It was made in a time that I did n't resign  --  when my country needed me . " Gen. Gordon repeated the charge that Bacon had left the army ( luring the war , and wound tip by declaring that " I am going to be elected , and my friend will then get sicker than he did in 1802 . " Here Major Bacon i terposed and said : " Since he has lent himself to my enemies to destroy me , I absolve tern from all friendship . " It is not believed that this debate can go on without personal collision , as the two men are full of mettle .                    @
