txt We give in our columns this morning a portion of the memorial of the Public Edulation Society to the Board of Education at its meeting last evening . We heartily wish that the full report could be in the Lands of every father or mother having children in the public schools in New-York , and we trust that the association will undertake to distribute it as widely as possible . Its value consists in the clearness with which it gives in relatively compact form the chief facts as to school accommodation , modes of instruction , and school administration . The evils of the first two of these matters are very great . We do not believe that they can be remedied thoroughly without a radical change in the last one , and this can be brought about only by the spread of correct knowledge among the people most directly interested . It may be assumed that parents with children in the schools have so direct an interest in their management that they will inform themselves regarding it . Unfortunately in point of fact this is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are inclined to take the schools as they are , just as the greater number of people are inclined to take most things in daily life , as they coins without seriously asking themselves if they might be improved , and without special aptitude for devising methods of improvement even if they see that improvement is needed . The most obvious evil in the schools , and the one to which public attention has been most often called , is the want of sufficient and proper accommodation for the younger children , usually termed the primary scholars . According to the figures given in the memorial there is an average attendance of 150,000 pupils in the public schools of this city . These consist of nearly twothirds primary pupils and one-third grammar scholars , or 95,000 of the former and 55,000 of the latter , and it must be remembered that the primary schools , despite this very large attendance , can not aocommodate all who are entitled to schooling . Now , though the primary scholars are nearly two to one in proportion to the grammar scholars , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the former . In other words , there are 40,276 more primary than grammar scholars , and there are only 166 more teachers and only 12 more " schools , " and the latter are by no means always separate buildings , The result is that in the sixth or lowest grade of the primary schools each teacher has an average of 86 scholars , ' in the fifth grade 58 , and in the fourth grade 56 scholars . It is absurd to suppose that any teacher , however gifted and skilled , can deal fairly with such numbers . It is simply impossible . And , moreover , these teachers are not the best , but with the hardest work to do , under the most difficult conditions , they are the youngest , least experienced , least trained , and poorest paid of all . This is bad , onough , but it is not the worst . It is a deliberate , incalculable , and enduring wrong to the children who are entitled to adequate instruction , and the great body of whom can get it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their minds , we subject their little bodies to the most inhuman treatment and expose their health and their lives to great danger . There are certain fixed requirements as to the space to be afforded to each scholar . They are not observed , and they are wholly inadequate if they were . In the three lower grades of the primary schools there are required for each child 5 ( square feet of floor space and 70 cubic feet of room . In the three higher grades the requirement is 6 square feet and 80 cubic feet . But in the four lower grammar grades there are allowed 7 square feet and 90 cubic feet , and in the four higher grades 9 square feet and 100 cubic feet . By what hygienic rule a child of 15 years of age is supposed to require 100 cubic feet of air for its lungs , and a child of 7 to be able to get life frohi 70 cubic feet no one can tell . The most liberal requirement is none too much for the smallest child . The actual requirement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are 185 schools in the city where it is not met and where the little victims of our evil management are poisoned with the polluted air from their own langs . In some cases they are treated as an intelligent farmer would be ashamed to treat his young pigs . In such schools it would be better for the children to be driven out into the streets . The memorial gives some striking facts as to the course of study , the methods of teaching , the modes of examination , and . the grading of the teachers . We shall not now recite them . We content ourselves with remarking that the society has struck at the root of the evil in the whole bad system when it points out that it is constructed from beginning to end solely with reference to these who go through the entire course , whereas 60,000 of the 150 , - 000 annual attendants on the schools leave the schools each year under the age of 12 . In other words , the system is constructed in utter disregard of the interests and rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consideration . We urge with the greatest possible earnestness upon all of our readers the study of these facts . They present a problem and a duty second in importance to none that can engage the attention of the intelligent people of the city of New York .
