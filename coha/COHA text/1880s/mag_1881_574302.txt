*HE CONTRIBUTORS ' CLUB . SHE was English , but for twenty years had been tied to a little old driedup Hungarian , a rabid revolutionist , who had been banished from his own country , when a young man , for trying to overthrow the government . The morning she first called on me her husband accompanied her , and remained in the hall - having been taken by the servant as an attendant only - until I sent a special messenger to ask him into the parlor . " Quite an old man , I assure you , my dear lady . You will not mind . He speaks seven languages with facility , I assure you ; and he is such a good soul , but so unsettled ! I assure you , strange as it may seem to you , we have moved dozens of times . I ca n't just say that I married him for love , you know , but then I think we have been quite as happy as most people , after all , thank God ! We had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop her h 's , once in a way ; a house , I assure you , Mrs. Brown , I would not ave been ashamed to receive her royal ighness the Princess of Wales in . And I had my own carriage , too , and as pretty a span as any in the Ladies ' Mile . " We were really quite rich , and a house full of children , too , thank God . But one day my husband took it into his head to go to Jersey and buy a farm . You see he is so set in his way . All men are , do n't you think so ? The easiest way to get along with em is just to pretend you think as they do . And nothing to do but we must pack off at once , selling things at ruinous prices , too , when I was so appy in London . " We had four beautiful children , and now we are all alone , - we two old people , " and the tears glistened in her kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , and such a comfort ; but we have each other left , please God , and I assure you we think a great deal of each other , even if Mr. Aubrey is a little peculiar . We have to put up with those things , you know , my dear . After we had got nicely settled on our estate and everything in quite a thriving condition , and had just begun to feel at home again , our three little girls sickened and died , one after another , poor things ; and Mr. Aubrey was so broken down that he insisted he could not stay there any longer , where everything reminded him of the dear children , and so we took our little boy and went to the south of France . We hired a pretty villa in Cannes , surrounded by beautiful grounds , and I had begun to feel a little content . ed again , when the fever took away our last darling , and we were indeed desolate . You see , my dear lady , I have seen much trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go on living , in spite of everything . We spent two years at Cannes , and I had begun to pick up a little patois and to feel quite at home , when Mr. Aubrey 's term of banishment expired , and he took a notion to visit his only remaining relative , an old uncle , whom he had not seen for twenty years . So we pulled up stakes again , and started for Pesth . We were received at the station by very kind strangers , who informed us at first that Mr. Aubrey 's uncle was from home , afterwards that he was quite ill , and would we rest a while with them , who were close friends of the family ; and not until after much pressing did we learn the real facts in the case , - that my husband 's uncle had very suddenly expired . It was all very sad , I assure you , my dear lady . But my husband , good soul , stayedand settled up his poor uncle 's affairs , and then we came on here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall . be // nameless to see an agent for his nude 's widow , and thought we might as well stay on , you know ; and we have been prospered , thank God . Mr. Aubrey really seems quite contented sometimes , though I must say my heart is in dear old England , where everybody speaks the same language . My husband is a very fine chemist , and spends much time in his laboratory , and I have been much prospered in my profession . " Her profession , hy the way , was medicine , and she confined herself principally to children 's diseases . Her motto was , " One may as well laugh as cry , " arid so , when the baby had been particularly restless from teething , it was a comfort to see her broad , good-natured face , with its kindly blue eyes , and hear her cheery laugh , which was always contagious . It is impossible to reproduce the cordial , benevolent way in which she said , " Good . morning , my dear Mrs. Brown . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear baby ? Much better , I hope . I could n't sleep last night for thinking of it . A little ailing , of course ; you must expect those things , my dear . And Mr. Brown , too , - how is he , poor thing ? Quite well , I hope . Why , my dear lady , your husband is one of a thousand . Such a kind , thoughtful soul , and so devoted to you - " Yes - but , Madame Aubrey , the baby " - " Oh , certainly ! my dear , the baby . It wo n't do to give babies much medicine , you know . Nature must have her way . Have you given it a camomile bath , with a little drop of vinegar in it ? No ? Not so very strange , either , my dear . How should you know , to be sure ? And a drop of gin , too , you know , is so warming . Not that I believe in spirits at all , my dear , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know , nothing else answers the same purpose , " and she fanned herself vigorously , while the feathers on her hat nodded good-naturedly . Her toilets , indeed , were a study in themselves , particularly her bonnets , which she assured me she very frequently trimmed herself , and I was not loath to credit the assertion . Every time she came she had on a new specimen , quite outrivaling the last . They were always very large , overhanging her forehead , from which her gray hair was brushed ' straight back , innocent of curls or crimps , and tucked into a net at the back of her head . Her eye had evidently not been trained to harmony of colors , for while a bunch of full-blown roses would be perched on top of her bonnet , a bright yellow feather would be tucked in in close proximity , a black one on the other side , an abundance of purple ribbon adorning the crown , while a bouquet of cornflowers filled up the brim , from the edge of which dangled and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throat , often innocent of collar or ruche , would be a magenta silk handkerchief fastened with a large cameo . An ancient magenta silk polonaise , bountifully trimmed with black fringe , over a well - worn black silk petticoat , completed a favorite costume with her . She used to say , " One can not dress , you know , running about as I do . " Her hands were very beautiful , small , - quite un-English , by the way , - white , and as dimpled as a girl 's , while her fingers were always sparkling with rings , sometimes half a dozen on each hand . Bracelets encircled her fair arms , and jewels depended from her ears . Yet one could not call her vain . It was simply want of taste which led her to decorate herself in this way . She dearly loved her cup of tea , - as what Englishwoman does not , - and chatting over our lunch the lights and shades of her character and life came out quite unconsciously . " Mr. Aubrey and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said one day . " He got really quite grumpy , do n't you think . I almost always laugh , you know , but this morning I did a little crying , which I am heartily // ashamed of , I assure you . One may as well laugh as cry , though I do get tired sometimes trotting around all day , trying to understand the abominable languages , while Mr. Aubrey keeps house , and so get a little nervous sometimes , though I never allow it in my patients . " He has taken it into his head to go to Roumania , - just after the rent has been paid for another year , too , and he must needs go and try to find a tenant for the house , - and wanted me to pack right up and be off next week , Very well , ' I said , Mr. A. , you can go if you wish . I shall stay here . I will pack up your shirts this morning , if you like . ' " He took his hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silly school-girl : I sat down and cried . I assure you , I do n't come to that pass once in a year . But he came home to dinner as sweet as a peach . Did he beg my pardon ? No ; men never do that , you know . But he said he had been thinking of making me a present for a long time , and wotild I have a pony phaeton or a handsome set of jewelry ! Of course , my dear , I chose the phaeton , and now I shall take you to drive to the Gardens in my own carriage . My husband is such a kind soul , but he is a little quick , you know , my dear . One must put up with those things in a man ! I am going to try to make him forget all about the Roumanian scheme , and propose a trip to Mt . Olympus , where he can have his cigarette in peace . But I really must go , my dear Mrs. Brown . I have to visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffering terribly , poor thing , and the court physicians ca n't do anything for her . I am to go in her own carriage . Give my love to Mr. Brown , poor thing . You have so much to be thankful for , my dear , in havin , g such a good husband ! He quite adores you , I am sure ; " and she gathered up her reticule and her purse and her gloves , and came back to find her handkerchief and say good by again , and ask me to be sure and give her very best compliments to Mr. Brown , good creature , and then she bustled away . I met her on the street , one day , resplendent in amber silk of the stiffest quality , with exquisitely embroidered crepe drapery , surmounted by her wellworn black mantilla , ten or a dozen years old , and a Dolly Varden of rough white straw , trimmed with pink rosebuds , perched on her head , while her hands were encased in shabby brown kids . " So glad to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and see me . You must , indeed . Shopping is so tiresome . You really must have a cup of tea before you go home . " And so , cowardly wretch that I was , mustering up all my moral courage , and inwardly trembling lest we should meqt some of my acquaintances , I accompanied her to her own hired house . It was a pleasant four-story stone building , in a pretty , quiet street . But as soon as the door was opened by the slatternly servantgirl I was taken aback by the absolute untidiness of the interior . Mr. Aubrey sat in the back part of the stone hall , which was raised two or three steps from the entrance , quietly lunching in his shirt-sleeves . He immediately put on his yellow nankeen coat , and came forward to welcome me in the most obsequious manner , bowing over my hand nearly to the floor , and assuring me in Oriental terms and broken English that I had done them the greatest honor in visiting their humble abode . We proceeded up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shabby little room , furnished with sofa and chairs upholstered in faded crimson damask , a large mahogany table with a beautifully embroidered Turkish table cover , and the inevitable upright piano . Tea was served in thick white cups like those used on shipboard , from the daintiest of silver tea-pots , while the creamjug was a marvel in itself of exquisitely // wrought silver . The sugar was in a common white cracked bowl , and the spoons were so brassy that it required much courage to put one deliberately and with malice aforethought to one 's lips . But my hostess presided with as much grace as though the service had been of gold , the room in a palace , and herself a queen . Her conversation ranged world-wide , and embraced all topics , from art , literature , and science , and the Russo-Turkish war , to the latest recipe for salad . She was never at a loss for a word , an expression , or an opinion ; always racy , cheery , and good-tempered , breaking into musical peals of laughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful , to be sure , about dates or localities , but giving you the impression all the while of conversing with a thoroughly cultivated woman , as well as a thoroughly charming one . What if you found yourself in a whirl , sometimes , in attempting to follow her ? It was impossible to converse with her half an hour without feeling one 's own stupidity , even if vanity asserted that in point of education , cultivation , depth of character , and various other attributes and virtues , too numerous to mention , you might claim superiority . But withhold admiration you could not . Brilliancy carried the day . As I walked slowly down street I meditated on her really heroic life . Thrown among strangers in a foreign land , with her fortune to carve out , - for one could see that she was the true head of the family , - an appendage in the way of a husband whose early education and tastes differed so much from her own , winning her way by the charm of her manner , showing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not call her a fraud . One even forgot her little oddities in the way of dress , and her disregard of what some would call the necessities of life . Her occupation led to constant recourse to the crowded Bosphorus steamers conveying the busy population of the large city to and from its numerous suburbs , which line the banks of that beautiful stream . The stern of the boat is appropriated to the Turkish women , who are discreetly curtained from idle gazers of the male persuasion , and then mercilessly tied in to prevent a rush at the time of landing . The great Gatalco bridge across the Golden Horn is the startingpoint and the destination of these numerous steamers , and as a consequence the chances of collision and disaster are constantly multiplied . One sunny afternoon , Madame Aubrey , returning from one of her errands of mercy , was comfortably ensconced on the deck of a steamer under the white awning , watching the marble palaces set in emerald gardens ; the scores of graceful minarets on every hand pointing to the sky ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habited in his own peculiar garb ; and the gilded ca*ques , with their whiterobed boatmen , dancing on the blue waters , - all making a never-to-be-forgotten picture , - when suddenly a whistle sounded , quick and sharp ; then a hurried order from the captain to back , - an order , however , which came too late , - and crash I into the side of the boat , cutting her half in two , came an English grain steamer bound for the Black Sea . In an instant the water was filled with people , and the air rang with the frantic screams and even curses of the Turkish women , who were struggling with each other to gain possession of the small boats which swarmed to the wreck like flies . My friend was carried along with the crowd at the time of the accident , and found herself in the water , side by side with a woman holding a tiny baby tight to her breast . They both caught at a dangling rope ; a sudden lurch of the steamer , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loosened the hold of the mother upon the child , and with a cry of horror she saw it fall into the cruel water . At // the same time the poor mother disappeared under the wheel , and my friend , comprehending the situation in her own peril , with a desperate clutch caught the child in one hand , as it rose to the surface , hy the little knotted girdle , and with the other hand made an effort to reach an oar held out to her from a passing caique . The first essay was fruitless ; then the boat swung nearer , and with another and almost superhuman effort , she succeeded in grasping it without letting go her hold upon the child , who was lifted in by kind hands ; and then she was drawn up , almost unconscions , and conveyed on shore with her little charge . The harbor was filled with ships of war and multitudes of other craft , and from these life-boats were sent at once to the relief of the frightened passengers , who were nearly all rescued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no souls , any way . And so the busy throng went its way . My poor friend was taken home in a carriage , and in her pitiable plight was met at the door by her husband . Holding up his hands in dismay , he broke forth in a torrent of ejaculations concerning her distressing appearance . She briefly explained the accident . " Merdf*l heavens ! and I not there to risk my life for you ! " - inwardly thanking his stars for escaping such a fate . Then he saw she was not alone . " But what piece of baggage is this ? You do n't mean you have saddled yourself with a baby for us to take care of ! " And here the poor man groaned aloud . " Leave it in the carriage ! Throw it in the gutt&amp; ! Carry it to the almshouse ! Why , we have n't enough for our poor little dogs ! " And he fumed and fretted , and muttered imprecations at the driver for not interfering in his behalf . All in vain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby firmly under one arm , and faced her irascible mate . " This child has no mother . It shall have a home with me until some responsible person comes to claim it . If you do n't like it , Monsieur Aubrey , you can take your lodgings out , until you feel more humanity in your soul ! " And her strong will carried the day . " But I shall have to give up the poor little thing " she said to me afterwards , " and it is enough to break my heart . My husband ca n't abide the poor little thing because of its Eastern parentage , and no one has come to claim it . It is only a girl , you know , and very glad its friends are to be rid of it , poor thing ; " and the tears came into the kind blue eyes as she thought of its probable fate . " I could n't love it more if it were my very own , " she said . But her husband , unknown to her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily papers , of the language of which she was entirely ignorant , and one day a relative , pretended or otherwise , of the child called , and , identifying it , claimed it in the name of the family , and once more poor madame 's heart was wrung with anguish , while monsieur rubbed his hands in malicious triumph at having outwitted his wife and settled so easily what might have become a very difficult matter , considering his wife 's English obstinacy . Sadly she took up her work again , hut her laugh was no longer cheery and ringing , and seldom heard . A friend 's house was infected with a contagious disease , and a dear one lay dangerously ill . Near friends , even , feared to *iross the threshold . But although she was not the attending physician , Madame Aubrey 's hearty sympathy led her to risk danger and expose herself to a terrible disease , in order to give a word of cheer and show her warm interest in a time of sure distress . But that act of devotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposure and the constantly enervating influence of a foreign climate , was not able to bear up under the test , and after a // short struggle with disease the brave heart was still , and another English grave was made under the cypresses on the shore of the blue Bosphorus . - Was Shakespeare a " racker of orthography " ? Mr. Richard Grant White does not often leave his readers in doubt as to either his purposes or his opinions ; but if the following passage in EveryDay English is no exception , it certainly suggests the question I have just asked . In praising what he calls the Irish pronunciation , he says : " As to the silent 1 in calm and calf , and other clipped and silent letters , there is an illustration in Love 's Labor s Lost . lobfernes , the schoolmaster , speaking of Armado , whom he ridicules and scoffs at for his affectation in speech , says that he abhors such rackers of orthography as to speak dout , fine , when he should say doubt ; det , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not d e t ; he clepeth a calf cauf , half hauf , neighbour vocatur nebour ; ? 2e*gh abbreviated ne . ' And I have myself heard the 1 pronounced in talk and such like words in Cheshire , England . There is no doubt that most of these now silent letters were heard in Elizabethan English . " I have not the most unbounded confidence in rhymes as indicating the proper pronunciation of words , and yet they undoubtedly have a value ; for it would be gratuitously absurd to suppose that any poet would make a false rhyme in preference to a true one . It is quite interesting , therefore , to notice some of the rhymes in the very play from which Mr. White quotes . Boyet , one of the lords attending on the Princess of France , in disclosing to her the plan of the King of Navarre and his companions " to woo these girls of France . . . and win them too , ' says , - " And ever and anon they made a doubt Presence majestical would put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declares , - " Therefore I do it ; and I make no doubt The rest will ne'er come in , if he be out . " Could Armado himself have been more " abhominably " regardless of the sound of the b ? Biron , one of the king 's attendants , seems to have spoken " det , when he should pronounce debt , " for he remarks as Boyet goes out , - " And consciences , that will not die in debt , Pay him the due of honey-tongued Bo*et . " Rosaline , too , must have been among the abhorred , to judge from this exclamation : - " Ware pencils , ho ! let me not die your debtor , My red dominical , my golden tetter . " On the other hand , I believe there is not in Love 's Labor s Lost a single rhyme in which there is reason to suppose that Shakespeare sounded a letter that is now silent ; so that if the words which he puts into the mouth of lobfernes are to be regarded as pointing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not see how to escape the conclusion that the great dramatist himself was a " racker. " - To speak of a man 's warming his hands in his own parlor by the heat of a fire a mile distant suggests an exploit of sorcery ; yet for several years such a thing has been possible to the citizen of Lockport , N. Y. If he will , he may break up his stoves and sell them for old iron : one furnace is henceforth to do the work of a thousand , and distribute its heat to the houses of an entire city by the agency of the good servant , steam . The process was invented and put into practical operation by Mr. Birdsill Holly . Near the centre of the city stands to plain brick building , from whose one tall chimney clouds of black smoke are constantly ascending . This is the boilerhouse , and here in a row are the four great boilers in which the steam is generated . Three are horizontal , fifteen feet in length by five in diameter . The fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companions , but different in shape ; it looks like a gigantic bell dropped down upon the furnace , and is familiarly known to the workmen , not as " the upright , " but as " the nigger . " An iron pipe , eight inches in diameter , receives the steam from these boilers ; yonder , back of the nigger , it passes into the ground . Outside the building , we might trace its course along the street by the black line of bare soil , from which it has melted away the snow . This pipe is laid at a depth of three feet below the surface , sheathed in nonconducting materials , and inserted in logs of wood bored for the purpose . As the distance from the boiler-house increases , it diminishes in size from eight inches to one or one half , to correspond with the amount of steam passed through it . At intervals of one or two hundred feet are placed wooden " service boxes , " in which the expansion and contraction of the pipe under different temperatures is provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also , the branches of the main diverge , and the service pipes are sent out to the buildings heated . The whole distributing system is divided into sections , from any one of which , in case of necessity , the steam can be excluded , without affecting the others . As it is but a few years since this new method of heating had its origin in Lockport , we can not expect to find it universally adopted . But here is a pleasant , home-like , private house warmed these two winters by the city furnace , from which it is distant perhaps half a mile . It is a cold , January day , but , as the outer door closes behind us , we find ourselves in a genial , summer-like atmosphere . No cheerfully glowing grate , no ugly black register , is to be seen in the parlor ; against the wall stands the radiator , with its polished marble cap and single row of delicately painted tubes . It is a hint of the housekeeper 's millennium , when dust and coal-ashes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the kitchen the family washing is in progress without any aid from the stove . heat is conveyed to the boiler and tubs through rubber tubes attached to the service pipes . The water in the bath-room above is heated by a similar arrangement . There is no nerve-startling hiss as the steam escapes ; that ingenious invention called the " anti-thunder box " reduces it to perfect quiet . In the basement , also , we find the regulator . Perhaps at this moment the pressure in the boiler and mains may be forty or sixty pounds ; in the house , as we ascertain by glancing at the gauge , it is only five . This reduction of pressure is due in part to the fact that , upon reaching the regulator valve , the water of condensation contained in the pipes is wire-drawn , and thus to a great extent reconverted into steam before being diffused through the building . Connected with the regulator is a steammetre , which registers the number of pounds consumed daily , and also the hour at which each radiator in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used steam ? It is condensed upon leaving the radiator , and , in the form of hot water , returns to the basement . There , within a brick-walled inclosure , it circulates through several coils of pipe , exposed to a current of cold air . This air , warmed in its progress through the cooler , passes upward by a register into the apartment above , which it serves to ventilate . The water accumulates in a tank , the surplus being discharged into the sewer . Dip up a glassful from the tank . It is purer than a draught from any spring ; it is the distilled water of chemistry . Should steam-heating ever become universal in our cities , there will be no danger of drawing up death from the well , no need of building expensive aqueducts and reservoirs ; the same pipes that warm our houses will furnish // us with water for every domestic purpose . Steam has been made as subservient to the comfort of man as gas . What will science do for us next ? Will the model city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one central furnace , and have its dinners sent in from the common kitchen through pneumatic tubes ? - In certain ways , Quakers represent the most respectable social development we have in this democratic country . What mortal can be more respectable than an Arch Street Philadelphia Quaker ? Is he not the very incarnation of moral dignity and honest worth ? Above all , Joes lie not count equally worthy ancestors back to the time of William Penn ? Prosperity , also , shines very generally on the modern Quaker , and the recollection of ancient adversity only heightens by contrast the intensity of the present glow of his abundant peace and plenty . Nothing tends to make a person more highly respectable than doing the same thing over and over again , year by year , with the grave regularity that comports with profoundest dignity . As a logical result , however , dead formalism has been the outcome of this Quaker respectability , regularity , and regard for old customs . Not all dead though , for sweet , quaint homes belong to these staid Quakers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natures . But oh , the discipline of the society ! Pictures , music , and gayety of the most innocent kind have been literally under a ban . The loveliness of simple healthy Quaker home life has been too often clouded by the habits of the ascetic . From the first , the professed religion of Friends has been distinctly spiritual . They have always , as a body , consciously sought to live more or less directly under the influence and power of the Divine Light , but , strange to say , the effort to attain this very devotion and the continuous spirituality which is neces sary to sustain such a life has led grosser natures to lapse into passive asceticism , mysticism , and spiritual pride . The gift of preaching with unction , and indeed all preaching , has passed away in some places , and , as a consequence , many young people , earnest and careless alike , sought more living and articulate influences . The High Church Quaker , sitting in dead formality , adhered strictly to the customs of his ancestors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Bible . He , the advocate of absolute simplicity arid informality of worship , thus came to govern himself according to the strictest terms of a complex law . What is the result of this widespread deadness and formality of a society the acts of which have so often " made for righteousness , " as Matthew Arnold would say ? Is extinction at hand ? Some people conceive this to be the case . But let such as incline to this view first study the history of Friends for the last twenty years , and they will see how the elements of good in the society , its spirituality , practical morality , and unselfish simplicity , are tending to renew its life almost in spite of itself . It is strange , but again true , that , although during their worst torpor there have not been wanting among Quakers men of high Christian endowment and training entirely worthy to control a new movement , the change has come almost imperceptibly and without a distinct leader . Perhaps as far as was specially visible this change was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general meetings held by Friends throughout the country , where ministers as well as all earnest folks gathered . A new spirit swayed them . They said it was a returning to the ways of Early Friends , and it is true that Early Friends were given to holding these general meetings in much the same manner . Sunday-schools increased in size and numbers . Bible study became popular after having been sadly neglected , and // many features of Quaker formalism rapidly lost importance . Friends who married out of meeting were not disowned , if they expressed unity with the views of Friends and a desire to remain with them . Less prejudice was felt against music and pictures , while simplicity still continued to he the rule in most places . Many conservative Friends lamented these changes as sure signs of increasing decay in the society , of a lapsing into Methodism , and what not . In reality it was a reaction from dead formalism , which was best proved by the new spirit leading directly to the study of the Bihie . The inspiration to follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , combined with a noble * intellectual seriousness " and desire to do whatever would " make for righteousness , " was sure to lift them out of the slough of deadening formality when they once realized the necessity for change . Friends may have been helped more and more , doubtless , by the growing spirituality of the age . Yet their rich funds of homely virtues and healthful home life have , I believe , next to the increased study of the Bible , done most to renew their religious life . And to appreciate how this religious life has been renewed requires only a visit to one of the general meetings , where the single thought seems to be to secure the illumination of Divine Light . If less is said sometimes about the leading of the Inner Light , the feeling is none the less present in like degree as of old . Conduct of life as taught by the Bible , simple active Christianity with little doctrinal discourse , forms the body of the preaching . Eccentricities crop out now and then , as they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in earnest and possessed of strong individuality ; but the regular established discipline of Quakers stands them now in good stead . It would be hard indeed to instance a revival of religion anywhere more devoid of cant , hypocrisy , and self-seeking , more sober , devout , and reverential . At any rate , open to criticism or not , this movement , which , it is asserted , indicates a return to the ways of Early Quakerism , is making a living body of the Society of Friends . There are States in the West where the numbers of the societ* have increased by thousands in a few years , and the Bible , alike in Sunday-school and at home , is studied with a thoroughness and regularity to he found in scarcely any other denomination . In short , it is very evident that Friends are once more entering on a phase of profound religious activity , equipped with other weapons of warfare against the world , the flesh , and the devil than mere external separatism and rigid ascetic discipline , bound up , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stopford Brooke has won a very honorable position as a critic of English literature , and his remarks about Shelley , in his volume of extracts from that poet , can not fail to be of service to the reader . At first sight there always seems to be something derogatory to a writer in printing extracts from his works . We are accustomed to gird at our ancestors for their undeniable affection for Dodd 's Beauties of Shakespeare , and we rather plume ourselves upon our superiority in rejecting that once famous book . Yet , after all , the art of reading consists in great measure in knowing wh t to skip , and the books are few that we do read through from cover to cover without considerable exercise of choice . Of poets this is especially true . Byron said , it will he remembered , " You say that one half of Don Juan is very good ; you are wrong ; for , if it were , it would be the finest poem in existence . Where is the poetry of which one half is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no poetry is generally good , - only by fits and starts ; and you are lucky to get a sparkle here and there . You might as well want a midnight all stars as rhyme // March , all perfect . " And while it is well to read at least once all that a poet has written , where is the poet whose works we read without omissions ? Mr. Brooke acknowledges this by editing a volume of extracts , and the selections he has made are not mere scrappy , teasing hits , but they include the whole of Alastor , the Adonais , etc. , etc . A valuable part of the hook consists of the editor 's comments , yet it is too much to say that they will give unalloyed satisfaction . Shelley is too ethereal a poet to be fully described in prose , and if all that his poetry expresses and implies could be put down in a preface we may be sure that the number of extracts would be very small . It is not too much to say that there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was in so- many respects incomprehensible , so like embodied poetry of which other bards get but faint glimpses , that an analysis of his pictures of dawns and sunsets leaves the reader cold . His verse is what he has described to us as the song of the skylark . He really unfolds to us things that seem beyond mortal vision ; he does what Goethe failed to do in the second part of Faust , and he stands in a company with Pindar and Eschylus . These be big words , and they partake of the tumidity which generally overtakes those who try to describe the indescribable ; yet they hardly overstate the enthusiasm that Shelley-lovers feel , even if they convey no definite notions to other people . Mr. Brooke , at least , has the advantage of avoiding tumidity , and he says many things of real value . He shows in what respects Shelley was like , and in what unlike , other poets , and by so doing he helps us to classify this remarkable man , and he points out some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poet 's work . Here , for instance , is a good bit of criticism : " The huddling rush of images , the changeful crowd of thoughts , are found on almost every page . It is often only the oneness of the larger underlying emotion or idea which makes the work clear . We strive to grasp a Proteus as we read . In an instant the thought or the feeling Shelley is expressing becomes impalpable , vanishes , reappears in another form , and then in a multitude of other forms , each in turn eluding the grasp of the intellect , until at last we seize the god himself , and know what Shelley meant , or Shelley felt . In all this he resembles , at a great distance , Shakespeare ; and has , at that distance , and in this aspect of his art , a strength and a weakness similar to , but not identical with , that which Shakespeare possessed , - the strength of changeful activity of imagination , the weakness of being unable , through eagerness , to omit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is new about Shelley 's life is the distinct statement of his love for Mrs. Williams , to whom , it is said , he composed his Arid to Miranda , The Invitation , The Recollection , etc . It is new , too , to find Shelley praised for his good influence in behalf of Christianity . - It is a fact of very considerable interest that the last *york of Mr. Spencer on Ethics - in some regards the weakest and the least satisfying , both to the author and the reader , of all his works - should have received , on the whole , up to this hour , r*elatively more commendation than his earlier and far stronger writings , that are the foundation of his reputation and will be the support of his fame . Professor Denslow , in his work on Modern Thinkers , holds that human motives of virtue have their source in the triumphs of the strong over the weak ; the terms right and wrong , he might say , are but the echoes of forgot .. ten conflicts for life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The very existence of such a criticism , in the way in which it was evolved , is // itself a phenomenon . In the columns of a daily newspaper , by the side of dark-head-lined politics and murders , these compact discussions of unpopular problems first came into being . In no other era than ours , in no other laud but this , in almost no other centre of trade , would this have been likely or possible . Of the nine philosophers whose lives , thoughts , and fancies Professor Denslow reviews , not one was of American birth ; only one dwelt with us , and that one but for a fraction of his life . During these centuries hundreds of millions of human beings - the products of the most intellectual of modern races - have entered upon and disappeared from our stage ; but , to this hour , no one of all these generations has held our own or the world 's attention by the deliverance of any new truth , or image of truth , in social science ; and a people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must itself go to all other peoples for ideas , - the country that in directly usable discoveries is the greatest of originators , in philosophy has been but a timid borrower and importer . Is there an inherent antagonism between federalism and thought ? Must it ever be that theological and political liberty shall be compensated by intellectual slavery ; and shall the least creative thinking be done by those who have the most freedom ? Is it a psychological necessity that the mind ceases to originate as soon as its chains are removed and it has liberty to work as it pleases ? Is a nation that has liberated four millions of slaves to remain forever incompetent to deliver fifty millions of whites from the bondage of the demonstrably false ? Is there any just reason for asserting that , in the parceling out of ' the products of the two hemispheres , nature assigned thought exclusively to the Eastern , and action exclusively to the Western ? Is there anything in the peculiarities of our climate - the dryness of the air , or the ex tremes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle realms , paralyzes it in the very highest realm , that of creative philosophy ? For myself , I hold on these themes views that may be considered the extreme of optimistic ; and , in little works like this , I see the signs of the coming of the reign of ideas on this continent , when , as in old Greece and modern Germany , it shall be no disgrace to be a thinker , and the young men who are organized for finding truth , and who are in harmony with their organizations , shall no longer be considered as outlaws , but rather as worthy and honorable forces in society , even while living . A century hence , some acute critic like Professor Denslow shall write of American thinkers , and shall proclaim theories and reasonings of which these are but intimations and adumbrations. - I can not join with a recent writer in the Club in welcoming the possible advent of a time when the thing called style shall pass out of literature , leaving to readers only the satisfaction of feeling themselves in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " However , the coming of such a styleless era , I suppose , need not be seriously deprecated , for a literature can hardly exist without literary styles , good or less good . Literature being a fine art , as I understand it , a literary man can no more help having a style than a painter his ; it may be more or less strongly marked , finished or faulty , but it can not be altogether bad , or even indifferent . There is an ideal of literary expression which looks upon language as best employed when it becomes the perfectly transparent medium of thought , - like plateglass , as the advocates of this theory phrase it . It is of course always in good taste to be simple , and a plainness approaching to baldness is infinitely better than the " fine " language , socalled , indulged in by pseudo-cultivated writers . But I have never been able // to accept the plate-glass theory , and can not help fancying that it is the unconscious refuge of writers and readers without any keen apprehension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are indeed prime requisites of a good style , but why should we forego the pleasure to be had from other and more positive qualities than these ? The imperishable cbarm belonging to certain writers lies in their style ; it is their unique expression of their thought , more than the thought itself , we care for , as witness many of Lamb 's most deligbtful sketches ; and in the most original writers this characteristic quality of expression is so much a part of their genius that it is scarcely possible to separate between substance and form , the ideas and their embodiment . In fact , one is sometimes tempted to call the thought the grosser particle in this combination or interpenetration , so subtle and exquisite may be the charm of mere words , not only in poetry , but in imaginative prose . - A correspondent in the Contributors ' Club for January , while allowing the altered tone of English literature towards Americans , seriously impugns English hospitality . Being able to compare the present with the long past , I should like to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect , and to the great change which has taken place in their manners during the last forty years . The traditional John Bull is , we know , gruff , closing his doors to strangers and his lips to conversation with them , but the modern traveler must see that he has cast his aggressive horns , and that he is quite safe to approach . Touchett no doubt was perfectly right in his judgment at the time he wrote , for even as late as from 1845 to 1850 the idea of British roughness and exclusiveness was prevalent and in a measure justifiable . At that time self-respecting Americans were cautious how they made any advances to the roaming English , it being usually the rule to let them speak first , as overtures might be met with ' coldness and rudeness . They certainly could not then be called a pleasant or hospitable people . Letters of introduction might insure visits and social attentions in their homes , but the traveling multitude were reserved and rough . Going abroad again from 1872 to 1874 , we were struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met the English we found them friendly and polite , and this was the experience of all Americans to whom we spoke of the remarkable change . It was probably owing to the more frequent intercourse between the countries . Englishmen had found that there was a middle ground between the barren offering of a seat in church , a drive to Mount Auburn in their favorite city of Boston , and the mad homage paid to Dickens . They had seen our best people and examined our institutions , and our countrymen had met with a hearty welcome in the home of their ancestors . It frequently happened , on our last visit to the Continent , that our most agreeable neighbors were English , and the unfavorable opinions of a quarter of a century before were greatly modified . They seemed a new race with new feelings . The national characteristics of bluntness , directness , and pride remained , but there was no offensive reserve or hauteur , and this change was not only observable in transient amenities , but invitations were frequently given to visit them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It may be said with truth that for a much - enduring Nmerican housekeeper to entertain the English is more of a virtue than for them to reciprocate , delegating all cares , as they do , to a corps of well-trained servants ; hut without sifting motives or means I merely wish to assert that the modern educated Englishman is not only apt to be hospitable to the modern edu // cated American , but is surprisingly and imprudently so , and that he goes beyond our compatriots in these rash attentions . - If there were any doubt that The Wreck of the Grosvenor was written by an able seaman it is dispelled by his second yarn , A Sailor 's Sweetheart . The author launches his story as though it were a ship . The amateur seafarer , who generally goes below , and who regards the sea as an unpleasant but inevitable after-dinner confidant , will not care to follow Mr. Russell very closely through the first chapters . For one , I am willing to admit that I hardly escaped a slight touch of mal de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's zeal for detail . Here is the realistic novel with a vengeance , - Zola with his sea legs on . I have heard of a girl - an American girl , of course , - who , when her whole system was in revolt , expressed herself as " so thankful for the experience . " But I am inclined to regard the instance as apochryphal , and I think the readers of The Atlantic will bear me out in the assertion that seasickness is neither enjoyable subjectively as a phenomenon , nor objectively as a word painting . On another count this latest sea tale is open to indictment in a literary court . The author asserts that die incidents of his story are impregnable facts , based upon two narratives and one personal experience , to which it is sufficient to answer that an incident must have another apology for its narration in a novel beyond the bald fact of its truth . It must be interesting per se . It must derive an additional charm from the manner in which it is told . And , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are few situations in a work of fiction , however startling , that have not had their counterpart in real life . You shall find material for a circulating Mudie in the columns of one daily newspaper . Curious coincidences , hair-breadth escapes , strange disappearances , all the ano*iymous tragedies of a great city , are the legitimate quarry of the romancer . But his art is not to string these together as one would make a necklace , or lay them cunningly side by side in a mosaic . He must suffuse his canvas with their various colors , and fill in the crude outlines of fact with the delicate shadings of his imaginations until all parts are in fair proportion and become merged into one artistic conception . Apply these criteria to Mr. Russell 's book , and it will be seen that he has sometimes misused truth in the interest of melodrama . The incident of the Jesse Jackson is vigorous and vivid in its transcription , and it may be veritable , but in its setting it is superfluous . The most careless reading will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Waldeshare . A more practiced artisan , like Collins or Reade , would have used elsewhere the eighth chapter of The Wreck of the Grosvenor . - When Lord Beaconsfield puts into the mouth of one of the characters in Endymion the saying that " style is everything , especially in fiction , " he furnishes his critics with a telling weapon against himself ; for anything more slipshod than the style employed in Endymioii it would be difficult to find . The misplacement of clauses is at times so marked as to be perfectly grotesque and to remind us of the examples of such carelessness that we studied in our text-books at school . Take , for instance , this : " And what do you think of this ? ' asked Lord Montfort of Nigel Penruddock , who , in a cassock that swept the ground , bad been stalking about the glittering saloons like a prophet who had been ordained in Mayfair , but who had now seated himself beside his host . " If we are to trust Mr. Disraeli 's statement , it becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the actual Mr. Penruddock , who has placed himseli in juxtaposition to Lord Montfort. // Observe , too , the awkwardness of this sentence : " No , ' said Mr. Neuchatel , with a laughing eye and who saw through everybody 's purpose though his own manner was one of simplicity amounting almost to innocence . " And of this : " Baron Sergius never spoke except to Endymion and then chiefly social inquiries about Lord and Lady Roehampton . " In addition to all this , there occur on almost every page little blemishes such as the follo wing : - " There was a dinner twice a week at which Waldershare was rarely absent , " and , " The snow was falling about the time when the Swindon coach was expected . " And , in conclusion , observe the following examples of two grammatical errors that occur in continual repetition throughout the book : - " Lady Roehampton had res'lly intended to have gone , " and , " The Count of Ferroll says there is a chance of Lady Montfort coming here .
