JUSTICE AND LAW IN RUSSIA . BY ALBERT F. HEARD . HE treaty in negotiation between I Russia and the United States for the extradition of criminals suggests a study of the judicial system of Russia , and I propose to attempt a summary sketch of the reforms made in this department of the government from 1862 to 1864 , and of the modifications more recently introduced . In the tenth century Yaroslav promulgated the " Rouskafa Pravda , " or " Russian Law . " When the independent principalities were united under Ivan III. , in the fifteenth century , and under Ivan IV. , the Terrible , in the sixteenth , the statutes of the various appanages were consolidated in a single code . This was revised under Alexis Romanoff , father of Peter the Great , and the " Oolozshenie Zakonov , " or " Collection of Laws , " established by hini in the seventeenth century , is the basis of modermi Russian legislation . Under Peter the Great and his successors the influence of western Europe was paramount in Russia , and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all branches of the government . Foreign ideas were engrafted // on the native , and the judicial system , in common with all other institutiohs , was subjected to a double pressure-one from within , in accordance with the wants and requirements of the people ; one from without , suggested by comparison with more civilized countries . The confusion already existing in consequence of arbitrary enactments called forth by special emergencies , or issued from caprice by an irresponsible autocrat , was thus enhanced by the introduction of this foreign element . Peter the Great appreciated the difficulty and projected a remedy , but never had time to elaborate it . His edicts and regulations , borrowed mostly from abroad , at variance with the habits and customs of his people , contradictory of old laws , and frequently inconsistent with themselves , without unity of plan or any guiding principle for their base , aggravated the evil . His successors followed his example . Each sovereign abrogated and altered the decrees of his predecessors , promulgated new ones of his own , until the chaotic whole was unworthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shapeless mass of contradictory , confusing , bewildering enactments , defeating the ends of justice , and affording every opportunity for judicial tyranny and venality . The necessity of a codification of the laws became yearly more imperative , and the longer it was delayed the more difficult the task . Catherine II . attempted it , and in her celebrated *instructions " laid down the principles which should guide the assembly she convoked for the purpose . Wars with Turkey and Poland interrupted the work . Alexander I. resumed it , and Nicholas concluded it . Instead of making clean sweep , and establishing , as did Napoleon a new and homogeneous code , complete in itself and in accordance with modern ideas , Nicholas preferred a systematic codification of existing laws . Commencing with the Oolozshenie Zakonov of Alexis , the statutes of the empire were classified in fortyfive quarto volumes , comprising 1500 chapters , with 45,000 articles , called the " Svod Zakonov , " or " Code of Laws , " in three divisions-civil , criminal , and commercial . Many changes and modifications have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an autocratic sovereign to make and alter laws at his pleasure may seem to militate against the possibility of having a fixed and permanent code . This power , however , exists in every government , and the obligation of giving stability to existing institutions is as imperative in an absolute as in a constitutional monarchy , and offers a guarantee generally sufficient against abuse of this prerogative . With the establishment of a regular code the necessity of honest judges , competent tribunals , and impartial administration of the laws arose . At this point commenced the reforms of Alexander II . Prior to his reign the dispensation of justice had been as defective as the management of other departments of the government . The procedure was secret , and this secrecy served to maintain , in legal matters , the evil which for centuries has been the curse of Russia-venality . Justice was bought and sold , the tribunals were shops , and the scribes were brokers , dealing in the property , liberties , and lives of men . Judicial sentences were put up at auction and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither competent nor honest ; they were poorly paid , and eked out their livelihood by bribery . Public opinion was not shocked at the exhibition , but rather approved of the custom which laid the expenses of the law upon the litigants . The first measure of the government to arrest this scandal was to authorize the election , by the local population , of the judges of the lower courts . Although this was apparently a concession to liberal ideas , it proved utterly inadequate . The choice generally fell on the poorer members of the noble class , who sought the position as one of profit , and so long as the proceedings were secret , the electors had no control over the action of the judges . A second remedy attempted was to multiply the forms and formalities to be observed , in the hope that they would afford checks and counterchecks against abuses . This served only to increase delays and expense . It placed all power in the hands of the scribes and subordinate officers who alone were competent to follow the multitudinous ramifications of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentences they were to render , and shared the spoils with them . The emancipation of the serfs increased by millions the numbers of those possessing legal rights , and the existing evils were correspondingly intensified . Radical reform became imperative . An // imperial commission was charged with the study of the subject , and the institutions of France and England were especially investigated . Starting from the immutable principles of right , and following the well-defined maxims of European law , as elsewhere tested and proved , the judicial reform has been more thorough and more successful than all the others attempted by Alexander II . Without aiming at originality , or aspiring to be peculiarly Russian , it is based on fundamental truths , and has been elaborated in accordance with and profiting by the experience of other countries . It recognizes the separation of the judicial from the administrative and executive authorities , and the independence of all magistrates of government control ; the equality of all persons before the law , with the abolition of all privileges and the suppression of all distinctions of class or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oral for written testimony ; trial by jury ; and popular election of judges for certain courts . The tribunals are classed in two categories , according to the nature and the importance of the suits to be tried by them ; the two divisions are not superposed one over the other , but are independent each of the other , with separate courts of appeal , and are both subject , in last resort , to the Senate . Before considering this judicial organization , complete in all its parts , we will glance at other institutions of similar nature existing alongside of it , and operating in the same field . These institutions are what remains of the old Russian system , preserved intact in principle , although somewhat modified in detail . The first in importance , as affecting the great mass of the population , is the Mir , or peasant self-government , in its judicial capacity . It is of very ancient and popular origin , and for centuries has , with undisputed authority , regulated peasant life and administered justice in peasant communities according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ code . The imperial government deemed it unwise to disturb its jurisdiction , or to attempt any radical change other than to modernize its patriarchal methods , and to somewhat curtail its attributions . It is by law now restricted to cases in which peasants are parties , and , except by com mon consent of the litigants , to such as involve amounts less than 100 rubles. * In point of fact its jurisdiction is generally invoked by peasants where larger sums are at stake . Corporal punishment is , with certain exceptions , abolished by law throughout the empire , but while it may still be inflicted by this tribunal , functionaries , women , and men over sixty years of age are exempt , and twenty stripes is the maximum allowed . Peasants usually prefer this summary mode of punishment to the penalties authorized by the code . The judges are peasants chosen by the township Mir , which is composed of heads of peasant households : the rude patriarchal justice they administer is more acceptable to the people , because it is better understood , than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is often imperfect , from the ignorance of the judges and from the undue influence of the scribes who have charge of the records , but , notwithstanding its defects , it responds more fully to the exigencies of peasant life , and the system has been preserved to satisfy the rural population , who testified in its favor before the imperial commission by an overwhelming majority . Those who object to it can escape its jurisdiction , as the legal tribunals are open to all , and litigants may also , by mutual consent , submit their cases to referees , whose decisions are by law made binding . There is no court of appeal , properly so called , from these peasant justices , but their sentences may be referred to a body specially charged with the administration of the rural communes , called the " District Commission for Peasant Affairs , " and if they are found to be illegal or informal , they are invalidated , and a new trial is ordered . Next in importance to the Mir are the military tribunals , to which all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also jurisdiction over all cases involving crimes against the Emperor or the state , and in recent years their attributions in this direction have been widely extended . Procedure in them has shared in the general reformation ; their sessions are public , the accused is heard in his defence , and penalties have been mitigated . Flogging has been abolished , save in disciplinary regiments , but capital pun * The mint value of the ruble is 65*5* cents ; by depreciation it is now worth about 50 cents . // ishment , prohibited to all other tribunals , may be inflicted by these . Finally , , ecclesiastical cases are judged by ecclesiastical courts . The clergy are subject to them for all matters of discipline , and for all others not comprised in the penal code . They have jurisdiction in all affairs pertaining to marriage , divorce , and separation , although certain offences , like bigamy , may also be tried before lay tribunals . In this branch of the judicial system secrecy and old forms of procedure are maintained , doubtless from reluctance to meddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change in this respect , to accord with the general spirit of the reformation , has frequently been under consideration . It will thus be seen that three of the five classes composing the population , and which together comprise more than five-sixths of the whole , are , save in exceptional cases , exempt from the jurisdiction of the ordinary tribunals ; two only , the noble class and the inhabitants of towns , are subject to them . These tribunals are of two categories , which may , for distinction 's sake , be called the inferior and the superior courts , in view of the extent of their respective jurisdiction ; the superior , however , have no control over the inferior , and they both are subject to the Senate . They differ not merely in their attributions , but also in their composition , their methods , and in the mode adopted for the selection of judges . The inferior courts take cognizance of cases of minor importance , both civil and criminal . They are , as in England , presided over by justices of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the practice in England , the justices are limited strictly to their judicial functions . They are elected for three years , from among the local landed proprietors , by the district rural assemblies ( Zemstvos ) , or in large cities by the municipal councils ( Doumas ) . It is worthy of notice that Russia is the first of the great European states in which a portion of the magistracy has been left to popular choice . It is not the least remarkable of the singular anomalies to be found in the empire , where an autocratic monarchy not only accords to the great bulk of the population , the peasantry , the privilege of self-government , but also thus concedes to the entire nation , in cases of minor importance , which are vastly the most numerous , the right of self-justice . No special legal education is required in order to be eligible as justice of the peace , but the candidate m ust be in possession of a certificate , about equivalent to the graduating degree of our colleges , and have , either himself or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varies according to the locality ; in the rural districts it ranges from 400 to 900 dessiatines* of land , or immobilized property worth 15,000 rubles ; in the cities , real estate valued at from 3000 to 6000 rubles . The educational qualification may be deemed sufficient , as the justice has little or nothing to do with strictly legal questions , and for the most part has to decide in equity ; it is necessarily low , for otherwise it would in many districts be impossible to find the requisite number of individuals competent to fill the post . The property qualification is intended to secure men of sufficiently independent means to be above temptation and to insure impartiality . For this purpose it is inadequate , and affords no real guarantee . Not only is the amount reduced to a minimum , but there are no restrictions against its being mortgaged or pledged .. Many Russians advocate the suppression of all conditions , preferring to trust to the good sense of the assemblies for the selection of fit and proper men , and the government has yielded in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instances of election by a unanimous vote . While conceding the principle of popumr choice , the imperial administration may exercise very great influence over the selections made , inasmuch as governors of provinces make reports on the candidates , and the elections , to be valid , must be ratified by the Senate . The frequently incomplete nature of Russian legislation is signalized in this special reforni : an elective magistracy is restricted to the provinces of the empire where Zemstvos and Doumas exist , and consequently it is withheld from Poland and Lithuania . In the selection of justices the law makes no distinction of persons , but in the rural districts the real estate qualification and the usual preponderance of nobles in the assemblies practically limit the choice to them . This circumstance , however , is not accompanied by abuses * A dessiatine is about 2* acres . // of class favoritism . The noble class in Russia differs widely from the nobility or gentry of other countries ; it designates those who , belonging to the fourteen grades of the tchin , or official tableaux of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its members are hardly distinguishable from the common people , and the most enlightened are generally , in theory at least , imbued with liberal ideas . Those among them who are willing , in view of its modest retribution , to accept the office , are usually of the humbler grades , and have few prejudices of birth or caste . The stipend ranges , according to locality , from 1500 to 2000 rubles , out of which rent , salaries , and all expenses of the court are to be defrayed . To the justices in active service the law adjoins others called " honorary , " who are also elected , and in the same way , but who can sit only in civil cases , and then only when requested to do so by the parties to the suit , or as assistants to the acting magistrates . Their number is unlimited , they receive no pay , and the position , purely honorary , is conferred and accepted as a compliment upon the most notable personages of the district . They rarely take part in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high social or official positions they add dignity to the office , and their influence , though seldom directly exercised , is felt more especially in the " assemblies of peace , " which are the courts of appeal from the lower tribunals , and in which they , in common with the active magistrates , have a voice . Justices of the peace have jurisdiction over cases involving sums less than 300 rubles , and penalties not exceeding a year 's imprisonment or a fine of 300 rubles . To these are added such as by common consent are referred by peasants to their tribunals in preference to the Mir . The proceedings are public and oral ; they are characterized by the least possible formality , and attended with the least possible expense . The plaintiff enters his complaint direct to the justice , who is bound , first , to exhaust all conciliatory methods , and failing them , to decide according to common - sense and equity rather than by law . Witnesses , duly sworn as required by their religious beliefs , are subjected to direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plead in their own behalf , or be represented under a power of attorney . Professional lawyers are sometimes , but not usually , employed , and their place is assumed by irregular practitioners , without diplomas , education , or even honesty , who throng about these petty tribunals , and live by their wits at the expense of a litigious and credulous public . Cases involving over thirty rubles , and penalties exceeding a fine of fifteen rubles or fifteen days ' imprisonment , may be appealed to the assemblies of peace . They are composed of the justices of the district , and hold sessions monthly . Three justices , one of whom acts as presiding officer , are necessary to constitute a court , and the magistrate from whose decision the appeal lies is excluded . An attorney , officially appointed , represents the government , and assists the bench on points of law . The case may be heard ' again upon its merits , and be decided accordingly , or , if it is simply sent down , another justice is designated , before whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from this tribunal to the Senate , which , however , does not reopen the case , but may order a new trial in another district if it finds the previous decision to be illegal or informal . The wholesome influence of honorary justices is perceptible chiefly in the assemblies . As they have had generally no part in the primary proceedings , and are by their social position raised above suspicion of being unduly biassed , their presence on the bench , when they can be induced to act , is a guarantee of uprightness and impartiahity Equity as between man and man , common-sense rather than law , are supposed to govern the decisions of the inferior courts which deal with cases of minor importance , and consequently by far the most numerous . It is otherwise with the tribunals of the second category , which adjudicate matters of graver nature , and may inflict penalties of the heaviest description . This section of Russian jurisprudence is imitated in great measure from the French . There are district courts , or courts of first instance , courts of appeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This latter body is divided into two departments-one having authority over the assemblies of peace or inferior , the other over the regular legal or superior tribunals . In each department the attributions are the same : they both hear appeals // on points of law only , and do not reopen cases , but simply confirm or invalidate previous decisions , in the latter event sending them down for retrial . The functions of the Senate correspond to those of the French cour de cassation . The judges of the superior courts , from the highest to the lowest , are appointed by the crown for life or during good behavior , and some consideration is paid to the opinions of the members of the bench . Life tenure of office is one of the surest guarantees of impartiality and independence , but in Russia the efficacy of this guarantee is not absolute . In filling vacancies for the courts of first instance and the courts of appeal , the magistracy of each district is permitted to present candidates for the simple judgeships , but not for the offices of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the attorney of the government ; but the crown is not restricted to them in its choice , so that this right of presentation is of little effect against arbitrary action , and for membership of the Senate it does not exist . While judges may not be removed save for cause , government has strong hold upon them from its power of advancement and displacement . The pressure which it may thus exert , by appealing to the ambition of some or by acting on the fears of others , in a country where there is such wide choice of residence , from the centres of civilization to the wilds of Siberia , is very great . The district courts are few in numberabout seventy in all  --  and the jurisdiction of each one embraces vast tracts of territory , while the courts of appeal , of which there are nine , are located only in the large centres of population. * The delays from accumulation of business that mighf be anticipated from the small number of these tribunals is diminished by the existence of the inferior and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the presence of three , of whom one is the presiding officer , is necessary . District courts may try both civil and criminal cases ; the former they decide without appeal , but they can take cognizance of the latter only with the previous authorization of the upper courts , to which there is an appeal on the part of the accused . An attorney , appointed by the crown , is al * At St. Petersburg , Moscow , Kasan , Saratof , Odessa , Kiev , Smolensk , and Vilna. ways present , and generally exercises great influence , not only from his official position , but also from the fact that as yet great difficulty exists in finding competent men , with proper legal education and training , to discharge the duties of judge , and the incumbents often depend for their law and their opinions upon the official representative of the government . While this obstacle is of temporary nature , there is another and more serious one , affecting the character of the judiciary . The tendency of liberal studies is to enlarge the mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issuing from universities and imbued with modern theories seldom sympathize fully with the principle of autocratic rule , and , viewed with suspicion , are neglected by the government in its choice of magistrates . The official bar , which corresponds to the French parquet , is completely under the control of the administration ; its functions were originally limited , but during the reactionaxy tendency of recent years it has acquired a preponderating influence ; the highest judicial dignities hcve been filled from its members , and in them the government has found able and devoted agents , willing often to bend the power of the law in support of arbitrary and repressive measures . The right of pleading before the courts is open to all . No diploma nor special legal education is requisite , but simply an authorization , which is granted by the tribunals theoretically to such as are deemed competent and worthy ; practically to those who can pay the heavy tax exacted ; women are not excluded . This wide latitude was rendered necessary , when the judiciary reforms were commenced , by the non-existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motley crowd of licensed p*ctitioners , a properly constituted bar , from which women are excluded , has since been established . It is composed of regularly sworn advocates , educated in law schools , holding diplomas authorizing them to practise throughout the empire . This body has a corporate existence , and for admittance to it five years ' study and a successful examination are necessary . The bar of each city elects its governing council , which has power of reprimand , suspension , and expulsion over its members . There is n* such distinction as exists in England between barrister and attorney ; a lawyer is , as in America , both one and the other . // The legal profession , thus systematized , opened to aspiring and educated youths of every class a new career , of which they have eagerly availed , as frequently , however , from pecuniary as from ambitious motives . Law is an expensive luxury in Russia , and one of which the people are fond . Fees are graduated on the greater or less measure of success , and cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debase the dignity of the profession , it must be acknowledged that the Russian bar has given ample proof of courage and independence . No political criminal , even in the late years of conspiracy and rebellion , has been left without an advocate , although to speak boldly in his defence might involve a broken career and exile . The advanced opinions generally held by its members , and their readiness to plead on behalf of political offenders , have aroused the hostility of the government toward them as a body . To the detriment of public service it has interposed obstacles to their entrance to the magistracy , and restricted their advancement therein . A lawyer can be called to a judgeship only in the district courts , and that only after ten years ' practice . Measures of this nature simply deprive the judiciary of the men who are by education and training the most competent to discharge its duties . The section of Russian jurisprudence most seriously modified by the decrees of 1864 , and the one in which reform was most urgent , was that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all crimes were dealt with exclusively by the police . This body , notoriously dishonest and venal when all the departments of the administration were rank with corruption , ransomed the innocent and was bribed by the guilty . Torture was abolished only under Alexander I. ; arbitrary imprisonment and flogging existed under Nicholas , and , even after the edicts of 1864 , were of common occurrence in remote provinces , where reforms , though proclaimed at the capital , were slow to penetrate . These corrective measures , however , struck at the root of the evil by recognizing the principle that the accused must be deemed innocent until proven guilty , and by allowing him in certain cases to remain at liberty under bail . Criminal procedure is , as in France , divided into three sections , independent each of the other  --  the accusation , the ex amination , and the trial-thus acknowledging the separation of the executive from the judicial authority . The guarantees thus theoretically established are still often evaded in practice-sometimes on the plea of necessity for speedy action , frequently in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their reluctance to surrender it , aided by centenary habits of submission on the part of the people , but especially from the incapacity and subserviency of the examining magistrates . They are by law independent and permanent , but the security of life tenure of office is nullified by appointing them temporarily , and requiring long service before confirmation . The office is ill paid , and therefore acceptable only to common and ignorant men , full of deference for and under the control of the police and government authorities ; the latter thus practically both nnite in their own hands the power of arrest and the management of the preliminary examination , and also strongly infinence the decisions of the courts . Trial by jury , as instituted in 1864 , is limited to criminal cases . It was the most radical measure sanctioned by the great reformer , and was an extraordinary concession on the part of an absolute monarch . It goes farther than the recognition of the principle that men should be tried by their peers , and establishes the equality of all in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the peasant are indiscriminately called upon to serve together , thus effacing before the law all distinctions of class or caste . Only such restrictions upon the choice of jurors are imposed as are deemed necessary to insure a certain degree of competency , and those restrictions are applicable to all , without respect of persons . The exceptions and exemptions are not peculiar to Russia ; the army , the clergy , the magistracy , and the police are precluded , and the five upper classes of the tchin are exempted from service . The first who are qualified are all officials of the government , and all local functionaries peasant or other , who hold office by election ; to them are afterward added every year from the population such resident male adults as are designated by the district rural assemblies ( Zemstvos ) , and the municipalities ( Doumas ) , and who , in the provinces , are owners of 100 dessiatines of land , and , in the cities , of property valued // at from 500 to 2000 rubles , or have as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubles , according to locality . From the entire list , thus representing every class of the whole population , juries are drawn by lot at each session of the tribunals . At the trial thirty-six jurors are summoned , and each side may challenge six ; if the prosecution is content with a less number , the accused may challenge so many more . While so wide an extension of this franchise frequently admits to the jury-box incompetent men , experience has shown that , upon the whole , the sturdy honesty and good sense of the muzhik may be trusted as implicitly as the greater intelligence of the educated classes . The jury has to pronounce on questions of fact and not of law , and in Russia , as elsewhere , knowledge of the penalty has often biassed its decision in spite of evidence ; by thus tempering the severity of the code , its action has had effect upon the spirit of legislation , and is also indicative of progress in the power of public opinion . The judicial edifice of 1864 thus summarily sketched still exists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the first . Subsequent edicts , closing some of its doors , and modifying its fair proportions , have been issued in self-defence , as measures of necessity , which knows no law . By their terms they are of temporary duration , but they depend on the will of an autocrat , and their abrogation can hardly be expected until the nation throughout recognizes the obligation of pursuing redress by legal means instead of violence , of trusting to reason rather than force , and , possessing itself in patience , will believe that truth and right are mighty and must prevail . The edicts to which I allude have been called forth by the revolutionary outbreaks and outrages of the past ten years . In the enactments establishing legal reform a reservation was made for crimes against the Emperor and the state ; they were withdrawn from the ordinary tribunals , and tried by special courts . Besides this guarantee against political offenders the government retained in its hands as a weapon of defence , an institution which deserves especial mention . This was the political or secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperial chancellery . The police in Russia , as in all absolute VOL . LXxVI. - No. 456-64 monarchies , has had to combine the duty of preventing crime and watching over the people with that of supervising officials and protecting the government . Alexander I. , in imitation of Napoleon , made it a department of the state . Nicholas , refining thereon , divided it into two sections  --  the ordinary police , under the Minister of the Interior , and the secret police , under the Emperor in person . The latter was a privileged body , above all law , responsible only to the Tsar , and with almost unlimited authority . Its head was member of the Committee of Ministers , and by his intimate relations with the sovereign and freedom from other control became the most powerful personage in the empire . This institution was preserved by Alexander II . with its attributions intact . Although by law subjects of the Tsar could no longer be arrested and condemned without legal process , the Third Section could seize , incarcerate , or deport at will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not pretend to punish or to inteifere with the course of justice against crime ; it merely suppressed indefinitely individuals who were deemed a danger to public order . Its existence after the inauguration of the reign of law presents an anomaly similar to that of lettres de cachet in France , of which the King could avail at pleasure , despite tribunals and statutes . During the early years of Alexander II . s reign , when Russia seemed progressing toward a new and glorious future , it was seldom resorted to . An attempt upon his life in 1866 restored it to favor and activity . Notwithstanding its irresponsible character and its almost unlimited powers , it was worsted in the duel with nihilism from 1870 to 1878 . Of its last chiefs , General Mezentsof was assassinated , and General Drenteln , severely wounded , resigned . Its inefficiency caused a change in its organization ; a double police led at times to absurd results , and the public agents of one department often wasted their efforts in pursuing the emissaries of the other , acting in secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1880 , the Third Section was abolished , but in name only ; it was removed from the imperial chancellery and united to the ordinary police , in order , by giving the whole service a single head , to increase its efficiency . Both departments were placed under General Loris Melikof , upon whom , as Minister of the // Interior , almost dictatorial powers were conferred for the preservation of public order . While this change made no alteration in the attributions of the secret police , it was a slight gain in principle . The Third Section was no longer under the personal direction of the Tsar , but became one of the departments of government , and as such was subject to administrative control . The unreasoning violence and monstrous atrocities of the radical party not only led to the revival of this tremendous engine of despotism with increased powers , they have also turned the wheel of progress backward , deprived the nation of liberties accorded , and destroyed the hope of further concessions for years to come . Modifications in existing statutes were commenced in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By the penal code of 1863 flogging was abolished , save in disciplinary regiments and for insubordination in prisons . General Trepoff , the able and energetic prefect of the capital , irritated by the insolent demeanor of a political offender , Bogoloubof , detained in the St. Petersburg jail , ordered him to be flogged . Vera Sassoulitch , a young woman in a distant province , who had herself been a victim of police tyranny , confined arbitrarily for two years without being charged with crime , only just released , and still under surveillance , without personal acquaintance with the prisoner , but sympathizing with his political opinions , determined to avenge the insult . Hastening to St. Petersburg , she gained access to Trepoff and shot him . Arrested and arraigned , she avowed the deed , and regretted only its partial success . She was defended by able advocates , whose eloquence electrified audience and jury , and she was acquitted almost by acclamation . An appeal , entered by the government prosecutor , was granted by the court , although contrary to the code . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but friends , aided by an excited and defiant populace , kidnapped her on her way to confinement , and hurried her over the frontier . Bogoloubof 's flogging was in accordance with the law , but Trepoff 's action was condemned by public opinion ; its manifestation in Vera Sassoulitch 's acquittal despite law and evidence , the loudly applauded speeches in her behalf , and her rescue , aroused the apprehensions of the government . The Tsar , by successive ukases in 1878 and 1879 , first transferred temporarily to special tribunals all crimes against public functionaries , thus amplifying the existing statute , and exempting the whole class of officials from the ordinary operation of the law ; then all crimes against the state and state functionaries were deferred to military courts , where the process was summary , and the death penalty , prohibited to other tribunals , could be inflicted . Nihilists retaliated by increased boldness and audacity . Prince Krapotkine was murdered by them at Kha*rkof , General Drenteln , chief of the Third Section , was wounded , and Solovief attempted the life of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1879 , authorizing governors - general of provinces to deport suspected individuals without trial , and to bring all offenders , without distinction , before drumhead courtsmartial , have them judged without preliminary examination before magistrates , condemned without hearing , and executed without appeal . A year or two of comparative tranquillity ensued , but the explosion of the Winter Palace and the assassination of the Tsar induced Alexander III. , shortly after his accession , to issue the famous ukase and manifesto of 1881 . He therein solemnly asserted the principle of autocratic rule , established the conditions of a minor and a major state of siege , prescribing the measures to be in force according as the one or the other might by ministerial decree be declared to exist in any portion of the empire . This enactment extended the powers of provincial governors , and enabled them arbitrarily to close factories and industrial establishments , to deport individuals from any locality , and to remove them from the jurisdiction of ordinary tribunals ; it authorized the police to arrest and imprison all persons suspected of treasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere at any time , and to affix seals sequestering property . When and wherever the major state of siege was proclaimed , the powers of the governors were increased almost indefinitely ; they could at will fine and imprison such persons as they deemed it injudicious to bring to trial , suspend all publications , close all educational establishments , and sequester property , not merely when the owner was suspected of offence , but whenever , in their opinion , he was culpable of negli // gent administration thereof , prejudicial to public order . Equality before the law was violated by permitting persons of high rank to testify in private without appearing in court . Publicity of proceedings was first evaded by holding sessions in small rooms packed beforehand with government agents , and with no accommodation for the public . Subsequently political trials were held with closed doors ; the accused might claim the presence of three of his family or friends , and this privilege was finally restricted to his wife or a direct relative , and limited to one person for each prisoner . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports of the official gazette . For banishment to Siberia however , the approval of a special tribunal , formed by delegates appointed by the ministers of Justice and of the Interior , was necessary , and it could not exceed five years ; this concession was one more of name than of reality , in view of the usual subserviency of state officials . These measures were the response of the government to the successive attacks of the revolutionary party ; assassination following closely upon ukase , and ukase upon assassination . In the early stages of the struggle , when frequent cruel and murderous attempts upon high officials , and even upon the sacred person of the Tsar , seemed to inaugurate a reign of terror , the nation recognized the necessity for energetic action , and public opinion was hostile to the pestilent disturbers of social order . An editorial of the Gobs ( Voice ) declared " that these men have themselves shown the way to deal with them ; their arms are the dagger and the pistol ; it is meet that they should be judged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bewildered , was impatient of the inefficiency of the police , and early in Alexander III . ' s reign organized a kind of vigilance committee to co-operate with the authorities . This Holy League ( Sviataia Drouzshina ) , or League of Safety ( Drouzshina Spassenia ) , accomplished but little ; its creation , however , was a manifestation of sympathy from all classes with the efforts of the government to repress anarchy and maintain order . The terrible severity of the measures adopted in self-defence is due to the rancorous hostility and savage violence of the nihilistic party blindly butting against a stone wall . It has no affiliation with the people whose cause it pretends to espouse ; it presents no comprehensive plan , no scheme for the regeneration of the nation , to rally in its support the partisans of wise reform . Destruction is its motto , and chaos its millennium . Arbitrary and tyrannical as the ukases of the Tsar may appear , they are directed against political offences , and their action , abrogating all law , is restricted to them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public opinion ; in deference thereto they are declared to be of temporary duration , war measures to be in force so long only as violence is resorted to . Whereas formerly the exercise of irresponsible power was the rule and natural condition of things , it is now tacitly acknowledged to be the exception , and the reign of law to be the normal state . Other countries have resorted to similar expedients in similar crises , as in Germany against the socialists , and in England against the Irish , with , however , the grave difference that their application depended on popular assemblies and not on personal will . For the present , victory remains with the gros batailbous of autocratic power ; but the end is not yet , and the remedy has aggravated the evil . It has nourished a spirit of universal suspicion , consequently of frivolity , throughout society ; it has crushed interest in public affairs , and paralyzed free and serious discussion of national matters . Russia is turning in a vicious circle : the impatience of radicalism induced repression , repressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which begat violence . The empire is divided into two hostile camps , arrayed in irreconcilable opposition , the one armed with all the might of absolute power , the other , like a wolf at bay , animated with a fierce and savage resolution , born of despair , but fanatical and determined . Never in any Christian country have so many and such great changes been peaceably accomplished in so short a period as in Russia by Alexander II . One of them alone would have immortalized a reign , yet they have been followed by his murder , and a worse state of affairs than before . This strange and melancholy result is due to the exuberant nature of the Russian people , excessive in all things , and to the timid spirit of Russian legislation , halting in its onward course , and curtailing with one hand what it granted // with the other . Too much was perhaps attempted at once , and hopes too extravagant were aroused . The radicals , disappointed , turned in fury upon their masters , and , like the ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government lies in the loyalty of the masses ; this is yet unshaken , but the peasant 's mind is sore perplexed , and , as usual , seeks in pious legends and parables , generally , like the following , the product of its intense devotional feeling , an explanation of the mysterious events which disturb its veneration for the sacred person of the Tsar . " When God heard of the fourth attempt to assassinate Alexander II. , He called St. Nicholas and said to him , If the people are so much incensed against my servant the Tsar , he must be guilty of grievous sin ; protect him yet one time more ; but if he do not amend , then leave him to his fate . ' St. Nicholas accordingly saved him when the palace was blown up , but apparently he did not repent , for St. Nicholas then gave him over to his enemies , and he fell . " This instinctive confidence of the people was not misplaced in the case of the last Emperor . The wise and beneficent measures which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by others still more profoundly modifying the institutions of Russia . While deeming it necessary to curb the irrational haste of extreme radicals , he was anxious to satisfy the aspirations of the nation , and to establish reform upon a sure and settled basis . With this end in view , the convocation of a national assembly , to be elected by the provincial assemblies and city municipalities , was decided upon in principle early in 1881 , with the approbation of Alexander III. , then Tsesarevitch . It was to be a deliberative and consulting body , and final decision upon the measures it recommended was to be left with the Tsar . The scheme was thoroughly elaborated in committee , and on the morning of his assassination the Emperor authorized its publication in the official gazette . Before leaving the palace , he said to the Princess Iourievski , " I have just signed a paper which I hope will produce a good impression , and show Russia that I wish to grant all that is possible . " Making the sign of the cross , as was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To-morrow it will be proclaimed ; I have given the orders . " A few hours later he fell a victim to radical hatred . Alexander III . was at first inclined to persevere in the liberal policy , which had his sympathy , but other counsels soon prevailed . Before his father 's mangled corpse he declared war to the death upon radicalism and nihilism , and issued his manifesto of 1881 . For political offenders in Russia there is neither law nor justice ; the way of these transgressors is hard , and their lot deplorable . They are not only subjected to penalties of especial severity , but their sufferings are increased by the animosity of all in government service . These enthusiastic partisans are , with the exception of the rabid anarchists , animated by noble motives , and belong generally to the better classes . Statistics reveal the fact that four-fifths of them are either nobles , sons of priests or officials , or well-to-do citizens who have had a liberal education , and that of the entire number only one per cent . can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life and to contact with common criminal* . For the rest of the nation , wise laws , regular courts , trial by jury , and fair administration of justice exist . The penal code is one of the mildest in Europe as regards its enactments . Capital punishment was abolished by Elizabeth in 1753 ; it has since been revive ( h for cases of high treason , but can be inflicted only by military tribunals . Under the laws of Finland , which recognized the death penalty , not an execution has taken place since its cession to Russia in 1809 ; and by the present code established there it is now restricted as it is in the empire . The knout was abolished by Nicholas early in his reign , and flogging was suppressed by law in 1863 ; it can now be legally inflicted only in disciplinary regiments , for insubordination in prisons , and by peasant courts . This mode of punishment has been so long and so universally applied that it is not surprising to find it yet frequently , though illegally , resorted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the government in patriarchal fashion has flogged its subjects , with scrupulous observance of the Scriptural injunction . No class was exempt , and the great reformer Peter never hesitated to apply the rod with his imperial hands to the highest of his nobles the peasant still prefers it to other penalties , and in spite of the law it is constantly abused . // The lenity of the law is counteracted by the abuses of the prison system , which are a disgrace to humanity , and have been reprobated by none more severely than by Russians themselves . The heaviest penalty that may be decreed by the ordinary tribunals is exile to Siberia , with hard labor , for twenty years . Siberia has been a penal colony since the sixteenth century , and to it have since been added the Caucasus , Turkistan , and the island of Saghalien . Exile was first resdrted to as a means of ridding society of troublesome members , and of pacifying conquered countries . Whole districts of schismatics were deported to stifle heresy , and whole provinces were depopulated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in themselves excessive , especially to those accustomed toRussian winters ; the climate is not more inclement than that of a large portion of the empire , nor as deadly as that of the penal colonies of France , more recently established . For the great majority of the exiles there is no great change in this respect from the homes they leave . Convict life is , however , made terrible from the outrageous cruelty and venality of officials . They are generally petty tyrants , exempt from any supervision , and free to exercise their power to oppress and plunder without control . Exile as punishment for all criminals , from the mere vagrant to the murderer , dates from the commencement of this century . The condemned may be divided into two classes : those sentenced to hard labor with total or partial loss of civil rights , and those who for minor offences are simply deported to reside in Siberia as forced colonists . The latter class comprises also those who are arrested by administrative order , and compelled to reside in remote localities of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and until within comparatively recent times , conviction to exile and hard labor was condemnation to a life-long lingering torture . The convicts , assembled at central stations , were heavily ironed and chained together in gangs ; the journey of from 4700 to 5200 miles was performed on foot , and occupied from two t*two and a half years of daily agony . Once condemned , the victim was dead in the eye of the law ; his heirs inherited his property , if it was not confiscated ; his wife might remarry ; he lost name and identity in a living tomb ; he toiled in the mines , in iron and salt works , suffering every conceivable privation , exposed to harsh and brutal treatment from irresponsible overseers , until he welcomed death as a relief . The wretched fate of the " Decembrists " of 1825 aroused a throb of sympathy throughout the empire ; no one dared murmur against the iron rule of Nicholas , but public distress found a voice that echoed through the world in the devotion and self-sacrifice of Russian women , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , craved as a boon permission to accompany their fathers , husbands , and brothers . The stories and traditions of that dreadful period still cast their shadow over Siberian exile . Severe as the penalty now is , it has been greatly mitigated . Harshness and cruelty on the part of officials who know no restraint other than that of their own pleasure are only too common , but the present law makes ten months count as a year , the journey is made during the summer , and the exiles , no longer chained together , are transported most of the distance by rail and by steamers . The mines , of such evil report , are now abandoned , and the hard-labor convicts are employed on roads or on public works ; they are confined in the prisons only during the first quarter of their sentence , and afterward lodge in the villages ; they may receive money and relief from friends , and when their sentence has expired they are embodied among the forced colonists , but can not return to Russia . The second class of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower ranks of the people , for whom Siberian life is not exceptionally hard . They comprise offenders condemned , for minor offences , to periods seldom exceeding five years , suspicious persons deported by administrative order , and troublesome members of rural communes , expatriated as such by the authority of peasant tribunals . The latter are frequently accompanied by their families as willing emigrants from wretched homes , to whom any change is welcome , and who by their numbers largely increase the aggregate total . They are restricted to special localities , and are under police surveillance ; they depend for a livelihood upon their own exertions , and if they have or acquire means , may evade irksome police control by bribery .
