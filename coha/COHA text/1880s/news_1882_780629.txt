txt After the North-western war , the one prominent subject of discussion among railroad men in this City yesterday , was the reported combination of William H. Vanderbilt , Franklin B. Gowen , of Philadelphia , and James McHenry , of London , to divert traffic from this City to Philadelphia . The story as told in a Loudon letter to the Sim , had on its fare every probability of truth . It was stated that Mr. Vanderbilt was the power which held the throne for Mr. Gowen , the President of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad , and that he was indebted to Mr. McHenry for the help which that gentleman gave to him a year ago , in securing the control of the Cleveland , Columbus , Cincinnati and Indianapolis Railroad , a result which Mr. McHenry accomplished by the use of the proxies which were held for the benefit of the Atlantio and Great Western holders of the Western extension bonds . These alleged facts were cited to show that Mr. Vanderbilt was on such terms of busluess intimacy with McHenry and Gowen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at all events not Improbable . Then followed the story itself , of the establish . ment of another great railroad from the West to the Atlantic sea:board . Many years ago , it wee said , when Erie was in the hands of Fisk and Gould , McHenry concocted a scheme for building what he called the Jersey Shore , Pine Creek , and Buffalo Railroad , to run from Salamanca , the eastern tertninnq of the Atlantic and Great Western Road , to Williamsport , where connection would be made with the Reading Road . That scheme was abandoned when tile friends of McHenry secured possession of the Erie Road , and it is now I egun again because the organization of the Erie Road Is hostile to Mr. McHenry. end he wants to secure an outlet to the Atlantic independent of the Erle . It is now mortised , the story says . for the Atlantle and Great Western Road . which is now known as the New-York , Pennsylvania and Ohio Railroad , to build the Pine Creek Road as far east from Salamanca as Antrim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remainder of the road to Williamsport , where it will connect with the Rending . Mr. Vanderbilt , it was further alleged , secured the present west-hound coal traffic for the Now-York Central Road by the favor of the Pennsylvania Railroad . which Is his greatest compotitor , and he was anxious to be eumnelputed from its control . In view of the aceompliatiment of this result the New-York , Pennsylvania and Ohio , the Pine Creek , the New-York Central , and the Reading Road have entered into a compact , the more important provisions of which are the following : " The said parties of the first , second , third , fourth , and fifth parts covenant and agree with each other that upon the completton of the said two railroads , to be eonstrneted under articles first and second of this agreement . the said several lines of railroad owned . Dperated , and controlled by theta shall be use a for the lnterohangc of local and through traffic . as a system of connecting lines forming one through line from the City of Phtlitaeiphia to the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other perttes hereto that the new line sloe have the termer. of all the needing Company 's halm/lore and euuthere Railway connections now existing or hereafter to he secured , constructed , or formed . The New-Yore Central Company covenants and agrees with the other parties hereto that the new line seen have the benefit or all the Central company 's Western and Northern connections now existing or he.rieirair to he secured . constructed , or formed . Beaffing Company covenants and a . rees with the paeoes ( if the tirsr , second , third , and fourth parts that a .. railway trance , the route . direction , or destination of which it can control , , to , shall be thrown on the new line . " The result of tins combination of Mr. Vanderbilt , Mr. Gowen , and Mr. McHenry would be , it was said , to divert the traffic co this City which is now brought here by the New-York Central Railroad to Philadelphia , the terms of the contract obliging Mr. Vanderbilt to send ail his Western freight intended for Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New-York , Pennsylvania and Ohio Lout would also , it was said , be taken from the Erie and emit over the Reading . Road , so that this City would suffer areatly from the combination . When a reporter of Tot : TIMES suggested this possibility -o 31r . Riddle . President of the Rook Island Boni : at the Windsor Hotel Yesterday , he looked at his cp  --  stioner intently for a moment , and then said : " 1 ) 0 you believe any such story as tnat ? Do you believe that Mr. Vanderbilt is fool enough to ruin the takiness of his principal road ? I don't. " 31r . RldfIle walked away without volunteering any further comment . Ilugh .1 . Jewett , President of the Erie Road , of which the New-York . Pennsylvania and Ohio Is an important link , when asked in regard to the story , said : " I have no positive knowledge whatever on the subject . I have heard rumors in regard to this matter for a lone time , hut I have never been aide to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no reason to believe that Mr. Vanderbilt lies entered into any contract of the kind now spoken of with Mr. McHenry . " " What En-dot would such a contract have on the business of the New-York . Lake Erie and Western ? " " Ail that I can say is this , " said Mr. Jewett . " We are not at all alarmed at any of the threats which have been : made of building a road from Salamai , ea to connect with the Reading at Williamsport . I should anticipate no serious consequences either to the Erie Roan or to the traffic of this City from the building of such a road . But I do not believe that any such road is contemplated . I regard this story as simply a fiction invented by McHenry for purposes of his own . It is a matter of some importance to a man like him to make the public believe that he is on terms of such business Intimacy with Mr. Vanderbilt that be can negotiate with him for a combination of interests , Mr. Vanderbilt , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Now-York Central , but he Is not making a connection with the New-York , Penneylvania and Ohio . That part of the alleged contract is a pure fiction born in the brain of McHenry . " Mr. W. IT . Vanderbilt , when his attention was railed to the story , said that it was like a great many other things printed about him . There was a small foundation of truth in the report , upon which a eurerstructure of lies had been built which almost bid the facts from view , " There is liard:y as fact in this whole story as it Is printed , " said Mr. Vanderbilt , " and any man acquainted with the railroad business of this country would know upon reacting it that it was a tissue of falsehoods almost from beginning to end . In the first place , the story that I was indebted to James McHenry for securing the control of the Cleveland , Columbus , Cincinnati and Indianapolis Railroad Is totally false . James McHenry never maned Dr pretended to own one-quarter of the stock for which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control of the road . I am the owner of more than twice as much stock in that road as ever 3icllenry pretended to own or control , and all the English holdings put together did not amount to so much as I owned myself . It is true that the votes on MelIenry 's stock were cast for ma , but if I remember right 1 held proxies for about copo votes , and I could have carried the election without any help from Mr. Meilenry . So far as Mr. Gowen , of the Reading Road , is concerned , the story now told says that he , too , is In my power , and that I practically govern bin In nis actions . Now , the fact is that Gowen is a man of ability . He manages the Reading Road to suit himself , and he never comes to me for advice . I do n't know that I shortie , give him advice if he came to me , for I think the President of a railroad who can not manage it had better get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his position to somebody who understands it . I have not , as has been charged , been able to control Mr. Gowen or to influence Mr. McHenry in regard to the combination which it is said lies been formed to divert traffic from this City . I thought when I first read this ridiculous story that I would say nothing until I heard what Gowen had to say , but the whole sub- is so absurd that I have concluded to open my mouth . The idea that I , who have every motive in the world to bring all the trade that I can to this City , should deliberately enter Into a scheme to divert it to Philadelphia is simply laughable . " " But have you not entered into some sort of a combination with Mr. Gowen and Mr. McHenry to give certain business of the New-York Central to the Reading Railroad ? " " I have entered into a compact to give certain business to the Reading Road , " was the answer , " but Mr. McHenry Is not a party to that compact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have . The terms of the compact as yon have read them to me are correct , but the assertion that McHenry is a part to them Is a falsehood . McHenry and I are good friends . He visits my family , and I visit him when I am in Europe , but we have no business relations , for the simple reason that the Atlantic and Great Western Iload does not reach my road at all . I have no use for it , and therefore I have no business connection with McHenry . Now , this compact about which so much talk is being made was entered into about a year ago . The contracting parties are the New-York Central , the Pine Creek , and the Philadelphia and Reading Railroads , with the lines controlled by the Central , which make a connection with the Pine Creek Road . We are building the Pine Creek Road from Antrim to Williamsport , and we expect to have it In running order next year , Mr. McHenry has nothing whatever to do with it . When it is completed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Beading , giving us an outlet for our Western traffic to Philadelphia . The Pine Creek Road was begun by the New-York Central because Mr. Sloan. who used to send all his coal over our road , built an extension of the Delaware and Lackawanna and carried this traffic over his own road . The result was that the New-York Central lost the business on about 700,000 tons of freight a year , end I naturally looked about me to see what I could do to make up for this loss of business . I found the solution in the building of the Pine Creek Road , which , connecting with the Reading at Williamsport. will enable the New-York Central to open up a ereat etial territory : and compete with Mr. Sloan In this business . Thus we shall not only make up for the business which we lost by the building of the extension of the Delaware and Lackawanna. which is for the interest of our stockholders solety , but we shall introduce a new factor into the coal trade by producing competition in the business . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reading available for our purposes , we were obliged to give to that road some equivalent for the benefits which we were to derive from it . The Reading carried us into the coal regions , and made for us a new business to take the place of that which we had lost from Mr. Sloan . In return for this we agreed to give to the Reading , as soon as the Pine Creek Road is finished and connection is made at Williamsport , all our Western and Northern business ; designed for Philadelphia , We have not been giving this business to the Pennsylvania , as those who have started this story of the McHenry compact say . It has bean given to the Delaware end Leckawanna , and in return for It we received the coal business until the extension of that road was built . It is a simple business proposition . The New-York . Central received something from the Delaware and Lackawanna , and it gave something to the Delaware and Lackawanna . It receives nothing from that road now , and it proposes to transfer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it an equivalent for the traffic which it has lost . " " Then , according to the terms of the contract , no traffic is to be diverted from this City ? " Not at all . On the contrary , this City is to he Der efited by an increased traffic in coal . The Western and Northern business of the New-York Central which is to be given to the Reading is ; imply the busineee which has hitherto gone over the Delaware and Lachawanna to Philadelphia . It will hereafter go over the Reading line . We open to the Beading all our territory in the North and West , and the Reading opens to us a coal-field from which wo shall draw a business equal . if not tuoerior , to that which we have lost . That is all tee compact about which so much is being said amounts to . Mr. McHenry has nothing to do with It , and the agreement , so far as it has any hearing on this City at all . certainly has a tendency to increase the traffic here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
