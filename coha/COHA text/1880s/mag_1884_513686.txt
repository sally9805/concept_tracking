BEEF . FROM THE RANGE TO THE SHAMBLES . AN establishment in Chicago which combines the operations of " shipping " and of " canning " beef has a slaughtering capacity of 400,000 head annually . When we add to this the requirements of other similar although smaller concerns , and the large number shipped eastward on the hoof , we have a grand total of not far from 2,500,000 head marketed in the city of Chicago alone . To meet this unceasing and regular demand there must be an unfailing source of supply somewhere in reserve from which an average daily quota can be expected . Whence does it come ? Let the five great trunk lines which have their termini on the borders of Lake Michigan answer . Like the outstretched fingers of a hand , they meet in the central palm , Chicago . All from the West , but from the extreme northern and southern portions , Texas representing the latter , and the utmost limits of Montana the former . Ten thousand miles of rail at least are occupied in the transit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " conveyed to the mind all that was rough and lawless in the uncivilized border white man . Tall , raw-boned , long-armed , with broad sombrero hat , and wild and unkempt locks and visage , he was at once the representative of the State and the terror of the newly arrived emigrant seeking a home in the wilderness . To-day some of his characteristics have descended to the native steer , and the broad-horned , lank-sided , long-legged bovine ranger of the prairies has usurped the title and the place of his possibly more human prede cessor . To each class of these native Texans are we indebted for much of the stock which is now covering the immense grassproducing regions of the broad Northwest . With the great annual cattle drives which start from the arid plains of the Red River and the Pecos comes the wild cow-boy , with his six - shooter on his hip and his leathern girdle bristling with the little metal cylinders . The cool breezes from the snow-clad peaks of " the Rockies " temper somewhat his heated blood , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a better protection of life and property , which is now pretty well inaugurated in the northern Territories , has already had its effect in modifying his reckless disregard of any restraint not imposed by himself . Change of temperature and of climate has likewise produced a marked impression upon the Texas steer , after being for a few years transplanted to a more temperate zone . The nutritious grasses of Wyoming and Montana , combined with the fresh and vigorous air , give even to the beef of a southern - bred bovine an improved flavor and quality ; while the great attention recently paid by stock-growers to the introduction of the best-blooded animals has already been instrumental in raising the grade of entire herds now roaming over the northern ranges . No beef- producing Territories have a higher reputation than those above-named in the markets of the Lake City , and while in the Eastern towns the indiscriminate title of " Chicago beef " is given to all passing // through its slaughter-houses , yet the expert buyer knows full well from what source to seek for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great aversion to what they are pleased to designate as " Western beef , " not knowing , or perhaps not earing to know , that the very finest corn-fed animals in the world come from the broad and fertile prairies which have been subdued into bearing the richest grasses and the most abundant fat-producing cereals in the country . The great reservoir from which has been drawn the bulk of the cattle which are now becoming so abundant in all our Western Territories is the State of Texas . In 1870 one-seventh of the horned cattle in the United States was found within its borders , and it outnumbered the aggregate of those of all the other States and Territories west of the Missouri , California and the Pacific coast included . This ratio was slightly changed by the statistics of 1880 , the State representing somewhat less than one-eighth of the whole numbcr , while it still contained more than all the others mentioned above . From this source of supply has been drawn the great bulk of the range cattle now to be found on the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to huge proportions , and yet dating back in these States and Territories a few years only . As an evidence of this we note that in 1870 the number given for Montana , Wyoming , and Colorado was a little less than 280,000 . Ten years later Wyomiug alone equalled this , while the three together aggregated nearly 800,000 . We do not doubt that an accurate census taken to-day would more than double these figures . To Texas , then , we must still look for the supply from which to draw recruits to further develop the capabilities of the northern ranges . Like the tide of immigration which is daily landin* thousands of foreigners on the shores of the New World , more than equalling the relative birth increase , so the annual cattle drive from Texas must yet be the base of supplies for all the country north . Said one of the " kings " who holds his court on the broad ranges of the great plains to a friend spending a few weeks at Little Rock , Arkansas , partly for recreation , but more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LxIx. - INo. 410. -i 9 of the Southwest : " If you are inclined to invest in cattle , and want to move cautiously in an enterprise in which at present you have no experience , buy steers . " On this hint I acted , and while I drop the personal in what I may have to say in the remainder of this article , the facts as stated are the result of somewhat definite knowledge in the premises . There are several ways of becoming interested in the cattle business on a northern range . One may commence by buying out a small herd , with the ranch and primitive equipments which accompany it , and with this nucleus build up by natural increase and additional purchases from time to time . To do this the owner must have had some experience in the business , or have secured the services of a competent foreman , or , better , both . Or , again , one may contract in Texas during the winter for a given number of one or two year old steers , to be delivered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer . Having previously made an arrangement for their herding for two or more years , for which he pays annually one dollar per head , inchiding all expenses , all he has to do is to await their arrival about midsummer , see them counted and branded , and then turn them loose upon the range . Or , thirdly , he may become a stockholder in one of the organized gigantic companies already existing , in which case he will probably pay full value for his shares , and if the present high prices of beef cattle continue , will receive fair dividends for his investment . In this latter case lie may rernaii* in the business ten years , and if at the , end of that time the herd should fail to count out one-half of the original number , lie would no more know what had become of them than a director of a broken hank would know where to look for its missing capital . If the second method is adopted , in accordance with the advice given above , we will suppose a purchase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two thousand steers , one-half to be yearlings , and the other half two-year-olds , to be delivered on a range in Wyoming the following summer . These would be well bought at fifteen and eio-hteen dollars a head respectively , and then only as part of a larger drive of perhaps ten or twelve thousand going through to the same locality . About oiie-third cash will be paid at the signing // of the contract , an equal amount when the cattle are started on the trail early in April , and the balance when they are delivered on the range . Of course in a transaction of this character responsible parties must be dealt with , but most of the larger herders are " princes " in fortune as well as " kings " in the business , and are men of honor , having a reputation to maintain . With the early starting of the grass in the spring the cattle are on the trail . They have the road brand by which the present owner is known , and are headed northward for their new and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they reach their destination , and in the windings of the road , and in the course which many a wayward steer will take , no doubt much more . If all goes well , and no mishaps occur , the end may be reached in three months ' time , or about the middle of July . In the hands of a careful foreman they will come through with but little loss in flesh and numbers . The word " drive " is a misnomer as applied to the trail . It is exactly this which should not be done . Cattle once gathered , and headed in the direction of their long journey , should be allowed to " drift " rather than be urged . Walking as they feed , they will accomplish their twelve or fifteen miles a day with but little exertion to themselves , and with very much less care and anxiety on the part of the herder . This remark is especially applicable to the handling of beef herds , and to " through " Texans likewise , with the qualification that there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep them up to the mark ; and it is among these last that the losses , if any , occur . All excitement of the animals is to be avoided , and the dangers of a stampede are lessened in proportion as the cattle are handled with gentleness and discretion . When a panic does arise , it is then that the cow-boy himself must be equal to the situation , and ride fearlessly to tura the flank of the flying beasts . No fear of a charge of the long horns must then affect him , but putting his " broncho " on his mettle , he must ride hard and ride long until the column is headed and the herd once more brought into line . A successful stampede within a hundred miles of the starting-point may result in the return of the animals to their native heath , or , farther on , to their being scattered abroad upon the plains , not all to be found for weeks , if ever . There are several distinct trails across the plains , and the pathways are as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hoofs of thousands for years past . The essentials of grass and water are to be considered in a region none too well supplied with these requisites , and the possibilities of fencing and occupation in districts which are being rapidly redeemed from their original state . The raids of hostile Indians no longer enter into the question , and the chances are that the full quota of the winter 's purchase will be safely delivered on the , range within a few days of the expected time . If this is not later than the first of August , the new arrivals will have ample time to become wonted to their new home , and to settle down in a peaceful frame of mind , taking on all the flesh possible before the advent of the wintry blasts . The count and the branding over , the cattle are distributed upon the range , and told to shift for themselves . If the grass is well cured and abundant , they will get in fine condition in three months ' time , and be well able to stand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , they do not reach their destination until late in the fall , they are quite apt to be thin in flesh , and if a severe winter comes on , muc Ii loss will ensue . It is in such cases that the large percentage of loss is reported in the returns after aperiod of heavy storms . Ten per cent. , or even more , of loss may have to be charged against a herd of " through " cattle in this condition , while two per cent , will fully cover the loss on a well-located range occupied by cattle which have been on the same a year or more . As previously stated , the expense of herding a " bunch " of cattle is one dollar per head annually , which includes all charges after they are turned loose upon the range until they are delivered as " beeves " at the nearest railroad shipping point . If the owner is wise , he will not allow a hoof to be gathered until it has been two years wintered . The temptation is great , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to ship steers that have been only one year upon the range . This is a mistake , as the second year is the one that tells both in the weight and quality of the beef ; and as to age , no steer reaches maturity until he is four years old . High rates , however , have induced many shipments during the past two years , . and the gathering of beeves has been much closer than // formerly . Now for the results of this business , the most simple , easily managed , and conducted with less chance of loss than in any department of the cattle business : Purchase1000 head of vearlin* Texas steers , to be delivered on a northern range , at $15 each 1000 head of two-year-olds , at $18 each Branding same , say T*vo years ' herding , at $1 each per year At the end of second year sell 75() head of the older lot , which will then be four years old , to be delivered at the railroad shipping station , at *33 per head . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ed one year , at $1 each At the end of third year sell the balance of first lot , which will then be five years old , viz. , 200 head ( allowing five per cent . for losses ) , at $36 per head  |p7,200  Also 500 head of the younger lot , then four years old , at $33 . .. 16,500 $48,450 Cost of herding the balance one year At the end of fourth year sell remainder of herd , which will then be five years old ; after deducting ten per cent . for missing and losses , will leave 400 head , at 36 per head 14,400 Add to cost for taxes and incidentals Total product of sales $62,850 Total cost and expenses .... Profit at end of four years-nearly sixty per cent The drawback to investments $15,000 18,000 $33,000 250 4,000 $37,250 1,250 38 500 $500 850 *3P,850 23,000 $62,850 of this character is the fact that constant renewals must be made by purchase , or the business will soon run itself out . With the rapid advance which has taken place in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the possible falling off in the price of beef , which is already apparent , as compared with the prices of 1882 , it may happen that the balance-sheet for the next period may not present as attractive an array of figures . It is fair to state , however , that much higher profits have been realized during the past , when purchases were made fully forty per cent . below the prices named above . It is within the writer 's knowledge that a profit of one hundred per cent . has been realized within three years from the time of the original investment . The result of the first year 's sale will no doubt have the effect of stimulating the somewhat timid operator into becoming interested in a permanent herd . He already begins to think that he knows something about cattle , and talks learnedly to those who are still more novices than himself of ranges and ranches , corrals and round-ups , brands and branding , although he has probably never been within a thousand miles of either . It is comparatively an easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure up on a sheet of paper the cost of a herd , and the increase and profits after a five or six years ' outlay . It is a very different thing to ride the range day after day for three or four months , in snow and rain and mud , or in the dust and heat , or , worse still , to face the blizzard of an almost arctic winter , when the thermometer ranges 20* to 40* below zero , and the wind blows a gale at fifty miles an hour . That cattle live and even flourish in such a climate , with no shelter to cover them , and with no food but the standing grass of last summer 's growth , is one of the mysteries of the business . But the argument is a good one that where the buffalo has found a home and a living for a thousand years , more or less , there may cattle likewise profitably range . At any rate experience has proved it , and herds now numbering hundreds of thousands peacefully graze where less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or murdered the white man whenever a convenient opportunity offered . As a matter of interest to those who are studying the pecuniary results set forth in this article , I will give the figures as written out by an experienced cattle man in one of our Eastern counting-houses during the winter of 1880-81 , the object being to show what would be the result of an investment of about $50,000 at prices as they stood at that time . 1881. 1882. 1883. 1884. 1885 .

A cow-boy scorns a tent , and will r*ll himself in his blanket and sleep under the open canopy of heaven , often during the entire round of seasons . If timber can be had within fifteen or twenty miles , a few hundred dollars will build the necessary pens or " corrals , " and the " shack " or ranch itself is a onestory log structure of two or three rooms seldom consisting of anything more than an earth floor and a mud roof . Until within the last year horses have been comparatively cheap , a good saddle and bridle of ten costing more than the animal itself . Tin plates and cups , iron forks and spoons , with a wagon sheet for a table-cloth and the ground for a table , complete the outfit for the regular meals . But oftentimes even these are a luxury , as frequently the cow-boy is in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bite from hand to mouth , caught at odd intervals , as his only sustenance . As the allowance of twenty per cent . on the gross inventory for losses during the period of six years is a large one  --  and few Wyoming or Montana men wottld be willing to admit any such discount in selling or inventorying a herd-that sum will easily cover taxes , and any increase in the running of the ranch not included in the estimate under that head . On the other hand , present values would largely increase the prices set opposite the different grades given above . While some classes have risen more than others , we could easily add twenty per cent . to the gross footings of the entire list , a corresponding increase , of course , being charged upon the original purchase . When this estimate and these figures were made , barely three years ngo , an investment of $50,000 was considered a very respectable amount with which to start a cattle company . To-day the concentration of smaller interests , coupled with the introduction of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consolidate and build up many large corporations . Firms representing a million of money are no longer rare , and some companies are found whose stock ledger foots up double that sum . In the statement already given of the herding of two thousand steers , the returns are estimated upon a sale to dealers at the railroad shipping station . But it often happens , and indeed it is more usual , for the owner to take his beeves directly through to the Chicago stock - yards , and market them himself . If there is a profit to the buyer , there is also one to the owner , and if he has the time and the ability , he may as well reap the same himself . Supposing him to drive five hundred head , he will require for their transportation twenty-four cars ; these the Union or the Northern Pacific Company will furnish at from one hundred to one hundred and fifty dollars per car , according to the distance travelled . Stock pens for feeding and watering are found at convenient intervals along the line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly cared for during their , long and weary journey , , and even with the best attention considerable shrinkage is inevitable . The owner spends his days and nights in the caboose with his rough assistants , and it is questionable whether he is much more comfortable than the beasts huddled into the crowded cars ahead of him . // Cattle trains arrive in Chicago early in the morning . They are unloaded , the cattle are classified and entered upon the stock-yard books in the name of the consignee , and after they are fed and watered in their respective pens , are ready for the inspection of the buyer . The owner then steps aside , and the commission man takes his place . The selling and the buying are not transactions which occupy a great deal of time . Both classes are experienced in their business , which is often conducted on horseback , the purchaser riding back and forth , and looking over the pens from his favorable point of observation . It is not unusual for a bargain to be struck , the cattle weighed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount , and all before eleven o'clock in the morning of the day of arrival . It rarely happens that any considerable number are carried over into the next day ; the law of supply and demand works in this , as in many other classes of business , with great regularity . This remark applies more particularly to the receipts of the day ; for it is an unquestioned fact that , owing to the immensely increased facilities for canning beef , and the great perfection arrived at in the matter of shipping dressed quarters , the business has assumed proportions not dreamed of ten years since , and the general market has advanced in consequence . Our " cowman " having concluded his business can sit down quietly to a comfortable dinner at the Transit House , with his check for $15,000 or $20,000 in his pocket , make his bank deposit afterward , and take the evening train back to the ranch , without having even spent a night in the city . Let us now see what becomes of the cattle as they pass into the hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " misnomer " when applied to the present system of dressing beef , but we will let it stand , for the want of a more intelligible designation . There are two distinct departments in the large establishments of the day , viz. , the " shipping " and the " canning . " Into the former come the choice corn-fed animals from the great cereal districts of what can hardly now be called the " far West , " as well as the best " grass " cattle which have had the run of the summer ranges . The latter receives most of the " through Texans , " the old cows , and the " scrubs " and " culls " from the better lots . The process of slaughtering each is substantially the same up to a certain point , where the inferior quality passes from the killing to the canning house . As we come within the gate we reach first the outer inclosure or pen , where may be gathered one hundred head of choice shippers . ' ' They come in quietly and without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them are driven into a narrow alleyway adjoining the single pens , where each one is in a few minutes to meet his death . This part of the yard is boarded up with heavy plank about six or seven feet high , and open at the top , along which we walk on a single plank running from end to end . As an animal is wanted , a slide door opens , and he passes into the pen nearest him . Here he stands , unconscious of the fate that awaits him , and that his executioner is at that moment loading the fatal weapon above his head . A few seconds later and a mild-looking man with a short carbine in his hand drops the muzzle to a point in the centre of the forehead , just below the horns , and pulls the trigger . The steer falls without a struggle or a groan , and he passes on to the next , taking the life of half a dozen in a couple of minutes , more or less . The door at the other end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neck , and the animal is drawn out upon a broad platform about fourteen feet wide , at the bottom of which runs a shallow trough to catch the blood . Suspended by the hind-feet , the sticking-knife completes the bleeding process , and then two men step forward and disconnect the head . Four follow , stripping down the hide , two others , in the mean while , taking off the feet . Sawing the breast and haunch bones is the next operation , and then the carcass is hoisted preparatory to taking out the inwards . This accomplished , a number are detailed to do the trimming , cleaning , and turning to account every scrap and particle connected with the animal , so that nothing is wasted , down to the horns and hoofs . While these several operations are in progress the carcass has been moving along a distance of some two hundred feet , being attached to a track overhead . The men at work maintain their relative positions as one after another of the carcasses come before them , and in the brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot the animal is hung up , " drawn // and quartered , " and then left to cool in the chill-room for forty-eight hours preparatory to shipping . Twenty different processes take place in the course of the fourteen minutes aforesaid , and ninety men are engaged in it . The average weight of this class of cattle , as brought into the slaughter-house , is 1250 pounds , and during the summer season five hundred head are killed daily in the nine hours allotted to the work . Perhaps the most satisfactory part of the operations we have witnessed is the scrupulous cleanliness observed throughout . The pure creamy fat and dark rich red meat attest the perfection and purity attained , which the most expert stall-man in Fulton Market can not excel . Next comes the shipping of the quarters , and here science comes to the aid of mechanical skill with the most perfect adaptation of a means to the end . It does not seem possible to improve the " refrigerator " cars as now built and used . We will assist in the loading of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car stands alongside of the platform at the extreme end of the building ; the cooled meat , hanging in rows , is in the adjoining apartment . Once more the sides run along upon a track ; the forequarters , partially severed from the hind , are ready to be cut loose as they are carried into the car . Here rows of hooks extend crosswise just below the roof . In one end are hung the hind-quarters , and in the other the fore , suspended about a foot from the floor ; a sufficient space is left underneath , which is utilized to the full extent for shipping boxes of sausage meat . The ice compartment is in the forward end , and is filled from above and from the outside . The sides of the car are double ; a cool current of air passes around but not through the apartment where the meat is hung . With a proper watching of the ice-box , which is filled from time to time during the journey , the temperature will not vary over four degrees , and the meat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proper point for preservation . Shipped in this way , it will keep for weeks , and be improved by the process . Perfect system , order , and scrupulous cleanliness have brought this mode of transporting beef to perfection , and the day is not distant when the moving of cattle long journeys by rail will give place to the practice of dressed beef shipping , slaughter-houses springing up on the line of the road a thousand miles westward to meet the cattle as they come in on the trail . The canning and packing department is another branch of the business entirely distinct from that of shipping . Up to a certain point the process is substantially the same , until it comes to cutting up the quarters into suitable pieces for these uses . Here division of labor takes complete possession of the work , and it is carried to the perfection of economy . A man will stand by the hour giving but a single turn to his knife , which separates a joint . But one portion of the carcass comes upon his block . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does this , and this only . A hundred others are on the same floor with him , each doing what may seem a trifling portion of the work , but before the carcass , which came in on one side in quarters , leaves the room , it is entirely bereft of bones , and then wheeled away in small pieces ready for the curing and the canning . It is marvellous with what rapidity " boned ox " can be made ready for the table . We are not prepared to say that it will ever find its way on the menu of a Delmonico supper alongside of a turkey rival , nor can we say that we should care to give it a place on even an ordinary bill of fare . We should taboo it , however , only on the ground that it is made up of the inferior parts of poorly fattened animals , or of the " lean and ill-favored kine " of the stock-yards . While walking through one of the latter one day in May last we noticed a pen of gaunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companion said , " What are those cattle doing here ? there certainly can be no market for them . " Much to my surprise , he replied , " They will go off quicker than a better lot ; the canners will pick them up at once . " And so it proved , for they were driven away before a splendid pen of corn-fed " Jowas " near by had found a purchaser . Aside from the facts here stated , there is nothing repulsive or objectionable in the matter of canned beef . The average weight of the class of animals used for " mess " and " canning " is 950 pounds , and 800 head are daily disposed of in this way . If necessities of trade call for a large proportion of barrelled beef , then the carcasses are mostly cut with reference to this demand . In this case the division is made into the va // rious pieces here named , many of which are familiar to household providers , viz. , loins , ribs , mess , plates , chucks , rolls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sirloins , butts , rump butts , strips , rounds , and canning beef . " Extra mess** is composed of chucks , plates , rumps , and flanks , and the time of curing is twentyfour days . All hams are cut into three pieces , or " one set " ; time of curing , sixty days . Plates are cut into five pieces . Loins , ribs , and shoulders are also sold to the city butchers . " Prime " tallow is made from the kidney and caul fat only , while " regular " tallow is made from the other fat , bones , and trimmings . Glue factories and fertilizing establishments use up the bones and refuse , and the hides find their way to the tanneries . Not a scrap of the animal is wasted , or fails to yield some revenue to the buyer . To show the immense nature of the business now centring in Chicago , and the increase which has taken place in the last ten years , we give the statistics as furnished by the reports of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago brought , in the year 1883 , 1,512,212 head ; the receipts from all other sources were 366,732-making a total of 1,878,944 . The receipts for the year 1873 were 761,428 ; so that the business has more than doubled itself during ten years past . The largest receipts on any one day during that period was on November 15 , 1882 , being 12,076 . The largest for one week was on that ending October 20 , 1883 , being 52,192 , while that of the same month gave 217,791 . The total valuation of stock of all kinds received during the year 1873 was $91,321 ,  - -  162 , while for 1883 it was $201,252,772 . A record so remarkable of the growth of a single industry is indeed a marvellous one . But who shall say what the next decade may bring forth ? Before closing this article let me give a few words of suggestion and advice to those who wish to become thoroughly posted either in the cattle business or in the empires over which it is conducted , for such they are in extent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articles and books that have been written will suffice to convey a clear idea of the wonderful country which extends for 200 miles north and south and west of the one-hundredth meridian of longitude .

A brief summary of camp life on the range during the summers of 1882 and 1883 may be of benefit to those who are to follow , and of some interest to those who remain at home . The line of railroad travel across the continent is familiar to many ; the experience on the stage routes , which extend for hundreds of miles far away into the interior of the Territories , is known to but few . Before leaving home you have , no doubt , taken some pains to look up your destination and the means of reaching the same , and have possibly become possessed of a handbill which gives the information that a line of " fourhorse Concord coaches " has been established , leaving tri - weekly , and making the distance , it may be , of 400 miles in six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night travel . When speaking of a Concord coach one not unusually has in view a White Mountain outfit , and looks out on leaving the train for the familiar equipage . Vain delusion ! A low , two-seated , canvas-covered , mud-stained , or alkalidusted vehicle stands near the platform , under the flapping curtains of which we crawl , if fortunate enough to have secured a seat several days in advance ; otherwise one may have to stay over two or four days , as the case may be , waiting for the same . And here for a little practical advice as to personal luggage . You may have been beguiled on leaving home into taking a trunk , and this may be well , as part of the journey is to be within the limits of civilization ; bi*tt leave it behind at the railway station , and in it all linen of every description , except handkerchiefs and a few towels . " Boiled shirts " are not admissible on the plains , and collars and cuffs are an unheard-of luxury . Wear coarse , second-hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few necessaries as possible into a stout valise , not omitting a small supply of medicines most likely to be needed when you are fifty miles from the nearest doctor . Carry a pair of the best and heaviest blankets to be had , a pair of boots , a rubber pillow , and a " slicker , " all tied up with a cord into as compact a bundle as possible : weight and space are both to be considered when on the stage or riding the range . I was told on leaving the East that after the 1st of June we should have almost cloudless skies , with possibly now and then a light shower . Whereas the facts are that it rained more or less every day for three // weeks , and we were more than once encamped beside raging torrents , waiting for the subsidence of the waters . Therefore do not be beguiled into leaving " slicker , " overcoat , or boots behind , as when it rains it rains bard , and when it is muddy the mud is deep and tenacious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through Wyoming in 1882 to leave my gold watch at home , and take a cheap silver one , also to carry as little ready money as possible . No " road agents " had been seen on the line for over two years , and I had not hesitated to say , in consequence , that one was in much more danger of being robbed in the streets of New York than on the plains of Wyoming . This year , although equally for- tunate over stage routes in Montana , yet I had hardly reached home when , on the same line taken by me from Helena to Deer Lodge , two cases of " holding up of hands " occurred in the passes of the mountains , and the passengers were relieved of all their available assets . That such unpleasant episodes may have still more disagreeable incidents was shown by one of our fellow-travellers of last season , who pointed to a scar on the lobe of one ear caused by a road agent 's bullet , who mistook his motion in pulling on a boot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fired without delay . Strictly speaking , there are no roads on the great plains . Certain well - defined trails there are , which can not be mistaken , and as there is very little limit to the area of freedom as soon as one track becomes rough and cut up by travel another alongside takes its place . There are places where no road in Central Park can excel the smooth , hard surface of a track across the prairie , while again there are passes over the mountains and through deep cafions which would exhaust a descriptive vocabulary . Bridges are an exceptional convenience , and streams are forded with safety or with doubtful results , as the weather of twenty-four hours previous often determines . A sudden shower in the mountains , or a day or two of hot sun melting the snows , will send down a raging torrent with very little warning . A variation of two feet in a night is not unusual , and I have sat beside a rapidly running stream more than once , with a stick planted in the edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise or fall , and predicating thereon the chances of crossing during the day . Many narrow escapes have been had and some fatal accidents have occurred in these wild streams of the West . We crossed one roaring little run in Wyoming six times in as many miles , the water coming into the bottom of the coach every time . The sensation is not a pleasant one , when the possibility of an upset in the middle of a stream is considered , especially in a current running six or eight miles an hour . But it will not do to be too critical while travelhin* through this primitive country . It is barely seven years since the Custer massacre , when central Wyoming and Montana were given over to roving bands of red men . It is none too safe even now from the revolvers of the road agents . Be satisfied , therefore , if your slumbers are comparatively safe , even if not altogether undisturbed , and take your rations , which are fair if not luxurious , seasoned with the appetite which travel and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You may not always have butter for your bread or milk for your coffee , notwithstanding that thousands of cows are roaming within a few miles of you . But one gets used to almost anything when necessity compels . If we are to ride a range for a few weeks to get some insight into the cattle business , we will joii an outfit , and take what experience comes in our way . First in importance is to secure a good saddle . Much of our comfort and ability to endure depends upon this . One day 's ride upon an ill-fitting , badly constructed saddle may send a nian into " the hospital " -i . e. , the camp wagon-at the outset . This provided , we will take our choice of fifty horses , more or less , belonging to the ranch , and there is a choice , although the animals are plenty enough . If we should chance to select " a bucker , " the probabilities are that we will come to grief , and bite the dust before many hours are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the animal soon knows that he has found his master . But he also is quite well aware when a " tenderfoot " bestrides him , and he will carry him as far as " his own sweet will " inclines him , and no farther . The Texas ponies are small , tou*h , and unkempt in appearance . Seldom groomed , shod , or stabled , they run loose until wanted for the saddle or the harness , when they are driven in from the range to ' the pen . Picking up their own living on grass // only , they can not stand the hard work of grain - fed animals ; consequently two or three sets must be provided . Each is ridden in turn until exhausted , when another lot takes its place . For this reason at least double the number of horses in daily use must be kept on hand during the season of the round-ups . A couple of horses are placed at our command , and having secured a well-fitted saddle , we are ready for business . This means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to circumstances , starting with the rising sun , perhaps reaching some ranch at noon , or giving a rendezvous for the wagon with the commissary stores . At night we look out for wood and water as prime requisites for a camping ground . These are not so readily at hand as may be imagined in a region proverbially treeless , and where alkali is the basis of most of the water deposits . They are found , however , and we pitch our tent , making it secure by banking against the insidious draughts in the low temperature of summer nights in this elevated region . Blankets are unrolled , and we proceed to make our beds , having previously spread a canvas over the damp or dusty earth , as the case may be . Others are cutting wood , mixing bread , frying bacon , or making coffee , as called upon by the chief cook . The welcome cry , " To supper 1 ' ' soon brings hungry men to their hams around the improvised table . A smoke by the camp fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ere twilight has fairly faded from the western sky . A cow-boy seldom indulges in the luxury of a tent , but with his saddle for a pillow , and a soft hollow in the ground for a cot , rolls himself up in a blanket , and takes the stars for his canopy . The limits of a range may be twentyfive or thirty miles square , or it may be twice the distance in one direction , as the size of the herd or the different sections occupied may determine . Cattle turned out in a region well supplied with water , and where hills and broken country form a natural bouudary , will not often " drift " a very great distance , except in the case of prolonged and severe winter storms . When these occur , natural instinct seems to come to the aid of the beasts , and they move before the gale in search of bare ground and better grass . If they find it , all is well ; if not , the weak ones must succumb , and losses take place according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains upon the ground . Cold weather is not so much dreaded by cattle men as a deep fall of snow without wind . Twenty below zero in the dry air of the plains does not carry with it the same intensity as a like temperature on our Eastern coast ; and although many calves are seen with frdzen ears and tails , attesting the severity of the cold , yet they come through all right if they are old enough to run by the mother 's side . If an Eastern man wonders , when first discussing the cattle business , how the animals are ever found after being turned loose upon time limitless prairies , it is an equal mystery to him , while riding the ranges , to know on what they manage to subsist . To the unpracticed eye a fullgrown steer would apparently starve to death in a week , while the facts are that he is growing fatter every day , and in a moderate winter will even hold his own during the entire season . There is no such thing as a sod known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bare ground rather than of grass . Yet what there is is nutritious beyond the comprehension of one brought up in a region where rain and not dry weather is supposed to be required for the development of grass . I say this with a qualification , for early rains are desirable to start the growth in the spring . After that , the less moisture the better , as the grass cures like standing hay ; and cattle do their own foraging with much better success than an Eastern farmer can put his hay under cover and feed it out to his stock in the winter . The limits of this article will not permit a farther insight into the details of the working of a range . Let him who seeks to know it better leave the fox-hunters of Newport to chase one poor frightened Reynard , whose hounding to death seems to be considered a great achievement , and come out upon the breezy plains where the buffalo still roams , and into the region of the big-horn and the elk-game worth the seeing and the killing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shadow of the mighty mountains which form the backbone of the continent , and he will take in a good deal more stock of health , wealth , and knowledge than he will get on the velvety lawns of tennis , or riding the little circuit of the polo grounds . // " TJj* HAR 'S Mis ' Bliss 's pieces in the I brown kaliker bag , an ' thar 's Mis ' Bennet 's pieces in the bed-tickin ' bao- " said she , surveying the two bags leaning against her kitchen wall complacently . " I 'll get a dollar for both of them quilts , an ' thar 'll be two dollars . I 've got a dollar an ' sixty-three cents on hand now , an ' thar 's plenty of meal an ' merlasses , an ' some salt fish an ' pertaters in the house . I 'll get along middlin ' well , I reckon .

It stood far enough back from the road for a pretentious mansion , and there was one curious feature about it-not a door or window was there in front , only a blank , unbroken wall . Strangers passing by used to stare wonderingly at it sometimes , but it was explained easily enough . Old Simeon Patch , years ago , when the longing for a home of his own had grown strong in his heart , and he had only a few hundred dollars saved from his hard earnings to invest in one , had wisely done the best he could with what he had . Not much remained to spend on the house after the spacious lot was paid for , so he resolved to build as much house as he could with his money , and complete it when better days should come . This tiny edifice was in reality simply the L of a goodly two-story house which had existed only in the fond and faithful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front wall was designed to be joined to the projected main building ; so of course there was no need of doors or windows . Simeon Patch came of a hardworking , honest race , whose pride it had been to keep out of debt , and he was a true child of his ancestors . Not a dollar would he spend that was not in his hand ; a mortgaged house was his horror . So he paid cash for every blade of grass on his lot of land , and every nail in his bit of a house , and settled down patiently in it until lie should grub together enough more to buy a few additional boards and shingles , and pay the money down . That time never came : he died in the course of a few years , after a lingering illness , and only had enough saved to pay his doctor 's bill and funeral expenses , and leave his wife and daughter entirely without debt in their little fragment of a house on the big sorry lot of land . There they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various little petty ways , keeping their heads sturdily above - water , and holding the dreaded mortgage resolutely off the house for many years . Then the mother died , and the daughter , Martha Patch , took up the little homely struggle alone . She was over seventy now , a small , slender old woman , as straight as a rail , with *ar1&lt; black eyes , and a quick toss of her head when she spoke . She did odd housewifely jobs for the neighbors , wove rag carpets , pieced bed-quilts , braided rugs , etc. , and contrived to supply all her simple wants . This evening , after she had finished putting her house to rights , she fell to investigating the contents of the bags which two of the neighbors had brought in the night before , with orders for quilts , much to her delight . " Mis ' Bliss has got proper harnsorne pieces , " said she - " proper harnsome ; they 'll make a good-lookin ' quilt . Mis ' Bennet 's is good too , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I reckon some of em 's old . " She began spreading some of the largest , prettiest pieces on her white-scoured table .

Lor , what bag did I take em out on ! It must hey been Mis ' Bliss 's . I must n't git em mixed . " She cut out some squares , and sat down by the window in a low wooden rockingchair to sew . This window did not have a very pleasant outlook . The house was situated so far back from the road that it commanded only a rear view of the adjoining one . It was a great cross to Martha Patch . She was one of those women who like to see everything that is going on outside , and who often have excuse enough in the fact that so little is going on with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she used to say , in her snapping way , which was more nervous than ill-natured , bobbing her head violently at the same time- " a very great
