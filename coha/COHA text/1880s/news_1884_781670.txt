txt In November , 1869 , Mr. BLAINE was Speaker of the House of Representatives . He had peculiar facilities for knowing the probable course of actual or proposed legislation . He was also familiar with the financial conditions of that eventful period , when the country was still under the stimulus of the unredeemed and at that time irredeemable Government paper money . He had watched with an eager eye the fortunes of the national banks , and had seen that they were making a great deal of money . He was then on intimate terms with Mr. WARREN FISHER , Jr. , of Boston , who , with Mr. JOSIAH CALDWELL , was engaged in the Little Rock and Fort Smith Railroad enterprise . On the 18th of November , on the eve of his departure from his home to attend the approaching session of Congress , he wrote to Mr. FISHER from Boston as follows : " It is quite evident to my mind that at the approaching session of Congress there will be an expansion of the currency to the amount of fifty to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think , will be an addition to the National Bank circulation West and South . My object in writing is to ask in season if your friends would desire to establish a Bank at Little Rock . It will be to some extent a matter of favoritism as to who gets the Banks in the several localities , and it will be in my power to cast an Anchor to the Windward ' in y'r behalf if you desire it . Please think over the matter and confer with Mr. CALDWELL , and let me know y'r desires as soon as you reaChany conclusion . * * * I suppose it might be ' practicable to secure a $500,000 bank ; but in that locality you would hardly wish to go so deep : But they are very profitable institutions  --  say $250,000 . " Mr. BLAINE 'S prediction was correct . " The evidence , " whatever it was , " to his mind " proved trustworthy . At the session of Congress then approaching a bill was introduced by Senator . SHERMAN , and passed July 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circulation by $54,000,000 . The Speaker had hit almost the exact figures . The new circulation was " apportioned among associations in States and Territories having under previous ' apportionments less than their full proportion of the aggregate amount of notes authorized , which had made due application for circulating notes prior to the 12th day of July , 1871 . " Under this bill Arkansas was entitled to a part of the additional circulation . and got it . The accuracy of the Speaker 's information in regard to the proposed legislation confirms his opinion that it was " a matter of favoritism as to who gets got the banks in the several localities . " His general reputation adds strength to that opinion . He was also undoubtedly right in thinking that it would " be in his power to cast an anchor to the windward , " for those who should make it desirable for him to do so . He is on record as desiring very anxiously to make favorable terms with CALDWELL . Here was a new " channel in which he could make himself useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a job of this kind he would be " a deadhead . " Now , it so happens that a bank was established in Little Rock , Ark. , with a capital of " say . $250,000 . " It also happens that the President of that bank is LOGAN H. ROOTS , who was so deeply interested in the railroad affected by Mr. BLAncE 'S ruling as Speaker , in which Messrs . FISHER and CALDWELL were also involved , and in which Mr. BLAINE , after diligently seeking , got a large slice . As late as Dec. 7 , 1870 , Mr. BLAINE wrote to FISHER again on the subject , and on the 9th gave to him and CALDWELL elaborate advice about the kind of bonds to start a bank with , with information obtained from " further conference " with the Controller of the Currency , and " assurances " which " they " gave him as to the privileges to be obtained . It still further happens that in 1884 Mr. LOGAN H. ROOTS , ex-member of Congress , star route jobber , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Little Rock , Ark. , was largely instrumental in giving to Mr. BLAINE the vote of the Arkansas delegation to the Chicago Convention . Mr. BLAINE 'S highly businesslike correspondence will lead all its readers  --  the fifty-odd millions who are now let into his confidence  --  to ask whether the Little Rock Bank was secured by Mr. BLAINE 'S " anchor to the windward . " And it will also suggest the inquiry whether a Speaker of the House who offers his " power " to influence " favoritism " in the action of a high officer of the United States is fit to be President .
