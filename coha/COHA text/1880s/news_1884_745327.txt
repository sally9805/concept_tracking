txt Unless the Senate and House of Representatives come very soon to some agreement regarding the Naval Appropriation bill , either the holiday recess will have to be given up or the Navy Department will be left to begin the new year without any money to pay its running expenses . When the two houses failed to agree on the regular naval hill at the last session they compromised the difficulty by passing a brief measure giving the Navy Department 50 per cent . of the appropriations it received for the preceding fiscal year . The bill provided that this sum should run the department for the first half of the present fiscal year , which period ' will expire on Dec. 31 . Thus far during the present session the conferees on the part of the House have absolutely refused to consider any other than a similar compromise measure to provide for the coming six months . The Senate couferrees have been equally persistent in insisting upon discussing the provisions of the regular bill , prepared by the House itself , and basing upon three Provisions the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conferees could not break . and they reported that fact to their respective houses to-day . As the Senate by a unanimous vote declined to recede from its decision it rests with the House to ask for a new conference committee ; but the House has already passed a joint resolution to adjourn from to-morrow to Jan 5 , and that proposition is now pending in the Senate . The latter will hardly agree to adjourn until the Navy Department is provided for in some way , and if the House persists in its attitude a holiday recess may not be possible . The Senators , at any rate , seem determined that some kind of a naval bill shall be passed by Congress before the end of the year . The earnest desire of many Congressmen to spend Christmas with their families may , however , induce the House to give way to-morrow or Monday , and thus sesecure a recess .
