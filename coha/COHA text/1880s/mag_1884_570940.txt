ARTICLE VIII. - PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS OF LUTHER . THE statement that Martin Luther is the greatest of modern prose writers , in the same sense in which Shakespeare is the greatest of modern poets , will seem exaggerated to most men . For it is but the few that are familiar with the writings of the German reformer . Those who are , will not hesitate to place Luther , as a writer of German prose , by the side of Shakespeare , the greatest of English poets . It happens , also , that neither the one nor the other was a professional writer , who lived by his pen , or intended to enrich his nation with literary riaster-pieces which were to shed honqr and glory alike upon the writer and his country . Both writers , however , were conscious of their superiority , both knew that they wrote for ages to come as well as for their own time , and both were remarkably careless about the editing of their own collected works . There have been long periods during which both Luther and Shakespeare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has taken place a great revival in the interest which men of ability have taken in the writings of these masters . Yet as a popular writer , Shakespeare has been the more fortunate of the two , while Luther has been more popular as a man and as the champion of German ideas . The writings of Shakespeare are more the property of all educated nations that have a stage , while Luther , emphatically a German , is yet to be appreciated at his true value by the world at large . But it is not too much to say that the reading of Luther 's prose alone will repay the trouble of learning the German language . It is a fact worth mentioning that , while Shakespeare has been studied assiduously and not without fair success in the United States , Luther has only been less fortunate , in that his works are widely read by the clergy and laity of a denomination by no means insignificant , and that several scholars of high standing have gone to much labor and expense , in collecting not only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but also the tracts of the times in which the mighty name of Luther was on the lips of all Christendom . Yet the fact remains , that even in Germany , the writings of Luther are not read as generally as they deserve . The greatest philological master of this century never wearied of praising the language of Luther , and many hundreds of German books have been written in honor of Luther 's writings . Just now the German government is engaged in the honorable work of publishing another complete and critical edition of Luther 's writings . But the world , outside of Germany , knows Luther chiefly as the leader of the Protestant Reformation , and half the Protestant world remembers him as an opponent of unbounded severity . In Germany , however , the mere name of Luther is still a great popular power ; his sayings are current coin , and his sentiments find a responsive echo in the breasts of high and low , of profound students and the plain people , who rarely forget a true friend . So good an observer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was an aristocratic tone in Calvin ; Luther was democratic , not because he believed in popular power , for he never did , but because he was a man of the people , and because his writings retain the elements of the truest popularity after the lapse of nearly four centuries . The titles of Luther 's principal writings alone would fill the entire space of the present essay . Walch 's edition of his writings is not complete , and fills twenty-four stout quarto volumes . The more critical Erlangen edition is even less complete , and makes about a hundred duodecirno volumes . Yet a reader really familiar with Luther 's writings will be reluctant to recommend a selected edition , and to name the literary master pieces which have dropped from the pen of Luther , as showers drop from the skies . The reader of Luther 's letters may think them most characteristic of the man ; but in turning to his reformation pamphlets , these will seem essential , while , on general principles as well as upon special investigation , the great theologian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place of honor . There remain the volumes of sermons , the catechetical works of immortal value , and the miscellaneous writings . To say what is best of all these riches is like guessing what is best in Shakespeare 's plays . It may seem rash to // advise that men learn German in order to read Luther , and it may be rash to recommend all that Luther has written . But it is certain that the reader of Luther 's letters , pamphlets , essays and commentaries , will be repaid precisely as is the student of all Shakespeare 's plays , and it is probable that Luther has never written a page that does not bear the vestiges of the great mind to which neither poetry nor philosophy , neither man nor nature , neither Greek and Latin antiquity , nor the logicians and scholastics of the Middle Age were strangers ,  - -  a mind filled to overflowing with sentiment , imagination , learning , literary impulses , and , above all else , a religious faith that shook the world . Surely , such a mind and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and as long as men are thirsty for what is noblest and strongest in literature . It is true that Luther abominated Popery as an institution , and that he turned against the Swiss reformers . Accordingly neither ultramontanism nor distinctive Calvinism will derive much comfort from the tenets of Luther . But nearly as much may be said of the Lutherans themselves , if they go to Luther to find aid and comfort for their modern doctrines and tendencies . It is a reasonable question , however , whether the nineteenth century has any right to go to the sixteenth to find out what it should believe , or how it ought to conduct its affairs . For better or worse it has pleased Divine Providence to let us live nearly three hundred and fifty years after Luther , and these centuries can not have been given to be merely forgotten . We do not ask physicists and astronomers to return to Copernicus for the only or final wisdom . But precisely as we return to Shakespeare for true poetry , so it is ever safe to go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote in German , and to study the Saxon reformer , if we wish to get the benefit of a singularly impressive writer , who was at the same time a great patriot , a great theologian , a great character , and a very great author . Quite likely , but few readers will be disposed to accept Luther 's theological tenets , although it would be rash to call them moribund , even in this country . But we do not read Shakespeare for doctrines ; why then should we read Luther for theological opinions , inasmuch as he never cared to inaugurate a system of theology any more than he attempted // to organize a new church or a new sect ? As we read Shakespeare for poetry , and are not alienated by the Elizabethan 's occasional harshness , so it is well worth while to read Luther for his prose ,  --  despite his passion , despite his theology , and despite his sixteenth-century learning . As men descend into the bowels of the earth for gold or coal , so the modern student may well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver , and hard iron ,  --  to catch the mighty forces that lifted the better part of Christendom out of dependence , and to learn from personal contact with a profoundly religious character , that a great theological mind somehow commands more power than men of the world are prone to acknowledge . The year 1530 brought rising Protestantism to a crisis , for the German Emperor had resolved to avenge the schism which the Augustinian of Wittenberg had occasioned . Luther 's friends insisted that he should not risk his life by attending the diet at Augsburg . He remained in Koburg , the name which he playfully reversed into Grubok . From there he wrote a series of epistles altogether unique in the history of letters . Luther himself had been outlawed , and could not even visit his father , who died about that time . In order to be near his friends at Augsburg , Luther went to the fortress of Koburg , where he promised Melanchthon that three tabei'nacles should be made ,  --  one for the psalms , one for the prophets , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have at his table in Wittenberg , he wrote the following letter Grace and peace in Christ ! Dear Gentlemen and Friends-I have received your joint letter , and learned how goes the world . That you may understand in return how things go here , I let you know , that we , namely , myself , Master Vitus and Cyriacus , shall not go to the diet at Augsburg ; in fact , we have come to a different kind of diet . Just below our window there is a grove , like a little forest , where the jackdaws and crows have appointed a diet . There is such a coming and going , and such a noise , day and night without end , as if they were all drunk and mad . Young and old scream together that I wonder how , long their voices and breath will last . Fain would I know if any of the gentry and knightly squires still tarry with you , for methinks that they have come here from all the world . I have not seen their emperor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly before our eyes . They are not dressed very preciously , all having one uniform color , being black , with grey eyes to match ; and they sing the same song , but with a lovely difference // between old and young , the big ones and the little fellows . Neither do they respect our palace and hall , for their hall is vaulted by the fair , broad sky , their carpet is the open field , decked with fine green branches , and the walls are the end of the world . They do not care for horses and armaments . They move on feathery wheels , with which they escape the guns and flee from persecution . Great , mighty lords they be ; but what they resolve , I know not . From an interpreter I learn that they propose a mighty campaign against wheat , barley , oats , malt and grains of every kind , and many of them mean to earn the knighthood and do great deeds . Thus we sit here in the diet , look and see with loving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the estates of the realm sing merrily and live happily . But we have particular joy when we see them swagger knight-fashion , brandish their bills , and run down all opposition , that victory and honor may be theirs against corn and malt . We wish them all hail and luck , that every one of them may be speared on a fence rail . And I hold that such are the sophists and papists , with their sermons and essays . I must have them all before me in one company , that I may hear their lovely voices and sermons , and behold how very useful they are to examine whatever there is on earth , while they kick from too much leisure . To-day we have heard the first nightingale , for hitherto it would not trust in April . And we have had delightful weather , no rain , save yesterday a little . With you it has been different , perhaps . And now good-bye ; keep our house in good order . From the diet of the jack-daws , April 28 , 1530 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he called it , he wrote the famous letter to his son John ,  --  probably the prettiest letter ever received by a young boy . Another letter told in detail what kind of a seal Luther desired to have made for his use , namely , a black cross fixed in a heart having its natural color , because the cross " does not corrupt nature ; " the heart was to stand in a white rose , and the latter in a sky-blue field surrounded by a golden ring . At the same time he wrote to princes of the realm and complained bitterly to Melanchthon that he and the Protestants at Augsburg had looked to Luther . " If it is my cause , I alone will attend to it , " he said : " I will not have it that you recognize and name me as the principal and the beginner of this cause . " His wife he addressed us my dear master , Lady Kate , " and to a friend in Nuremberg he sent the address , in which he recommended the establishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support out of the public funds . He congratulated the elector of Saxony on his escape " from the hell at Augsburg . " A friend // in Augsburg was thanked for two boxes of confectionery , and was told that Luther had lost more than half his time through " a noise and rattling in the head . " The peculiar resolution finally adopted in Augsburg Luther ridiculed as " worldly wisdom " going to show that Christ can govern " not only talkers , but also fools . " Indeed , as he had been shocked from the beginning by the absurdity of the Papal arguments , so he was now amused by the impertinent order that the gospel should remain a strictly local affair . ff his adversaries would but keep the peace , he was very glad to accept it , " for the Turk is after us . " " We will suffer and yield whatever we can . But we beg that they will not ask of us what is not in our power . " To a statesman in Augsburg , Luther expressed fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day I saw two miracles ,  --  the first , when I looked out of my window , the stars in heaven , together with the whole , beautiful firmament of God ; and yet I saw no pillars , on which the master had rested his vault ; but the heavens did not fall , and the mighty vault still remains firm . There are those who look for the pillars , and would fain touch and feel them . Inasmuch as they can not , they wriggle and tremble as if the skies must surely fall from no other cause than that they can not see and hold the pillars . If they could grasp them , the firmament would stand firm . And the second miracle consisted in vast heavy clouds that hung over us with a weight that one might liken them to a vast ocean ; yet they had no foundation on which they rested ; neither were they contained in a great vessel . Nevertheless they did . not fall upon us , but greeted us with a wry face , and hurried off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundation and our arch that held them , namely , the rainbow . Forsooth , it was a delicate , thin , slender foundation and arch , that vanished in the clouds , and was rather a haze , such as one sees through colored glass . From the same fortress , Luther addressed an open letter to the primate of Germany , the cardinal-archbishop of Menz , who was also a secular prince . Agreement in matters of faith was declared impossible as between Protestants and Catholics , but political peace was offered and urged in pathetic terms " Good God , " Luther added , " our faith does not injure you ; it keeps the peace , teaches peace , leaves you undisturbed , and teaches that we must take nothing from you , but leave you everything . That alone ought to be enough to move you to peace , if the truth alone could not do it . Verily , it helps to keep you all , and has done so hitherto . " In the same letter // Luther appeals to the cardinal-archbishop as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would please the Pope , that fine product of Florence , and with a laugh he might say : Go to , you German brutes , if you will not have me for a Pope , take that . " The letter concludes : " I can not help it , I can not but think of my poor , wretched , forsaken , despised , betrayed and inveigled Germany , which shall have from me no evil , but good alone , as is due to my own dear country . " One of Luther 's companions at Koburg mentioned that often the reformer would pass three hours a day in prayer . His working hours he devoted to the translation of the prophets ,  - -  a masterpiece which is , like the whole of Luther 's Bible , the foremost source of pure German , and so perfect in its way that all attempts at revising and correcting have been unpopular , although no well-informed scholar believes that Luther 's translation is as accurate as is even the common English version . Nor is it a mere sentiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germans , the wisest Catholics included . In a very large sense it is the matchless style which has made Luther 's translation peerless . And for this reason the greatest students and masters of German prose have been uniformly averse to that revision for which there is sufficient reason on the ground of accuracy and scholarship . But Luther did not boast in vain that he had made the Holy Spirit speak honest German ; he might have added that he had made the Germans speak a language , the spirit and syntax of which may be obscure in unskilled writers , but are none the less precise , clearly defined , and singularly philosophical . No one , however , has surpassed Luther 's own style , which is to German prose even more than the diction of Shakespeare is to English poetry . Thus the few weeks of the year 1530 , which Luther passed in Koburg , reveal the character of the man as a son , husband , and father , as a loyal and patriotic citizen , as a man who dealt with princes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient learning , as the harbinger of the present age which has returned to Luther 's love of roses , as the great author engaged on his masterpiece , as the gay companion and friend , as the comforter of those in spiritual distress , and above all else as the profoundly religious , character that loved God as a child loves // its father , and feared God as the culprit dreads his judge . If Luther presented such a picture as an outlaw , what must he have done during the many years that he was free ! One answer is to be found in the stout quarto volumes of which he filled annually one during the thirty years of ' his authorship ; another and less direct answer is to be found in the Protestant churches and states of our time . A characterization of Luther as a great theological and religious character has no right to become a mere eulogy , for the greatest and truest honor which we can pay to an eminent man consists rather in understanding him than in agreeing with his statements or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man , because he has acquired great authority or fame , is less noble than it is to appreciate him , to understand his growth , and to comprehend his characteristics . For this reason it is always safe to apply to an eminent man like Luther the strictly historical method , to learn his story as the judge in court learns the facts of the cause before him , to *ipply to the record the critical knife , which separates fictions from facts , and to proceed altogether in a judicial spirit that is bound to learn the truth and to accept the consequences . Nor is it , perhaps , altogether unreasonable or unprofitable to hold up to the present time a picture of Luther , the theological character . For whatever may be the glories of the present age , its reverence for theologi*al study is not among them . In fact , the Germans themselves have done greater j ustice to Luther 's secondary and subsidiary attainments than to his central achievement . Scholars are impressed by the weeks and months which Luther passed in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would sink down on his bed in physical exhaustion . The German philologians have traced the slow stages by which Luther acquired , mastered and shaped the German language . Professor Franz Delitzsch has described the manner in which Luther became a master of Hebrew . Professor Kdstlin has compiled the facts of Luther 's life with great accuracy . But one enters a larger world in passing from the historians and eulogists of Luther to the man himself , as he appears in his daily walk and work , and in his publications . He was undoubtedly a great man , a man of genius , and a // giant . But he will be misunderstood , unless he is treated first and last as a religious character . Men of the world outside of Germany are disposed to underrate what is characteristic in Luther , namely , his national and his religious individuality . But it is these rather than any other traits that make up the personality of Luther . It would be unhistorical to elevate Luther , and to lower Calvin . Quite likely Luther never appreciated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do likewise , any more than we follow Shakespeare in studying English history . It is useless , also , to elevate Luther ; he needs no elevating , and it is childish to think what Luther would be , if he lived now . He does not live now , and he can no in ore be our principal teacher in dogmatics , than can Augustine . On the other hand , it is useless to explain his theology away , or to deny that his greatness as a man rested in the main on his religious and theological character . The sixteenth century was not more theological than is the present time , and it was not the spirit of the age that made Luther religious , but it was Luther 's religion , right or wrong , that made him the most powerful writer of his day , and the greatest man of his century . Nor is it , perhaps , a mere accident that the foremost writers of English , French , and German prose in our day have been theological writers like Newman , iRenan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatness can not for a moment be separated from his religious character . Indeed , he himself foresaw with his usual penetration that a later age would think him a politician , a revolutionist , or a sectarian leader . But he protests against this view . He desires his writings to be simply a stepping-stone toward the purer faith which he found in the Bible . His religion , therefore , is at the same time his honor and his limitation ; it is the test by which he must be judged . He himself demands this , for a few months before he went to Koburg he published a remarkable confession of faith in which occurs the following passage As I see that there is the longer the more of schism and scepticism , and no end to the fury and rage of Satan , lest now or hereafter people help themselves to my writings and misquote them in order to cover their errors , as the Sacramentarians and Anabaptists have begun to do , I shall confess in this writing , before God and the world , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remain until death , to die , God // helping , and to appear before the judgment seat of our Lord Jesus Christ . And though some one should say after my death , if that Luther lived now , he would teach and hold differently on this or that article , for he has not considered it sufficiently : to this I shall say then as now , now as then , that by the grace of God I have considered all these articles most diligently , that I have dragged them often , again and again , through Scripture , and that I should defend them as surely as I have now defended the sacrament of the altar . I am neither drunk nor rash . I know what I say , and feel what it will mean to me on the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ to the day of judgment . For this reason no one sh*4l treat my writings as loose talk or an amusement . I am in earnest . For I know Satan , by the grace of God , fairly well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Scripture , what will he not do with my words or another man 's ? It would be very wide of the mark to assume that Luther intended to teach systematic theology . Theology in his mind was not a body of dogmas , but a living religion . Still less did he ever intend to found a new church . He does not use the word dogma , he never thought of writing a theological or any other system , and probably the best theological treatise he ever wrote is his smaller catechism , which is still used in all Lutheran schools . In Luther , therefore , as in all true divines , the theological , religious and purely human elements are blended into one harmonious personality , and it is this blending of many elements that makes his individuality . Like Shakes . peare he appropriated freely whatever came under his observation . But unlike Shakespeare he was a laborious student who wrote two languages with ease , besides having mastered Greek and Hebrew . Like Shakespeare he was an acute observer of nature , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In dealing with men , he was simple and almost naive . It never occurred to him to organize his followers , and from first to last he confined himself to religious work , just as Shakespeare confined himself rigorously to poetry and the stage . It is essential to observe that Luther viewed the true church as a matter of faith , not as an institution or a corporation , that he regarded church government as altogether secondary , that he cared very little for church ordinances , and that he was entirely unwilling to interfere with civil government or secular affairs . It can be charged against Luther that he alludes with a certain contempt to the German peasants , who // were then mostly serfs , and that he looked upon princes as having something like divine rights . The true explanation of this remarkable fact is , perhaps , that Luther accepted the social and political institutions of his time as beyond his jurisdiction . Accordingly he never preached political or doctrinal sermons . On the other hand , he was intensely German , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meagre . His acquaintance with ancient Greece and Rome , however , was intimate . What Luther strove after was the salvation of his immortal son . Heaven , hell , the justice of God , the day of judgment , and the saving death of Christ were to him as real and definite as the facts of natural history are to us . It was natural , therefore , that he turned from the law , for which his father intended him , to theology and religion . He began his public career as a professor of philosophy . But immediately he plunged into theology , and it was as a doctor of divinity that he began Hebrew , and perfected himself in Greek . With his usual thoroughness he did not stop toiling until he had fairly mastered these languages , and he perfected himself in German in order to make his sermons intelligible to his plainest hearers . Incidentally he stumbled upon Popery as a human institution ; but Luther devoted more attention to his own necessities as a sinner that needed a Saviour , and to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever did to Popery , bishops and ecclesiastics . He has been criticised harshly for his treatment of Calvin and Zwingle ; this criticism should be applied no less to the singular severity with which Luther treated his own friends and himself in all theological matters . Theology was to him an objective reality such as the Rocky Mountains are to us , and it was foreign to his mind to beg that men might acknowledge the fact . He accepted the Bible as the Word of the living God , and it is not strange that he measured all things by its revelation . His own profound agitation was due no less to his temperament than to his unquali. fled acceptation of the Old and New Testaments as the literal Word of God to be accepted under the pain of everlasting damnation . Luther never ceased to dread the justice of God , and to tremble at the day of judgment . By the side of this profound terror , his treatment of opponents in theology is consistent , // although his language is unbridled and at times terrific . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but history explains them . In a like sense the unmeasured violence of Luther against theological opponents and himself , as well as his friends , is explained , when we remember the power of the Papacy , and the unswerving firmness with which Luther accepted every syllable of the Bible as the Word of the righteous God who judges the quick and the dead . Calvin made and defended a system in which there was hardly a flaw . Luther had no system , and wished for no system ; he assumed the Trinity , plenary inspiration , and the accuracy of the early creeds , precisely as he did not assume God to be merciful on the ground of justice . This belief was not so much liuked to a heroic soul , as it made him a hero , and fairly forced him into gigantic proportions . It was his religion that called into activity and enlarged whatever nature had planted in his breast . And having grown up toward the ideal demands of his stern , great belief it was no wonder that he could readily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piety made to him . For his children he wrote this Christmas hymn I. SONG OF THE ANGEL . From highest heaven come I here , To bring you news of goodly cheer ; So much of good came I to bring , That I will of it say and sing . This night to you was born a child Of holy virgin meek and mild , A lovely child so sweet and bright To be your joy and your delight . It is the Christ , our common Lord , To guide you and all help afford ; He will himself your Saviour be , And from all sin will set you free . He brings you all beatitude , Which from his father he has sued , That you may dwell with us above Through all eternity in love . Hear , then , the sign that you may knowThe swaddling-clothes , the oxen 's low , And in a manger there is laid The child whose hand hath all things made . // II . SONG OF THE CHILDREN . Then let us all right joyous be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behold the Son most dear , Whom God hath sent , who now is here . Behold , my soul , and look thereat ! What lies there in the manger , what ?

And though the world were twice as great , And full of gold and pomp and state , E'en then too narrow would it be To make a cradle , Lord , for thee . Instead of silk and velvet gay Thou hast coarse swaddling-clothes and hay , And there , thou King so great and wise , Dost lie as if in paradise .

VOL . VII . 18 // It is not strange that Luther has never found outside of Germany that appreciation which his countrymen have for him . He is one of them in a stronger sense than Shakespeare was an Englishman . Luther wrote pamphlets for his countrymen , and for these writings there is no universal demand , save with such rare scholars and students as would approach Lord Bacon , Augustine , and Aristotle . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to his theology than to the marvelous and heroic proportions which religion gave to his German mind , heart , and aspirations . It is not an accident that the language of the German people is full of expressions , puns , and witticisms coined by Luther ; for he created the literary language of his country , and he could do it , because he lived , felt , and spoke like a true-hearted German . Next to his religious character , then , it is his German way of thinking with the heart that reveals the nature of Martin Luther . Had he not been a German , he would not have called himself Doctor through life , and on all occasions . Few people , except the Germans , would ransack all scholarship and history in order to find arguments for the dogmatic assumption with which Luther started , and to which he clung tenaciously . Like so many eminent Germans , Luther was somewhat imaginative in his conclusions , dogmatic in his assumptions , and not always original in his fundamental ideas . In one respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the world would wish to perish . But a more perfect parallel may be drawn between Shakespeare , the poet , and Luther , the German prose writer . As a religious character , Luther is unique for his want of secular prudence and executive skill , for his self-concentration upon purely religious interests and for a certain neglect of ethics . For to him the acceptance of God 's revelation iii Christ outweighed all matters of secular conduct . It is not strange , therefore that the Lutherans of the pre8ent time are lacking in organization , and that they exalt their pure doctrines above morality . Neither is it strange that they glory in the name of Luther ,  --  a name which will probably be uttered with increasing joy , when a century from now the Protestant world celebrates the five hundredth anniversary of Luther ' &amp; birth .
