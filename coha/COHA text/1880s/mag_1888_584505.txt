By Hugh McCulloch . DERBY , in a speech delivered at Liverpool , in 1872 , made the striking remark that the increase of wealth in Great Britain , within the present century , far exceeded the increase in the preceding 1800 years . This wealth had been chiefly created by her extensive commerce and her manufactures , in which for many years she excelled all other nations combined . The gain in the United States has been the result of agricultural and manufacturing industry , and of the increased value of land , and this increase in the value of land is in a very great degree attributable to canals and railroads , chiefly the latter , without which the most of the great West would have remained a wilderness , and our large cities would have been unimportant towns . It is hardly too much to say , that the United States are twenty times richer than they were a half century ago . The whole world has , indeed , felt the influences that have been at work within this brief period of its history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has , in fact , been rejuvenated within a half century . Nearly all of the mechanical inventions , now so indispensable , such as railroads , iron ships , telegraphs , agricultural implements , labor-saving machinery of all kinds , have come into use within less than two generations , but in no part of the world have such changes taken place as in the United States . Within the period named , the population of the United States has been more than twice doubled . Sixteen States have been added to the Union , and what was then the far distant West , has become the centre of population and political power . Of all the changes that have taken place within the last half century , none has been more marked and decided than that in ships . Until the Cunard Company , in 1840 , sent their first steamship the Britannia , of thirteen hundred tons , from Liverpool to Boston , sailing vessels built of wood , had the command of the seas . There were , it is true , a few steamships constructed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with steam as well as sails , went from Savannah in Georgia , to St. Petersburgh , stopping on her way out at England , and completing her run from St. Petersburgh back to Savannah in twenty-six days ; so that the honor of sending the first steamship across the ocean from the United States , belongs to a Southern State . In 1825 , the Enterprise , properly so called , went from England to Calcutta , and in 1838 the Sirius , of seven hundred tons , and the Great Western , of thirteen hundred and forty tons , came to New York from Liverpool . These , however , were experiments . Regular ocean traffic by steamships did not fairly commence until the establishment of the Cunard line in 1840 . From that time the construction of steamships went rapidly on , and traffic upon the seas went as rapidly from sailing vessels to steamers . The great motive power of the world upon water as well as upon land , is steam . Upon the Great Lakes and upon the Ocean , its value is appreciated ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fully understood . Before I went to the West in 1833 and for some time after , the business upon the Mississippi and its tributaries was chiefly carried on by flat-boats , which were floated down to New Orleans by the current , and broken up and sold for lumber after their cargoes had been disposed of ; or by barges which , after they had been unloaded at the levee , were towed back to their shipping points by watermen , a race that has long since disappeared . A whole season was consumed by these barges in a single trip down and back from the Ohio and Upper Mississippi to New Orleans . Steamboats when they came into full // play changed all this , and opened for settlement a country as large as that which lies east of the Alleghanies . The ocean and lake traffic might have been carried on by sailing vessels , but upon no rivers , except the great rivers of South America , could sails be used . In our harbors one now sees a few small sailing vessels , and here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Baltimore Clippers , but these are engaged in a coast wise trade , and are being rapidly superseded by small steamers . In 1876 , the last time I was in Liverpool , I saw scarcely a single sailing vessel among the hundreds that filled her docks . The age is utilitarian ; it is the most useful that is sought for , what pays the best is the desideratum . The sailing ship is a thing of beauty . Nothing to me is so beautiful as a full rigged ship with all sails set , as she moves before the wind ; but she has ceased to pay . A steamship is a thing of power . There is nothing about her which is beautiful , but she is time-saving , and hence her superiority over sailing vessels . Next to steam , iron and steel have been the great factors in the revolution of the last half century in ship building . Fifty years ago , vessels of all description s , naval as well as those that were used in trade , were built of wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are a few small sailing vessels being built of wood for home trade , but a wooden ship of war can only be seen among the huI*s . The fight in Hampton Roads between the little Monitor and the Virginia , sealed the fate of wooden war ships . What a revolution in ship building that first contest between iron-clads produced ! It literally made valueless the navies of the world , upon which countless millions had been expended . In itself considered , it was in comparison with hundreds of other naval battles , an unimportant affair , but by enabling the Government to maintain the blockade , it did much for the preservation of the Union , and by showing how powerless wooden ships would be in contests with ironclads , it created a system of naval architecture in which all the commercial nations are now experimenting . Each is trying to construct ships that will attain the greatest speed , carry the heaviest guns , and resist the heaviest shot . Their value will be tested in the next great European war . The decline in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Less than half a century ago , it was second only to Great Britain , with strong indications that it would soon be her superior as a maritime power . The best ships in the world were then built in the United States , chiefly in New England , and our ship-yards not only supplied the home demand , which was very large but to a considerable extent the foreign demand also . Now , except for the home trade , the building of ships has substantially ceased . It makes one who saw the ship-yards , along the New England coast half a century ago sad as he sees them now . A few steam-ships are being built there and in the other Atlantic States for coast-wise or West Indian and South American trade , but none for the European . In ship-building and ship owning , the United States are behind nations that , a few years ago , were not known for either . The carrying trade between the old world and the new is in the hands of Europeans . It is their ships that are crowded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business or for pleasure ; it is their ships that bring emigrants to our shores ; their ships that carry our cotton , our wheat , our beef and pork , our tobacco and petroleum and what not , to foreign markets . We no longer share in the glory and the gain which attend upon maritime enterprise . The decline of American shipping commenced with the substitution of iron for wooden ships . It was hastened by our refusal to permit our ship owners to protect their ships by a foreign flag during the late war , and the finishing blow was given to it by a tariff which , by taxing the materials that are used in the construction of ships , made them too costly to invite capital in that direction and forced it into manufactures . That the United States have been enormously enriched by their manufactures , is undeniable , and it is equally undeniable that their rapid growth in manufacturing industries is very largely attributable to high duties // upon imports . But why have our tariff laws been so framed as to prejudice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our people looked on with indifference ? Why have our law-makers been inert , while our ships have been disappearing from the ocean ? The answer must be found in the lack of broad and comprehensive statesmanship in Congress and in the Executive branches of the Government . There are , I am happy to say , indications that the public mind is being awakened to the importance of having something done for the restoration of American shipping . Over-production in manufactures for the home demand , the want of foreign markets for the surplus , are awakening public attention in this direction . The party of the future will be that party which , comprehending the interests of the whole country , fosters all alike , or relieves the people altogether from the burdens which a partial policy now imposes . If protection is to be the continued policy of the Government , ship-building should be encouraged , and maritime interests protected , as well as manufactures . If restrictions are to be removed , and taxation for revenue only is to be the policy , the shipping interest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with fair compensation to steam-ships for carrying the mails , will take care of itself . It will be a proud day for the United States when American ships share with those of other nations in the business of the seas , and the American flag is seen again in ports from which it has been long banished . On one point there should be accord between men of all parties : if by reason of the tariff or any other cause we can not profitably build ships , we should not be prohibited from buying and putting them under our own flag . It is urged , I know , that the building of ships could not be a profitable industry in the United States , even if the duty on all articles which are used in their construction and outfit were taken off , by reason of the cheaper labor on the other side of the Atlantic . If this were a fact , which I do not believe , what justification can there be for keeping on the statute book the law that prohibits citizens of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own flag ? If we can not build ships , why should our citizens be prohibited from purchasing them ? In no country in the world except this great , free country of ours , does such a barbarous prohibition exist . If we need ships and can not build them , why should the right to buy be denied ? The following sentences are selected from some rather extended remarks , which I made in my report as Secretary of the Treasury to Congress , in 1866 , upon the subject of American ship-ping : " INo single interest in the United States , although it may be fostered by legislation , can long prosper at the expense of other great interests , nor can any important interest be crushed by unwise or unequal laws without other interests being thereby prejudiced . The people of the United States are naturally a commercial and maritime people , fond of adventure , bold , enterprising and persistent . Now the disagreeable fact must be admitted that , with unequal facilities for obtaining the materials , and with acknowledged skill in ship-building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the finest harbor in the world , with surplus products that require a large and increased tonnage , we can neither profitably build ships , nor successfully compete with English ships in the transportation of our own productions . It is a well established general fact that the people who build ships navigate them , and that a nation which ceases to build ships , ceases of consequence to be a commercial and maritime nation . Unless , therefore , the cause which prevents the building of ships in the United States , shall cease , the foreign carrying trade even of our own productions , must be yielded to other nations . To this humiliation and loss , the people of the United States ought not to be subjected . Ti other branches of industry are to prosper : if agriculture isto be profitable , and manufactures are to be extended ; the commerce of the country must be restored , sustained , and increased . The United States will not be a first class power among the nations , nor will her other industrial interests continue long to // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to languish . " The causes of the decline of ship-building referred to in these extracts were , higher prices of labor and materials in the United States than in Europe , and the Tariff . One of these causes has been much modified . Skilled labor has become abundant in the llJnited States within the last twenty years , and greater progress has been made in labor-saving machinery on this side , than on the other side of the Atlantic . If all the materials which are needed in the construction of ships were relieved from import duties , the other cause of the decline of shipping would be also modified ; but so much ground has been lost by delay , and so strong has become the European monopoly of the ocean traffic , that something more is required to build up ship-building in the United States . Not only should ship-building materials be admitted free of duty , but United States Steamship Companies should be liberally paid for the transportation of the mails . We should , in this respect , do what other nations have done to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we must not stop here . All efforts to induce investments of capital in ships will be unavailing unless foreign markets are secured for what we have to sell . Trade is essentially barter , and there can be no barter as long as trade is fettered with unequal duties on articles to be exchanged . This leads me naturally to say something upon a subject which ever since the formation of the Government has been fruitful of discussion  --  the tariff . That in the infancy of our manufactures , protective laws were needed , and that the country has been in times past , greatly benefited by these laws , is admitted by the advocates of tariff reform , if not by free traders . Without Government protection against the competition of British manufacturers , capitalists in the United States would not have engaged in manufacturing . Great Britain , early in the present century , became the work-shop of the nations . From 1831 to 1870 , she controlled the manufacturing of the world . She had more capital than any other nation , and her people were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Continent . She had also , what they had not , an unlimited supply of coalthe great factor in manufacturing , and if not the inventor of the steam-engine , she was the first to utilize it . She was also the leading maritime power of the world , and consequently possessed the facilities for sending her goods to all ports that were open to her ships . To make the most of these advantages , she adopted the principle of free trade . By it the raw materials which she needed were admitted free from taxation and paid for in productions of her mills . By this means she had obtained a manufacturing ascendancy too formidable to be competed with by capitalists of the United States , without government aid . It was to free the United States from dependency upon Great Britain , for the goods which were needed , and of which they might be deprived in case of war between the two nations , that our protective laws were mainly advocated . These laws were for many years simply revenue laws with incidental protection . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and revenue the incident . lam in favor of a judicious tariff** said John Quincy Adams , in a conversation with Henry Clay and others . " I am in favor of a judicious tariff . " " And I , " said Mr. Clay , " am in favor of a tariff , judicious or not . " Congress has of late years been altogether with Mr. Clay , and adhered to protection until it has become burdensome upon the people-depriving producers to a considerable extent of the benefits of foreign markets for our surplus of agricultural productions , for which at remunerative prices there is insufficient demand , and what is worse than all , our protective tariff has created a demand for laborers , which has brought over immense numbers of foreigners for whom already there is insufficient employment , and who are consequently restive , and may become dangerous . Conceding that protective tariffs were needed to induce investments in home manufactures , and to sustain them when they were too feeble to compete unaided with Great Britain , it is clear to my // mind that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the purpose of accommodating them to the changed condition of the industrial interests of the country . Protection was originally and properly advocated on the ground that without it manufacturing could make no headway against the crushing power of British capital , and on this ground only . Thirty years ago , few if any of the advocates of protection were bold enough to advocate it as a permanent policy . It was to be temporary-not perpetuaL When the expenses of the civil war began to require immense revenues , the tariff was largely increased , and a patriotic people submitted to the additional burden thus laid upon them , because they had resolved that the Government should be sustained . Not only was the tariff increased , but an excise system was adopted under which almost everything that could be reached by the tax collectors was heavily taxed . Nothing more was heard about protection . Revenue was what was needed and taxation was chiefly submitted to , not only for revenue , but to give credit to the immense loans that the Government was obliged to resort to , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were , and indiscriminately as they were levied , neither diminished production nor checked importation . On the contrary , both were increased . So great were the necessities of the Government in the prosecution of the war , that existing cotton , woollen , and iron mills were worked to their full capacity , and new ones were created , while at the same time foreign importations were greatly stimulated . To pay for needful supplies , immense sums of money were required , and this requirement was met by the issue of Government notes , so that in a great and destructive war  --  the greatest and most destructive that has ever been carried on  --  the loyal States seemed to be highly prosperous , and the burden of taxation was not felt . When the war ended the paper circulation of the country ( money as it is improperly called ) instead of being reduced as it should have been , was increased , and artificial prosperity continued until the crisis of 1873 , put a temporary end to it . The terrible de pression which followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The spirit of the people was too elastic and buoyant and energetic to be long depressed . Millions of debts were wiped out by the Bankrupt Act . The Government notes were not called in . Bank notes practically irredeemable , were abundant , for both of which employment must be found , and this employment was found in the construction of railroads , many of which were built not for business which required them , but for the business they were expected to create . So capital went into railroads in amounts that would have been ruinous , had not short crops in Europe , and abundant crops in the United States , greatly increased railroad traffic and created balances in our favor which were settled by importations of gold . All this is now being changed . Manufacturing of all kinds has been overdone . Mills have been built where they can never be profitable , no matter what governmental protection may be given to them . Our agricultural productions are declining in value . The tariff is gradually shutting up foreign markets against our manufactured goods , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread-stuffs . Foreign nations , upon whose productions heavy duties are imposed , buy of us only what they greatly need , and can not dispense with the use of , and these articles are chiefly limited to cotton , wheat , corn , tobacco , petroleum , beef and pork , and our markets for some of these articles are in danger . India is becoming a formidable competitor in the great wheat market of . Great Britain , and petroleum from Russia is competing with the petroleum from the United States , in the markets of which , on this article , we have had for years the control . To remedy the evils which are now to be faced , wise counsels are needed in Congress . The attention of our lawmakers must be diverted from the making of Presidents and the distribution of patronage , to the economic questions upon the proper solution of which the permanent well-being of the people must depend . The most important of these questions are those which arise from the // decay of our shipping , and the want of foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are the only really vital questions , except the currency question , before the country , and they ought to receive the most careful consideration of Congress ; and if party politics could be subordinated to them , there would I think be but little doubt in regard to the conclusions which would be reached . What is now needed in the United States , and needed more than anything else to promote general prosperity , is such a modification of our tariff as will facilitate exchanges with other countries . The protective policy must be abandoned . A revenue tariff we must have . Absolute free trade will be among the things hoped for , but not to be gained until the people are prepared to support the Government by excise duties or by direct taxation . The Government is mainly to be supported as it was before the late civil war by a tax upon imports which , although the most insidious , and in some respects the most unequal of all taxes , is , as it has always been , the most popular , by reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such duties , there never will be serious complaint , and when judiciously imposed , separated as the United States are from European nations by the broad Atlantic , ( neither Canada nor Mexico , nor the South American States can be formidable competitors , ) they will afford all the protection that our manufacturers can fairly claim . In asking more than this , they are asking that the whole people shall continue to be taxed for the benefit of a few : Much the larger part of the revenue required for the support of the Government and the payment of the national debt , must be derived from duties upon imports , and it will , therefore , be impossible so to reduce them that they will not be protective . A tariff for revenue which must necessarily be to some extent protective , is what is now required to increase and enlarge the foreign markets for our various manufactured goods , and our agricultural productions . Without these markets , our great industrial interests can never be permanently prosperous . Time will be required to overcome what has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more than recovered , if wisdom prevails in our national councils . That a country with sixty millions of people rapidly increasing in population , washed by the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans , with thousands of miles indented with the finest of harbors ; - with unequalled facilities for ship-building ; - with a soil better fitted to produce cotton , tobacco , maize , cattle and hogs , than is possessed by any other country ,  --  and with equal capabilities for the production of wheat ; - that such a country should be without ships to transport its surplus to foreign ports , is an anomaly in the history of nations ; - that in such a country , with manufactures of all descriptions well-established and skilfully managed , with plenty of capital and cheap money , manufacturers who have become enriched by our protective tariffs should claim more protection than a tariff for revenue will afford , is unreasonable and unjust . The tariff ought to be carefully considered not only with regard to its burdens upon consumers but in its bearing upon commerce and navigation . The leading nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ship owning nations . Such were they in medieval ages , and such they will always be . It was by such nations that trade was extended and civilization was carried into countries that had been degraded by their isolation . By such nations , in search of markets for their productions , the American Continent was discovered , and all other great land discoveries made . What has made Great Britain the nation she is  --  the nation upon whose domain the sun never sets ? Not her manufactones alone-extensive , varied , and profitable as they have been  --  but her manufactures , her commerce , and her shipping combined . Why have her merchants been able to take raw materials from all other nations in exchange for their manufactured goods ? Is it not because she has exempted those raw materials from import duties ? Why is her flag seen upon every sea ? By what means has her supremacy as a commercial and maritime power been secured and maintained ? Is it not mainly because her statesmen have understood the simple // fact that trade is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In all natural advantages , the United States are greatly superior to Great Britain . While , including her colonies , her domain is more extensive , the terntory over which she has absolute control is insignificant in comparison , and so doubtful is her hold upon her colonial possessions , that some of her wisest statesmen have thought that she would be stronger without them . In what respect is she superior to the United States ? Not certainly in productions of prime necessity , not in cotton or wool , not in cattle , or swine , or grain of all kinds , not even in what may be called luxuries , such as fruits of all descriptions-not in precious metals , or even in iron or lead or copper , which are more valuable than the precious metals ; nor in the inventive power and manufacturing skill of her people . In everything necessary for national growth , everything needful for the comfort and happiness of the people , the United States are vastly superior to Great Britain . In two things only are they inferior : in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and artificial productions , and in shipping , without which in combination , they can not take precedence of Great Britain , and become what they ought to be , and what , with wise legislation , they would soon become , the leading nation of the world , to which all other nations would be tributary . Without freer exchanges and a revival of their shipping interests , the United States , no matter how rich and populous they may become , will never be a great nation in all that is needful for national greatness . No nation can be truly great that depends upon other nations for the means of transporting its productions to foreign markets , or lessens the demand for them by restrictions upon trade . A half century ago the United States were almost supreme upon the ocean . Now they have no rank as a maritime power . I am proud of my country , but I can not help being humiliated by the consideration that our merchants must establish credits in London , in order to pay for their purchases abroad ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that city , for the payment of its representatives in foreign lands , and the expenses of its ships of war in foreign ports . There is in these times much discussion in regard to landed property , and it is claimed by even fair minded and intelligent men that land is the gift of God , to which none should have the right of exclusive ownership ; that the manner in which it is held in all civilized countries is a wrong to the public , and the main cause of the poverty which is so generally prevalent . That in some countries land is held in too large quantities by a comparatively few people , whose ownership is perpetuated by legislative or sovereign power , is undoubtedly true . In such countries there is little trade in land , and the ownership of a home , no matter how humble , is beyond the reach of the great mass of the people . The effect of this has been the creation of landed aristocracies , to the power of which labor has been subjected . Nothing of this kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there free trade in land , but the Government has been for years , by homestead laws and low prices at which its immense territories of fertile lands have been subject to entry , holding out the strongest possible inducements to industrious people to secure for themselves homes . Strangely enough , however , some of the most earnest opponents of the exclusive ownership of land are in the United States . In their opinion , as land was not created by man , no man should be the absolute owner of any portion of it ; - that it should be held by the state for the benefit of all . To correct the wrong which land ownership is inflicting upon the public , these advocates of equal rights contend that land should be so taxed that the owner would be willing to surrender his right to it . Land , it is true , is the gift of God , but it is by man 's labor that it has been made valuable . It is admitted by the Land Reformer , that the improvements being of man 's creation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have given value to the land , and it would be practically impossible to tax the latter without taxing the former . Most of the land in the United States , // east of the Mississippi River , was covered with dense forests , and every acre of it which has been cultivated has cost more in labor and other needful expenditures than it would sell for . I speak of course of lands which have not been made valuable by their minerals , or by being the sites of cities or towns , or their proximity to them . I question very much that there are any farms outside of the prairies and away from large towns , which , if they were charged with the labor bestowed upon them at the rate of one dollar a day for men and fifty cents a day for women , and with other necessary outlays ( their original cost not included ) , and credited with the market value of their productions , and their estimated present value , would exhibit a balance on the right side of the account . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the first settlers in the timbered lands of the United States-their unceasing toil , their actual want-.  - -  not of the comforts , but of the necessaries of life when in health , to say nothing of what they needed , and could not be supplied with , in sickness , during the long and wearisome years which came and went before they had cleared enough of their lands to enable them to begin to enjoy the fruits of their sacrifices and labors ; - no one who has known anything about all this will be found among those who speak of land as being God 's gift , and therefore property of which there should not be absolute ownership . In travelling from Fort Wayne to Indianapolis , in the early days of the West , over or rather through roads that for a good part of the year could only be travelled by men on foot or wellmounted horsemen , and in noticing the slow progress which was being made in the opening up of the country , the question naturally presented itself , Would men who could support themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , make their homes in this wilderness and undergo the privations they are subject to , and labor as they must for a good part of their lives , before they can make a comfortable living ? These settlers were invariably poor men ; two or three hundred dollars would cover the entire outfit of a majority of them ;  - -  their lands , their teams , their cows , their farming implements , their axes and rifles . It was chiefly by such men that the timbered lands of Ohio and Indiana were settled . I have seen hundreds of such beginnings , and have admired the endurance , the patience , the persevering industry , by which forest lands have been converted into productive farms ; I do not say profitable farms , because few farms are profitable . Men who , like the late Dr. Gwinn , of California , have bought at low prices extensive tracts of land which were ready for the plow , and which for a time needed no fertilization , and cultivated them by machinery for wheat , have undoubtedly made money out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become exhausted , and restoratives become necessary , profits will decline , and may soon disappear altogether . Lands naturally adapted to grazing may yield indefinitely good returns , because they do not become exhausted by being grazed , but they are exceptions . The alluvial lands on the lower Mississippi , and on some of its tributaries , might also be excepted , for so deep is the soil that they may be regarded as being practically inexhaustible ; but they are subject to overflows and droughts , and good crops on even these lands are by no means certain . On the whole , farming is not a profitable business in the United States . It is a healthful employment , productive of strong and vigorous men , but it is not attractive , and it is not attractive because it is not profitable . Seldom do the sons of well-to-do farmers become farmers . As soon as they are old enough to strike out for themselves , they will be found in the towns , not upon the farms . Nor are lands in the old States which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used for market gardens , increasing in value . So far is this from being the case , that very few farms in those States could be sold today for prices which they readily commanded twenty years ago . Investments in lands which are valuable for agriculture only , are not now regarded with favor by capitalists . Better use for their money is found elsewhere . If thanks are due to God for the land , greater thanks are due to him for the // muscle and the patient industry by which it has been brought under cultivation , and by which its producing properties are preserved ; and yet these cultivators of the soil are among those whose property should be confiscated because they did not create what they have made valuable ! Land is less able to bear heavy taxes than almost any other kind of property . The taxes to which cultivated land is now subjected in most of the States , instead of being advanced , should be reduced , for the purpose of increasing the number of farmers . In most of the European states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavily , that they can be held only by the rich . In that country the landholders are monopolists , and they will continue to be so until free trade in land is established , and the taxes upon it are so reduced that men of moderate means can afford to be the owners . No greater mistake was ever made by intelligent men than is made by those who suppose that monopolies can be broken up or weakened , and property can be more evenly distributed in the United States by increase of taxes upon land , which is the cheapest thing upon the market . It is true that in cities , lots to be built upon for homes are beyond the reach of all except those whose incomes are considerably greater than their outlays , but this is unavoidable . Cities are limited in extent , and the value of lots depends upon the demand for them for building purposes . In a few cities , especially in Philadelphia , some who belong to what are called the laboring classes are the owners of their homes , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceptions those whose living depends upon their manual labor are renters or boarders . There is , however , compensation for these deprivations . Wages are higher in the city than in the country , and greater inducements to save as well as to spend are found there , than exist elsewhere . Men are naturally gregarious , and when thrown together they have enjoyments of life , although subject to great discomforts . In cities , however , as well as in the country , it is labor and the fruits of labor that have made the ground valuable , and it is dif ficult to see how the public would be benefited if city lots were to be confiscated , subject to the outlay that has been made upon them . None but Anarchists have gone so far as to contend that the property of man 's creation should be subject to division among the people or become the property of the state . But in this free land of ours , for whose benefit should property of any kind be confiscated ? Not for the benefit of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is rarely lack of employment at remunerative wages , and the way to rise in the world is open before them . Not for the benefit of those who are disabled ; their wants when made known are relieved by private or public charities . Nine-tenths of the rich and prominent people of the United States have made their upward way in the world without help from others . Of the wealthy men , or the men of large social or political influence , whom I have known personally , or with whose history I am familiar , I call to mind very few who have not made themselves what they are by their own exertions . With rare exceptions they are the offspring of poor men , or of men with very limited means . The opportunities for those who are self-dependent to make headway in life are not now , it is admitted , as great in the United States as they were some years ago , but one has only to look about him to see large numbers of such people rising above the level from which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in society , in politics . Poverty always has prevailed and always will prevail to a greater or less degree in all countries-in the freest as well as the most despotic , until , under some new dispensation , mankind become equal in natural gifts , in capacity and disposition to acquire and retain , in mental and physical power . Until then the industrious and the indolent , the thrifty and the unthrifty , the strong and the weak , the rich and the poor , will be found in all communities . If all the property in the world should be equally divided , in a few brief years inequalities like those which are now complained of would prevaiL The differences in the circumstances of the race are to some // extent produced by unequal and unjust government and laws , but they are largely in most countries , and altogether in the United States , the result of constitutional dissimilarities , which always have existed and always will exist . There can be no equalizing power short of divine power , and that power will , as heretofore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all governments which have existed in civilized nations , none has been so bad as a paternal government would be . The permanency of our free institutions depends more than anything else upon our homes , our independent homes . Of all property the homestead should be subject to the lightest taxation . In some States humble homes are protected against the claims of creditors ; they ought everywhere to be protected against the tax collector . Great differences in the condition of men have existed and will exist under all forms of government , and these differences will be most marked under the freest , where natural gifts have full play . All that can be done by the best government is to provide for the protection of life and property  --  the enforcement of just and equal laws-anything more than this would be tyranny . Without perfect liberty to acquire , and without protection to whatever may be lawfully acquired , no matter what might be the character of the property , enterprise would cease , and government would be a mockery . In looking back upon a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the growth of the country in the physical elements of national greatness-territory , population , wealth . This growth , so unprecedented in the world 's history , has been effected without any change in the form of the government-without any departure from the principles upon which it was established , or material change of the Constitution which was adopted for its preservation . Nevertheless , changes have taken place , the effect of which upon our republican institutions can not be contemplated without apprehension . Immigration , considered merely with regard to its pecuniary and economical results , has been of immense gain to the United States . It is estimated that since the formation of the Government more than thirteen millions of immigrants have come to the United States , and that if each brought with him sixty dollars in money , the pecuniary gain has been about eight hundred millions ; but the gain in this respect has been small in comparison with what the immigrants were worth as laborers in the varied branches of industry . Estimating them to have been equal in value to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the national wealth three times as much as our national debt amounted to at the close of the civil war . What the offsets may be to this enormous gain is yet to be determined . The true wealth of the country is not to be measured by acreage or money , but by the quality of its people . If the effect of foreign immigration should prove to be deleterious to the character of the population , the gain referred to would have been dearly acquired . That the worst and most dangerous part of the population of the United States are foreigners , is proved by the criminal records and by the utterances of socialists . Not only have the industrious and honest been invited to come to our country to secure homes . for themselves , but the door has been thrown wide open to the lazy and the disreputable  --  the very classes that foreign governments have been glad to get rid of . Nor is this all . Money has been furnished to enable foreigners to come and be workmen in our factories and shops because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very large part , if not a majority , of the population in some of our great manufacturing towns are foreigners , many of whom have soon learned enough of American freedom to be disorderly and dangerous . The greatest mistake which has been made by the Government of the United States has been in conferring upon foreigners the elective franchise . So short is the period required for their naturalization that hundreds of thousands have become voters before they knew anything about the nature of republican institutions-before even they could // speak the language of the country . The majority of them are doubtless well-meaning people , but they naturally fall under the influence of those who are not . With the working-men have come men who are revolutionists by nature or have been made such by real or fancied injustice in their native lands . To denounce the Government , and to make their followers believe that all governments are tyrannical and ought to be overthrown , seems to be considered by these men their especial duty . Others do not go quite so far as this ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property should be held and owned in common , that exclusive ownership by the few is oppression to the many , that the laws have been made by the rich and for their benefit , to the great injustice of the poor , and that they should be so changed that all would fare alike . If these men , with their blind and ignorant followers , were not voters , they would be comparatively harmless ; but they are not only voters , but some of them active politicians , and when the two great parties are nearly evenly divided , their votes are courted by both . They are already a dangerous class , and are likely to become more dangerous , as they are rapidly increasing in numbers , and are becoming cohesive by organizations . It is very clear to my mind that none but native born citizens ought to have been permitted to be voters ; that immense risk has been incurred-not by making the United States an asylum for the oppressed , not by opening the doors for foreigners to become inhabitants , under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to come and participate in the law-making and governing power . The elective franchise , which ought to have been considered the most precious of all rights , has been freely bestowed upon those who have no knowledge of its value , and upon those who use it for other than patriotic purposer . Though it may now be too late , in the present condition of political parties , to change effectively our naturalization laws , there might be a limitation upon the franchise in municipal elections , and it is very certain that this must be done if our large cities are to be properly governed , and sufficient safeguards are to be thrown around persons and property . Municipal government should be created and conducted on business principles . No one should be a voter who is not the owner of property . The amount required need not be large , but it should be large enough to indicate that the voter has something at stake . Manhood suffrage in municipal elections is , to say the least , a dangerous experiment ; a law that places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enterprising wealth-producing citizen is certainly neither just nor reasonable . The Government is stronger than it was a half century ago , but has not this increase of strength been at the expense of republicanism ? We claim that the United States is the freest country in the world  --  the only country except Switzerland in which the people have equal rights . Equal rights before the law are indeed possessed by everybody here , but are there not combinations of interests which prevent the full play of natural rights , which hold in check , if they do not destroy , individual enterprise ? In what other country can be found such companies as have been organized in the United States for the purpose of controlling the manufacture , the transportation , and the price of goods ? Where can be found an organization like the Standard Oil Company , which absolutely controls the market of an article for which there is an immense and constant demand , and stamps out competition ; or even such companies as have been formed to regulate the production of iron and steel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protected by tariffs against foreign competition , combine by trusts and other agencies to advance or sustain prices and prevent domestic competition ? There is no country of which I have any knowledge in which business of all descriptions is so steadily falling into fewer and fewer hands , in which combinations are so powerful and individuals so powerless , as the United States-no country in which the solution of the labor question may be more difficult . We have yet to learn that // qwq
