txt The Butler Democratic State Committee dined at Young 's Hotel to-day . To ward the close of its festivities , a resolution of greeting was sent to the Massachusetts Democratic Association , dining at Parker 's , near by , and which included the representative men of the Pannell Hall or regular Democratic State Committee . The greeting was sent by a committee which was heartily received by the Parker House gathering , and a committee from that body was sent back to the Butler committee , to invite the latter to come over and join it Thereupon the entire Butler company left their diningtables and marched to ? the banquet-room of their rivals , where they were received with an ovation . J udge Abbott . who was there presiding , extended the righthand.of fellowship to the newcomers , and Jonas H. French , their Chairman , responded . Speeches were also made by Charles Theodore Russell , Major McCafferty , Col. Henry Walker , the Hon. John K. Tarbox , P. A. Collins , and Gen. Donahue . Charles Louis Woodbury bespoke a cementing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization . After the meeting was over , the occurrence formed the tonic of discussion at the clubs and in private political circles for the evening . Both wings have elected delegates to the National Convention . It is among the possibilities , in the light of the spirit shown at the meeting , that the two rival State Central Committees may ' come to some agreement by which a new joint ' convention may be called , all past differences harmonized , and a new delegation chosen . The opinion also prevails that Gen. Butler , in proper form , will soon declare himself a Democrat , without any other party affiliations , and that the way will be made clear for the united Democracy to nominate him for Governor next Fall .
