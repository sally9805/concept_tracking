txt The Bradlaugh case has had the effect of showing , in a very vivid way , how far the House of Commons is , in spite of all the widenings of its basis that have been made within the past fifty years , from representing the British populace . Thirty thousand people were got together yesterday in Trafalgar-square to remonstrate against the exclusion of BRADLAUGH from the House of Commons , and these thirty thousand persons beyond doubt represent a great numerical majority of the people of England . The House of Commons no more represents the people of England now than it did a hundred and twenty years ago , when it expelled , JOHN WILKES from one Parliament for libel and refused to admit him to another because he had been expelled from the first . Nobody now pretends to doubt that the rights of the case were all with WILIIRS and that the House of Commons was guilty of an outrageous usurpation of the rights of the electors . The wisest men in England of all parties took the same ground then . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so famous as the Middlesex election , though there is no telling what may happen if the House of Commons keeps on denying ' the right of the electors of Northampton to send whom they like to represent them in Parliament . The question involved is virtually the same and must ultimately be settled in the same way . FRANKLIN said of the Middlesex election that if JOHN WILwES had had a good private character . and GEORGE III . a bad one , the member for Middlesex . might have deposed the monarch and driven him out of his kingdom . And the power which the House of Commons has given to BRAD . LAUGH by its silly persecution is absurdly beyond what BRADLAUGH could have acquired by any force of his own . The real ground of opposition to BRADLAUGH 'S admission to the House of Commons is the opinion , of a large majority of its members that BRADLAUGH is what they would call a " cad ; " an eminently unclubbable person who ought to be kept at all hazards out of " the pleasantest club in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the club to black-ball whenever an occasion presents  --  tself . But it must be owned that an occasion for black-balling BRADLAUGH in his capacity of cad would not have arisen if BRADLAUGH had not himself raised it in his capacity of fool . He first refused to take the oath required by ancient usages , inconsiderate of tender consciences , because it was to him a meaningless form . As if anybody could be a member of the House of Commons , or for that matter of civilized society , without going through a number of meaningless forms every day of his life . This declaration of BRADLAUGH ' 13 , however , gave an opportunity to black-ball him to a House of which at least half the members , as was said at the time , were of BRADLAUGH 'S opinion upon the meaninglessness of the oath . When they declared that BRADLAUGH could not take his seat without taking the oath , BRADLAUGH himself waived any question of conscience by offering to go through the meaningless form , which the House thereupon most tyrannically refused to let him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contempt by a re-election , the case is on quite the same footing with that of WILKES . The real question is whether a constituency which sends to the House of Cora : mons a person whom a majority of , its members regard as a cad has any rights which the House of Commons is bound to respect . Of course there can not be any controversy upon this question . The merits are all with BRADLAUGH , and the thirty thousand people who met yesterday in Trafalgar-square were engaged in vindicating a right which never ought to have been questioned , and which never would have been questioned if the religious and social prejudices of the classes which alone the House of Commons represents were not far stronger than their logic or their sense of justice . A body which defines:the right of , representation to be'the right of a constituency to elect anybody , subject to the chance that his colleagues may find him a cad , is not a body which has any real attachment to political freedom .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
