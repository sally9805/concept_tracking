txt Senator DAVIS , of Illinois , presented in the Senate yesterday strong arguments in support of his bill for the relief of the Supreme Court by the creation of intermediate courts of appeal in the several circuits . Mr. DAVIS 'S own experience on the Supreme bench gives him a thorough knowledge of the burdens of that tribunal , and enables him to judge of the most effectual means of affording the desired relief and at the same time of strengthening the Federal judiciary throughout its entire extent . It is to be noted that his views coincide with those of exJustice STRONG , as set forth some months ago in a prominent periodical , and it is to be presumed that they are shared by the Judges on the bench , who are precluded by their position from taking part in the discussion . This is in itself a strong recommendation in favor of his measure . These men , who are best able to form an opinion on the subject , are opposed to the plan of increasing the membership of the Supreme Court itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of relief is absolutely necessary does not admit of question . There has been no material change in the constitution of the Federal judiciary , and little increase in the working force of the Supreme Court in the last eighty years , while the multiplication of cases and the increase of labor has been enormous . The result is not only that the courts are overworked , but there is a delay in securing final adjudication which in many cases amounts to a denial of justice . It requires now fully three years to reach and dispose of a case after it has been docketed by the court , and the litigation with which it is connected may have been going on for two or three years before the appeal is taken . Not only has the volume of business in the courts grown to vast proportions , but year by year it has increased in complication and difficulty . Under the present system of appeals the Justices of the Supreme Court have to deal with questions growing out of the legislation and adjudications of all the States , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these is such as to tax the energies of the ablest minds in any effort to master them . Besides this  --  they have occasion to deal with international questions , involving more or less the laws of other countries and the principles that are established affecting the relations of nations to each other . It is evident that any means that can be devised for finally and effectually disposing of the less important litigation arising in the districts and circuits , without a resort to the Supreme Court , is eminently desirable . This is the main purpose of the bill of which Mr. DAVIS is the author . It provides for the appointment of two additional Judges in each of the nine circuits into which the country is at present divided . Then the three Circuit Judges , together with two of the District Judges within the circuit , to be assigned for the purpose , and the Justice of the Supreme Court allotted to the same , would constitute the court of appeals for that circuit . To this tribunal appeals could be taken from the Circuit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceeded $500 or any important question was involved . This would materially extend the opportunity for a review of the decisions of single Judges , as now in order to carry a case to the Supreme Court the amount involved must be at least $5,000 . It is also proposed to allow appeals in criminal cases where they can not now be taken before any appellate tribunal . Resort to the Supreme Court by writ of error would still remain in cases where the amount in controversy exceeded $10,000 , where any question of Federal law was involved , or where the Judges of the Court of Appeals certified that there was an important question which it was desirable to have that tribunal pass upon . It would also retain exclusive appellate jurisdiction in patent and copyright cases . There is a strong argument in favor of these circuit courts of appeal upon which Senator DAMS does not appear to have dwelt . A large proportion of the cases brought in Circuit Courts involve questions of State law only . They are brought in the Federal courts only because the litigants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and questions involved differ in no respect from those which are disposed of finally by the State tribunals without any resort to the Supreme Court at Washington . There is no sound reason why such cases should not be finally adjudicated within the circuit by means of such courts of appeal as those proposed . The new system would necessitate the appointment of eighteen additional . Circuit Judges , and would doubtless involve some increase of expense beyond their salaries , but , in several of the circuits additional Judges are needed under present requirements , and no method of relief can be devised which will not add to the judicial expenses of the Government . The aggregate salaries of the twelve additional Justices required by the plan for expanding the Supreme Court itself would be considerably greater than that'of eighteen Circuit Judges , and nothing like the same degree of relief and of benefit would be attained as is prom .. ised by the Davis bill . It is seldom that a measure is presented before Congress so well considered in its scope and details as this and so well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no reason that we can see why it should not be passed without delay .
