txt The most remarkable bill ever submitted to the consideration of any legislative body was introduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman WILLIAM E. ROBINSON , of Brooklyn , on March 27 . It is known as H. R. 5,463 , and was referred to the Committee on Patents and ordered to be printed . It covers seventy-three printed quarto pages , and its printing must have cost several hundred dollars . But when the people of these United States have read this bill and fully considered the enormous benefits it proposes to confer on their country , they will not grumble about any expense it may occasion . The purpose of the bill , as expressed in the title , is to define two species of personal rights of property in literary articles ; to declare and define national and international rights which the United States , in behalf of its citizens , may have and hold in literary articles ; to define literary crimes and provide for their punishment , and " for other purposes . " We deeply regret that the necessity of giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other trivial things forbids our attempting to give a full analysis of this bill , for which about twenty-four columns would be required . A few extracts , chosen almost at random , will give some idea of its scope and character . In defining the phrase " originally conceived and made , " as applied to any " literary article , " it is declared that it shall be construed as expressing " The fact of the person that made a literary article not having had any part thereof or the whole thereof suggested or communicated to him in any manner and in any degree by any other person , but which literary article , if claimed to be entirely original and lawfully conceived and made , has been originally conceived and made by the person that claims to be its author , in all its parts and as a whole , without any other suggestions or communications thereon than in the fact of the conceptive and constructive mind-properties of such person , having acted themselves normally laborative at his physical and psychal environments , and in more or less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at himself , have become suggestors and communicators to him of a subject for a literary article , and on such subject and in the making of such literary article and otherwise . " The terse , sinewy , and limpid style of this passage suggests that Its authorship is to be sought in the " mind-properties " and " physical and psychal environments " of Mr. DANIEL PRATT , the " Great American Traveler , " but there is also some internal evidence that it may have been written by the Magyar son of a Basque mother , reared in a Chinook monastery , and knowing intimately no language but Pehlevi . The two classes of personal rights of property in literary articles are " literary ideal property , " which is the " moral distinction which shall accrue " to any person who shall have conceived any literary article by the " lawfully laborative " use of his " mind-properties ; " and " literary copy property , " which is the right of literary pre-emption of an ideal That is , any person who conceives an idea may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labors in further developments and demonstrations of such new idea " for the period of fifty years by paying 50 cents to have it hung up , properly labeled , in the Patent Office . But this bill does not merely define , it creates . We are to have a " United States Office of Literature , " with a " United States Commissioner of Literature " therein , at $5,600 per year , with four assistant Vommissioners , each " of a thorough training in general literature , and in any and all of its branches , and of special mind-properties for the analysis of any literary article . " The functions of these officers are many and various , but the great business of the " Office of Literature " is to receive and file away " copies , either in manuscript or printed , when for private use , of the sentence in which the idea for which a certificate of literary pre-emption is applied for is embodied or expressed ; " and to make abstracts and analyses of literary articles and file copies thereof with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in order that those officers may keep abreast of the ideas of the age and punish plagiarism . Undoubtedly the most novel , as well as the most valuable , provision of this bill is embodied in the section requiring the " United States Commissioner of Literature " to make an annual report to Congress upon the doings of this bureau ; " to review in such report the general quality of the literary product of the United States during such year , " and " to distinguish by special notice every literary article , if any , of either home or foreign production , that is noteworthy either by the great importance of the ideas it reveals or as a literary work of art , or both . " Of course , this idea will be developed by amendments before the bill is passed , so that we shall have monthly reports upon the growing crop of books and ideas , after the model of the Agricultural Department 's precious monthly bulletins . It will be reported , for instance , that , owing to the early disappearance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully three weeks in advance of last season ; that the acreage of fiction in the West is sensibly less than the average , a large number of the ablest writers having turned their attention to poker books , and that for standard biography , history , and metaphysics we shall , as usual , be compelled to depend upon the import supply , the home crop being thin and poor . In the schedule of " literary felonies " of various degrees and " liteinry crimes " and " literary misdemeanors , " it is provided that any person convicted of " literary felony of the first degree , " by which is meant deliberate plagiarism , shall be " punished with imprisonment at hard labor for no less than three years and for no more than . six years , " and with a fine of from $3,000 to $6,000 . If under our present statutes literary felony could be adequately punished , the author of H. R. 5,463 Would emerge from the Albany Penitentiary toward the end of August , A. D. 8269.      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
