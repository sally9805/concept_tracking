txt It is beginning to dawn on the minds of some of the politicians who have been most frightened over the tariff question that the best disposition to be made of it is a moderate reduction , and that if this be assented to by both parties in Congress neither will lose very much in the coming election . This is so simple and sensible a solution of the difficulty in which both parties find themselves involved that it is not at all strange that it did not suggest itself to them at the outset . Politicians whose business in life it is to " take positions " naturally magnify the importance of the task , and as most of their ingenuity is spent in devising positions which they can take without offending any considerable class , it is much easier for them to procrastinate than to take positive action , however moderate . But the examination of the tariff that is being made before the Ways and Means Committee , though rapid , is so much more thorough and intelligent than any like work of late years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only on public opinion but upon the minds of members of Congress . This examination has brought out , of course , the same old arguments of the protected interests which have been recited over and over again for a dozen years before the Ways and Means Committees and in memorials and petitions . But the manufacturers ' representatives have met with a very different reception this year , and have been subjected to a series of direct and practical questions which have thrown a great deal of light upon their statements . So that it has come about that their testimony has supplied the strongest arguments for some conservative but substantial reduction in the tariff . For the first time in years they have been put upon the defens ; ve . The facts of the situation throw the burden of proof upon those who resist reduction . The surplus revenue is obvious and great . The rates of taxation are very high , The reduction of last year was a sham . The duties on raw materials , which are practically untouched , are a direct burden On manufactures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country . Trade is depressed . The most highly protected industries are suffering the most . Imports have fallen off , but in spite of the diminution of foreign competition , production outruns demand , prices are low , and wages have been generally reduced . The natural and apparently inevitable remedy is reduction of taxation , and the manufacturers are required to show why it should not be adopted . They are forced to admit at the outset that the old stock arguments no longer apply . A high tariff is certainly not needed for revenue . It is not needed to promote the establishment of the industries protected , for they are already vast and powerful , and the only trouble with them is that they are too great . It is not justified on the ground that it keeps up wages , for wages have gone down . If it be defended on the plea of the necessity of maintaining the industries established , the natural inquiry is , Is it to be perpetual ? Is a high tariff to be a constant tax on the consumer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a plea which the public will not accept with patience . Moreover , the examination of the Ways and Means Committee has brought out the fact that our protected industries already have full command of the home market , and that the tariff which gave them that shuts them out of the foreign market that they need . Under these circumstances no party can afford to take the position that the tariff must be maintained without change . No party is prepared , or even remotely desires , to maintain that the tariff should be abandoned , or that we should have either free trade or a very low tariff . If there were a moderate reduction of the present tariff , if our system were reduced , for instance , to something near the rates which prevail in Germany and France , the only protection countries of modem Europe , it would be a sensible relief to the business interests of the country , and it would practically take the question out of the Presidential election of this year . This fact is of the greatest importance to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If they resist a moderate reduction they leave to the Democrats all the advantage of a conservative position . It would be idle for them to point to such a reduction , either proposed or accomplished , as evidence that the Democrats are in favor of absolute free trade . The facts would be too obviously against such an accusation . Not that alone ; the time has gone by when the epithet " free trader " frightens many people . On the contrary , it is rapidly becoming a term of respect . There . is a steadily growing sentiment in the country that at some time or other this Nation will hold its own in free competition with the world , and the number of business men who are ready to try the contest is constantly increasing , while the number of those who cling to the old theory of universal high taxes is becoming smaller all the time . The course of prudence lies now not in inaction , or in reaction , but in action , prompt and in good faith .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
