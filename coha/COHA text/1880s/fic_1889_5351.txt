THE FIRST PRIZE FOR THE Wickedest Cow . THE BUSTED EX-TEXAN . THE BUSTED EX-TEXAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which led up to the Kicking Horse Pass . The sun had already passed from sight , beyond the white summits above us , and the shadow of the monstrous mountain range darkened the prairie to the east , to the horizon 's rim . Our bivouac was made in a grove of lofty firs , six or eight in number ; and a little rivulet , trickling from the upper slopes , fell , with soft , lapsing sound , within a few feet of our camp-fire . We did not even pitch a tent , for the sky was mild , and above us the monstrous trees lifted their protecting canopy of stems . The hammocks were swung for the ladies , and each gentleman " preempted " the claim that suited him best , by depositing his blanket and rifle upon it . The entire party were in the best of spirits , and nature responded to our happiness in its kindest mood . Laughter sounded pleasantly at intervals from the busy groups , each working at some self-appointed industry . The hum of cheerful conversation mingled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the snatch of some sweet song would break from tuneful lips , brief , spirited , melodious as a bobolink 's , dashing upward from the clover-heads . And before the mighty shadow lying gloomily on the great prairie plain , which stretched eastward for a thousand miles , had grown to darkness , the active , happy workers had given to the bivouac that look of designed orderliness which a trained party always give to any spot they select in which to make a camp or pass a night . An hour before , there was nothing to distinguish that grove of trees , or the ground beneath them , from any other spot or hill within the reach of eye . But now it commanded the landscape ; and , had you been trailing over the vast plain , the bright firelight , the group of men and women moving to and fro , the picketed horses , the fluttering bits of color here and there , would have caught your gaze ten miles away ; and were you tired or hungry , or even lonesome , you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as toward a cheerful reception and a home ; for wherever is happy human life , to it all lonely life is drawn as by a magnet . And this was demonstrated by our experience then and there . For , scarcely had we done with supper ,  --  and by this time the gloom had grown to darkness , and the half-light of evening held the landscape ,  --  when out of the semi-gloom there came a call ,  --  the call of a man hailing a camp . Indeed , we were not sure he had not hailed several times before we heard him ; for , to tell the truth , we were a very merry crowd , and as light of heart as if there was not a worry or care in all the world ,  --  at least for us ,  --  and the smallest spark of a joke exploded us like a battery . Indeed , so rollicking was our mood that our laughter was nearly continuous , and it is quite possible that the stranger may have hailed us more than once without our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man 's voice was not of the loudest , nor was it positive in the energy of its appeal . Indeed , there was a certain feebleness or timidity in the stranger 's hail , as if he was mistrustful that any good fortune could respond to him , and , hence , deprecated the necessity of the resort . But hear him we did at last , and he was greeted with a chorus of voices to " Come in ! Come in ! You 're welcome ! " And partly because we had finished our repast , and partly from courtesy and the natural promptings of gentlefolk to give a visitor courteous greeting , we all arose and received him standing . And , certainly , had the kindly act been unusual with us , not one of our group would have regretted the extra condescension bestowed upon him at his coming , after he had entered the circle of our firelight , and we saw the expression of his features . What a mirror the human face is ! Looking into it , how we behold the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappointments it has borne ! Are not the faces of men as carved tablets on which we read the records of their lives ? The face of childhood is smoothly beautiful , like a white page on which neither with ink of red or black has any pen drawn character . But , as the years go on , the pen begins to move and the fatal tracery to grow ,  --  that tracery which means and tells so much . And the face of this man ,  --  this waif , so to speak ,  --  this waif that had come to us from the stretch of the prairie , whose southern line is the southern gulf ; this stranger , who had come so suddenly to the circle of our light , and so plaintively sought admission to its comfort and its cheer , was a face which one might read at a glance . Not one in our circle that did not instantly feel that he embodied some overwhelming calamity . A look of sadness , of a mild , continuous sorrow , overspread his face . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brave determination had withdrawn its lines from it forever . From his eyes a certain mistrustfulness looked forth ,  --  not mistrustfulness of others , but of himself ,  --  as if confidence in his own powers had received an overwhelming shock . The man 's appearance made an instant and unmistakable impression upon the entire company . The ladies  --  God bless their sweet and sympathetic natures !  --  were profoundly moved at the pitiful aspect of our guest . Their bosoms thrilled with sympathy for one upon whose devoted head evil fortune had so evidently emptied its quiver . Nor were our less sensitive masculine natures untouched by his forlorn appearance . " A target for evil fortune , " whispered Dick to the major . " A regular bull's-eye ! " was the solemn response . " A bull's-eye , by gad ! at the end of the score . " It was not a poetic expression . I wish the reader to note that I do not record it as such . I only preserve it as evidence of the major 's humanity , and of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled all hearts . Naturally , as it can well be imagined , the gayety of our company had been utterly checked by the coming of our sad guest . In the presence of such a wreck of human happiness , perhaps of human hope , what person of any sensibility could maintain a lightsome mood ? Had it not been for one peculiarity ,  --  a peculiarity , I am confident , all of us observed ,  --  the depression of our spirits would have been as profound as it was universal . This peculiarity was the stranger 's appetite . This , fortunately , had remained unimpaired ,  --  an oasis in the Sahara of his life . " The one remnant left him from the wreck of his fortunes , " whispered Dick . " A perfect remnant ! " returned the major , sententiously . For myself , acting as host to this appetite , and being naturally of a philosophic turn , I watched its development with the keenest interest , not to say with a growing curiosity . " Here is something , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine law of recompense which is kindly distributed through the universe finds here , " I reflected , " a most instructive and conclusive demonstration . Robbed , by an adverse fate , of all that made life agreeable , this man , this pilgrim of time , this wayfarer to eternity , this companion of mine on the road of life , has had bestowed upon him an extraordinary solace , has been permitted to retain a commensurate satisfaction . Surely , life can not have lost its attractions for one whose stomach still preserves such aspirations . " And , prompted by the benevolence of my mood , and the anticipations of a wise forecast , I collected in front of me whatever edibles remained on the table , that , if the supply of our hospitality should prove insufficient , the exhibition of its spirit should at least be conclusive . But , if the countenance of the stranger was of a most melancholy cast , there were not lacking hints that by nature he had been endowed with vivacity of spirit ; for , as he continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , there were appearances , which came to the eye and the corners of his mouth , which made the observer conclude that he was not lacking the sense of humor ; and , if his experience had been most unfortunate , there was in him an ability to appreciate the ludicrousness of its changeful situations . Indeed , one could but conclude that originally he must have been of a buoyant , not to say sanguine disposition ; and , if one could but prevail upon him to narrate the incidents of his life , they would be found to be most entertaining . It was something like an hour before our melancholy-looking guest had fully improved the opportunity with which a benignant Providence had supplied him ,  --  a freak in which , one might conclude , she seldom indulged . He ceased to eat , and sat for a moment gazing pensively at the dishes . It seemed to me  --  but in this I may possibly be mistaken  --  that a darker shade of sadness possessed his face at the conclusion than the one that shadowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The pleasures of hope , " I said to myself , " are evidently greater to my species than are those of recollection . Now that there is nothing left for my guest to anticipate , it is evident that memory ceases to excite . " And I could but feel that , had our provisions been more abundant , the stranger 's appetite would not have been so easily appeased . With something of regret in my voice , I sought to divert his mind from that sense of disappointment which I judged from his countenance threatened to oppress his spirits . " Friend , " I said , " I doubt not that you have trailed a goodly distance , and your fasting has been long ? " " I have not eaten a meal in two days , " was the response . " Heavens ! " exclaimed Dick in an aside to the major . " Is it credible that that man ate two days ago ! " " Gad ! " exclaimed the major , " the man 's stomach is nothing but a pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unexplored cavern ! " retorted Dick . " The direction and reason of your long trail would be interesting , " I resumed . " And , if not impertinent , friend , may I ask you whence you have come ? " " I have journeyed from Texas , " replied the man , and his voice nearly broke as he said it . " Oh ! " exclaimed the ladies , and they sympathetically grouped themselves , anticipating , with true feminine sensitiveness , some terrible denouement . " Texas ! " I ejaculated . " Gad ! " said the major . " The Devil ! " said Dick . " Yes , Texas ! " repeated the man , and he groaned . By this time , as any intelligent reader will easily divine , our whole group was in a condition of mild excitement . Several of us had resided in Texas , and we felt that we stood at the threshold of a history ,  --  a history with infinite possibilities in it . For myself , I knew not how to proceed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sorrows of life are sacred , and my sensitiveness withheld me from thrusting myself within the enclosure of my guest 's recollections . That his experiences , could we but be favored with a narration of them , would be entertaining ,  --  painfully entertaining ,  --  I keenly realized ; but how to proceed I saw not . I remained silent . " Yes , "  --  it was the stranger who broke the silence ,  --  " I am a busted ex-Texan ! " Illustration : I AM A BUSTED EX-TEXAN . The relief that came to me at the instant was indescribable . The path was made plain . We all felt that we were not only on the threshold of a history , but of a narration of that history . The ladies fluttered into position for listening . I could but see it , and so I am bound to record that I saw Dick irreverently punch the major . It was a punch which carried with it the significance of an exclamation . The major received it with the face of a Spartan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friend , " I said , " we are accustomed to beguile the evening hours with entertaining descriptions of travels , often of personal incidents of the haps and hazards of life ; and , if it would not be disagreeable to you , we would be vastly entertained , beyond doubt , by any narration with which you might favor us of your Texan experiences and of the fortunes which befell you there . " For a few moments , the silence remained unbroken , save by the crackle of the fire and the soft movement in the great firs overhead ,  --  a movement which is to sound what dawn is to the day ; not so much a sound as a feathery suggestion that sound might come . It was a genial hour , and the mood of the hour began to be felt in our own . The warmth of it evidently penetrated the bosom of our guest . He had eaten . He was filled ,  --  appreciably so at least , and that happy feeling , that comfortable sense of fulness , which characterizes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He loosened his belt ,  --  another tremendous nudge from Dick ,  --  and a look of contentment softened his features . Whatever storm had wrecked his life , he had now passed beyond its billows , and from the sure haven into which he had been blown he could gaze with complacent resignation , if not with happiness , at the dangers through which he had passed . I am sure that we were all delighted at the brightening appearance of our guest , and felt that , if the story he was to tell us was one which included disasters , it would at least be lightened by traces of humor and the calm acceptance of a philosophic mind . " I was born in the State of Connecticut , " so our guest began his narration . " I came from a venturesome stock , and the instinct of commercial enterprise may be regarded as hereditary in my family . My grandfather was the first one to discover the tropical attributes of the beech-wood tree . He first perceived that it contained within its fibres the pungency of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pride in our family , he availed himself of the commercial value of his discovery , and for years did a prosperous trade on the credulity of mankind . He was a man of humor ,  --  a sense which has been to some extent transmitted to myself ,  --  he was a man of humor , and I have no doubt he enjoyed the joke he was practising on people , fully as much as the profits which the practical embodiment of his humor brought to his pocket . My father was a deacon , a man of true piety and eminently respectable . He was engaged in the retail-grocery business ,  --  a business which offers opportunities to a person of wit and of an inventive turn of mind . The butter that he sold was salted invariably by one rule  --  a rule which he discovered and applied in the cellar of the store himself ; and the sugar which he sold , if it was sanded , was always sanded by a method which improved rather than detracted from its appearance . " Here our guest paused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtues of his ancestors . His face was as sober as ever , but his look was one of contentment ; and I could but note the suggestion of merriment  --  the merriment of a happy memory  --  in his eye . How happy it is for an offspring to be able to recall the character of his forefathers with such liveliness of mind ! " The motive which impelled me towards Texas , " he resumed , " was one which was natural for me to feel , thus ancestrally connected . I had heired my father 's business ,  --  the deacon , who had died full of honors , ripe in years , and in perfect peace . But the business did not prosper in my hands ; perhaps , I had not heired , with the business , the deacon 's ability ,  --  that accuracy of eye , that gravity of appearance , that deftness of touch , so to speak , which underlay his success . Be that as it may , the business did not pay , and without hesitation I sold it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journeyed to Texas . " It is proper for me to remark that the welcome I received was most cordial . I chose a populous centre for a temporary residence , and proceeded to look around me . I found the Texans to be a warm-hearted people , much given to hospitality , and willing , with a charming disinterestedness , to admit all new-comers , with capital , to the enormous profits of their various enterprises . " For the first time in my life , I found myself among a people who were successful in everything they undertook . Their profits were simply enormous . No speculation could possibly fail . However I invested my money , I was assured that I would speedily become a millionnaire . Cotton was a certain crop . Corn was never known to fail . The Texan tobacco was rapidly driving the Cuban out of the market . The aboriginal grapes of the State , of which there were millions of acres waiting for the presses , yielded , as Europe confessed , a wine superior to Champagne . If I preferred herding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few sheep and simply sit down . There was no section of the globe where sheep were so prolific , fleeces so thick , or the demands of market so clamorous . And , as for horses , I was assured that no one in Texas who knew the facts of the case would spend any time in raising them . The prairies were full of them , hundreds of thousands of them , all blooded stock , ' true descendants , sir , from the Moorish Barb , distributed through the whole country at the Spanish invasion . ' I need do nothing but purchase fifty thousand acres , fence the territory in , and the enclosed herds would continue to propagate indefinitely . Such were the delightful pictures which my entertainers presented to me . Captivated by the charming manners of my hosts , my sanguine temperament kindled into heat at the touch of their enthusiasm . Where every venture was sure of successful issue , there was no need for deliberation or selection . I invested indiscriminately in all , and waited buoyantly for the results . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slight interruption . Dick had retired , closely followed by the major . Our guest certainly was not devoid of humor , and I was convinced , as I watched the play of his features , that he apprehended and appreciated the reason for their retirement . He lifted a plate from the table , inspected it closely , turned it over , gazed contemplatively at its reversed side , and , poising it deftly upon the point of three fingers , quietly remarked :  --  " The gentlemen , I judge , have been in Texas ? " " They have , " I replied : " we three were there together . " " Ah ! " It was all he said . I might add , it was all that could be said . At this point , Dick and the major rejoined us . Their eyes showed traces of recent tears . They were still wiping their faces with their handkerchiefs . With that refinement which is characteristic of true gentlemen , and which seeks concealment of any extraordinary emotion , they had considerately retired to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued our guest , after Dick and the major had resumed their seats , " I am delighted to find myself in company with men of experience . I feel that you will not question the veracity of my story , or fail to appreciate the outcome of my enterprises . At the end of two years , my property was distributed promiscuously throughout the State , and I was reduced to the necessity of making one final venture to recoup myself for the losses which , to the astonishment of the entire Texan community , I assured them I had met . I was the only man , as they asserted , ' that had ever failed to make a magnificent success in Texas . ' " You can readily conceive , gentlemen , that I was determined to make no mistake in my final venture . There were other reasons , beside the one of caution , which persuaded me to begin with a moderate investment ; so I bought one cow . It was impossible for me to make a mistake from such a beginning . Every person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started with one cow . Many a time had a Texan ranchman swept his hand with a royal gesture over a landscape of flowers and Mesquite brush , dotted with thousands of cattle , and exclaimed , ' Stranger , I started this yer ranch with one cow . ' And then he would take out a piece of chalk and figure out to me on his saddle how that one cow had multiplied herself into seven thousand five hundred and twenty-three other cows , which had proceeded to promptly multiply themselves , ' regular as the seasons come round , sir , ' in the same reckless manner , until it was evident that the number of her progeny was actually curtailed by the size of the saddle and the lack of chalk . Now , I was eager to possess a cow with such a multiplication-table attachment , and , being unable to wait even ten years before I could tingle with the sensation of being a millionnaire ranchman . I decided to shorten the probationary stage by half , and so I purchased two cows . " At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the major was doubled up as with sudden pain . As for myself , I confess I could not restrain my emotions . I had been through the same experience as had fallen to my guest , and I appreciated the sanguine characteristics of his temperament , which prompted him to the investment , and the humor of the situation . I laughed till my eyes flowed with tears , and the stillness of the foot-hills resounded with the unrestrained merriment of the entire camp . The humor of our guest was truly American , the humor of suggestive restraint and exaggeration both . He narrated his experiences , which had resulted in the loss of his fortune and the collapse of his hopes , with a face like a deacon 's , and with a quaint and most charming sense of the ludicrousness of the position  --  a position of which he himself was the cause and central object . He fairly represented that type of men who combine in their composition that which is most practical and imaginative alike ; whose energy can subdue a continent , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the magnitude of their achievements . A humor that is often barbed , but which is most willingly directed against one 's self ; but , whether directed against the humorist or his neighbor , carries no poison upon its point and leaves no wound to rankle . " My financial condition , " said our guest , resuming , " my financial condition at the time I made this final investment contributed to the hopefulness of my mood , and made me feel the excitement of a reckless speculation , for , though my two cows only cost me seventeen dollars and fifty cents each , nevertheless , when the purchase was concluded , and the goods delivered , and I had made a careful inventory of my remaining assets ,  --  a business proceeding which the average Texan found it necessary to go through about once in two weeks , in order that he might know what his financial standing was , or whether he had any standing at all ,  --  when , I say , the purchase was consummated , and an inventory of my remaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swallowed up nearly my entire estate , and that a few dollars of farther expenditure would plunge me into bottomless insolvency . I must confess that this disclosure of my financial condition added zest to the undertaking , and filled me with that fine excitement which accompanies a desperate speculation . I have always felt that another cow would have made a financier of me , and that I could have taken my place among my brethren in Wall Street without a tremor of the muscles or the least sense of inferiority . " The cows were both black in color ; so black that they would make a spot in the darkness of the blackest night that ever gloomed under the cypresses of the Guadaloupe . ' If those cows , ' I said to myself as I looked them over , ' if those cows ever do bring forth calves at the rate that the Texan of whom I purchased them figured out on his saddle , they 'll put the whole State under an eclipse . ' " I can not say ,  --  speaking with that restraint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , ladies and gentlemen , that I regarded either cow with any great affection . There were peculiarities about them , which checked the outgoing of my emotional nature . They had a way of looking at me through the wire fence , that made me feel grateful to the inventor of barbed wire . I can not describe the look exactly . It was a direct , earnest , steady , intense inspection of my person , that made me feel out of place , as it were , and caused me to remember that I had duties at home , which required me to get there as rapidly as possible . " One morning , seeing that the basis of my speculation was near the centre of the field , and busily feeding on the bountiful growths of nature , I crept softly through the wires of the fence that I might gather some pecan nuts under a big tree that stood some twenty rods away . I reached the tree in safety , and proceeded to pick up the nuts . I had filled one pocket only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking up , I saw that all the profits of my stock speculation , and all my stock itself , were coming toward me on a jump . I was never more collected in my life . My mind instantly reached the conclusion that the pecan crop that year was so large in Texas that it would not pay to pick up another nut under that tree ; that the whole thing should stand over , as it were , until another fall , and that , the sooner I retired from that field , the better it would be for me and the few pecans I had about me . " Acting in harmony with this conclusion ,  --  which to my mind carried with it the force of a demonstration ,  --  I started for the wire fence . I have no doubt but that the line of my movement was absolutely straight . I assure you , gentlemen , that if cows had multiplied in my business connection as rapidly as they did in my imagination during the next sixty seconds of time , I should have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually alive with cows . I reached the fence just one jump ahead of the oldest cow , and , seeing no reason why I should take time to crawl through between the wires , I lifted myself over the airy obstruction in a manner that must have convinced that old animated bit of blackness that I had absolute ownership in every nut about me . This little episode supplied me with material for reflection for at least a week , and made me realize that any northern man that enters into a speculation with Texas cows as a basis must keep his eyes open , and not allow his thoughts to be diverted by any side issues , like pecan nuts , while the business is developing . " The sixth morning after my speculation had arrived at the ranch , my profits began to roll in upon me ,  --  or , to state it more practically , and in a business-like manner , the oldest cow produced a calf . This raised my spirits , and made me feel that my business was fairly started . I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : 7523-1 . This meant that there were only seven thousand five hundred and twenty-two yet to realize on ; that is , if seven thousand five hundred and twenty-two calves should promptly come to time , seeing that one calf had already actually come to time , my herd would be complete . I think , gentlemen , you can readily understand my feelings as I stood contemplating the first fruition of my hopes from behind a tree . The cow was securely tied , but still from habit I took my usual position when inspecting my stock . My mood was very hopeful . I felt as every Texan felt , in those days , when by some accident he found himself in possession of actual property . ' There is a calf , ' I said ; ' I 've only had to wait six days for that calf to materialize . Suppose another calf should materialize in six days . ' I extracted a pencil from my pocket and began to figure . I multiplied that calf by six  --  I mean that at the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every time I put down a new multiplier I took a look at the calf , and every time I looked at the calf it multiplied itself , as it were , until I felt the full force of the Texan 's statement , save that , the more I multiplied , the more I felt that seven thousand five hundred and twenty-three did not fairly represent the certainties of the speculation . That cow would surely make a millionnaire of me yet  --  if nothing happened . " But , gentleman , something did happen , and it happened in this wise : You have doubtless , by this , concluded that the cow was a wild cow . The man who sold her to me had not put it precisely that way . He had represented her to me as a cow of mild manners , thoroughly domesticated , of the sweetest possible temper , used to the women folks , playful with children ,  --  in short , a creature of such amiability that she actually longed to be petted . But I had already discovered that her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not understand the nature of the cow or I did not understand the man . I was convinced that , if she had ever been domesticated , it had been done by some family every member of which had died in the process , or had suddenly moved out of the country only a short distance ahead of her , and that she had utterly forgotten her early training . Still , I had no doubt but that her amiability was there , although temporarily somewhat latent , and that the influences of a gentle spirit would revive the dormant sensibilities of her nature . ' The sight of a milk-pail , ' I said to myself , ' will surely awaken the reminiscences of her early days , and of that sweet home-life which was hers when she yielded at morn and at night her glad contribution to the nourishment of a Christian family . ' " There was on my ranch a servitor of foreign extraction who did my cooking for what he could eat ,  --  Chin Foo by name ,  --  and to him I called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the household  --  which , like most Texan households in the Tertiary period , so to speak , of their fortunes , was conducted on economic principles  --  as a washtub , a chip-basket , a water-bucket , and a dinner-gong . It also occurred to me , as I stood looking at the cow and caught the spirit of her expression , so to speak , that , as she had come to stay , was a permanent fixture of the establishment , as it were , Chin Foo might as well do the milking first as last . Moreover , as the Texan from whom I purchased her had assured me that she was a kind of household pet , the children 's friend , and took to women folks naturally , the case was a very clear one . For , as Chin Foo had long hair , wore no hat , and dressed in flowing drapery , the cow , unless she was more of a physiologist than I gave her credit for , would be in doubt somewhat as to the sex of the Chinaman ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach a dead-sure conclusion , the milking would be over ; and I would have scored the first point in the game , if she was a cow of ability , had any trumps , and was up to any tricks , as it were . So I told Chin Foo , as he approached with the pail in his hand , that the cow was a splendid milker , thoroughly domesticated , accustomed to Chinamen , and that he might have the honor of milking her first . I remarked , furthermore , that , as everything about the place was new to her , and she was a little nervous , I would gently attract her attention in front , while he proceeded to extract the delicious fluid . I charged him , in addition , to remember that it was always the best policy to approach a cow of her temperament in a bold and indifferent manner , as if he had milked her all his life , and get down to business at once ; and that any hesitation or show of nervousness on his part would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that Chin Foo acted in a highly creditable manner , considering he was in a strange land , and , to my certain knowledge , had no money laid by for funeral expenses ; for , while I was stirring the dust and flourishing my stick in a desultory manner in front of the cow , to divert her mind , and keep her thoughts from wandering backward too directly , he fluttered boldly up to her , and laid firmly hold of two teats , with the familiarity of an old acquaintance . " At this point of his narration the stranger paused a moment . There was a sort of plaintive look on his face , and he gazed at the plates with an expression in his eyes of sorrowful recollection . " I can not say , " he resumed , as one who speaks oppressed with a sense of uncertainty , " exactly what did happen , for I never saw the Chinaman again until he alighted . I only know that when he came down he was practically inside the pail , and that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eastern look on his face , as if he lived on the isle of Patmos and had seen a vision . And when he had crawled out of the pail he went directly into the house , saying , ' The Melican man is dam foolee to try to milkee that cussee ! ' or words to that effect . Illustration : PRACTICALLY INSIDE THE PAIL . " But I did not agree with him . I reflected that the Chinese are only an imitative race , and wholly lacking in original perception . ' They never invent anything , ' I said ; ' never study into causes , never get down to principles , as it were . It requires a purely occidental intellect to master the problem before me . This cow has a strong disinclination to be milked . Why ? What is the motive of her conduct ? If I could only answer that ! ' All at once it came to me ,  --  came like a flash . The reason was plain . ' This cow is a mother . The maternal instinct in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . She has a calf . To her mind , we are trying to rob her beloved offspring of its nourishment . She naturally resents this injustice on our part . Beautiful development of maternity , ' I apostrophized , as I looked at the cow in the light of this new revelation . ' Thy instincts are those that sweeten the world , and remind us of the benignity that planned the universe . I will bring thy calf to thee . I will show thee that I am not devoid of the spirit of equity ; that I am ready to go shares and play fair , as it were . Thy calf shall take one side of thee . I will take the other , and thy soul will come forth to me in gratitude ! ' " I was delighted . I went directly to the pen , and gazed benevolently at the calf . The little imp was blacker , if possible , than its mother . There was that same peculiar look also in its eyes . ' You 're all hers ! ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own child ! ' I seized hold of the neck-rope . I opened the pen-door and I went out through that door quicker than a vagrant cat ever got round a corner of a house where a Scotch terrier boards . The calf went under the cow and I struck her , head on . But I had come to stay . I grabbed the pail with one hand and a teat with the other . I tugged it , pulled it , twisted it . Not a drop could I start . A suction pump of twenty horse-power would have found it drier than Sahara , and all the while the calf 's mouth , on the other side , was actually running over with milk ! In two minutes he looked like a black watermelon . Then the cow , with a kind of back action , suddenly reached out one foot , and when I came to I found myself facing a mulberry tree , with one leg on each side of it . Illustration : " AND WHEN I CAME DOWN . " " By this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courage of my convictions . I felt it to be my duty to milk that cow . I reminded her in plain , straightforward language that I was the son of a deacon , and that she 'd find it out before she got through with me . I assured her that I understood the beauty of righteousness , and that I held a strong hand  --  a straight flush , as it were . I was well aware that the metaphor was somewhat mixed ; but it expressed my sentiments and relieved my feelings , and so I fired it at her point-blank . She snorted and pawed and bellowed , and swore at me in cow-language , but I did n't care for that . So I shook the old , battered milk-pail in her face , and told her I was born in Connecticut , and did business on spot-cash principle ; and that she would know more of the commandments than any cow of her color in Texas , before we said our long farewell . " By this time the matter had attracted a good deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the cow in the voice of a tragedian when the chief villain of the play has stolen his girl , and my next neighbor , an old sea-captain from Mattagorda Bay , and his hired men had come over to assist me . They were of the nature of a reenforcement , which consisted of the captain , a Mexican , a Michigan man that stuttered , and two negroes  --  Napoleon Bonaparte de Neville Smith , and George Washington Marlborough Johnsing , by name . Hence we were six in all , and I decided to take the offensive at once . The captain was advanced in years and rheumatic , but a clearheaded man , used to command , and had ' boarded , ' as he expressed it , ' several of the  --   --  crafts in his own waters . ' So I put him in charge of the marines , namely , ourselves , and told him to fight the ship for all she was worth . He caught on to the thing at once , and swore he would ' sweep the old black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son to the bottom , or make her strike her colors . ' The vigor of the gallant old gentleman 's language , and the noble manner in which he shook his cane at the old pirate , put us all in good spirits , and I verily believe that , if he had at that fortunate moment given the word ' board ! ' we would , niggers and all , have gone over the bulwarks of that old cow with a rush . " The captain 's plan of action was proof of his courage , and in harmony with my own ideas of the matter . He said that our force was ample , every gun shotted , and the ports open : that we had the windward gauge of her , and that the proper course was to send a boat in to cut her cable , and , when she drifted down with the current , we would ware ship , lay up alongside , grapple , pass lashings aboard , and send the whole crew on to her deck with a rush . Assaulted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become confused , be intimidated , and strike her colors without firing a gun . The brave and sonorous language with which our commander set forth his plan of assault captured our imaginations , and we all longed for the moment when the word of command should permit us to swarm up the sides and over the rail of the old bovine . " Not only was the general plan thus agreed upon , but each man had his post of duty assigned to him . When the ' cable was cut , ' that is , when the cow should find herself at liberty and bolt , as she would be sure to do , the Mexican was to lasso her and hang on ; Napoleon Bonaparte de Neville and George Washington Marlborough were to lay hold of her horns to ' port and starboard , ' as the captain insisted , while the Michigan man  --  who was over six feet tall , and leggy  --  was to fasten with a good grip on to her tail , that he might serve not only as a ' drag , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilot as well , ' if she should get to yawing or be suddenly taken aback , and be unable to come up into the wind promptly , ' while I was held in reserve to guard against emergencies . I did not quite like the position assigned to me , and so intimated to the captain , but he said no one could tell how it might go when we once got out of the harbor , and , if any of the braces should part , or the sea get high , that he would have to send an additional man to the wheel , ' for , ' he added , in a whisper , ' God knows , that long-legged Michigan land-lubber could never keep her to a straight course if she should once get running with the wind over her quarter , and everything drawing , through that cornfield . ' I saw the force of his reasoning , and felt easier . " So , without farther delay , we went into action . The old captain stood , knife in hand , ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but , before he did so , he hailed , ' All ready to cut cables ! ' " ' Fo ' de lawd , cap'in ! ' yelled Napoleon de Neville , ' what is dis yere nigger gwine to do if de udder nigger lets go ? ' " ' Go way dar , nigger ! ' retorted George Washington Marlborough ; ' what you takes dis nigger for if you tinks I 's gwine to let go dis ole black cow ? ' " ' I 'll give a silver dollar to the nigger that holds on the longest , ' I yelled . " ' Well answered , mate , ' sang out the old captain . ' All ready to cut cables . Cut she is ! ' " The cow gave a bellow like the roar of a lion , and made a rush with lowered horns at the captain . Now , this was not the course laid down on his chart for her to take ; and he and the rest of us were struck all aback , as he afterwards expressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He broke his big , Spanish-oak stick on the nose of the brute , and then the old mariner rolled in the dust . " ' Lay aboard of her , men ! ' shouted the old hero , in a voice like a fog-horn , flourishing the fragments of his stick . ' Lay aboard of the old cuss , I say ! Cast your grapplings , Greaser ! Seize her helm , some of ye , and throw it hard over to port ! ' Illustration : " LAY ABOARD OF THE OLD CUSS ! " " These orders were obeyed with alacrity . Not a man flinched . The loop of the lasso settled over the polished horns to the roots , and Don Juan San Diego set it tight with a twang . Napoleon Bonaparte and George Washington rushed headlong upon her and hung to horns and ears ; while the man from Michigan fastened a grip on her lifted tail , as she tore past him , which straightened him out like a lathe . As to myself , I could only stand and gaze with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which depended not only the chances of my speculation , but even the preservation of my self-esteem . " The combat deepened and enlarged itself , as it were . A bull-dog , who was wandering along the road in search of adventure , and two foxhounds joined in the fight . The calf , the only one of the seven thousand five hundred and twenty-three I was ever destined to behold , broke from its pen and ran bellowing to its mother . The dogs bayed , the niggers yelled , the Mexican swore in his delightful tongue ; and the stuttering Michigander remained silent , simply from his inability to pronounce the profanity of his feelings . " Suddenly the cow , which had been slowly working her way , with her several attachments clinging to her , toward the road which ran along the front of the field , turned and started pell-mell toward the river , which flowed wide and deep , through the rushes , at the rear of it . She left the path and took to the corn , and through the mass of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came . I anticipated the awful catastrophe , and stood riveted to the spot . The old captain still sat in the gravel , where the cow had bowled him , his hand grasping the shattered cane , and his game leg extended . He too foresaw the inevitable . Through the corn came the cow , like a black Saturn attended by her satellites . But her career was too terrific for these to hold to their connection . The laws of the universe forbade it . Napoleon Bonaparte de Neville lost his hold as she crashed into the sorghum patch . George Washington Marlborough tripped over an irrigation ditch , and soared away at a tangent , like a sputtering remnant of a burnt-out world . Don Juan San Diego went the wrong side of a mulberry tree , and the lasso parted with a snap . He never stopped until his momentum carried him through the slats of the neighboring cow-pen . Only the long-legged Michigander kept his hold , and he looked like a pair of extended scissors . I stood aghast at the impending ruin of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captain alone retained his presence of mind . As the black unit of my last Texan speculation shot by him , with Michigan , elongated like a peninsula , fastened to her tail , he rolled up to his knees and roared :  --  " ' Starboard your helm , boy ! Luff her up ! Luff her up , for the love of God , or the colonel is busted ! ' " It is doubtful if the Michigan man ever heard the stentorian call of the captain , for sound travels only thirteen hundred feet to the second , and the cow was certainly going considerably faster than that ; and , besides , he was himself engaged , with a terrific earnestness , in a vain effort to extricate a word out of his throat , which stuck like a wad in a smutty gun  --  a word of undoubted Saxon origin and of expressive force , and which has saved more blood-vessels from bursting than the lancet of the phlebotomist , for as he streamed past there was left floating upon the air a long string of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  d  --  d  --  d  --  d-d-d ... ! " No one who did not hear them could ever conceive of the awful sputtering , hissing sound that they caused in the atmosphere as they came out of the mouth of the mad and stuttering Michigander ; and as he and the cow bored a hole through the reeds on the bank of the river , and , hitting a cypress stump , ricochetted into the water , that fiery string of d 's , still hot and sputtering , reached half across the field . Illustration : " LUFF HER UP ! LUFF HER UP ! " " The splash of the two as they struck the water brought the old captain to his feet , and , in spite of his rheumatic leg , he rushed toward the river , crying :  --  " ' Man overboard ! Man overboard ! Gone clean over the forechains ! Life-floats to port and starboard ! ' " With such a frightful catastrophe , gentlemen , the remembrance of which actually makes me nervous , my last speculation in Texas ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening ,  --  a process which took us well into the night ,  --  it was our united opinion that the speculation was a failure . This conviction was mutual and profound . The cow was not only gone , but she had shown such disinclination to be domesticated , and such a misapprehension of the true purpose of life , that the prospect was truly disheartening . " ' Why , damn it , colonel , ' said the captain , ' we 've no evidence that the old cow wanted to be milked ! ' " To this discouraging conclusion of the captain 's I was compelled to give a sorrowful assent . I recognized that my speculation was in arrears , as it were , and that it would never figure up a profit . " Therefore , next day I divided my few personal effects between the captain and the noble men who had risked their lives for an idea ; who had seen the tragedy played out and the curtain rung down to my last appearance , as it were . And , with the few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me to Texas , I mounted my horse and started northward , to join that noble army of martyrs , that brotherhood of sufferers , that fraternity of the busted , whose members are legion , and who are known as ' Ex-Texans . ' " The hilarity of the camp that evening under the foot-hills will never be forgotten by those of us who composed the happy number , and who listened with streaming eyes and aching sides to the narrative of our unfortunate guest . He told his story with a directness and simplicity of narrative , with a gravity of countenance and plaintiveness of voice , which heightened the humor of the substance . Never did the stars , which have seen so much of human happiness , which have listened to so much of the rollicking humor of those who were fashioned for laughter , looked down upon a jollier camp . Long after our guest had ended his narrative and was apparently sleeping in happy forgetfulness of his Texas speculation , succeeding pauses of silence would come roars of laughter . The remembrance of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had fallen on us all , fun still held possession of our dreams . For Dick , starting from sleep in a nightmare of hilarity , roared out : " Luff her up , luff her up , or the colonel is busted ! " Ay , ay , thank God for laughter . Thank him heartily and ever , dear friend , blow the winds , run the tides as they may . The sorrows of life may be many , and its griefs may be keen , and we who are frosted with years and you who are blooming have felt and will feel the sting of false friends and the burden of losses ; but , lose what we may , or be pained as we have been and shall be , we are happy in this ,  --  we who know how to laugh ,  --  that we find wings for each burden , solace for pains , and return for all losses , in our sweet sense of humor , thank Heaven ! So , whether rich men or poor , healthy or sick , brown-headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with eyes for all beauty and hearts for all fun . Let lilies teach us , and of the birds of the air let us learn . The day that is not shall not make us anxious , for of each day is the evil enough , and the morrow shall take care of itself . Illustration : THE WICKEDEST COW. * HOW DEACON TUBMAN and PARSON WHITNEY CELEBRATED NEW YEARS . HOW DEACON TUBMAN AND PARSON WHITNEY CELEBRATED NEW YEAR 'S . " Mirandy , I 'm going up to see the parson , " exclaimed the deacon , when the morning devotions were over , " and see if I can thaw him out a little . I 've heard that there used to be a lot in him in his younger days , but he 's sort of frozen all up latterly , and I can see that the young folks are afraid of him and the church too , but that wo n't do  --  no , it wo n't do , " repeated the good man emphatically , " for the minister ought to be loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody ; and a church without young folks in it is , why , it is like a family with no children in it . Yes , I 'll go up and wish him a Happy New Year anyway . Perhaps I can get him out for a ride to make some calls on the people , and see the young folks at their fun . It 'll do him good , and them good , and me good , and everybody good . " Saying which , the deacon got inside his warm fur coat , and started toward the barn to harness Jack into the worn , old-fashioned sleigh , which sleigh was built high in the back , and had a curved dasher of monstrous proportions , ornamented with a prancing horse in an impossible attitude , done in bright vermilion on a blue background ! " Happy New Year to you , Parson Whitney ! Happy New Year to you , " cried the deacon , as he stood in the doorway of the parsonage and shook the parson by the hand enthusiastically , " and may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , come in , " cried Parson Whitney , in response . " I 'm glad you 've come ; I 'm glad you 've come . I 've been wanting to see you all the morning , " and in the cordiality of his greeting he literally pulled the little man through the doorway into the hall , and hurried him up the stairway to his study in the chamber overhead . " Thinking of me ! Well , now , I never ! " exclaimed the deacon , as , assisted by the parson , he twisted and wriggled himself out of his coat , that he filled , a little too snugly for an easy exit . " Thinking of me , and among all these books too  --  Bibles , catechisms , tracts , theologies , sermons . Well , well , that is funny . What made you think of me ? " " Deacon Tubman , " responded the parson , as he seated himself in his armchair , " I want to talk with you about the church . " " The church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going wrong , I hope ? " " Yes , things are going wrong , deacon , " responded the parson . " The congregation is growing smaller and smaller , and yet I preach good , strong , biblical , soul-satisfying sermons , I trust . " " Good ones ! good ones ! " answered the deacon promptly , " never better  --  never better in the world . " " And yet the people are deserting the sanctuary , " rejoined the parson solemnly , " and the young people wo n't come to the sociables , and the little children seem actually afraid of me . What shall I do , deacon ? " and the good man put the question with pathetic emphasis . " You 've hit the nail on the head , square as a hatchet , parson , " responded the deacon . " The congregation is thinning . The young people do n't come to the meetings , and the little children are afraid of you . " " What 's the matter , deacon ? " cried the parson in return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Speak it right out ; do n't try to spare my feelings . I will listen to  --  I will do anything to win back my people 's love , " and the strong , old-fashioned Calvinistic preacher said it in a voice that actually trembled . " You can do it  --  you can do it in a week ! " exclaimed the deacon encouragingly . " Do n't worry about it , parson ; it 'll be all right , it 'll be all right . Your books are the trouble . " " Books ? " ejaculated the parson . " What have they to do with it ? " " Everything , " replied the deacon stoutly . " You pore over them day in and day out ; they keep you in this room here when you should be out among the people ,  --  not making pastoral visits ,  --  I do n't mean that ,  --  but going around among them , chatting and joking and having a good time . They would like it , and you would like it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , parson ? " " Sixty next month , " answered the parson ; " sixty next month , " he repeated solemnly . " Thirty ! thirty ! that 's all you are , parson , or all you ought to be , " cried the deacon . " Thirty , twenty , sixteen !  --  let the figures slide down and up , according to circumstances , but never let them go higher than thirty when you are dealing with young folks . I 'm sixty myself , counting years ; but I 'm only sixteen , sixteen this morning , that 's all , parson , " and he rubbed his little round plump hands together , looked at the parson , and winked . " Bless my soul , Deacon Tubman , I do n't know but that you are right ! " answered the parson . " Sixty ? I do n't know as I am sixty , " and he began to rub his own hands , and came within an ace of executing a wink at the deacon , himself . " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of age , " responded the deacon deliberately , as he looked the white-headed old minister over with a most comic imitation of seriousness . " Not a day over twenty , on my honor , " and the deacon leaned forward toward the parson , and gave him a punch with his thumb , as one boy might deliver a punch at another , and then he lay back in his chair and laughed so heartily that the parson caught the infectious mirth and roared away as heartily as himself . Yes , it was impossible to sit hobnobbing with the little , jolly deacon on that bright New Year 's morning and not be affected by the happiness of his mood , for he was actually bubbling over with fun , and as full of frolic as if the finger on the dial had , in truth , gone back forty-odd years , and he was " only sixteen . Only sixteen , parson , on my honor . " " But what can I do ? " queried the good man , sobering down . " I make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responded Deacon Tubman . " Oh , yes , and they are all well enough for the old folks , but they ar' n't the kind of biscuit the young folks like  --  too heavy in the centre , and over-hard in the crust for young teeth , eh , parson ? " " But what shall I do ? what shall I do ? " reiterated the parson , somewhat despondently . " Oh ! put on your hat , and gloves , and warmest coat , and come along with me . We will see what the young folks are doing , and will make a day of it . Come ! come ! let the old books , and catechisms , and sermons , and tracts have a respite for once , and we 'll spend the day out-of-doors , with the boys and girls and the people . " " I 'll do it ! " exclaimed the parson . " Deacon Tubman , you are right . I do keep to my study too closely . I do n't see enough of the world and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Testament this morning , and I was impressed with the Master 's manner of living and teaching . It is not certain that he ever preached more than twice in a church during all his ministry on the earth . And the children ! how much he loved the children , and how the little ones loved him ! And why should n't they love me , too ? Why should n't they ? I 'll make them do it ! yes , I 'll make them do it ! The lambs of my flock shall love me . " And with these brave words Parson Whitney bundled himself up in his warmest garments , and followed the deacon downstairs . " Tell the folks that you wo n't be back till night , " called the deacon from the sleigh ; " for this is New Year , and we 're going to make a day of it , " and he laughed away as heartily as might be  --  so heartily that the parson joined in the laughter himself as he came shuffling down the icy path toward him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already ! " said the good man as he stood up in the sleigh , and with a long , strong breath breathed the cool , pure air into his lungs . " Bless me ! how much younger I feel already ! " he repeated , as he settled down into the roomy seat of the old sleigh . " Only sixteen to-day ,  --  eh , deacon ? " and he nudged him with his elbow . " That 's all , that 's all , parson , " answered the deacon gayly , as he nudged him vigorously back ; " that 's all we are , either of us , " and , laughing as merrily as two boys , the two glided away in the sleigh . Well , perhaps they did n't have fun that day , these two old boys that had started out with the feeling that they were " only sixteen , " and bound to make " a day of it ! " And they did make a day of it , in fact , and such a day as neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they went to Bartlett 's Hill , where the boys and girls were coasting , and coasted with them for a full hour ,  --  and then it was discovered by the younger portion of his flock that the parson was not an old , stiff , solemn , surly poke , as they had thought , but a pleasant , good-natured , kindly soul , who could take and give a joke , and steer a sled as well as the smartest boy in the crowd ; and when it came to snow-balling , he could send a ball further than Bill Sykes himself , who could out-throw any boy in town , and roll up a bigger block to the new snow fort they were building than any three boys among them . And how the parson enjoyed being a boy again ! How exhilarating the slide down the steep hill ; how invigorating the pure , cool air ; how pleasant the noise of the chatting and joking going on around him ; how bright and sweet the boys and girls looked , with their rosy cheeks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrilled as they crowded around him when he would go , and urged him to stay ,  --  and little Alice Dorchester begged him , with her little arms around his neck , to " jes ' stay and gib me one more slide , please ! " " You never made such a pastoral call as that , parson , " said the deacon , as they drove away amid the cheers of the boys and the " good-bys " of the girls , while the former fired off a volley of snow-balls in his honor , and the latter waved their muffs and handkerchiefs after them . " God bless them ! God bless them ! " said the parson . " They have lifted a load from my heart , and taught me the sweetness of life , of youth , and the wisdom of Him who took the little ones in His arms , and blessed them . Ah , deacon , " he added , " I 've been a great fool , but I 'll be so , thank God ! no more . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal of character , and had a great history ; but of this none in that section , save the little deacon , knew a word . Dick Tubman , the deacon 's youngest , wildest , and , we might add , favorite son , had purchased him of an impecunious jockey , at the close of a disastrous campaign , that cleaned him completely out , and left him in a strange city a thousand miles from home , with nothing but the horse , harness , and sulky , and a list of unpaid bills that must be met before he could leave the scene of his disastrous fortunes . Under such circumstances it was that Dick Tubman ran across the horse , and partly out of pity for its owner , and partly out of admiration of the horse , whose failure to win at the races was due more to his lack of condition and the bad management of his jockey than lack of speed , bought him off-hand , and , having no use for him himself , shipped him as a present to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with no harder work than ploughing out the good old man 's corn in the summer , and jogging along the country roads on the deacon 's errands . Having said thus much of the horse , perhaps we should more particularly describe him . He was , in sooth , an animal of most unique and extraordinary appearance ; for , in the first place , he was quite seventeen hands in height , and long in proportion . He was also the reverse of shapely in the fashion of his build : for his head was long and bony , and his hip bones sharp and protuberant ; his tail was what is known among horsemen as a rat-tail , being but scantily covered with hair , and his neck was even more scantily supplied with a mane , while in color he could easily have taken any premium put up for homeliness , being an ashen roan , mottled with flecks and patches of divers hues ; but his legs were flat and corded like a racer 's , his neck long and thin as a thoroughbred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lively , while the white rings around his eyes hinted at a cross , somewhere in his pedigree , with Arabian blood . A huge , bony , homely-looking horse he was , who drew the deacon and Miranda into the village on market days and Sundays , with a loose , shambling gait , making altogether an appearance so homely and peculiar that the smart village chaps riding along in their jaunty turn-outs used to chaff the good deacon on the character of his steed , and satirically challenge him to a brush . The deacon always took their badinage in good part , although he inwardly said more than once , " If I ever get a good chance , when there ar' n't too many around , I 'll go up to the turn of the road beyond the church , and let Jack out on them ; " for Dick had given him a hint of the horse 's history , and told him " he could knock the spots out of thirty , " and wickedly urged the deacon to take the starch out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horse , then , that the deacon had ahead of him , and the old-fashioned sleigh , when , with the parson alongside , he struck into the principal street of the village . Now , New Year 's Day is a lively day in many country villages , and on this bright one especially , as the sleighing was perfect , everybody was out . Indeed , it had got noised abroad that certain trotters of local fame were to be on the street that afternoon , and , as the boys worded it , " there would be heaps of fun going on . " And so it happened that everybody in town , and many who lived out of it , were on this particular street , and just at the hour , too , when the deacon came to the foot of it , so that the walk on either side was lined darkly with lookers-on , and the smooth snow-path between the two lines looked like a veritable homestretch on a race-day . Now , when the deacon had reached the corner of the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point where the course terminated and the " brushes " were ended , and at the precise moment when the dozen or twenty horses that had just come flying down were being pulled up preparatory to returning at a slow gait to the customary starting-point at the head of the street , a half-mile away , so that the old-fashioned sleigh was surrounded by the light , fancy cutters of the rival racers , and old Jack was shambling awkwardly along in the midst of the high-spirited and smoking nags that had just come flying down the stretch . " Hellow , deacon , " shouted one of the boys , who was driving a trim-looking bay , and who had crossed the line at the ending of the course second only to a pacer that could " speed like a streak of lightning , " as the boys said ,  --  " Hellow , deacon ; ai n't you going to shake out old shamble-heels , and show us fellows what speed is to-day ? " And the merry-hearted chap , son of the principal lawyer of the place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at the great angular horse that , without any check , was walking carelessly along , with his head held down , ahead of the old sleigh and its churchly occupants . " I do n't know but what I will , " answered the deacon , good-naturedly ; " do n't know but what I will , if the parson do n't object , and you wo n't start off too quick to begin with ; for this is New Year 's , and a little extra fun wo n't hurt any of us , I reckon . " Illustration : THE DEACON AND PARSON . " Do it , do it ; we 'll hold up for you , " answered a dozen merry voices . " Do it , deacon : it 'll do old shamble-heels good to go a ten-mile-an-hour gait for once in his life , and the parson need n't fear of being scandalized by any speed you 'll get out of him , either ; " and the merry chaps haw-hawed as men and boys will , when every one is jolly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of good-natured chaffing from the drivers of the " fast ' uns , " and from many that lined the road too ,  --  for the day gave greater liberty than usual to bantering speech ,  --  the speedy ones paced slowly up to the head of the street , with old Jack shambling demurely in the midst of them . But the horse was a knowing old fellow , and had " scored " at too many races not to know that the " return " was to be leisurely taken , and , indeed , he was a horse of independence , and of too even , perhaps of too sluggish , a temperament , to waste himself in needless action ; but he had the right stuff in him , and had n't forgotten his early training either , for when he came to the " turn , " his head and tail came up , his eye brightened , and , with a playful movement of his huge body , and without the least hint from the deacon , he swung himself and the cumbrous old sleigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming brush . Now , Jack was , as we have said , a horse of huge proportions , and needed " steadying " at the start , but the good deacon had no experience with the " ribbons , " and was therefore utterly unskilled in the matter of driving ; and so it came about that old Jack was so confused at the start that he made a most awkward and wretched appearance in his effort to get off , being all " mixed up , " as the saying is ,  --  so much so that the crowd roared at his ungainly efforts , and his flying rivals were twenty rods away before he even got started . But at last he got his huge body in a straight line , and , leaving his miserable shuffle , squared away to his work , and , with head and tail up , went off at so slashing a gait that it fairly took the deacon 's breath away , and caused the crowd that had been hooting him to roar their applause , while the parson grabbed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rim of his tall black hat with the other . What a pity , Mr. Longface , that God made horses as they are , and gave them such grandeur of appearance when in action , and put such an eagle-like spirit between their ribs , so that , quitting the plodding motions of the ox , they can fly like that noble bird , and come sweeping down the course as on wings of the wind ! It was not my fault , nor the deacon 's , nor the parson 's either , please remember , then , that awkward , shuffling , homely-looking old Jack was thus suddenly transformed , by the royalty of blood , of pride , and of speed given him by his Creator , from what he ordinarily was , into a magnificent spectacle of energetic velocity . With muzzle lifted well up , tail erect , the few hairs in it streaming straight behind , one ear pricked forward and the other turned sharply back , the great horse swept grandly along at a pace that was rapidly bringing him even with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little was the pace to him that he fairly gambolled in playfulness as he went slashing along , until the deacon verily began to fear that the honest old chap would break through all the bounds of propriety and send his heels antically through his treasured dashboard . Indeed , the spectacle that the huge horse presented was so magnificent , his action so free , spirited , and playful , as he came sweeping onward , that cheers and exclamations , such as , " Good heavens ! see the deacon 's old horse ! " " Look at him ! look at him ! " " What a stride ! " etc. , ran ahead of him , and old Bill Sykes , a trainer in his day , but now a hanger-on at the village tavern , or that section of it known as the bar , wiped his watery eyes with his tremulous fist , as he saw Jack come swinging down , and , as he swept past with his open gait , powerful stroke , and stiffles playing well out , brought his hand with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll be blowed if he is n't a regular old timer ! " It was fortunate for the deacon and the parson that the noise and cheering of the crowd drew the attention of the drivers ahead , or there would surely have been more than one collision , for the old sleigh was of such size and strength , the good deacon so unskilled at the reins , and Jack , who was adding to his momentum with every stride , was going at so determined a pace , that , had he struck the rear line , with no gap for him to go through , something serious would surely have happened . But , as it was , the drivers saw the huge horse , with the cumbrous old sleigh behind him , bearing down on them at such a gait as made their own speed , sharp as it was , seem slow , and " pulled out " in time to save themselves ; and so without any mishap the big horse and heavy sleigh swept through the rear row of racers like an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time the deacon had become somewhat alarmed , for Jack was going nigh to a thirty clip ,  --  a frightful pace for an inexperienced man to ride ,  --  and began to put a good strong pressure upon the bit , not doubting that old Jack  --  ordinarily the easiest horse in the world to manage  --  would take the hint and immediately slow up . But though the huge horse took the hint , it was exactly in the opposite manner that the deacon intended he should , for he interpreted the little man 's steady pull as an intimation that his inexperienced driver was getting over his flurry and beginning to treat him as a big horse ought to be treated in a race , and that he could now , having got settled to his work , go ahead . And go ahead he did . The more the deacon pulled , the more the great horse felt himself steadied and assisted . And so , the harder the good man tugged at the reins , the more powerfully the machinery of the big animal ahead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to call upon the horse to stop , crying , " Whoa , Jack ! whoa , old boy , I say ! Whoa , will you now , that 's a good fellow ! " and many other coaxing calls , while he pulled away steadily at the reins . But the horse misunderstood the deacon 's calls , as he had his pressure on the reins , for the crowd on either side were now yelling , and hooting , and swinging their caps , so that the deacon 's voice came indistinctly to his ears at the best , and he interpreted his calls for him to stop as only so many encouragements and signals for him to go ahead ; and so , with the memory of a hundred races stirring his blood , the crowd cheering him to the echo , the steadying pull and encouraging cries of his driver in his ears , and his only rival , the pacer , whirling along only a few rods ahead of him , the monstrous animal , with a desperate plunge that half lifted the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , with such a burst of speed as was never seen in the village before , tore along after the pacer at such a terrific pace that , within the distance of a dozen lengths , he lay lapped upon him , and the two were going it nose and nose . What is that feeling in human hearts which makes us sympathetic with man or animal who has unexpectedly developed courage and capacity when engaged in a struggle in which the odds are against him ? And why do we enter so spiritedly into the contest , and lose ourselves in the excitement of the moment ? Is it pride ? Is it the comradeship of courage ? Or is it the rising of the indomitable in us , that loves nothing so much as victory , and hates nothing so much as defeat ? Be that as it may , no sooner was old Jack fairly lapped on the pacer , whose driver was urging him along with reins and voice alike , and the contest seemed doubtful , than the spirit of old Adam himself entered into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried away by the excitement of the race , they fairly forgot themselves , and entered as wildly into the contest as two ungodly jockeys . Illustration : THE RACE . " Deacon Tubman ! " said the parson , as he clutched the rim of his tall hat , against which , as the horse tore along , the snow chips were pelting in showers , more stoutly , " Deacon Tubman ! do you think the pacer will beat us ? " " Not if I can help it ! not if I can help it ! " yelled the deacon in reply , as , with something like a reinsman 's skill , he instinctively lifted Jack to another spurt . " Go it , old boy ! " he shouted encouragingly . " Go along with you , I say ! " and the parson , also carried away by the whirl of the moment , cried , " Go along , old boy ! Go along with you , I say ! " This was the very thing , and the only thing , that huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rally him for the final effort ; and , in response to the encouraging cries of the two behind him , he gathered himself together for another burst of speed , and put forth his collected strength with such tremendous energy and suddenness of movement that the little deacon , who had risen , and was standing erect in the sleigh , fell back into the arms of the parson , while the great horse rushed over the line a winner by a clear length , amid such cheers and roars of laughter as were never heard in that village before . Nor was the horse any more the object of public interest and remark  --  we may say favoring remark  --  than the parson , who suddenly found himself the centre of a crowd of his own parishioners , many of whom would scarcely be expected as participants of such a scene , but who , thawed out of their iciness by the genial temper of the day , and vastly excited over Jack 's contest , thronged upon the good man , laughing as heartily as any jolly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parson and wished him a Happy New Year , and the parson shook hands with everybody and wished them all many happy returns ; and everybody praised old Jack , and rallied the deacon on his driving ; and then everybody went home good-natured and happy , laughing and talking about the wonderful race , and the change that had come over Parson Whitney . And as for Parson Whitney himself , the day and its fun had taken twenty years from his age , and nothing would answer but the deacon must go home and eat the New Year 's pudding at the parsonage ; and he did . And at the table they laughed and talked over the funny incidents of the day , and joked each other as merrily as two boys . Then Parson Whitney told some reminiscences of his college days , and the scrapes he got into , and a riot between town and gown , when he carried the " Bully 's Club ; " and the deacon responded by narrating his experiences with a certain Deacon Jones 's watermelon patch when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mulled cider they laughed till they cried , and roared so lustily at the remembered frolics of their youthful days that the old parsonage rang , the books on the library shelves rattled , and several of the theological volumes actually gaped with horror . But at last the stories were all told , the jokes all cracked , and the laughter all laughed , and the little deacon wished the parson good-by , and jogged happily homeward ; but more than once he laughed to himself , and said , " Bless my soul ! I did n't know the parson had so much fun in him . " And long the parson sat by the glowing grate after the deacon had left him , musing of other days , and the happy , pleasant things that were in them ; and many times he smiled , and once he laughed outright at some remembered folly , for he said , " What a wild boy I was , and yet I meant no wrong ; and the dear old days were very happy . " Ay , ay ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not only to thee , but to all of us , who , following our sun , have fared westward so long that the light of the morning shows dull through the dim haze of memory . But happier than even the old days will be the young ones , I ween , when , following still westward , we suddenly come to the gates of the new east and the morning once more ; and there , in the dawn of a day which is cloudless and endless , we find our lost youth and its loves , to lose them and it no more forever , thank God ! THE LEAF OF RED ROSE . THE LEAF OF RED ROSE : THE OLD TRAPPER 'S STORY . A story ? Why , yes . If Henry , there , will translate it And put it in verse and print as he promised To do when it happened . Will he do it ? I doubt . He dislikes to dabble with rhyme and with measure . Says that good honest prose is the best and the sweetest If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pithy . And that making of verse is the business of women , Of green boys at school , and of lovers when spooning . But try him . It may be he will . For a lesson Is in it , and that makes it worth telling . The woods have their secrets and sorrows and struggles As well as the cities . You can find in the woods Many things , if you look , beside trees , rocks , and mountains . Jack Whitcomb he said his name was , though I doubted . For the name on his bosom , tattooed in purple , Did n't point quite that way . But that does n't matter . One name in the woods is as good as another If a man answers to it and it 's easily spoken . So we called him Jack Whitcomb and asked nothing further . Brave ? Why , of course he was brave . Men are not cowards . Cowards do n't come to the woods . They stay in the cities , Where policemen are thick and the streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their ears and eyes open , And sleep when they sleep with their hands on their rifles . Why ? Well , panthers are plenty and cunning and quiet , And a man is a fool that goes carelessly stumbling Under trees where they crouch , under crags where they gather . Furthermore , with the saints , now and then there are sinners That live in the woods ; and some half-breeds are wicked , And know nothing of law unless taught by a bullet . I 've done what I could to teach knaves the commandments . Yes . Jack Whitcomb was brave . Brave as the bravest . His glance was as keen and his mouth was as silent As a trailer 's should be who looks and who listens By day and by night , having no one to talk to . His finger was quick when it handled the trigger , And his eye loved the sights as lightning loves rivers . I 've seen him stand up when the odds were against him . Stand up like a man who takes coolly the chances . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One day we were boating on far Mistassinni . We were fetching the portage above the great rapids , Where they whirled , roaring down , freshet full , at their whitest , When we saw from a rock that stretched outward and over The wild hissing water as it swept on in thunder , A canoe coming down , rolling over and over , With a little papoose clinging tight to the lashings ; And as it lanced by Jack went in like an otter . How he did it God knows , but at the foot of the rapids , Half a mile farther down racing onward , I found him High and dry on the beach in a faint like a woman , With the little papoose pulling away at his jacket . And when he came to , he put child to his shoulder , Nor stopped till it lay in the arms of its mother . We were trailing , Henry and I , trailing and trapping In the land to the north , where fur was the thickest , And knaves were as plenty as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and trailed our line double To keep our own skins , if we did n't get others . It was folly to stay where we were , and we knew it , For the knaves they got thicker , and soon there was shooting Going on pretty lively . But we held to the business And scouted the line once a week like true trappers . And no accident happened save some holes in our jackets , And my powder-horn emptied by a vagabond 's bullet . So we mended our clothing and felt pretty lively . But the signs pointed one way . Our enemies thickened Around us each day , and we were n't quite decided To stand in for a fight and settle the matter , Or pull up our traps and get out of the country , When it settled itself . And in this way it happened . We were scouting the lake on the west shore one morning , To find the knaves ' camp and how many were in it , When a short space ahead there came of a sudden A crash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or twenty placed rifles had burst an ambushment . And then in an instant there sounded another . Two sharp , twin reports and the death yells that followed Told us as we listened where the lead had been driven . Knew who he was ? Of course . The man was Jack Whitcomb . Do you think men who live by trapping and shooting Do n't learn to distinguish the voice of their rifles ? Jack was trailing the lake to find our encampment , For far away in the south there had come to his cabin A rumor that we in the north land were holding Our line and our furs with a good deal of shooting . So he left his own traps and came by swift trailing To give us the help of another good rifle . That was just like Jack Whitcomb . If you were in trouble He was there by your side . You could always count on him , With finger on trigger and both barrels loaded . So Henry and I both took to our covers Right and left of the trail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , for the boy knew his business , And soon he came backward , loading and running , Like a man who was busy but would n't be hurried Beyond his own gait , if he stopped there forever . As he passed our two covers I piped him a whistle ; And he stopped in his tracks , and with low , pleasant laughter , Stood there in full view coolly capping the nipples . I have shot on each Gulf , both Southern and Northern . I have trailed the long trail between either ocean . Brave men I have seen , both in good and in evil , But never a braver than the man called Jack Whitcomb . Well , why describe it ? Call it scrimmage or battle , It was done in a minute , or it may be a dozen . It came like a whirlwind , and we three were in it As men are in whirlwinds . It came like the thunder , With a crash and a roar and a long running rumble Dying down into silence . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that fled wildly backward ; And Henry and I , when it passed , were left standing By the body of him whose name was Jack Whitcomb , Who lay as he fell , when headlong he tumbled , His rifle still clinched and both barrels smoking . I have seen in my life many wounds made by bullets , And a good many gashes by spear-points and arrows . I have learned in my trailing a good many simples Which have power to keep men from crossing the river Before the Lord calls with voice that is certain . And the wound that we found on Jack Whitcomb 's body , Though ugly and deep , was not beyond curing . We cleansed and we stanched it and fought a brave battle With death , for his life , and we won . For Jack mended . We made a canoe and we bore him far southward . A hundred good miles down the river we boated , Till we came to his house of huge logs , strongly builded , Beneath the big pines on the bank of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown water . ' T was a place to bring peace to a heart that was troubled , If peace might be found this side of the silence Which brings peace to all that know sorrow in living . Yes , we boated him down to his home by the rapids . His home ? No , rather his house let us call it . For how can a house be a home with naught in it ? In house that is home must be love , warm and human , A voice that is sweet , a heart that is gentle , A soul that is true , and beside these a cradle That prattles and coos ; and the quick-falling patter Of little white feet that run hither and thither . To his house , and not to his home , then , we brought him , For certainly nothing and no one was in it , Save himself and a dog , a bed and a table , Some chairs , a few books , and a  --  Picture . And this was the story that he told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond doubt , had he cared to . But he did n't . No motive , he said . And he had none , As we felt later on , when he told us his story . So he died without word or sign . And in silence We stood and saw him go forth on his journey Without speaking a word , without a hand lifted To hold or to stop him , for we did not feel certain What was wisdom for one who went forth in such fashion . Perhaps it was best he should go and be over With pain , loss and trouble for ever and ever . Henry says , it were well we should all of us go When life has no aim and no hope ; and no doing Remains to be done ; and days are but eating And drinking and breathing , only these and no more . But before he went forth he gave me a message . " I loved her , " so his story began . Henry , You remember the look on his face as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast on the Picture ? " She was strong , and she drew me as life draws the young And as death draws the old . I could not resist her . She was vital with force , to attract and to hold . She raced me a race for my life , and she won it . I was man , not a boy , and I loved as man loves When the forces of life are in him full-flooded As rivers in meadows , when they flow to the sedges . Did she love me ? Perhaps . Who can tell ? She was woman , And hence she was dark as the night , and as hidden ! Who could find her ? Who the depth of her nature Might measure ? I tried but could not . Then boldly I spake  --  spake as man speaks but once unto woman . True and straight did I say it man fashion . But she drew back offended ; she shrank from my praying , And with coldness of tone and suspicion dismissed me . Had a man shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face , he or I would have died on the instant . But what can a man do , when scorned by a woman ? So I left her . I need not say more . My life it was ended . It was n't worth living ;  --  I am made in that fashion . So I came to the woods . Where else when in trouble Can man go and find what he needs , consolation ? Go you down to her house , in the city , John Norton , To the house where she lives , and give her this message . Word for word let her hear it ,  --  say where you left me . There 's gold in that box to pay your expenses . Word for word as I tell you , nor say a word further . " Then he bade us good-by , and marched away bravely , As a man on a trail that is somewhat uncertain . And under the pines on the bank of the rapids We buried the man whom the woods called  --  Jack Whitcomb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bosom . * * * * * I went down to her house in the city . A cabin Of stone , brown as tamarack bark , trimmed with olive . It was high as a pine that stands on a mountain . The door was as wide as the mouth of a cavern . At the door stood a man rigged up like a soldier ; His face was as solemn as judgment to sinners ; He looked at me some , and I looked him all over , Then he suddenly bowed like a half-breed with manners , And told me to enter , and he would call Madame . The room was as large as a town house where settlers Hold meetings to vote themselves office and wages . The walls were like caves in far Arizona . All covered with pictures of houses and battles ; Of ships blown onward by gales in mid-ocean ; Of children with wings , pretty queer-looking creatures ; Of men and of women , and some were half-naked . But the floor was of oak , which gleamed like a polish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skins it was covered , So I felt quite at home , as there I stood looking , And noting the size and signs of the cabin . Then , all of a sudden , there came a soft rustle , Like the rustle of leaves when the wind blows in autumn . And down the wide stairway across the great hall , To the door of the room in which I was standing , Stately and swift , came a woman and entered . Tall as the tallest . Made firmly , knit firmly Both in form and in limb , but full and well rounded ; Dark of eye , dark of face , with hair like a raven , Like the girls of Nevada , where live the old races , Whose blood is as fire , and whose skin is of olive , Whose mouths are as sweet as a fig when it ripens . Arms bare to the shoulders . Neck and bosom uncovered . Her gown of white satin gleamed and flowed downward And round her in folds of soft , creamy whiteness . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a circle Of gold round her throat . One armlet of silver , And one at her wrist loosely clasped , small and slender . So she entered and stood , and looked me all over . Then slowly she spake . " Your name , sir , and business ? " " Madame , " I said , " in the woods men call me John Norton ; John Norton , the Trapper . " Then I stopped mighty sudden , For her face it grew white to the lips and the chin , And she swayed as a tree to the stroke of the chopper When he sinks his axe in to the heart and it totters And quivers . So I stopped , stopped quick and stood looking . Then her dark face it lighted , and she said , speaking quickly : " John Norton , I know you . I know you are honest . You live in the woods . You are good . I can trust you . All men , I have heard , come to you in their trouble . Have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woods , Has there come to your cabin a man , tall as you , Brave as you and as tender ? A man like to this ? " And out of her gown , from the folds on her bosom , She lifted a locket of pearl-colored velvet , Touched a spring , and I saw , as the lid of it opened , The face of the man I and Henry had buried ! " John Norton , " she cried , and her eyes burned like fever . Her hand shook and trembled , her face was as marble , " Have you seen in the woods man like to this picture ? Speak quick and speak true as to woman in trouble . For I did him great wrong , I thought he held lightly My fair name and fame ; held lightly my honor . I thought he meant evil , and my heart , filled with anger , Dismissed him in scorn ; but I learned , I learned later , He was true , and spake truth and loved me as heaven . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steady , So it gave her no sign of what I was thinking . I saw she was honest , and I wished then to spare her , But my word it was pledged , pledged to him in dying , To stand as I stood , face to face with this woman , In her house , in that room , and give her his message . Beside , not to know is far worse than the knowing At times . So I rallied and told her the message , Word for word , as he charged , the night he lay dying In his house on the bank above the swift rapids . " Madame , " I said , " I have seen man like that picture , Face and form . He was brave as you say . He was tender . He was true unto death , and he loved you as heaven . And these are the words that he sent you in dying . I , a man of the woods , bring you this as last message , From one who now sleeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which pours its brown water To the Lake of St. John from far Mistassinni . ' Tell her , John Norton , I loved her . Loved her in living , With a love that was true , and with same love in dying . Loved her like a man , like a saint , like a sinner , For time now and time ever . That the one picture She gave me I kept ;  --  living , dying , and after . That it lies on the breast of the man that you buried ; On the breast of the man who living did love her , And that there it will lie until it shall crumble , With heart underneath it , to dust . So tell her . And in proof that I tell her the truth , and did tell it The night when we met , and I told her I loved her , Give her this , the watch that I wore on the evening We met , and the evening we parted . Let her open And see . With her eyes let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more . " Thus I spake . Word for word as he told me I spake . I gave her the watch , and I said no word further . I had done as I pledged , I had said as he charged me , So I stopped and stood waiting for word of dismissal . But she said not a word , nor made she a sign . The watch she took from me , touched the spring and it opened , And there , ' twixt the glass and the gold , withered and faded , Lay a leaf of Red Rose . One leaf , and  --  no more . For a moment she stood ; stood , and gazed at the leaf , Her face grew as white as her gown , and she trembled And shook like a white swan in dying , then she cried , " My God , I have killed him , my lover ! " And down on the floor , on the skins at her feet She dropped as one stricken by bullet or lightning . It was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred good miles across to the rapids . For we wanted to see before going northward If evil had come to the grave of our comrade . But the grave lay untouched , by beast or by human . The grass on the mound was well rooted and growthful . At the foot of the grave the rose-tree I planted Was as high as my head . And the leaves of the roses Lay as thick as red snow-flakes on the mound that was under . And we knew that on breast , as he slept , was her picture . So we felt , as we gazed , it was well with Jack Whitcomb . But often at night , when alone in my cabin , I hear the low murmur of far northern rapids . And often I see the great house and its splendor , And wonder if death has helped the proud woman To lay off her grief and escape from her sorrow . And blazed a line through the dark Valley of Shadow , And brought her in peace to the edge of the clearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , waiting . So I say it again , and I say it with knowledge , That the woods have their sorrows as well as the cities . And he knows but little of this great northern forest Who thinks there 's naught in it save trees , lakes , and mountains .
