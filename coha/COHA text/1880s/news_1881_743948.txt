txt No part of the report of the tenth census will be more attentively studied than that which relates to the South , and none will better repay study . There is an increasing demand for accurate information in regard to the present industrial condition and prospects of the Southern States , and the Census Bureau has been at great pains to gather this information and prepare it for publication . The " extra bulletin " on the cotton production of Louisiana gives a foretaste of the varied and carefully arranged store of facts ' which the completed report will contain . Besides the tabulated results of the enumeration , this bulletin , which is a quarto pamphlet of 100 pages , gives an outline of the physical geography of the State , a careful description of the several agricultural regions , with analyses of soils , a treatise on the alluvial plain of the Mississippi below the mouth of the Ohio , accompanied with an excellent colored map , a short account of the main features of the several parishes , and a mass of information upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing the results of various kinds of tillage and cultivation , the wages and condition of laborers , the nature of the risks and insect enemies of the crop , the price and rent of land , the cost per pound , and the profits of cotton-growing . It can readily be seen that reports of this kind for all the cotton States will be of immense value to any one having an interest , present or prospective , in the production of that staple or in any business based on it . The plan is to be extended and varied somewhat in its application to other States . The Mississippi report , for instance , will contain a general discussion of the utility and interpretation of soil analysis . Altogether the report of this census will be , it is safe to say , much more elaborate and careful than any of its predecessors . sacrifices all other considerations to getting the largest return with the smallest outlay , and the majority of the landlords are satisfied with this . Most of the negro tenants sell the cotton-seed , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard for the value of his farm , would use as a fertilizer , or a portion of it at least . Very few of the negro laborers have as yet become the owners of the land they till or the houses they live in . Last of all comes in the pernicious credit system , coupled with heavy commissions for selling and shipping , which together reduce the profits of both owner and laborer to a pittance or wholly extinguish them . In some parishes three-fourths of the crops are pledged in advance for supplies furnished . All classes favor the system , though acknowledging that it is the greatest evil they have to struggle against . The cost of production is variously estimated at from $15 to $20 per bale , though two parishes report a cost of $30 per bale . An estimate for Bossier Parish for 30 acres of land gives a ' return of 6,000 pounds of clean cotton , of  --  which the planter 's half , worth 10 cents per pound at the gin , would fetch $300 , having cost him but $130 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly be improved on . With the sounder methods of cultivation now being slowly introduced , cotton-raising must become a more profitable occupation everywhere in the South . This Louisiana cotton bulletin throws a great deal of light upon the manner in which agriculture is carried on in that State , and taken in connection with the regular bulletin ( No. 251 ) on the cotton production of the whole Union , it shows the defects of the Southern system of farming . The highest product per acre is found in the Yazoo bottom , in the State of Mississippi , where the average is 413 pounds , or 0.87 of a bale per acre , even with the present imperfect tillage and slov- , enly picking . With a better - system of farming , and the reclamation of about 3,000,000 acres which the river is at present allowed to overflow , the State of Mississippi alone would be able to raise the entire crop now grown in the whole ' South , which in 1879 amounted to 5.737,257 bales . in most of the cotton-growing States the amount of fertilizers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the soil as an inexhaustible natural bank on which they ' , . can draw till the end of time without ever making any deposits . The planters of the two Carolinas , and to a lesser extent those of Georgia , are just learning that it pays to enrich the soil of their plantations with something stronger than moonshine , which is the favorite fertilizer in other States , and the result is apparent in their increasing production per acre , which already approaches that of Mississippi , though the soil is not by nature so well adapted to the plant as in the river States . In Louisiana the practice of applying cotton-seed as a fertilizer is reported in some parishes , but green manuring is rarely resorted to . Another of the causes which keep the product of the soil far below its natural capacity is the frequent neglect to arrange a proper rotation of crops . The land is cropped with cotton until it no longer contains the elements of fertility required for that plant , and then a crop of peas is sowed and plowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before the exhausted vitality of the land is restored . The tillage is everywhere imperfect . The plowing is too shallow , leaving the rich subsoil untouched , and exposing the fields to bad washing in the Winter rains . In only a small proportion of the parishes are supplies raised at home . They come mostly from New-Orleans , St. Louis , and even from New-York . The tendency toward the raising of home supplies is reported to be increasing , however , and the practice will no doubt become general , as it will materially diminish the expenses chargeable against the price of the crop , though in Morehouse Parish the practice is reported to be decreasing " on account of the habit among the negroes of stealing swine . " The laborers are mostly negroes , of course , though in those parishes Where whites are to be had they are much preferred . The prevalent system of working cotton farms is r on shares , and it is unqualifiedly vicious . The - owner furnishes teams , tool , seed , ' and all material except food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the laborer ; or , on some plantations , onefourth of the crop is paid for landrent , and the laborer furnishes the stock , tools , &c.; Under this system the soil inevitably deteriorates .
