txt The Senate yesterday passed a bill regulating the counting of the Electoral votes . It is the bill reported from the committee , and , without amendment , almost without discussion , it was passed without calling the roll . When we recall the bitter controversy , the prolonged and angry debates , the obstinate contention mingled with threats of violence to which this subject has given rise , such an incident as that of yesterday may be regarded with satisfaction and with some degree of surprise . The bill is substantially the same as that which was introduced by Senator EDMVNDS two years ago , and that gentleman will learn with just satisfaction the final triumph in the Senate of the principles for which he contended so long and with such marked ability . The underlying principle of the bill is that upon which Republicans have happily been agreed ever since the question became an urgent one in the Autumn of 1876 , that each State should settle any doubt or dispute that may arise as to the Electors who are entitled to cast its Electoral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which can only with violent straining be interpreted as conferring upon the houses of Congress or upon either of them the right to decide a dispute of this character . The trouble which has arisen in connection with the matter has had its origin in the difficulty of securing a practical application of this principle in the absence of any distinct declaratory legislation by Congress . That difficulty is removed by the Senate bill . It recognizes in each State the right to determine , prior to the meeting of the Electors on the second Monday in January , in a manner pursuant to laws existing on the day fixed for the appointment of the Electors , any controversy that may arise concerning the appointment of all or any of them . This determination , it will be noted , must be made in accordance with some pre-established law , and not according to any measure devised to meet the particular case . Once made in this way , the Senate bill requires that such determination shall be conclusive evidence of the lawful title of the Electors and shall govern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a law , as there is every reason to expect that it will , there will be ample time for any State that may now lack the necessary legislation for such determination to provide it . There will also be every inducement for such provision . If it be not made , the State will run the risk of disfranchisement , for the bill further requires that where there shall bo more than one set of Electoral votes from any State , and there shall be no determination of the title of the Electors in the manner described , only a concurrent vote of the two houses acting separately can secure the counting of either set of votes . This bill , therefore , does all that it is practicable to do to secure to the States the right to determine each for itself any dispute as to its vote . If there shall be a decision from more than one tribunal in any State purporting to be the tribunal entitled , under the laws of the State , to decide disputes as to the Electoral vote , then that decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concurrently decide to be made by the lawful tribunal . This adds to the inducements held out to each State to settle any controversy conclusively , as , in case of a disputed State decision , the State incurs the danger of disfranchisement . It will thus be seen that everything in the Senate bill tends to strengthen the authority of the individual States , to secure its conclusive and efficient exercise , and to prevent any interference with it by Congress or either house of Congress . The same purpose is carried out in the provision of the bill that in any case where there is but one set of votes received from any State , it can not be rejected except by the separate concurrent action of both houses . Unquestionably , this is on the whole the most practical and effective arrangement that can be made to meet the difficulties which can now be foreseen . It was so understood by Senators of both parties , as is shown by the remarks of . Mr. PUGH and of Mr. MORGAN . But it is not to be denied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet , and Mr. MORGAN is quite sustained by the facts in his assertion that the whole subject can only be properly and adequately disposed of by a constitutional amendment . The system by which the President and Vice-President are chosen is , in its entirety , an anomaly and an anachronism . It was not devised for the actual work which it has to perform . It was not intended to operate as it does , but la a manner radically different , for a wholly different purpose , and to carry out entirely different ideas . To conform the process to the present requirements must always be a difficult and delicate task , demanding at times a great deal of restraint , judgment , and unselfish patriotism in the persons intrusted with its administration . That we have got along with it so well as we have done is a striking proof of that practical political capacity which has been shown in the highest degree only by English-speaking peoples , and yet which is the absolute condition to the peaceful and safe working of representative institutions .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
