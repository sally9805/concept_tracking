The whole system which has fostered the abuses complained  --  of and led to a corrupt ex- , ercise of power for personal and political profit should be swept away . The fees ought to be abolished and the Health . Officer should be paid by the State for the performance of all the legitimate duties of his position , but to offset in part the expense of the new arrangement , and to preclude all possibility of a continuance of the corrupt and harassing policy that has been exposed , the commission should go . Not simply because it has abused its powers , which would only be a reason for chang-ing its membership , but because-there is no really-useful purpose for it to serve . There - should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Officer ; otherwise he might , in the- exercise of an autocratic power , continue and even multiply profitable abuses . But that appeal should be to -a competent ' body with ? no possible interest in the incidental work of the Quarantine establishment , and a body well adapted to the purposenxists  --  n the State Board- of Health . The-legislation - needed ? is fairly embodled in the bill introduced in the Assembly - t. by Mr. HAMILTON , ? to which  --  a ' brief pro- ? vision may readily ' be added for an appeal from decisions of the Health , Officer to the-State Board of Health .

The reform should be thorough and complete . The only real obstacle in its way is the political power which Commissioner PLAT ; Health Officer Sum , and their associates are supposed to wield . The members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider-how small that . power would be after these menhad been driven from their intrenchments in the Quarantine service , and how much greater advantage can be.gained by a courageous . performance of public duty than from truckling to a discredited clique-of wirepullers . The . Republican majority should recognize the emphatic demand for putting an end to corruptions and abuses in the public-service and the establishment of a new and decent order of things . If they can get the ' - credit of answering thisdemand it will be-a source of strength to them and to the party in this State . 1434.1f-way work with the Quarantine service will ? not answer the purpose . It should be reformed altogether . REFORM IT ALTOGETHER . The bill introduced in the State Senate by Mr. GRISWOLD abolishing quarantine fees and placing the Health Officer of this port on a salary has been vigorously pushed forward , and to some extent the approval of the mercantile community here has been secured for it . Before it goes any further careful consideration should be given to the effect of a halfway measure like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain amount of exactions in the shape of fees for quarantine service , but it would leave the useless Quarantine Commission , which costs the State something like $16,000 , and would not touch the indirect exactions of the Quarantine ring carried on through such devices as the disinfecting company , which.are more annoying and burdensome than the regular quarantine charges . The cost of the Health Office , which is placed at $21,000 a year in the bill , would be added to that of the Quarantine Commission , and the latter would be left unshorn of its power for mischief and still devoid of any useful function . The commission was created at a time when the-whole Quarantine establishment had to be renewed in the Lower Bay . Its original purpose was to create the establishment and put it in running order . Subsequently it was empowered to make the quarantine regulations , to supervise the service , and to decide appeals from the Health Officer . When the system was filly established the commission virtually became a costly figurehead . The Health Officer , if competent for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary foran efficient service , and he must of necessity be charged with the power of enforcing the regulations . All this was so far a practical necessity that , the official duties of the commission years ago became merely nominal , and its members devoted themselves largely to making the Health Office , with its plethoric income , serviceable in politics . The first notable instance for years of an appeal to - the board from a decision of the Health Officer was in the case of the disinfection of rags . Then it was found that the Quarantine ring , including the Health Officer and two of the Commissioners , was reputed to be interested in the disinfecting monopoly , and disposed to use it to extort an enormous tribute from an important branch of - commerce , regardless of any necessity shown for the disinfecting process . Now , if a law is passed merely abolishing fees and leaving the Quarantine ring in full power the commerce of this port will still be subject to its indirect exactions , and it will be encouraged by the failure to dislodge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than ever
