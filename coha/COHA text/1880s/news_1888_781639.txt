txt Mr. WILLIAM P. FISHBACK , a former law partner of Mr. HARRISON , a schoolmate and a life-long friend , contributes to the Evening Post a very long article " depicting " the President-elect . The picture is skillfully and . agreeably drawn , with the fidelity of a realist and the trained judgment of an artist who understands values . There is a wide ? background of pleasant but not too sharply-defined details as to school and . college life , and a most varied and not highly important law practice , against which , before leaving the canvas , Mr. FISHBACK paints in vigorous , though reserved fashion , the significant features of the character of our next President . The whole justifies the author 's statement that he has " endeavored to deal fairly and frankly " with his subject , and . certainly no one can accuse him of flattery , " He is , " says Mr. FISHBACK of MT . HARRISON . " a strong partisan , and has always been so since he began to vote the Republican ticket in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held a brief for his party , and has served it with the unswerving fidelity which has always characterized his devotion to a client who committed his life or fortune to his hands . " " At its worst he has alivays believed that Republicanism is better than Democracy at its best . " So much for his partisanship , which Mr. FISHBACK , however , believes will not prevent him from being " a just magistrate . " " To the friends of civil service reform , " says Mr. HARRISON 'S old friend , " it isperhaps enough to say that Gen. HARRISON has the good lawyer 's instinctive respect for the law . Whatever laws exist will be enforced in letter and spirit . He knows what the functions of the Chief Executive are under the Constitution , and while he will assert his authority to preserve the rights and . dignity of his office he will recognize the fact that the will of the people as expressed through their Senators and Representatives in.Congress is the directing done in all matters of public policy . " This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reform " to give them a very clear idea of what they may hope for from Mr. HARRISON . It is certainly not " enough " to excite their hopes extravagantly . Mr. HARRISON may enforce the civil service law in letter , and even , in a sense , in spirit , and yet defeat it dismally . Without violating one of its provisions , without exposing himself to the charge of evading them , he has simply to put men in the chief places of the service who do not care to make the operation of the law thorough , exact , and effective in order to make it practically a dead . letter . It is upon the extent to which he does this , and upon the extent to which he selects men able and willing to so administer the law that it shall do what it was meant to do , that the real influence of the President upon the reform will depend . On that point we may , with our knowledge of Mr. HARRISON 'S career in the Senate , be . permitted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes to draw the President-elect in his relations to the question of tariff reform he is more pronounced . and even less flattering . Two points he emphasizes  --  one the statement by Mr. HARRISON that the advocates of tariff reform were " students of maxims and not of markets . " This his old friend regards as " a slur , " and . quietly acids : " He lowered . his tone somewhat in this and gave a note of provinciality . " The tone of the remark is clearly low , but we do not recall any other of Mr. HARRISON 'S on the same subject that was much higher . It is clearly " provincial , " but we do not remember anything broader or more nearly national . Mr. FISHBACK 'S second point of emphasis is the fact that " Gen. HARRISON has recently said that Ale holds his views on matters of public policy subject to modification , " and on this Mr. FISHBACK remarks : " The friends of reform who distrust the Democratic Party and stood by the Republican Party during the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they ' believed that the party and the candidate were better than the platform , have reason to hope that they will have a fair hearing and considerate treatment when they come to urge upon a Republican Congress the propriety of marked reductions in the customs duties in the interests of the people . " This is ingenious . It looks on the face of it cheerful and even encouraging , but as the best a revenue-reform supporter can say of Mr. HARRISON it is rather gloomy . Because Mr. HARRISON has uttered the vague generality that he holds his views " subject to modification , " the revenue reformers have reason to hope that they will get a fair hearing and . considerate treatment . From whom ? From Mr. HARRISON ? Not at all ; from " a Republican Congress . " We congratulate Mr. FISHBACK , not on the hopes he entertains  --  they are obviously not substantial or confident  --  but on the skill with which he has performed the difficult task he has assumed . His " old friend " and the subject of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has done his work . If , after all , the impression left upon the mind . of a careful critic is that Mr. HARRISON iS a narrow partisan , not very well informed , conscientiously obstinate and liable , in good faith , to perpetuate and aggravate some of the worst features of the policy and spirit of his party , it is not the fault of Mr. FISHBACK . It is the fault of Mr. HARRISON and the facts .
