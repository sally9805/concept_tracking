Liverpool reported another decline of lid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller , and prices at the stock yards were quoted firmer . This led a good many people to think that to bottom bad been struck on produce for the present , and they filled in snorts very freely . Several purchases were made on outside account , New-Orleans parties being mentioned as among leading buyers . Some parties expressed the belief that hogs will go to 85 before the holidays , which would mean much lower prices for pork than now , but they said that a further decline now is scarcely possible witn the present excitement in corn , and the conditions are favorable to Maher prices .
