txt It is reported that the Liberals were somewhat disappointed at the size of the majority against Mr. - PARNELL 'S bill . The vote Was nearly in the ratio of three to two . It seems , however , that the surprising thing is that the vote in favor of such a proposition should have been so large as it was . There were obvious objections to the bill , some of which we pointed out a few days ago . It was not made a strictly party question , and Mr. GLADSTONE , who returned from the Continent to make a speech upon it , was careful to give it only a carefully guarded and limited support . Until the introduction of Mr. GLADSTONE 'S own Land bill , five years ago , one would have said . that of all Governments that which could be relied upon most haplicitly to refrain from any interference with the freedom of contract , and to limit legislation upon such subjects to the enforcement of contracts , was the Government of Great Britain . The proposition that an interference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is always unwarrantable and mischievous has been for more than one generation held and acted upon as an axiom in British politics and by British politicians of all sects . The Irish Land bill set the precedent of treating the rights of Irishmen to their property and the obligations of Irishmen to their own agreements as different in kind from the rights and obligations of British subjects in other parts of the United Kingdom . Special tribunals were devised to as- , certain the difference between " rack rents " or the rents that tenants had agreed to pay , and " fair rents , " whatever that might mean , . presumably a compromise of some kind between the rents they had agreed to pay and the rents they subsequently avowed their willingness to pay . When legislation of - this kind begins to be , enacted it is not easy to draw the line at - which it shall stop . Mr. PARNELL 'S bill is an extension of Mr. GLADSTONE 'S , but it is. a legitimate offspring of it . Mr. PARNELL 'S bill proceeded . upon the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Land act , these rents being reduced from those fixed by the agreement of landlords and tenants , were still too high to be " fair rents , " and that the tenants should not be asked . to pay them . In all . cases in which the tenants offered . half the judicial rents the bill provided that they should not be evicted , or , in other words , that Irish tenants might continue to occupy their holdings at half rents . It is remarkable that two-fifths of the members of the House of Commons present and voting should have been found to vote in favor of such a measure as this . The vote is a declaration that the rights of an Irish landlord are less than those of a Scotch or a Welsh or an English landlord , and that he holds his property subject to total or partial confiscation byact of Parliament . Such a declaration has its value as an admission that the Irish people have a grievance against their conquerors . That is true enough , but the notion that their grievance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of interfering:between the parties to a contract when it thinks that one of them has made a bad bargain is unworthy of men of sense .
