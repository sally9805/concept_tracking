txt The criticisms of the New-York papers on Judge Auger 's order in the Sharp case and the bringing in of the name of James J. Belden in connection with the affair is the general theme of conversation among lawyers in Syracuse , as well as among the friends of these two prominent Syraeusans . Louis Marshall , a fernier law partner of Judge Auger , speaks as follows regarding the Judge 's famous stay in the Sharp ease : " The situation is simply this : Jacob Sharp has been tried , and after a long trial , in which numerous questious of law of the most novel character arose , was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment . Au appeal was taken from this decision to the General Term , and that court , after a few days ' consideration of a record covering several thousand printed pages , affirmed the conviction . The defendant had the legal right to appeal from this determination to the Court of Appeals , and ho has availed himSelf of this privilege . What is sought to be obtained by this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial court was erroneous , and that it should not be executed . Now , unless the proceedings under that judgment are stayed until the questions involved upon the appeal are determined by the appellate court , the defendant would , in case of a re%ersal of the judgment of the trial court , have undergone the punishment declared by the appellate court to have been unauthorized , and the defendant would have no redress whatever . To avoid this apparent injustice , provision has been made by the code of criminal procedure that , in ease reasonable doubt exists whether the judgment should stand , a stay of proceedings to stay toe execution of the judgment may be granted by either a Judge of the appellate court or a Judge of the court from which the appeal is taken , and this is what Judge Eager has done . He has simply granted a stay of proceedings , by which Sharp is retained in Ludlow-Street Jail until his appeal is disposed of by the Court of Appeals . " " There is not only authority for , the practice pursued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is provided by section 528 of the Code of Criminal Procedure that an appeal to the Court of Appeals from hjudgment of the Supreme Court affirming a judgment of conviction stays the execution or the judgment appealed from on filing with the notice of appeal a certificate of a Judge of the Court of Appeals or of the Supreme Court that in his opinion . there is reasonable doubt whether the judgment should stand . And by section 529 , immediately following , it is provided that this certificate can not be granted upon a conviction for felony until such notice as the Judge may prescribe has been given to the District Attorney of the county whore the conviction was had of the application for a certificate , but , continues the statute , the Judge may stay the execution of judgment iu the meantime . In the Sharp ease , atter an appeal was taken to the Court of Appeals , an application was made for such a certificate and Chief-Judge Auger required a notice of five days to be given to the District Attorney of New-York of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgment . Not only does the statute give this authority , but before its adoption the power was frequently exercised , and it is safe to say that no appeal was ever taken in a capital case , before the code was so amended as to make an appeal in such a case operate as a stay , in which Judges of the Court of Appeals or of the Supreme Court did not grant a stay of proceedings . Such stays were granted , if my recollection serves me right , in the Lindsey and Greenfield cases by Judge Andrews . " I not only think that the stay should have been granted , but I believe that the act of ChiefJudge Auger in granting it Is the bravest and most commendable judicial action that has taken place in many , years in the judicial history of this State . It seems to me. that the press is encroaching to a most dangerous extent upon the administration of justice ; that eases are prejudged by newspapers ; that a popular sentiment is sought to be created in public cases , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sought to tie railroaded to State prison or to the gallows , and the person accused of crime , iustead of receiving toe benefit of every doubt , is presumed to be guilty until he has succeeded ' in establishing his innocence to a jury which has been prejudiced against him by a systematic newspaper prosecution . If a wan is guilty of a crime the courts will , 99 times out of 100. do their duty , and the press is not required for the purpose of meting out punishment or of creating a sentiment against him . Neither does it perform a proper service if it seeks to intimidate the judiciary , the members of which . have taken the constitutional oath of office , and are liable to impeachment if they are guilty of a breach of its provisions . But it seems now that if a man accused of a public crime attempts to take the roost usual steps for the purpose of protecting his rights by a resort to well recognized legal methods , the entire press unites in a howl of rage and acts like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time that some action should be taken to correct this evil , which is but another form of Anarchy . If those who are now so indignant at the exercise of a judicial act , so clearly authorized , should happen to be placed In the position of defendant in a criminal proceeding , they would probably sing another song . In a civil ease , in which a judgment of more than $500 is involved , the defeated party has the right of appealing to the Court of Appeals , and of staying all proceedings against Him until the final determination of the action in the appellate court . So whatever the court may ultimately do is not involved . In the present controversy the question is one of principle , and it is a disgrace that respectable newspapers should be permitted to make personal attacks upon a Judge who simply does his duty . " The charge that James J. Belden may haVe influenced Chief-Judge Auger iu granting the Sharp stay of proceedings is regarded as preposterous by those acquainted with the relations between those two gentlemen . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have not been on friendly terms with each other . It is true that Judge Auger was Mr. Belden 's atter. nay in the canal cases , but after his connection with those cases ceased they became involved iu a personal litigation , which was bitterly contested through to the Court of Appeals , as can be verified by reference to the 91 New-York Reports , page 646.
