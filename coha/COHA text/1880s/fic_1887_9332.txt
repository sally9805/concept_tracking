Main text Footnote 1 : 1Kb I. Before Prospero 's cell . Moonlight . Ariel . Ariel . So  --  Prospero is gone  --  and I am free  --  Free , free at last . His latest charge have I Performed with duteous care ; have sent the breeze To blow behind the ship whose rounded sails Now bear him homeward ; and I am alone . Yet I , who pined for freedom  --  I , who served This lordly mind , not of my own free choice , Though somewhat out of gratitude ,  --  for he By his strong sorcery did release me once From durance horrible ,  --  now , since the touch And sympathy of human souls have warmed My cold electric blood , and I have known How sweet it were to love and be beloved Within the circle of the elements Whose soulless life is death to human hearts ,  --  I , here alone , now grieve to be alone , No longer linked with mortal loves and cares . For as I flit about the ocean caves , Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flower-bells dream long sunny days , Or run upon the crested waves , or flash At no one 's bidding , but in wild caprice , A trailing meteor or a thunderbolt ,  --  Or sing along the breeze that hath no sense Or soul of hearing , melodies I framed For Prospero and his child ,  --  I have no will To work as once , when serving earned this boon Of liberty , long sought , now tame and cheap . For what to me are all these air-fed sprites I marshalled , by his potent art constrained ? Their bloodless cold companionship can give No joy to me , now half estranged from them . There ' s Caliban , ' t is true  --  a human beast  --  Uncouth enough to laugh at  --  not so vile Perhaps as he appears  --  rather misshaped And thwarted in his growth . And yet he seems In this fair Isle , where noble souls have lived , Like a dull worm that trails its slime along The full heart of a rose ; and now at last Free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to himself , crawls feeding where he lists . Enter Caliban in the distance . Lo , here he creeps , and looks as if he meant To enter his old master 's cell . But no ! I 'll enter first , and there assume the voice Of Prospero . He some sport at least shall yield . Ah , sometimes I must be a merry sprite , If only to beguile these lonesome hours . Vanishes into the cell . Caliban . Caliban . So  --  so  --  the island ' s mine now . I may make My dwelling where I choose . Methinks this cell Might serve ; though somewhat I suspect Its walls are steeped in magic . And besides , Too well my bones remember how that lord Let fly his spirits at me . How he cramped My limbs ! The devil-fish o'ertake his ship ! He ' s far away  --  and I can curse him now , And no more aches shall follow . As for him , Yon drunken fellow  --  and his mate  --  good Lord , How I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moon , forsooth ! And yet he bore Brave liquor , though it set my wits agog . Would there were more of it . Well , I 'll make my bed E'en here , where Prosper slept . King of the isle  --  King Caliban ! But I 've no subjects yet , Save beasts of the wood , and even over them I lack those strong old charms of Sycorax . Enters the cell . Ariel Ariel sings . Halt there ! What man art thou ? Slave  --  Caliban ! Caliban . Caliban . Ah , ah ! ' T is Prospero back again  --  Ah me ! Ariel . Ariel . How dar'st thou here intrude upon my rest ? Caliban . Caliban . Nay now  --  I can not tell  --  I thought thee gone  --  I saw thee go . Ariel . Ariel . Think'st thou I can not leap Across the seas ? Think'st thou I can not ride Upon the wind ? Know'st thou not Prosper 's might ? Caliban . Caliban . Do not torment me ! Alas , alas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at sea ! Ah , here ' s a coil  --  here ' s slavery again . I 'll run , before the cramp gets to my legs . Exit . Ariel Ariel sings . Good riddance ! He 'll not venture here again . This grot is sacred to remembered forms ' T were base ingratitude could I forget . Their names make fragrant all the place . They fill The void of life within me more and more , And draw me closer to all human-kind . Much have ye taught me . Thou , O Prospero , Whom all too grudgingly I served , dost seem Now not a master , but a gracious friend . And she  --  Miranda , peerless in her bloom Of maidenhood  --  had I but human been , What tenderer germs  --  but no  --  too late , too late Those virtues , graces  --  this proud intellect That made a sport of magic , and renounced The sceptre of Wonderland as though it were The bauble of a child . Too late I see The topmost glory of the Duke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgiving his base foes . ( Pauses in deep thought . ) There is no life worth living but that life I missed , the sympathetic interchange Of mind with mind and heart with heart . This world Of air and fire and water , where I dwell , Is but a realm of phantasms  --  spectral flames Like the pale streamers of the frozen North ; Is less than half of life  --  motion without Life 's warm reality  --  a trance , a dream . Nay , even this slave  --  this son of Sycorax Hath something human in him . Might I now But find some passage to his heart , but breathe Into his sluggish brain some finer breath , But lift him to companionship of thought  --  ' T were worth the trial . At least I 'll follow him And wind about him with an airy song . He ' s fond of music , for whene'er I sing He listens open-mouthed . He ' s not so bad But some ethereal trap may snare him yet . ( Sings . ) I , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the enchanted Isle . But no more the master 's smile Greets me as his door I pass ; I shall hear no more , alas ! Hear no more the magic word Of the seer who was my lord  --  Nevermore ! Nevermore my flying feet Bring him music strange and sweet , Run for him upon the wind , While the cloven air behind Meets with roar and thunder-crack In the lightning of my track  --  Nevermore ! Enter Caliban , listening . Caliban . Caliban . This might be one of them . Full oft I hear Their music in the air . And yet he lies , And is a devil of Prospero 's , for he hints That Prosper ' s gone : and yet I heard his voice . And yet that voice might be a mimicry . Good Moon , assist me . Tell me , friendly Moon , Is Prospero gone ? Tell me , good Man i ' the Moon , He will not pinch me again . Ariel . Ariel . Nay , doubt not , friend . He ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my bones ! What voice art thou ? For nothing can I see But stars , and moonlight twinklings in the woods , And black broad shadows of the trembling trees , And here and there a fluttering zigzag bat . Ariel . Ariel . I hover in the moonbeam overhead . Caliban . Caliban . I think I 've heard thee sing and talk before . Did Prosper leave thee here to govern us , And sing us into pitfalls with thy lies And lying songs ? And yet how sweet thou singest ! Come , show thyself  --  I think thou'rt not a fiend . Ariel . Ariel . I 'll show myself anon . But do not fear . Prosper is gone . A lonely spirit am I Seeking companionship . I 'd talk with thee . Caliban . Caliban . Good  --  an ' thou talkest sense , and wilt not bite Or hunt me  --  nor dost bid me bring thee logs . Ariel . Ariel . I have no need of fuel , nor of food Nor dwelling , nay , not even of bodily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I choose . Caliban . Caliban . Then prythee do . I fain would see thee , friend . I like it not , this talking to the air . Ariel . Ariel . I 'll humor thee if I can be thy friend . What shape shall I assume ? Caliban . Caliban . Why , any shape But Prospero 's  --  and I 'll shake thee by the hand , And swear thou art as merry a fellow as e'er I have sat cracking nuts with  --  in my dreams  --  For wide awake I ne'er encountered such . Nay , this seems like a dream . Perchance it is  --  And I asleep , and babbling in my sleep  --  And Prospero still lord of all the Isle . Ariel . Ariel . Nay , all is real . I tell thee he has gone . Follow me now to yonder cave , where laps The sleepy sea upon the pebbled shore , Smoothing the flickering wrinkles of the moon , Who steeps her golden column in the brine . There will I meet thee in a human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I but see your face . You are no Jack-o ' - lantern , I believe . I know thee not , but something tells me true That I may trust thee . Sing then . I will follow . Exeunt , Ariel singing . Song . Follow , follow , Down the deep hollow  --  Down to the moonlit waves , Down where the ocean caves The full tides swallow . Follow , follow ! From the curse , from the blight , From the thraldom of night , From the dark to the light , From the slave to the man We will lift Caliban . Farewell , Hecate ! Rise , Apollo ! Follow , follow , follow ! II . In a cave by the sea . Caliban , and Ariel as a forester , seated . Caliban . Caliban . So then it seems thou'rt one of these who served This wizard lord  --  and he a duke disguised  --  One of his tricksy spirits . I like not this . Why did'st thou serve him ? Ariel . Ariel . He delivered me From torture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as by his spells To wait upon him . Oft unwillingly I served him . But at last I loved him well ; Knew his soul 's greatness , honored what he prized , Which yet was but his minister  --  his art ; Felt in my airy veins a blood-warm beat , Till through them double color seemed to run , Like moonlight mingled with the rosy dawn . Caliban . Caliban . If he was noble , why did he enslave me ? I never did him wrong , till he by force Took from me this mine island  --  pent me up In a vile prison  --  made me toil and drudge All day , and when I lagged , beset me sore With pinches and with terrors of his art . Ariel . Ariel . Thou nam'st not all he did . Was he not kind ? Taught thee to speak and reason  --  treated thee , At worst , as he would treat a faithful dog , ( For little more thou wast at first , ) till thou Did'st bite the hand that stroked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dishonor on his child . Caliban . Caliban . I know not . I was never taught to curb My passions , and I lived a lonely life . I wronged him ? Yet my punishment was hard . I might have served him , yet not been a slave . It turned all love to hate to be his slave . He did not treat me as he treated thee . Ariel . Ariel . I was his servant too . But I perceived There was a nearer tie ' twixt him and me , For which I learned to love him . Let that pass . What now behooves thee is to summon up Thy human heart long styed in ignorance And fear and hate ; and since thou call'st thyself Lord of this island , learn to be a lord In nobler style , and with a human love Of all things good . ' T were little gain for thee To have thy freedom , if thou'rt still enslaved To baser powers within thee . What thou hadst Ere Prospero came , is thine to enjoy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beast ; For man thou art , and of the same stuff framed As his who owned thee  --  and better than it seemed Thou wert , perchance , to one whose will enslaved All human and all elemental power His magic could enforce , to overpay For a few brief years the dukedom he had lost . Learn now to prize thy freedom in a field Where thou may'st work for good and not for harm . Curse not , but bless . If I do chance to talk Above thy head , I 'll dwarf my thought to thine ; Or meet thee again when thou upon my words Hast pondered . ... Now , by Apollo 's shaft , I think The moon-calf is asleep ! I 'll vanish then . Exit Ariel . III . Sunrise . Caliban Caliban ( who has been approaching unperceived ) . What , is he gone ! Or is it another dream ? It is my fate , I think , still to be duped With visions and with shows . Perhaps now he Was the man in the moon  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth . And yet , somehow , I dropped asleep as when I hear the wind Sing in the pines , or listen to the fall Of streams in drowsy summer afternoons . I do begin to love this spirit  --  albeit He spoke in praise of Prosper . Prosper ?  --  well  --  It may be that I knew him not  --  who knows ? I am glad he has sailed away though . Setebos ! What  --  sunrise ! Did I sleep so long ? In faith I know it , for I 'm hungry . I will dig Some mussels from the sand , and pick some fruits . I 'm not a cub , it seems  --  said he not so ?  --  But made for better things ; no slave  --  a man Fit to be talked with , and not called vile names  --  Made of the same stuff with that Prospero  --  Ah ha ! good stuff , do you see ?  --  the very same  --  Only a little soiled . We 'll see  --  we 'll see . ( Ariel Ariel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fires the hilltops grim and old . And down the valley melts the mist And turns the earth to gold . The lordly soul is lord of all . The heart that loves its human-kind , Where'er its warming sunbeams fall , Leaves night and death behind . Caliban . Caliban . Fine sprite , I hear you : think I love you too . I 'll follow you  --  though what you said to me Is hard to understand . I 'll hear you talk Again ; but first of all must eat and drink . Made of the same stuff with that Prospero ? No beast  --  no slave ! well  --  this is something new . IV . A pine grove by the sea . Ariel as a forester . Ariel . Ariel . Free , free at last ! Yet bound by a chain whose links Are the heart 's memories . Free to roam unchecked , Untasked . Free as these glancing dancing waves , This summer wind . But by an inward need Of action , and by late-born sympathies With human life , bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present I must waste my art Upon this son of Sycorax . Yet I have seen A kindlier sight flash in his brutish eyes , And in his harsh voice heard a tenderer tone . I think he almost loves me . But alas , What room for human fellowship , what hope To evolve the obstructed and distorted germ Of manhood here , in idle solitude Haunted by soulless elves and sprites  --  a land By human hearts and human intellects Untenanted ? Around us Nature smiles In indolent repose  --  too beautiful , Too soft  --  a land of dull lethargic ease , Steeped in the oblivion of the sleepy South . ( Pauses in thought . ) I know another island  --  where the North Blows with a fresher wind ;  --  where pulses bound Electric to assured results of thought . Its fertile plains , its rocky coasts and hills Are peopled with a vigorous race . Its ports , Forests of masts ; its fields by labor tilled ; Its growing towns and cities from afar Flash in the morning of a crystal sky , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ :  --  a people brave and strong , Yet peaceful , and advancing in all arts , Science and culture , by wise freedom nursed . Oft in my master 's errands flying north I have seen it far across the wrinkling waves , Facing the sunrise like a golden cloud , And heard the humming of its alien marts . And thither we might sail  --  I and this slave That was  --  not long a slave when he has known Contact with men of a superior mould In bonds of law and human brotherhood . Caliban Caliban ( who has been approaching unperceived ) . Good brother Ariel , you are lost in thought . I know ' t is about something wise and good . Come  --  do n't be glum . A penny for your thoughts . Ariel . Ariel . How like you this fair island , Caliban ? Caliban . Caliban . Oh , well enough  --  not having known a better . And yet ' t is lonely here  --  a prison still , Although our jailer ' s gone . And I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jesters  --  I have had enough of them  --  But like your own , whene'er you let yourself Be seen , and condescend to talk with me . Ariel . Ariel . What think you of a voyage from this shore To another island ?  --  better far than this , I needs must think ; a place where men have built Great cities , tilled broad fields , and sail huge ships  --  A home for you and me more fit than this ; For I 'm becoming human very fast , While you will need ere long some earthlier friend . Caliban . Caliban . Well  --  on the whole I 'm tired of this dull life , And do n't object to see some other lands : But how do you propose to sail away Without a ship ? Ariel . Ariel . We 'll see . Trust me for that . One task the more my magic shall achieve . We 'll build a boat . Your toil shall not be great . Yet your old task you must resume awhile , And bring me a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , good Ariel . But for Prospero  --  Thank Heaven , I 've carried my last load for him ! ( They retire , talking together . ) V. Sunset . Ariel and Caliban in a sail-boat are leaving the island . Ariel Ariel sings . I have built me a magical ship ; Its sails of the air were wrought . From the land of symbol and dream we slip To the land of deed and thought : To a clime where the north and south Have mingled their noble seed ; And the glance of the eye and the word of the mouth Are one with the honest deed . We sail , away , away ! To a land where the brain of man Works magic as strange as this ; And the heart of the future builds a plan As deep as the soul 's abyss . We need not the tide nor the gale , Nor the sun nor the moon with their beams , For our boat has a magical rudder and sail That were wrought in the island of dreams . Away , away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) In the island of dreams we stay . We echo your parting lay . Speed on by night and day ! Speed on ! away , away ! ( Caliban sleeps . ) Ariel . Ariel . Sleep on ! We leave the past . The night enshrouds The enchanted isle . And wake thou when the sun Shines on another clime  --  and shines in thee With the new light which thou hast never seen . L'ENVOI . Pardon , great Poet , should I seem to mar One mystery of thy supernatural tale ; Or with unreverent eye to scan the star Whose splendor makes his satellites so pale ! If in my play and privacy of thought , Led by thy light , I lingered for a while Amid the scenes thy master-hand had wrought , And , hovering over thy deserted isle , Dared to invoke thy sprites without command To come unmarshalled by thy mystic wand  --  If on the margin of thy immortal page I scrawled a sketch unfit to grace thy stage , ' T was but the joy of dwelling there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the wondering question of a child , To know what may have chanced beyond the wild Fantastic dream , from which too soon he woke To common daylight and life 's weary yoke . Pardon I crave once more , O mighty seer ! I bow before thee here With reverent love and awe , And say  --  " I only sported with his thought , While in its golden meshes gladly caught , I dreamed and fancied . He awoke and saw ! "
