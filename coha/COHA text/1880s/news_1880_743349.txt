txt Now that it has been decided that the Democratic Convention is to be held in Cincinnati on June 22 , the friends of Mr. Tilden declare that the selection of that city is perfectly satisfactory to him , end that he had no preference for any one of the three competing cities of the West . The representatives of Ohio and the successful city , deny that the choice has any political significance , and say that the winning votes were secured by a belief that the Democracy of Ohio would be inspired and strengthened by the convention and by a recognition of the ability of Cincinnati to provide for ' her guests in a comfortable manner . Nevertheless , there is a strong belief that Mr. Tilden was opposed to Cincinnati , and that his friends , after they saw that his Power could not direct the choice , joined the winning side and proclaimed Mr. Tilden 's indifference in order that his loss of strength might not be revealed . An attempt by his supporters to combine the forces of Chicago and St. Louis failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pledges of so many members for second choice twat a victory for Ohio was assured . It is a ' victory for Ohio rather than for Cincinnati , for the whole State was represented in the delegation which pressed Cincinnati 's claims , and the arguments advanced were rather an appeal from the Democratic Party of the State than a statement of reasons applicable to Cincinnati alone . It is plain that the men from Ohio have shown much more aversion to a resurrection of Tilden than has been manifested by the men from Chicago and St. Louis . As has been stated in a previous dispatch . there seems to be a strong desire among Ohio men to carry on the campaign with new material . Not only has considerable quiet work been done by these men for 31r . Jewett , but the claims of ex-Congressman H. B. Payne , of Cleveland , have not been forgotten . These representatives from Ohio will not use their influence for the old candidate , unless they are compelled to do so by the desires of other States . One prominent Democrat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to get the nomination , although he continued to be a candidate , but he felt sure that he would try to name his successor . The bitter feeling and contempt of Southern Democrats for Tilden render his nomination equivalent to an overwhelming defeat for the Marty . The friends of Tilden attempt to show that the choice of city was a matter in which be took no interest , but his opponents declare that the result indicates Tilden 's weakness and the party 's desire to get rid of him as an intubus . The celebration at Willard 's to-nieht was a very disgraceful exhibition of the influence of rum in Democratic councils . A band of music assembled in front of the main entrance , and the music called together a handful of negrnes and loafers . The Ohio head-quarters were directly above the main entrance of the hotel , and the cat-calls of the boot-blacks induced some of those in the room to send Senator Pendleton out upon the balcony to make a speech . His remarks were brief and formal , and at their close be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and fairly elected , and would be inaugurated . The scene , even at the beginning of the performance , was a ludicrous one , for llff . Pendleton %vas talking in the air . The persons before him could not be called an au ; hence . After he had returned to the room , a few of the most sober visitors from Ohio were pushed through the window and set up before the rabble , to be greeted with hoots and wails that were by no means complimentary . Congressman W. D. Hill . of the Sixth District of Ohio , insisted upon expressing his sentiments , although his utterances were far from clear . " The Democrats , " he cried . " will nominate their candidate in Cincinnati , and we will inaugurate him whether he is elected or not " After he bad made this statement his friends pulled him back into the room , and J. Frank , Chairman of the Democratic State Central Committee , of Ohio , took his place . This speaker promised that the Democrats would carry Ohio for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 350,000 able-bodied men to inaugurate him . Sergeant-at-Arms Thompson saw that Hill bad gone too far and he endeavored to correct his mistake . " We do n't intend , " said he , " to inaugurate our nominee if he is not elected . But keep your powder dry . " he continued , " for he will be elected , and then , of course , he must be inaugurated . " Mr. Thompson was followed by Armstrong , of the Cleveland Plain Dealer , whose thick utterances and wild gestures so amused the boys below that they ridiculed him unmercifully . This treatment made him angry , and caused him to indulge in profanity , whereupon his friends quickly withdrew him to the seclusion of the Ohio bead-quarters . After one or two men , who were under the influence of strong stimulants had spoken in an incoherent way . the performance came to an end and the band were invited in to drink . Later in the evening . Mr. Thompson remarked to Congressman Hill that he had thought it necessary , while on the platform , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They were too strong , " said he . " Well , I know they were pretty strong , " replied Hill , " but it 's the truth . "
