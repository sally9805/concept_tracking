Lazarus , Emma , 1849-1887 : THE TAMING OF THE FALCON . from The taming of the falcon ( 1889 ) The bird sits spelled upon the lithe brown wrist Of yonder turbaned fowler , who hath lamed No feathered limb , but the winged spirit tamed With his compelling eye . He need not twist The silken toil , nor set the thick-limed snare ; He lures the wanderer with his steadfast gaze , It shrinks , it quails , it trembles  --  yet obeys , And lo ! he has enslaved the thing of air . The fixed , insistent human will is lord Of all the earth ;  --  but in the awful sky , Reigns absolute , unreached by deed or word , Above creation , through eternity , Outshining the sun 's shield , the lightning 's sword , The might of Allah 's unaverted eye .
