txt The mystery surrounding the murder of Louis Schmidt , the solitary German who was shot on Wednesday night and then thrown into a well , is still unsolved , although Coroner Preston is searching diligently for clues . The entire premises were carefully examined yesterday , particularly the groundbetween the spot where the gun was found and the well where the body was discovered , both in a direct line , and in the roundabout course around the house not a footprint or a drop of blood was to be found . It is evident that the wound in Schmidt 's head bled very little , and the inference from this is that he died immediately . A little pool of blood was found near where the empty gun lay , and there was a little blood smeared over the well-curb , but this was all . There was not even blood on the murdered man 's clothes . Whatever stains had been around the wound were probably washed off in the well . It is generally believed that at least two persons must have been concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved Schmidt 's heavy body from the scene of the shooting to the well without leaving some marks on the ground . One of the most unaccountable circumstances connected with the case is the fact that one of Schmidt 's stockings was on his left foot , and the other on the ground outside the house . There are two theories in regard to this . One is that Schmdt was going to bed when attacked , had already taken off one stocking , and that it was dragged into the yard m the scuffle . The other is that the murderers took off one of Schmidt 's stockings to make it appear that he had committed suicide , taking off his stocking so that he might pull the trigger with his toes . The attempt to make an appearance of suicide , if there was such an attempt , was a very bungling one , for the gun was too far away from the blood-pool , and the blood was too far away from the well . Schmidt was known to be in the habit of carrying a large silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when his body was found . From the fact the story has started that he was murdered for plunder . The theory that he was undressing when attacked , would easily account for the disappearance of the watch . If he had taken it off , it would have been burned up with the house . Search has been made for it in the ashes , but without result . The burned house was the subject of litigation before Mr. Martin owned it , and it is hinted in some quarters that the unsuccessful litigant , whoever he was , might have had something to do with its burning . But why any such person should have wished to destroy the place after it was in the hands of a disinterested man is unexplained . The house was in a desolate , lonely place , where a murder might easily be committed without danger of immediate detection . There is such an utter lack of any clue that fewer theories than usual are advanced . The authorities are inclined to believe that there was some strong motive , either for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that two or more men with a boat landed in the neighborhood , and selected as lonely a place as they could find to plunder it , without knowing whether or not it contained anything valuable ; that they met with unexpected resistance ; that , being about to retire , Schmidt ran out of the house at them with the gun and the pistol , and that the men wrested the gun from him , killed him , threw him into the well , and set fire to the place . This theory , like all the other theories , has its weak points . It is more than likely that the body will be exhumed ? and the lungs examined to ascertain whether Schmidt was dead or alive when he was thrown into the well , although the doctors have little doubt that ho was dead at that time . Coroner Preston , who is by no means the average country Coroner , but an accomplished and active officer and physician , says that if this is a murder it is the tenth one that he has investigated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
