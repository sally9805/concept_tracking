txt Senator Z. T. Vance , who is to make the " long talk " to the TamMany Society at their Fourth or July celebration , will probably go over to New-York prepared to treat his hearers to a lot of " chestnuts " that have served their purpose in North Carolina since ante helium days , and will give a modern flavor to his harangue by supplying some vigorous abuse of the civil service system in a style very like that which Gen. Spinola would adopt if he were to be the orator in place of Mr. Vance . The Senator will probably speak with feeling In opposing an obstructive civil service law . It is not to be expected that he will be frank enough to say that the law stands in the way of the Vance family , however true that may be . He will assail the law on broad Democratic grounds , assuming that to the victor belongs the spoils and all of them . Mr. Vance is a bold talker and an entertaining speaker . Ho could not do a bolder or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how many of the Vance family have failed to appropriate their share of spoils in consequence or the odious civil service law . He could give his hearers a chance to guess if he would tell just how many of the Vances are in office . He could speak of himself as 17n1ted States Senator at a salary of $5,000 a year ; of R. B. Vance , Assistant Commissioner of Patents , at $4,500 ; of C. F. Vance , the Senator 's son and clerk , at $2,190 ; of Z. B. Vance , Jr .. another son . in the Geological Survey . at $600 ; W. G. Vance , cousin , in the Treasury . $1,200 ; T. H. Vance , cousin , m the Post Office Department , $1,000 ; D. M. Vance , cousin , in the army . $1,600 ; J. Vance , cousin , Mississippi River Commission . $1,800 : E. Vance . cousin , Department of Justice , $1,200 ; David N. Vance . cousin , Internal Revenue , $425 ; A. R.

These 16 persons , drawing about $26,000 a year from the Government , ought to make any Senator wile does not want " the whole earth " feel as if the civil service law was not much of an obstacle . It is just possible that no one but the Senator knows precisely what the intense desire of his family is to serve the Government , and that a clean breast or his difficulties , including a confession that he must profess to be anxious to provide for his own or condemn himself as worse than an infidel , is absolutely necessary to his peace of mind . Among those who are anxious that the work of improving New-York Harbor shall be carried out on a scale corresponding to its vast importance there is general regret that the liberal appropriation proposed by the Senate must take its chances in a measure so unlikely to receive the approval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The House of Representatives gave $150,000 " for the harbor improvements . This was increased by the Senate Commerce Committee , through Mr. Ellis 's efforts , to $1,000,000 . To-day the Senate agreed to this increase after a short discussion . Mr. Miller pointed out the fact that for years large ocean steamships have not been able to enter or leave the port of New-York with more than three-quarter cargoes , and have had to wait for high tide with even such light loads before crossing Sandy Hook bar . The work of making a 30-foot channel over the bar at low water could be finished in three years , Mr. Miller said , and $1,000,000 could be profitably expended upon it the first year . Mr. Beck regarded the committee 's amendment as one of the few meritorious items in the hill , and expressed his surprise that the House had so neglected New-York Harbor . The Senate added the increased item to the bill without a division . *** Senator Hoar 's absence from the Senate is the excuse now given by the Judiciary Committee for not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Beck 's bill to prohibit Senators and Representatives from acting as attorneys for railroad companies which nave received aid from the Government . There has been a little informal talk on the subject in the committee , but Mr. Edmunds and other opponents of the bill have taken advantage of Mr. Hoar 's absence to insist that no report shall be agreed upon until he has come back . The Massachusetts Senator is expected here some time next week , when it will be in order for the railroad Senators to seek some new pretext for delay . It is not their purpose to allow any such measure as Mr. Beck proposed to become a law this year . Mrs. Cleveland 's first visit to the Capitol since her marriage was made to-day . She was accompanied by Mrs. Vilas and Mrs. Lamont , and the ladies were escorted by Capt . Ends , who took pains to show them the model of his proposed ship railway in the basement of the building . When the party took seats in the executive gallery in the House of Representatives all eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to the Democratic side of the ? hamper , where they could obtain a better view of the President 's bride . Mrs. Cleveland apparently paid no heed to the staring to which she was subjected , but she remained in the gallery hardly ten minutes . When the party rose to go , many persons in the other visitors ' galleries ran into the corridors and watched Mrs. Cleveland as she walked over to the Senate Chamber . The Senators were courteous enough not to try to stare her out of countenance while she sat in the Presidential gallery , but when she went away after a brief visit she had to pass through another crowd of curious men and women in the corridors . The ladies looked into the President 's room before leaving the building . The first concert of the season on the White House lawn took place this afternoon . The usual platform , raised a few feet above the recently clipped grass , was occupied by Prof. Sousa and his Marine Band at 5:30 o'clock , when a crowd of several hundred persons had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concert closed there were 2,000 listeners upon the lawn and promenading the winding paths of the Executive Mansion grounds . The audience included many Prominent persons , the ladies greatly outnumbering the gentlemen . The President and Mrs. Cleveland started out for a drive at 4:30 o'clock , and only returned as the band was playing the fast number on the programme . They came out upon the south porch together , the President wearing a straw hat and Mrs. Cleveland dressed in a. close-fitting costume , buff in Y. color , i with a black chip hat . As they stood together looking down upon the throng about the band stand there was a movement of the crowd nearer to get a better view . The movement was a catching one , and presently the band was deserted and the audience gathered on the walk just beneath the porch , as the Presiaent and his wife retreated into the White House . In answer to a warm clapping of bands he turned for a moment and waved a response with his straw bat . The conference of Democratic members held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in the meeting to be held next  --  TuesdaY , when they will recommend that it be reported adversely . Col. Morrison has always intended that it should reach the House so that there could be no complaint that he had refused an opportunity for tariff discussion . It is the opinion of the Democratic members of the Ways and Means Committee that the adverse report will be acceptable to every member of the committee , Democrats and Republicans .
