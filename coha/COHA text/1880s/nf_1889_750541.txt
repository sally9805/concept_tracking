Phoenice , or Phoenicia , was the name originally given by the Greeks  --  and afterwards adopted from them by the Romans  --  to the coast region of the Mediterranean , where it faces the west between the thirty-second and the thirty-sixth parallels . Here , it would seem , in their early voyagings , the Pre-Homeric Greeks first came upon a land where the palm-tree was not only indigenous , but formed a leading and striking characteristic , everywhere along the low sandy shore lifting its tuft of feathery leaves into the bright blue sky , high above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hence they called the tract Phoenicia , or " the Land of Palms ; " and the people who inhabited it the Phoenicians , or " the Palm-tree people . " The term was from the first applied with a good deal of vagueness . It was probably originally given to the region opposite Cyprus , from Gabala in the north  --  now Jebili  --  to Antaradus ( Tortosa ) and Marathus ( Amrith ) towards the south , where the palm-tree was first seen growing in rich abundance . The palm is the numismatic emblem of Aradus , 11 and though not now very frequent in the region which Strabo calls " the Aradian coast-tract , " 12 must anciently have been among its chief ornaments . As the Grecian knowledge of the coast extended southward , and a richer and still richer growth of the palm was continually noticed , almost every town and every village being embosomed in a circle of palm groves , the name extended itself until it reached as far south at any rate as Gaza , or ( according to some ) as Rhinocolura @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have passed beyond Cape Posideium ( Possidi ) at the foot of Mount Casius , the tract between this and the range of Taurus being always known as Syria , never as Phoenecia or Phoenice . The entire length of the coast between the limits of Cape Possidi and Rhinocolura is , without reckoning the lesser indentations , about 380 miles , or nearly the same as that of Portugal . The indentations of the coast-line are slight . From Rhinocolura to Mount Carmel , a distance of 150 miles , not a single strong promontory asserts itself , nor is there a single bay of sufficient depth to attract the attention of geographers . Carmel itself is a notable headland , and shelters a bay of some size ; but these once passed the old uniformity returns , the line being again almost unbroken for a distance of seventy-five miles , from Haifa to Beyrout ( Berytus ) . North of Beyrout we find a little more variety . The coast projects in a tolerably bold sweep between the thirty-fourth parallel and Tripolis ( Tarabulus ) and recedes almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a deepish bay is formed between Lat. 34 ? 27 ' and Lat. 34 ? 45 ' , whence the line again runs northward unindented for fifty miles , to beyond Gabala ( Jebili ) . After this , between Gabala and Cape Posideium there is considerable irregularity , the whole tract being mountainous , and spurs from Bargylus and Casius running down into the sea and forming a succession of headlands , of which Cape Posideium is the most remarkable . But while the name Phoenicia is applied geographically to this long extent  --  nearly 400 miles  --  of coast-line , historically and ethnically it has to be reduced within considerably narrower limits . A race , quite distinct from that of the Phoenicians , was settled from an early date on the southern portion of the west Asian coast , where it verges towards Africa . From Jabneh ( Yebna ) southwards was Palestine , the country of the Philistines , perhaps even from Joppa ( Jaffa ) , which is made the boundary by Mela. 13 Thus at least eighty miles of coast-line must be deducted from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mediterranean shore must be regarded as not exceeding three hundred miles . The width varied from eight or ten miles to thirty . We must regard as the eastern boundary of Phoenicia the high ridge which forms the watershed between the streams that flow eastward toward the Orontes , Litany , and Jordan , and those that flow westward into the Mediterranean . It is difficult to say what was the average width , but perhaps it may be fairly estimated at about fifteen miles . In this case the entire area would have been about 4,500 square miles . The tract was one of a remarkably diversified character . Lofty mountain , steep wooded hill , chalky slope , rich alluvial plain , and sandy shore succeeded each other , each having its own charm , which was enhanced by contrast . The sand is confined to a comparatively narrow strip along the seashore , 14 and to the sites of ancient harbours now filled up . It is exceedingly fine and of excellent silicious quality , especially in the vicinity of Sidon and at the foot of Mount Carmel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Acre , Tyre , Sidon , Beyrout , and Marathus . Sharon , so dear to the Hebrew poets , 15 is the maritime tract intervening between the highland of Samaria and the Mediterranean , extending from Joppa to the southern foot of Carmel  --  a distance of nearly sixty miles  --  and watered by the Chorseas , the Kaneh , and other rivers . It is a smooth , very slightly undulating tract , about ten miles in width from the sea to the foot of the mountains , which rise up abruptly from it without any intervening region of hills , and seem to bound it as a wall , above which tower the huge rounded masses of Ebal and Gerizim , with the wooded cone , on which stood Samaria , nestling at their feet. 16 The sluggish streams , several of them containing water during the whole of the year , make their way across it between reedy banks , 17 and generally spread out before reaching the shore into wide marshes , which might be easily utilised for purposes of irrigation . The soil is extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and producing enormous crops of weeds or grain , according as it is cultivated or left in a state of nature . Towards the south the view over the region has been thus described : " From Ramleh there is a wide view on every side , presenting a prospect rarely surpassed in richness and beauty . I could liken it to nothing but the great plain of the Rhine by Heidelberg or , better still , to the vast plains of Lombardy , as seen from the cathedral of Milan and elsewhere . In the east the frowning mountains of Judah rose abruptly from the tract at their foot ; while on the west , in fine contrast , the glittering waves of the Mediterranean Sea associated our thoughts with Europe . Towards the north and south , as far as the eye could reach , the beautiful plain was spread out like a carpet at our feet , variegated with tracts of brown from which the crops had just been taken , and with fields still rich with the yellow of the ripe corn , or green with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the immense olive groves of Ramleh and Lydda , and the picturesque towers and minarets and domes of these large villages . In the plain itself were not many villages , but the tract of hills and the mountain-side beyond , especially in the north-east , were perfectly studded with them , and as now seen in the reflected beams of the setting sun they seemed like white villas and hamlets among the dark hills , presenting an appearance of thriftiness and beauty which certainly would not stand a closer examination . " 18 Towards its northern end Sharon is narrowed by the low hills which gather round the western flanks of Carmel , and gradually encroach upon the plain until it terminates against the shoulder of the mountain itself , leaving only a narrow beach at the foot of the promontory by which it is possible to communicate with the next plain towards the north. 19 Compared with Sharon the plain of Acre is unimportant and of small extent . It reaches about eight miles along the shore , from the foot of Carmel to the headland on which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shore and the hills of about six miles . Like Sharon it is noted for its fertility . Watered by the two permanent streams of the Kishon and the Belus , it possesses a rich soil , which is said to be at present " perhaps the best cultivated and producing the most luxuriant crops , both of corn and weeds , of any in Palestine . " 110 The Kishon waters it on the south , where it approaches Carmel , and is a broad stream , 111 though easily fordable towards its mouth . The Belus ( Namaane ) flows through it towards the north , washing Acre itself , and is a stream of even greater volume than the Kishon , though it has but a short course . The third of the Phoenician plains , as we proceed from south to north , is that of Tyre . This is a long but comparatively narrow strip , reaching from the Ras-el-Abiad towards the south to Sarepta on the north , a distance of about twenty miles , but in no part more than five miles across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watered about midway by the copious stream of the Kasimiyeh or Litany , which , rising east of Lebanon in the Buka'a or Coelesyrian valley , forces its way through the mountain chain by a series of tremendous gorges , and debouches upon the Tyrian lowland about three miles to the south-east of the present city , near the modern Khan-el-Kasimiyeh , whence it flows peaceably to the sea with many windings through a broad low tract of meadow-land . Other rills and rivulets descending from the west flank of the great mountain increase the productiveness of the plain , while copious fountains of water gush forth with surprising force in places , more especially at Ras-el-Ain , three miles from Tyre , to the south. 112 The plain is , even at the present day , to a large extent covered with orchards , gardens , and cultivated fields , in which are grown rich crops of tobacco , cotton , and cereals . The plain of Sidon , which follows that of Tyre , and is sometimes regarded as a part of it , 113 extends from a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about ten miles , and resembles that of Tyre in its principal features . It is long and narrow , never more than about two miles in width , but well-watered and very fertile . The principal streams are the Bostrenus ( Nahr-el-Auly ) in the north , just inside the promontory of Jajunieh , the Nahr-Sanik , south of Sidon , a torrent dry in the summer-time , 114 and the Nahr-ez-Zaherany , two and a half miles north of Sarepta , a river of moderate capacity . Fine fountains also burst from the earth in the plain itself , as the Ain-el-Kanterah and the Ain-el-Burak , 115 between Sarepta and the Zaherany river . Irrigation is easy and is largely used , with the result that the fruits and vegetables of Saida and its environs have the name of being among the finest of the country. 116 The plain of Berytus ( Beyrout ) is the most contracted of all the Phoenician plains that are at all noticeable . It lies south , south-east , and east of the city , intervening between the high dunes or sand-hills which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skirts of Lebanon , which here approach very near to the sea . The plain begins at Wady Shuweifat on the south , about four miles from the town of Beyrout , and extends northwards to the sea on the western side of the Nahr Beyrout . The northern part of the plain is known as Ard-el-Burajineh . The plain is deficient in water , 117 yet is cultivated in olives and mulberries , and contains the largest olive grove in all Syria . A little beyond its western edge is the famous pine forest118 from which ( according to some ) Berytus derived its name. 119 The plain of Marathus is , next to Sharon , the most extensive in Phoenicia . It stretches from Jebili ( Gabala ) on the north to Arka towards the south , a distance of about sixty miles , and has a width varying from two to ten miles . The rock crops out from it in places and it is broken between Tortosa and Hammam by a line of low hills running parallel with the shore. 120 The principal streams which water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south of Jebili , the Nahr Amrith , a strong running brook which empties itself into the sea a few miles south of Tortosa ( Antaradus ) , the Nahr Kuble , which joins the Nahr Amrith near its mouth , and the Eleutherus or Nahr-el-Kabir , which reaches the sea a little north of Arka . Of these the Eleutherus is the most important . " It is a considerable stream even in summer , and in the rainy season it is a barrier to intercourse , caravans sometimes remaining encamped on its banks for several weeks , unable to cross . " 121 The soil of the plain is shallow , the rock lying always near the surface ; the streams are allowed to run to waste and form marshes , which breed malaria ; a scanty population scarcely attempts more than the rudest and most inefficient cultivation ; and the consequence is that the tract at present is almost a desert . Nature , however , shows its capabilities by covering it in the spring-time from end to end with a " carpet of flowers . " 122 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very shore of the sea , rise up chalky slopes or steep rounded hills , partly left to nature and covered with trees and shrubs , partly at the present day cultivated and studded with villages . The hilly region forms generally an intermediate tract between the high mountains and the plains already described ; but , not unfrequently , it commences at the water 's edge , and fills with its undulations the entire space , leaving not even a strip of lowland . This is especially the case in the central region between Berytus and Arka , opposite the highest portion of the Lebanon ; and again in the north between Cape Possidi and Jebili , opposite the more northern part of Bargylus . The hilly region in these places is a broad tract of alternate wooded heights and deep romantic valleys , with streams murmuring amid their shades . Sometimes the hills are cultivated in terraces , on which grow vines and olives , but more often they remain in their pristine condition , clothed with masses of tangled underwood . The mountain ranges , which belong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four in number  --  Carmel , Casius , Bargylus , and Lebanon . Carmel is a long hog-backed ridge , running in almost a straight line from north-west to south-east , from the promontory which forms the western protection of the bay of Acre to El-Ledjun , on the southern verge of the great plain of Esdraelon , a distance of about twenty-two miles . It is a limestone formation , and rises up abruptly from the side of the bay of Acre , with flanks so steep and rugged that the traveller must dismount in order to ascend them , 123 but slopes more gently towards the south , where it is comparatively easy of access . The greatest elevation which it attains is about Lat. 32 ? 4 ' , where it reaches the height of rather more than 1,200 feet ; from this it falls gradually as it nears the shore , until at the convent , with which the western extremity is crowned , the height above the sea is no more than 582 feet . In ancient times the whole mountain was thickly wooded , 124 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " where there are " thick jungles of copse , " 125 and is covered in places with olive groves and thickets of dwarf oak , yet its appearance is rather that of a park than of a forest , long stretches of grass alternating with patches of woodland and " shrubberies , thicker than any in Central Palestine , " while the larger trees grow in clumps or singly , and there is nowhere , as in Lebanon , any dense growth , or even any considerable grove , of forest trees . But the beauty of the tract is conspicuous ; and if Carmel means , as some interpret , a " garden " rather than a " forest , " it may be held to well justify its appellation . " The whole mountain-side , " says one traveller , 126 " was dressed with blossoms and flowering shrubs and fragrant herbs . " " There is not a flower , " says another , 127 " that I have seen in Galilee , or on the plains along the coast , that I do not find on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was of old . " The geological structure of Carmel is , in the main , what is called " the Jura formation , " or " the upper oolite "  --  a soft white limestone , with nodules and veins of flint . At the western extremity , where it overhangs the Mediterranean , are found chalk , and tertiary breccia formed of fragments of chalk and flint . On the north-east of the mountain , beyond the Nahr-el-Mukattah , plutonic rocks appear , breaking through the deposit strata , and forming the beginning of the basalt formation which runs through the plain of Esdraelon to Tabor and the Sea of Galilee. 128 Like most limestone formations , Carmel abounds in caves , which are said to be more than 2,000 in number , 129 and are often of great length and extremely tortuous . Carmel , the great southern headland of Phoenicia , is balanced in a certain sense by the extreme northern headland of Casius . Mount Casius is , strictly speaking , the termination of a spur from Bargylus ; but it has so marked and peculiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rising up abruptly from the Mediterranean to the height of 5,318 feet , it dominates the entire region in its vicinity , and from the sea forms a landmark that is extraordinarily conspicuous . Forests of fine trees clothe its flanks , but the lofty summit towers high above them , a bare mass of rock , known at the present day as Jebel-el-Akra , or " the Bald Mountain . " It is formed mainly of the same cretaceous limestone as the other mountains of these parts , and like them has a rounded summit ; but rocks of igneous origin enter into its geological structure ; and in its vegetation it more resembles the mountain ranges of Taurus and Amanus than those of southern Syria and Palestine . On its north-eastern prolongation , which is washed by the Orontes , lay the enchanting pleasure-ground of Daphne , bubbling with fountains , and bright with flowering shrubs , where from a remote antiquity the Syrians held frequent festival to their favourite deity  --  the " Dea Syra "  --  the great nature goddess . The elevated tract known to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ansayrieh or Nasariyeh mountain-region , runs at right angles to the spur terminating in the Mount Casius , and extends from the Orontes near Antioch to the valley of the Eleutherus . This is a distance of not less than a hundred miles . The range forms the western boundary of the lower Coelesyrian valley , which abuts upon it towards the east , while westward it looks down upon the region , partly hill , partly lowland , which may be regarded as constituting " Northern Phoenicia . " The axis of the range is almost due north and south , but with a slight deflection towards the south-east . Bargylus is not a chain comparable to Lebanon , but still it is a romantic and picturesque region . The lower spurs towards the west are clothed with olive grounds and vineyards , or covered with myrtles and rhododendrons ; between them are broad open valleys , productive of tobacco and corn . Higher up " the scenery becomes wild and bold ; hill rises to mountain ; soft springing green corn gives place to sterner crag , smooth plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more elevated region the majesty of the cedar is wanting , yet forests of fir and pine abound , and creep up the mountain-side , in places almost to the summit , while here and there bare masses of rock protrude themselves , and crag and cliff rise into the clouds that hang about the highest summits . Water abounds throughout the region , which is the parent of numerous streams , as the northern Nahr-el-Kebir , which flows into the sea by Latakia , the Nahr-el-Melk , the Nahr Amrith , the Nahr Kuble , the Nahr-el-Abrath , and many others . From the conformation of the land they have of necessity short courses ; but each and all of them spread along their banks a rich verdure and an uncommon fertility . But the great range of Phoenicia , its glory and its boast is Lebanon . Lebanon , the " White Mountain " 131  --  " the Mont Blanc of Palestine " 132  --  now known as " the Old White-headed Man " ( Jebel-esh-Sheikh ) , or " the Mountain of Ice " ( Jebel-el-Tilj ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its greatness , and its crowning beauty . Extended in a continuous line for a distance of above a hundred miles , with an average elevation of from 6,000 to 8,000 feet , and steepest on its eastern side , it formed a wall against which the waves of eastern invasion naturally broke  --  a bulwark which seemed to say to them , " Thus far shall ye go , and no further . " The flood of conquest swept along its eastern flank , down the broad vale of the Buka'a , and then over the hills of Galilee ; but its frowning precipices and its lofty crest deterred or baffled the invader , and the smiling region between its summit and the Mediterranean was , in the early times at any rate , but rarely traversed by a hostile army . This western region it was which held those inexhaustible stores of forest trees that supplied Phoenicia with her war ships and her immense commercial navy ; here were the most productive valleys , the vineyards , and the olive grounds , and here too were the streams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the deep gorges which gave her the palm over all the surrounding countries for variety of picturesque scenery . The geology of the Lebanon is exceedingly complicated . " While the bulk of the mountain , and all the higher ranges , are without exception limestone of the early cretaceous period , the valleys and gorges are filled with formations of every possible variety , sedimentary , metamorphic , and igneous . Down many of them run long streams of trap or basalt ; occasionally there are dykes of porphyry and greenstone , and then patches of sandstone , before the limestone and flint recur . " 133 Some slopes are composed entirely of soft sandstone ; many patches are of a hard metallic-sounding trap or porphyry ; but the predominant formation is a greasy or powdery limestone , bare often , but sometimes clothed with a soft herbage , or with a thick tangle of shrubs , or with lofty forest trees . The ridge of the mountain is everywhere naked limestone rock , except in the comparatively few places which attain the highest elevation , where it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially remarkable , that of Jebel Sunnin towards the south , which is a conspicuous object from Beyrout , 134 and is estimated to exceed the height of 9,000 feet , 135 and that of Jebel Mukhmel towards the north , which has been carefully measured and found to fall a very little short of 10,200 feet. 136 The latter , which forms a sort of amphitheatre , circles round and impends over a deep hollow or basin , opening out towards the west , in which rise the chief sources that go to form the romantic stream of the Kadisha . The sides of the basin are bare and rocky , fringed here and there with the rough knolls which mark the deposits of ancient glaciers , the " moraines " of the Lebanon . In this basin stand " the Cedars . " It is not indeed true , as was for a long time supposed , that the cedar grove of Jebel Mukhmel is the sole remnant of that primeval cedar-forest which was anciently the glory of the mountain . Cedars exist on Lebanon in six other places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on one of the feeders of the Duweir , a wild gorge is clothed from top to bottom with a forest of trees , untouched by the axe , the haunt of the panther and the bear , which on examination have been found to be all cedars , some of a large size , from fifteen to eighteen feet in girth . They grow in clusters , or scattered singly , in every variety of situation , some clinging to the steep slopes , or gnarled and twisted on the bare hilltops , others sheltered in the recesses of the dell . There are also cedar-groves at B'sherrah ; at El Hadith ; near Duma , five hours south-west of El Hadith ; in one of the glens north of Deir-el-Kamar , at Etnub , and probably in other places. 137 But still " the Cedars " of Jebel Mukhmel are entitled to pre-eminence over all the rest , both as out-numbering any other cluster , and still more as exceeding all the rest in size and apparent antiquity . Some of the patriarchs are of enormous girth ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and the height is such that the birds which dwell among the upper branches are beyond the range of an ordinary fowling-piece . But it is through the contrasts which it presents that Lebanon has its extraordinary power of attracting and delighting the traveller . Below the upper line of bare and worn rock , streaked in places with snow , and seamed with torrent courses , a region is entered upon where the freshest and softest mountain herbage , the greenest foliage , and the most brilliant flowers alternate with deep dells , tremendous gorges , rocky ravines , and precipices a thousand feet high . Scarcely has the voyager descended from the upper region of naked and rounded rock , when he comes upon " a tremendous chasm  --  the bare amphitheatre of the upper basin contracts into a valley of about 2,000 feet deep , rent at its bottom into a cleft a thousand feet deeper still , down which dashes a river , buried between these stupendous walls of rock . All above the chasm is terraced as far as the eye can reach with indefatigable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrace , fertilising them as they rush to join the torrent in the abyss . Some of the waterfalls are of great height and of considerable volume . From one spot may be counted no less than seven of these cascades , now dashing in white spray over a cliff , now lost under the shade of trees , soon to reappear over the next shelving rock . " 138 Or , to quote from another writer , 139  --  " The descent from the summit is gradual , but is everywhere broken by precipices and towering rocks , which time and the elements have chiselled into strange fantastic shapes . Ravines of singular wildness and grandeur furrow the whole mountain-side , looking in many places like huge rents . Here and there , too , bold promontories shoot out , and dip perpendicularly into the bosom of the Mediterranean . The ragged limestone banks are scantily clothed with the evergreen oak , and the sandstone with pines ; while every available spot is carefully cultivated . The cultivation is wonderful , and shows what all Syria might be of under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen where one would suppose that the eagles alone , which hover round them , could have planted the seed . Fig-trees cling to the naked rock ; vines are trained along narrow ledges ; long ranges of mulberries on terraces like steps of stairs cover the more gentle declivities ; and dense groves of olives fill up the bottoms of the glens . Hundreds of villages are seen , here built amid labyrinths of rock , there clinging like swallows ' nests to the sides of cliffs , while convents , no less numerous , are perched on the top of every peak . When viewed from the sea on a morning in early spring , Lebanon presents a picture which once seen is never forgotten ; but deeper still is the impression left on the mind , when one looks down over its terraced slopes clothed in their gorgeous foliage , and through the vistas of its magnificent glens , on the broad and bright Mediterranean . " The eastern flank of the mountain falls very far short of the western both in area and in beauty . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the striking features of gorge , ravine , deep dell , and dashing stream which diversify the side that looks westward . The steep slopes are generally bare , the lower portion only being scantily clothed with deciduous oak , for the most part stunted , and with low scrub of juniper and barberry. 140 Towards the north there is an outer barrier , parallel with the main chain , on which follows a tolerably flat and rather bare plain , well watered , and with soft turf in many parts , which gently slopes to the foot of the main ascent , a wall of rock generally half covered with snow , up which winds the rough track whereby travellers reach the summit . Rills of water are not wanting ; flowers bloom to the very edge of the snow , and the walnut-tree flourishes in sheltered places to within two or three thousand feet of the summit ; but the general character of the tract is bare and bleak ; the villages are few ; and the terraced cultivation , which adds so much to the beauty of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the range the descent is abrupt from the crest of the mountain into the Buka'a , or valley of the Litany , and the aspect of the mountain-side is one of " unrelieved bareness. " 141 There is , however , one beauty at one point on this side of the Lebanon range which is absent from the more favoured western region . On the ascent from Baalbek to the Cedars the traveller comes upon Lake Lemone , a beautiful mountain tarn , without any apparent exit , the only sheet of water in the Lebanon . Lake Lemone is of a long oval shape , about two miles from one end to the other , and is fed by a stream entering at either extremity , that from the north , which comes down from the village of Ainat , being the more important . As the water which comes into the lake can not be discharged by evaporation , we must suppose some underground outlet , 142 by which it is conveyed , through the limestone , into the Litany . The eastern side of Lebanon drains entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it gives birth . The Litany is the principal of all the Phoenician rivers , for the Orontes must be counted not to Phoenicia but to Syria . It rises from a small pool or lake near Tel Hushben , 143 about six miles to the south-west of the Baalbek ruins . Springing from this source , which belongs to Antilibanus rather than to Lebanon , the Litany shortly receives a large accession to its waters from the opposite side of the valley , and thus augmented flows along the lower Buka'a in a direction which is generally a little west of south , receiving on either side a number of streams and rills from both mountains , and giving out in its turn numerous canals for irrigation . As the river descends with numerous windings , but still with the same general course , the valley of the Buka'a contracts more and more , till finally it terminates in a gorge of a most extraordinary character . Nothing in the conformation of the strata , or in the lie of ground , indicates the coming marvel144  --  the roots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress of the river seems to be barred by a rocky ridge stretching across the valley from east to west , when lo ! suddenly , the ridge is cut , as if by a knife , and a deep and narrow chasm opens in it , down which the stream plunges in a cleft 200 feet deep , and so narrow that in one place it is actually bridged over by masses of rock which have fallen from the cliffs above. 145 In the gully below fig-trees and planes , besides many shrubs , find a footing , and the moist walls of rock on either side are hung with ferns of various kinds , among which is conspicuous the delicate and graceful maidenhair . Further down the chasm deepens , first to 1,000 and then to 1,500 feet , " the torrent roars in the gorge , milk-white and swollen often with the melting snow , overhung with semi-tropical oleanders , fig-trees , and oriental planes , while the upper cliffs are clad with northern vegetation , two zones of climate thus being visible at once . " 146 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Belfort ( the modern Kulat-esh-Shukif ) , the river suddenly makes a turn at right angles , altering its course from nearly due south to nearly due west , and cuts through the remaining roots of Lebanon , still at the bottom of a tremendous fissure , and still raging and chafing for a distance of fifteen miles , until at length it debouches on the coast plain , and meanders slowly through meadows to the sea , 147 which it enters about five miles to the north of Tyre . The course of the Litany may be roughly estimated at from seventy to seventy-five miles . The other streams to which Lebanon gives birth flow either from its northern or its western flank . From the northern flank flows one stream only , the Nahr-el-Kebir or Eleutherus . The course of this stream is short , not much exceeding thirty miles . It rises from several sources at the edge of the Coelesyrian valley , and , receiving affluents from either side , flows westward between Bargylus and Lebanon to the Mediterranean , which it enters between Orthosia ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the volume of which is even in the summer-time considerable . In the rainy season it constitutes an important impediment to intercourse , since it frequently sweeps away any bridge which may be thrown across it , and is itself unfordable . Caravans sometimes remain encamped upon its banks for weeks , waiting until the swell has subsided and crossing is no longer dangerous. 148 From the western flank of Lebanon flow above a hundred streams of various dimensions , whereof the most important are the Nahr-el-Berid or river of Orthosia , the Kadisha or river of Tripolis , the Ibrahim or Adonis , the Nahr-el-Kelb or Lycus , the Damour or Tamyras , the Auly ( Aouleh ) or Bostrenus , and the Zaherany , of which the ancient name is unknown to us . The Nahr-el-Berid drains the north-western angle of the mountain chain , and is formed of two main branches , one coming down from the higher portion of the range , about Lat. 34 ? 20 ' , and flowing to the north-west , while the other descends from a region of much less elevation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little south of west to the point of junction . The united stream then forces its way down a gorge in a north-west direction , and enters the sea at Artousi , probably the ancient Orthosia. 149 The length of the river from its remotest fountain to its mouth is about twenty miles . The Kadisha or " Holy River " has its source in the deep basin already described , round which rise in a semicircle the loftiest peaks of the range , and on the edge of which stand " the Cedars . " Fed by the perpetual snows , it shortly becomes a considerable stream , and flows nearly due west down a beautiful valley , where the terraced slopes are covered with vineyards and mulberry groves , and every little dell , every nook and corner among the jagged rocks , every ledge and cranny on precipice-side , which the foot of man can reach , or on which a basket of earth can be deposited , is occupied with patch of corn or fruit-tree. 150 Lower down near Canobin the valley contracts into a sublime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on either side , and in places not leaving room for even a footpath beside the stream that flows along the bottom. 151 The water of the Kadisha is " pure , fresh , cool , and limpid , " 152 and makes a paradise along its entire course . Below Canobin the stream sweeps round in a semicircle towards the north , and still running in a picturesque glen , draws near to Tripolis , where it bends towards the north-west , and enters the sea after passing through the town . Its course , including main windings , measures about twenty-five miles . The Ibrahim , or Adonis , has its source near Afka ( Apheca ) in Lat. 34 ? 4 ' nearly . It bursts from a cave at the foot of a tremendous cliff , and its foaming waters rush down into a wild chasm. 153 Its flow is at first towards the north-west , but after receiving a small tributary from the north-east , it shapes its course nearly westward , and pursues this direction , with only slight bends to the north and south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea . After heavy rain in Lebanon , its waters , which are generally clear and limpid , become tinged with the earth which the swollen torrent detaches from the mountain-side , 154 and Adonis thus " runs purple to the sea "  --  not however once a year only , but many times . It enters the Mediterranean about four miles south of Byblus ( Jebeil ) and six north of Djouni . The Lycus or Nahr-el-Kelb ( " Dog River " ) flows from the northern and western flanks of Jebel Sunnin . It is formed by the confluence of three main streams . One of these rises near Afka , and runs to the south of west , past the castle and temples of Fakra , to its junction with the second stream , which is formed of several rivulets flowing from the northern flank of Sunnin . Near Bufkeiya the river constituted by the union of these two branches is joined by a third stream flowing from the western flank of Sunnin with a westerly course , and from this point the Lycus pursues its way in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mediterranean . Both banks are lofty , but especially that to the south , where one of Lebanon 's great roots strikes out far , and dips , a rocky precipice , into the bosom of the deep. 155 Low in the depths of the gorge the mad torrent dashes over its rocky bed in sheets of foam , its banks fringed with oleander , which it bathes with its spray . Above rise jagged precipices of white limestone , crowned far overhead by many a convent and village. 156 The course of the Nahr-el-Kelbis about equal to that of the Adonis . The Damour or Tamyras drains the western flank of Lebanon to the south of Jebel Sunnin ( about Lat. 33 ? 45 ' ) , the districts known as Menassif and Jourd Arkoub , about Barouk and Deir-el-Kamar . It collects the waters from an area of about 110 square miles , and carries them to the sea in a course which is a little north of west , reaching it half-way between Khan Khulda ( Heldua ) and Nebbi Younas . The scenery along its banks is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Nahr-el-Auly or Bostrenus rises from a source to the north-east of Barouk , and flows in a nearly straight course to the south-west for a distance of nearly thirty-five miles , when it is joined by a stream from Jezzin , which flows into it from the south-east . On receiving this stream , the Auly turns almost at a right angle , and flows to the west down the fine alluvial track called Merj Bisry , passing from this point through comparatively low ground , and between swelling hills , until it reaches the sea two miles to the north of Sidon . Its entire course is not less than sixty miles . The Zaherany repeats on a smaller scale the course of the Bostrenus . It rises near Jerju'a from the western flank of Jebel Rihan , the southern extremity of the Lebanon range , and flows at first to the south-west . The source is " a fine large fountain bursting forth with violence , and with water enough for a mill race . " 157 From this the river flows in a deep valley , brawling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grass shaded by black walnut-trees for a distance of about five miles , after which , just opposite Jerju'a , it breaks through one of the spurs from Rihan by a magnificent chasm . The gorge is one " than which there are few deeper or more savage in Lebanon . The mountains on each side rise up almost precipitously to the height of two or three thousand feet above the stream , that on the northern bank being considerably the higher . The steep sides of the southern mountain are dotted with shrub , oak , and other dwarf trees . " 158 The river descends in its chasm still in a south-west direction until , just opposite Arab Salim , it " turns round the precipitous corner or bastion of the southern Rihan into a straight valley , " and proceeds to run due south for a short distance . Meeting , however , a slight swell of ground , which blocks what would seem to have been its natural course , the river " suddenly turns west , " and breaking through a low ridge by a narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north of west to the Mediterranean , which it enters about midway between Sidon and Sarepta. 159 The length of the stream , including main windings , is probably not more than thirty-five miles . We have spoken of the numerous promontories , terminations of spurs from the mountains , which break the low coast-line into fragments , and go down precipitously into the sea . Of these there are two between Tyre and Acre , one known as the Ras-el-Abiad or " White Headland , " and the other as the Ras-en-Nakura . The former is a cliff of snow-white chalk interspersed with black flints , and rises perpendicularly from the sea to the height of three hundred feet. 160 The road , which in some places impends over the water , has been cut with great labour through the rock , and is said by tradition to have been the work of Alexander the Great . Previously , both here and at the Ras-en-Nakura , the ascent was by steps , and the passes were known as the Climaces Tyriorum , or " Staircases of the Tyrians . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its south side and has been engineered with considerable skill , first by the Egyptians and then by the Romans. 161 North of this , at Djouni , the coast road " traverses another pass , where the mountain , descending to the water , has been cut to admit it . " 162 Still further north , between Byblus and Tripolis , the bold promontory known to the ancients as Theu-prosopon , and now called the Ras-esh-Shakkah , is still unconquered , and the road has to quit the shore and make its way over the spur by a " wearisome ascent " 163 at some distance inland . Again , " beyond the Tamyras the hills press closely on the sea , " 164 and there is " a rocky and difficult pass , along which the path is cut for some distance in the rock . " 165 The effect of this conformation of the country was , in early times , to render Phoenicia untraversable by a hostile army , and at the same time to interpose enormous difficulties in the way of land communication among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the possibility of communicating by sea . The various " staircases " were painful and difficult to climb , they gave no passage to animals , and only light forms of merchandise could be conveyed by them . As soon as the first rude canoe put forth upon the placid waters of the Mediterranean , it must have become evident that the saving in time and labour would be great if the sea were made to supersede the land as the ordinary line of communication . The main characteristics of the country were , besides its inaccessibility , its picturesqueness and its productiveness . The former of these two qualities seems to have possessed but little attraction for man in his primitive condition . Beauties of nature are rarely sung of by early poets ; and it appears to require an educated eye to appreciate them . But productiveness is a quality the advantages of which can be perceived by all . The eyes which first looked down from the ridge of Bargylus or Lebanon upon the well-watered , well-wooded , and evidently fertile tract between the mountain summits and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marvellous and almost unequalled beauty , must at any rate have seen that here was one of earth 's most productive gardens  --  emphatically a " good land , " that might well content whosoever should be so fortunate as to possess it . There is nothing equal to it in Western Asia . The Damascene oasis , the lower valley of the Orontes , the Ghor or Jordan plain , the woods of Bashan , and the downs of Moab are fertile and attractive regions ; but they are comparatively narrow tracts and present little variety ; each is fitted mainly for one kind of growth , one class of products . Phoenicia , in its long extent from Mount Casius to Joppa , and in its combination of low alluvial plain , rich valley , sunny slopes and hills , virgin forests , and high mountain pasturage , has soils and situations suited for productions of all manner of kinds , and for every growth , from that of the lowliest herb to that of the most gigantic tree . In the next section an account of its probable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present it is enough to note that Western Asia contained no region more favoured or more fitted by its general position , its formation , and the character of its soil , to become the home of an important nation . CHAPTER II  --  CLIMATE AND PRODUCTIONS Climate of Phoenicia  --  Varieties  --  Climate of the coast , in the south , in the north  --  Climate of the more elevated regions  --  Vegetable productions  --  Principal trees  --  Most remarkable shrubs and fruit-trees  --  Herbs , flowers , and garden vegetables  --  Zoology  --  Land animals  --  Birds  --  Marine and fresh-water fish  --  Principal shell-fish  --  Minerals . The long extent of the Phoenician coast , and the great difference in the elevation of its various parts , give it a great diversity of climate . Northern Phoenicia is many degrees colder than southern ; and the difference is still more considerable between the coast tracts and the more elevated portions of the mountain regions . The greatest heat is experienced in the plain of Sharon , 21 which is at once the most southern portion of the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient elevation to exert an important influence on the temperature . Neither Carmel on the north , nor the hills of Samaria on the east , produce any sensible effect on the climate of the Sharon lowland . The heat in summer is intense , and except along the river courses the tract is burnt up , and becomes little more than an expanse of sand . As a compensation , the cold in winter is very moderate . Snow scarcely ever falls , and if there is frost it is short-lived , and does not penetrate into the ground. 22 Above Carmel the coast tract is decidedly less hot than the region south of it , and becomes cooler and cooler as we proceed northwards . Northern Phoenicia enjoys a climate that is delightful , and in which it would be difficult to suggest much improvement . The summer heat is scarcely ever too great , the thermometer rarely exceeding 90 ? of Fahrenheit , 23 and often sinking below 70 ? . Refreshing showers of rain frequently fall , and the breezes from the north , the east , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in part snow-clad , temper the heat of the sun 's rays and prevent it from being oppressive . The winter temperature seldom descends much below 50 ? ; and thus the orange , the lemon and the date-palm flourish in the open air , and the gardens are bright with flowers even in December and January . Snow falls occasionally , but it rarely lies on the ground for more than a few days , and is scarcely ever so much as a foot deep . On the other hand , rain is expected during the winter-time , and the entire line of coast is visited for some months with severe storms and gales , accompanied often by thunder and violent rain , 24 which strew the shore with wrecks and turn even insignificant mountain streams into raging torrents . The storms come chiefly from the west and north-west , quarters to which the harbours on the coast are unfortunately open. 25 Navigation consequently suffers interruption ; but when once the winter is past , a season of tranquillity sets in , and for many months of the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barometer scarcely varies , the sky is unclouded , and rain all but unknown . As the traveller mounts from the coast tract into the more elevated regions , the climate sensibly changes . An hour 's ride from the plains , when they are most sultry , will bring him into a comparatively cool region , where the dashing spray of the glacier streams is borne on the air , and from time to time a breeze that is actually cold comes down from the mountain-tops. 27 Shade is abundant , for the rocks are often perpendicular , and overhand the road in places , while the dense foliage of cedars , or pines , or walnut-trees , forms an equally effectual screen against the sun 's noonday rays . In winter the uplands are , of course , cold . Severe weather prevails in them from November to March ; 28 snow falls on all the high ground , while it rains on the coast and in the lowlands ; the passes are blocked ; and Lebanon and Bargylus replenish the icy stories which the summer 's heat has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered under the several heads of trees , shrubs , herbs , flowers , fruit-trees , and garden vegetables . The chief trees were the palm-tree , the sycamore , the maritime pine , and the plane in the lowlands ; in the highlands the cedar , Aleppo pine , oak , walnut , poplar , acacia , shumac , and carob . We have spoken of the former abundance of the palm . At present it is found in comparatively few places , and seldom in any considerable numbers . It grows singly , or in groups of two or three , at various points of the coast from Tripolis to Acre , but is only abundant in a few spots more towards the south , as at Haifa , under Carmel , where " fine date-palms " are numerous in the gardens , 29 and at Jaffa , where travellers remark " a broad belt of two or three miles of date-palms and orange-groves laden with fruit . " 210 The wood was probably not much used as timber except in the earliest times , since Lebanon afforded so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The date-palm was also valued for its fruit , though the produce of the Phoenician groves can never have been of a high quality . The sycamore , or sycamine-fig , is a dark-foliaged tree , with a gnarled stem when it is old ; 211 it grows either singly or in clumps , and much more resembles in appearance the English oak than the terebinth does , which has been so often compared to it . The stem is short , and sends forth wide lateral branches forking out in all directions , which renders the tree very easy to climb . It bears a small fig in great abundance , and probably at all seasons , which , however , is " tasteless and woody , " 212 though eaten by the inhabitants . The sycamore is common along the Phoenician lowland , but is a very tender tree and will not grow in the mountains . The plane-tree , common in Asia Minor , is not very frequent either in Phoenicia or Palestine . It occurs , however , on the middle course of the Litany , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also in many of the valleys214 on the western flank of the mountain . The maritime pine ( Pinus maritama ) extends in forests here and there along the shore , 215 and is found of service in checking the advance of the sand dunes , which have a tendency to encroach seriously on the cultivable soil . Of the upland trees the most common is the oak . There are three species of oak in the country . The most prevalent is an evergreen oak ( Quercus pseudococcifera ) , sometimes mistaken by travellers for a holly , sometimes for an ibex , which covers in a low dense bush many miles of the hilly country everywhere , and occasionally becomes a large tree in the Lebanon valleys , 216 and on the flanks of Casius and Bargylus . Another common oak is Quercus AEgilops , a much smaller and deciduous tree , very stout-trunked , which grows in scattered groups on Carmel and elsewhere , " giving a park-like appearance to the landscape . " 217 The third kind is Quercus infectoria , a gall-oak , also deciduous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chestnut-coloured , viscid galls which it bears , and which are now sometimes gathered for exportation. 218 Next to the oak may be mentioned the walnut , which grows to a great size in sheltered positions in the Lebanon range , both upon the eastern and upon the western flank ; 219 the poplar , which is found both in the mountains220 and in the low country , as especially about Beyrout ; 221 the Aleppo pine ( Pinus halepensis ) , of which there are large woods in Carmel , Lebanon , and Bargylus , 222 while in Casius there is an enormous forest of them ; 223 and the carob ( Ceratonia siliqua ) , or locust-tree , a dense-foliaged tree of a bright lucid green hue , which never grows in clumps or forms woods , but appears as an isolated tree , rounded or oblong , and affords the best possible shade. 224 In the vicinity of Tyre are found also large tamarisks , maples , sumachs , and acacias. 225 But the tree which is the glory of Phoenicia , and which was by far the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , the cedar . Growing to an immense height , and attaining an enormous girth , it spreads abroad its huge flat branches hither and thither , covering a vast space of ground with its " shadowing shroud , " 226 and presenting a most majestic and magnificent appearance . Its timber may not be of first-rate quality , and there is some question whether it was really used for the masts of their ships by the Phoenicians , 227 but as building material it was beyond a doubt most highly prized , answering sufficiently for all the purposes required by architectural art , and at the same time delighting the sense of smell by its aromatic odour . Solomon employed it both for the Temple and for his own house ; 228 the Assyrian kings cut it and carried it to Nineveh ; 229 Herod the Great used it for the vast additions that he made to Zerubbabel 's temple ; 230 it was exported to Egypt and Asia Minor ; the Ephesian Greeks constructed of cedar , probably of cedar from Lebanon , the roof of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lebanon in cedars is not great , but the four hundred which form the grove near the source of the Kadisha , and the many scattered cedar woods in other places , are to be viewed as remnants of one great primeval forest , which originally covered all the upper slopes on the western side , and was composed , if not exclusively , at any rate predominantly , of cedars. 232 Cultivation , the need of fuel , and the wants of builders , have robbed the mountain of its primitive bright green vest , and left it either bare rock or terraced garden ; but in the early times of Phoenicia , the true Lebanon cedar must undoubtedly have been its chief forest tree , and have stood to it as the pine to the Swiss Alps and the chestnut to the mountains of North Italy . Of shrubs , below the rank of trees , the most important are the lentisk ( Pistachia lentiscus ) , the bay , the arbutus ( A. andrachne ) , the cypress , the oleander , the myrtle , the juniper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rhododendron , the bramble , the caper plant , the small-leaved holly , the prickly pear , the honeysuckle , and the jasmine . Myrtle and rhododendron grow luxuriantly on the flanks of Bargylus , and are more plentiful than any other shrubs in that region. 233 Eastern Lebanon has abundant scrub of juniper and barberry ; 234 while on the western slopes their place is taken by the bramble , the myrtle , and the clematis. 235 The lentisk , which rarely exceeds the size of a low bush , is conspicuous by its dark evergreen leaves and numerous small red berries ; 236 the arbutus  --  not our species , but a far lighter and more ornamental shrub , the Arbutus andrachne  --  bears also a bright red fruit , which colours the thickets ; 237 the styrax , famous for yielding the gum storax of commerce , grows towards the east end of Carmel , and is a very large bush branching from the ground , but never assuming the form of a tree ; it has small downy leaves , white flowers like orange blossoms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like cherries. 238 Travellers in Phoenicia do not often mention the caper plant , but it was seen by Canon Tristram hanging from the fissures of the rock , in the cleft of the Litany , 239 amid myrtle and bay and clematis . The small-leaved holly was noticed by Mr. Walpole on the western flank of Bargylus. 240 The prickly pear is not a native of Asia , but has been introduced from the New World . It has readily acclimatised itself , and is very generally employed , in Phoenicia , as in the neighbouring countries , for hedges. 241 The fruit-trees of Phoenicia are numerous , and grow most luxuriantly , but the majority have no doubt been introduced from other countries , and the time of their introduction is uncertain . Five , however , may be reckoned as either indigenous or as cultivated at any rate from a remote antiquity  --  the vine , the olive , the date-palm , the walnut , and the fig . The vine is most widely spread . Vineyards cover large tracts in the vicinity of all the towns ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Bargylus , 242 hang upon the edge of precipices , and greet the traveller at every turn in almost every region . The size of individual vines is extraordinary . " Stephen Schultz states that in a village near Ptolemais ( Acre ) he supped under a large vine , the stem of which measured a foot and a half in diameter , its height being thirty feet ; and that the whole plant , supported on trellis , covered an area of fifty feet either way . The bunches of grapes weighed from ten to twelve pounds and the berries were like small plums . " 243 The olive in Phoenicia is at least as old as the Exodus , for it was said of Asher , who was assigned the more southern part of that country  --  " Let him be acceptable to his brethren , and let him dip his foot in oil . " 244 Olives at the present day clothe the slopes of Lebanon and Bargylus above the vine region , 245 and are carried upward almost to the very edge of the bare rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an excellent character . Fine olive-groves are also to be seen on Carmel , 246 in the neighbourhood of Esfia . The date-palm has already been spoken of as a tree , ornamenting the landscape and furnishing timber of tolerable quality . As a fruit-tree it is not greatly to be prized , since it is only about Haifa and Jaffa that it produces dates , 247 and those of no high repute . The walnut has all the appearance of being indigenous in Lebanon , where it grows to a great size , 248 and bears abundance of fruit . The fig is also , almost certainly , a native ; it grows plentifully , not only in the orchards about towns , but on the flanks of Lebanon , on Bargylus , and in the northern Phoenician plain. 249 The other fruit-trees of the present day are the mulberry , the pomegranate , the orange , the lemon , the lime , the peach , the apricot , the plum , the cherry , the quince , the apple , the pear , the almond , the pistachio nut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Lebanon250 in connection with the growth of silkworms , but is not valued as a fruit-tree . The pomegranate is far less often seen , but it is grown in the gardens about Saida , 251 and the fruit has sometimes been an article of exportation. 252 The orange and lemon are among the commonest fruits , but are generally regarded as comparatively late introductions . The lime is not often noticed , but obtains mention in the work of Mr. Walpole. 253 The peach and apricot are for the most part standard trees , though sometimes trained on trellises. 254 They were perhaps derived from Mesopotamia or Persia , but at what date it is quite impossible to conjecture . Apples , pears , plums , cherries , quinces , are not unlikely to have been indigenous , though of course the present species are the result of long and careful cultivation . The same may be said of the almond and the pistachio nut . The banana is a comparatively recent importation . It is grown along the coast from Jaffa as far north as Tripolis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent quality. 255 Altogether , Phoenicia may be pronounced a land of fruits . Hasselquist says , 256 that in his time Sidon grew pomegranates , apricots , figs , almonds , oranges , lemons , and plums in such abundance as to furnish annually several shiploads for export , while D'Arvieux adds to this list pears , peaches , cherries , and bananas. 257 Lebanon alone can furnish grapes , olives , mulberries , figs , apples , apricots , walnuts , cherries , peaches , lemons , and oranges . The coast tract adds pomegranates , limes , and bananas . It has been said that Carmel , a portion of Phoenicia , is " the garden of Eden run wild ; " 258 but the phrase might be fitly applied to the entire country . Of herbs possessing some value for man , Phoenicia produces sage , rosemary , lavender , rue , and wormwood. 259 Of flowers she has an extraordinary abundance . In early spring ( March and April ) not only the plains , but the very mountains , except where they consist of bare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loveliest hues260 from the floral wealth scattered over them . Bulbous plants are especially numerous . Travellers mention hyacinths , tulips , ranunculuses , gladioli , anemones , orchises , crocuses of several kinds  --  blue and yellow and white , arums , amaryllises , cyclamens , &c.,; besides heaths , jasmine , honeysuckle , clematis , multiflora roses , rhododendrons , oleander , myrtle , astragalus , hollyhocks , convolvuli , valerian , red linum , pheasant 's eye , guelder roses , antirrhinums , chrysanthemums , blue campanulas , and mandrakes . The orchises include " Ophrys atrata , with its bee-like lip , another like the spider orchis , and a third like the man orchis ; " 261 the cyclamens are especially beautiful , " nestling under every stone and lavish of their loveliness with graceful tufts of blossoms varying in hue from purest white to deepest purple pink . " 262 The multiflora rose is not common , but where it grows " covers the banks of streams with a sheet of blossom ; " 263 the oleanders fringe their waters with a line of ruby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the most striking plants of the country , with its flat disk of very broad primrose-like leaves , and its central bunch of dark blue bell-shaped blossom . " 264 Ferns also abound , and among them is the delicate maidenhair. 265 The principal garden vegetables grown at the present day are melons , cucumbers , gourds , pumpkins , turnips , carrots , and radishes. 266 The kinds of grain most commonly cultivated are wheat , barley , millet , and maize . There is also an extensive cultivation of tobacco , indigo , and cotton , which have been introduced from abroad in comparatively modern times . Oil , silk , and fruits are , however , still among the chief articles of export ; and the present wealth of the country is attributable mainly to its groves and orchards , its olives , mulberries , figs , lemons , and oranges . The zoology of Phoenicia has not until recently attracted very much attention . At present the list of land animals known to inhabit it is short , 267 including scarcely more than the bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hyaena , the jackal , the fox , the hare , the wild boar , the ichneumon , the gazelle , the squirrel , the rat , and the mole . The present existence of the bear within the limits of the ancient Phoenicia has been questioned , 268 but the animal has been seen in Lebanon by Mr. Porter , 269 and in the mountains of Galilee by Canon Tristram. 270 The species is the Syrian bear ( Ursus syriacus ) , a large and fierce beast , which , though generally frugivorous , will under the presser of hunger attack both men and animals . Its main habitat is , no doubt , the less accessible parts of Lebanon ; but in the winter it will descend to the villages and gardens , where it often does much damage. 271 The panther or leopard has , like the bear , been seen by Mr. Porter in the Lebanon range ; 272 and Canon Tristram , when visiting Carmel , was offered the skin of an adult leopard273 which had probably been killed in that neighbourhood . Anciently it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at present , as appears by the numerous notices of it in Scripture. 274 Wolves , hyaenas , and jackals are comparatively common . They haunt not only Carmel and Lebanon , but many portions of the coast tract . Canon Tristram obtained from Carmel " the two largest hyaenas that he had ever seen , " 275 and fell in with jackals in the vicinity. 276 Wolves seem to be more scarce , though anciently very plentiful . The favourite haunts of the wild boar ( Sus scrofa ) in Phoenicia are Carmel277 and the deep valleys on the western slope of Lebanon . The valley of the Adonis ( Ibrahim ) is still noted for them , 278 but , except on Carmel , they are not very abundant . Foxes and hares are also somewhat rare , and it is doubtful whether rabbits are to be found in any part of the country ; 279 ichneumons , which are tolerably common , seem sometimes to be mistaken for them . Gazelles are thought to inhabit Carmel , 280 and squirrels , rats , and moles are common . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are frequent ; they belong , it is probable , to several species , one of which is Xantharpyia aegyptiaca. 281 If the fauna of Phoenicia is restricted so far as land-animals are concerned , it is extensive and varied in respect of birds . The list of known birds includes two sorts of eagle ( Circaetos gallicus and Aquila naevioides ) , the osprey , the vulture , the falcon , the kite , the honey-buzzard , the marsh-harrier , the sparrow-hawk , owls of two kinds ( Ketupa ceylonensis and Athene meridionalis ) , the grey shrike ( Lanius excubitor ) , the common cormorant , the pigmy cormorant ( Graeculus pygmaeus ) , numerous seagulls , as the Adriatic gull ( Larus melanocephalus ) , Andonieri 's gull , the herring-gull , the Red-Sea-gull ( Larus ichthyo-aetos ) , and others ; the gull-billed tern ( Sterna anglica ) , the Egyptian goose , the wild duck , the woodcock , the Greek partridge ( Caccabis saxatilis ) , the waterhen , the corncrake or landrail , the coot , the water-ouzel , the francolin ; plovers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; dotterels of two kinds , red-throated and Asiatic ; the Manx shearwater , the flamingo , the heron , the common kingfisher , and the black and white kingfisher of Egypt , the jay , the wood-pigeon , the rock-dove , the blue thrush , the Egyptian fantail ( Drymoeca gracilis ) , the redshank , the wheat-ear ( Saxicola libanotica ) , the common lark , the Persian horned lark , the cisticole , the yellow-billed Alpine chough , the nightingale of the East ( Ixos xanthopygius ) , the robin , the brown linnet , the chaffinch ; swallows of two kinds ( Hirundo cahirica and Hirundo rufula ) ; the meadow bunting ; the Lebanon redstart , the common and yellow water-wagtails , the chiffchaff , the coletit , the Russian tit , the siskin , the nuthatch , and the willow wren . Of these the most valuable for the table are the partridge , the francolin , and the woodcock . The Greek partridge is " a fine red-legged bird , much larger than our red-legged partridge , and very much better eating , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " 282 The francolin or black partridge is also a delicacy ; and the woodcock , which is identical with our own , has the same delicate flavour . The fish of Phoenicia , excepting certain shell-fish , are little known , and have seldom attracted the attention of travellers . The Mediterranean , however , where it washes the Phoenician coast , can furnish excellent mullet , 283 while most of the rivers contain freshwater fish of several kinds , as the Blennius lupulus , the Scaphiodon capoeta , and the Anguilla microptera. 284 All of these fish may be eaten , but the quality is inferior . On the other hand , to certain of the shell-fish of Phoenicia a great celebrity attaches . The purple dye which gave to the textile fabrics of the Phoenicians a world-wide reputation was prepared from certain shell-fish which abounded upon their coast . Four existing species have been regarded as more or less employed in the manufacture , and it seems to be certain , at any rate , that the Phoenicians derived the dye from more shell-fish than one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is the Purpura lapillus of modern naturalists ; the Murex trunculus ; the Murex brandaris ; and the Helix ianthina . The Buccinum derives its name from the form of the shell , which has a wide mouth , like that of a trumpet , and which after one or two twists terminates in a pointed head. 286 The Murex trunculus has the same general form as the Buccinum ; but the shell is more rough and spinous , being armed with a number of long thin projections which terminate in a sharp point. 287 The Murex brandaris is a closely allied species , and " one of the most plentiful on the Phoenician coast . " 288 It is unlikely that the ancients regarded it as a different shell from Murex trunculus . The Helix ianthina has a wholly different character . It is a sort of sea-snail , as the name helix implies , is perfectly smooth , " very delicate and fragile , and not more than about three-quarters of an inch in diameter . " 289 All these shell-fish contain a sac or bag full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dye . It is quite possible that they were all , more or less , made use of by the Phoenician dyers ; but the evidence furnished by existing remains on the Tyrian coast is strongly in favour of the Murex brandaris as the species principally employed. 290 The mineral treasures of Phoenicia have not , in modern times , been examined with any care . The Jura limestone , which forms the substratum of the entire region , can not be expected to yield any important mineral products . But the sandstone , which overlies it in places , is " often largely impregnated with iron , " and some strata towards the southern end of Lebanon are said to produce " as much as ninety per cent . of pure iron ore . " 291 An ochrous earth is also found in the hills above Beyrout , which gives from fifty to sixty per cent . of metal. 292 Coal , too , has been found in the same locality , but it is of bad quality , and does not exist in sufficient quantity to form an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is plentiful , as are sandstone , trap and basalt ; while porphyry and greenstone are also obtainable. 293 Carmel yields crystals of quarts and chalcedony , 294 and the fine sand about Tyre and Sidon is still such as would make excellent glass . But the main productions of Phoenicia , in which its natural wealth consisted , must always have been vegetable , rather than animal or mineral , and have consisted in its timber , especially its cedars and pines ; its fruits , as olives , figs , grapes , and , in early times , dates ; and its garden vegetables , melons , gourds , pumpkins , cucumbers .

This group , somewhat irrelevantly named , since the descent of several of them from Shem is purely problematic , comprises the Assyrians , the later Babylonians , the Aramaeans or Syrians , the Arabians , the Moabites , the Phoenicians , and the Hebrews . A single and very marked type of language belongs to the entire group , and a character of homogeneity may , with certain distinctions , be observed among all the various members composing it . The unity of language is threefold : it may be traced in the roots , in the inflections , and in the general features of the syntax . The roots are , as a rule , bilateral or trilateral , composed ( that is ) of two or three letters , all of which are consonants . The consonants determine the general sense of the words , and are alone expressed in the primitive writing ; the vowel sounds do but modify more or less the general sense , and are unexpressed until the languages begin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them , more or less physical and sensuous . They are derived in general from an imitation of nature . " If one looked only to the Semitic languages , " says M. Renan , 31 " one would say , that sensation alone presided over the first acts of the human intellect , and that language was primarily nothing but a mere reflex of the external world . If we run through the list of Semitic roots , we scarcely meet with a single one which does not present to us a sense primarily material , which is then transferred , by transitions more or less direct and immediate , to things which are intellectual . " Derivative words are formed from the roots by a few simple and regular laws . The noun is scarcely inflected at all ; but the verb has a marvellous wealth of conjugations , calculated to express excellently well the external relations of ideas , but altogether incapable of expressing their metaphysical relations , from the want of definitely marked tenses and moods . Inflections in general have a half-agglutinative character , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Syntax scarcely exists , the construction of sentences having such a general character of simplicity , especially in narrative , that one might compare it with the naive utterances of an infant . The utmost endeavour of the Semites is to join words together so as to form a sentence ; to join sentences is an effort altogether beyond them . They employ the lexis eiromene of Aristotle , 32 which proceeds by accumulating atom on atom , instead of attempting the rounded period of the Latins and Greeks . The common traits of character among Semitic nations have been summed up by one writer under five heads :  --  1 . Pliability combined with iron fixity of purpose ; 2 . Depth and force ; 3 . A yearning for dreamy ease ; 4 . Capacity for the hardest work ; and 5 . Love of abstract thought. 33 Another has thought to find them in the following list :  --  1 . An intuitive monotheism ; 2 . Intolerance ; 3 . Prophetism ; 4 . Want of the philisophic and scientific faculties ; 5 . Want of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; 7 . Want of capacity for true political life. 34 According to the latter writer , " the Semitic race is to be recognized almost entirely by negative characteristics ; it has no mythology , no epic poetry , no science , no philosophy , no fiction , no plastic arts , no civil life ; everywhere it shows absence of complexity ; absence of combination ; an exclusive sentiment of unity . " 35 It is not very easy to reconcile these two views , and not very satisfactory to regard a race as " characterised by negatives . " Agreement should consist in positive features , and these may perhaps be found , first , in strength and depth of the religious feeling , combined with firm belief in the personality of the Deity ; secondly , in dogged determination and " iron fixity of purpose ; " thirdly , in inventiveness and skill in the mechanical arts and other industries ; fourthly , in " capacity for hard work ; " and , fifthly , in a certain adaptability and pliability , suiting the race for expansion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conspicuous in all the branches of the Semites , but the majority of them will be found united in all , and in some the combination would seem to be complete . It is primarily on account of their language that the Phoenicians are regarded as Semites . When there are no historical grounds for believing that a nation has laid aside its own original form of speech , and adopted an alien dialect , language , if not a certain , is at least a very strong , evidence of ethnic character . Counter-evidence may no doubt rebut the prima facie presumption ; but in the case of the Phoenicians no counter-evidence is producible . They belong to exactly that geographic zone in which Semitism has always had its chief seat ; they can not be shown to have been ever so circumstanced as to have had any inducement to change their speech ; and their physical character and mental characteristics would , by themselves , be almost sufficient ground for assigning them to the type whereto their language points . The place which the Phoenicians occupy within the Semitic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By local position they should belong to the western , or Aramaic branch , rather than to the eastern , or Assyro-Babylonian , or to the southern , or Arab . But the linguistic evidence scarcely lends itself to such a view , while the historic leads decidedly to an opposite conclusion . There is a far closer analogy between the Palestinian group of languages  --  Phoenician , Hebrew , Moabite , and the Assyro-Babylonian , than between either of these and the Aramaic . The Aramaic is scanty both in variety of grammatical forms and in vocabulary ; the Phoenician and Assyro-Babylonian are comparatively copious. 36 The Aramaic has the character of a degraded language ; the Assyro-Babylonian and the Phoenician are modelled on a primitive type. 37 In some respects Phoenician is even closer to Assyro-Babylonian than Hebrew is  --  e.g. in preferring at to ah for the feminine singular termination. 38 The testimony of history to the origin of the Phoenicians is the following . Herodotus tells us that both the Phoenicians themselves , and the Persians best acquainted with history and antiquities , agreed in stating that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Erythraean Sea ( Persian Gulf ) , and that they had migrated from that quarter at a remote period , and transferred their abode to the shores of the Mediterranean. 39 Strabo adds that the inhabitants of certain islands in the Persian Gulf had a similar tradition , and showed temples in their cities which were Phoenician in character. 310 Justin , or rather Trogus Pompeius , whom he abbreviated , writes as follows :  --  " The Syrian nation was founded by the Phoenicians , who , being disturbed by an earthquake , left their native land , and settled first of all in the neighbourhood of the Assyrian Lake , and subsequently on the shore of the Mediterranean , where they built a city which they called Sidon on account of the abundance of the fish ; for the Phoenicians call a fish sidon. " 311 The " Assyrian lake " of this passage is probably the Bahr Nedjif , or " Sea of Nedjif , " in the neighbourhood of the ancient Babylon , a permanent sheet of water , varying in its dimensions at different seasons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to twenty broad. 312 Attempts have been made to discredit this entire story , but the highest living authority on the subject of Phoenicia and the Phoenicians adopts it as almost certainly true , and observes :  --  " The tradition relative to the sojourn of the Phoenicians on the borders of the Erythraean Sea , before their establishment on the coast of the Mediterranean , has thus a new light thrown upon it . It appears from the labours of M. Movers , and from the recent discoveries made at Nineveh and Babylon , that the civilisation and religion of Phoenicia and Assyria were very similar . Independently of this , the majority of modern critics admit it as demonstrated that the primitive abode of the Phoenicians ought to be placed upon the Lower Euphrates , in the midst of the great commercial and maritime establishments of the Persian Gulf , agreeable to the unanimous witness of all antiquity . " 313 If we pass from the probable origin of the Phoenician people , and their place in the Semitic group , to their own special characteristics , we shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are certain points which are debateable . The following is the account of their general character given by a very high authority , and by one who , on the whole , may be regarded as an admirer :  --  " The Phoenicians form , in some respects , the most important fraction of the whole group of antique nations , notwithstanding that they sprang from the most obscure and insignificant families . This fraction , when settled , was constantly exposed to inroad by new tribes , was utterly conquered and subjected by utter strangers when it had taken a great place among the nations , and yet by industry , by perseverance , by acuteness of intellect , by unscrupulousness and wait of faith , by adaptability and pliability when necessary , and dogged defiance at other times , by total disregard of the rights of the weaker , they obtained the foremost place in the history of their times , and the highest reputation , not only for the things that they did , but for many that they did not . They were the first systematic traders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( if we apply such a term to those who kept an ever-watchful lookout for the inventions of others , and immediately applied them to themselves with some grand improvements on the original idea ) ; they were the boldest mariners , the greatest colonisers , who at one time held not only the gorgeous East , but the whole of the then half-civilised West in fee  --  who could boast of a form of government approaching to constitutionalism , who of all nations of the time stood highest in practical arts and sciences , and into whose laps there flowed an unceasing stream of the world 's entire riches , until the day came when they began to care for nothing else , and the enjoyment of material comforts and luxuries took the place of the thirst for and search after knowledge . Their piratical prowess and daring was undermined ; their colonies , grown old enough to stand alone , fell away from them , some after a hard fight , others in mutual agreement or silently ; and the nations in whose estimation and fear they had held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , disdained them , ignored them , and finally struck them utterly out of the list of nations , till they dwindled away miserably , a warning to all who should come after them . " 314 The prominent qualities in this description would seem to be industry and perseverance , audacity in enterprise , adaptability and pliability , acuteness of intellect , unscrupulousness , and want of good faith . The Phoenicians were certainly among the most industrious and persevering of mankind . The accounts which we have of them from various quarters , and the remains which cover the country that they once inhabited , sufficiently attest their unceasing and untiring activity through almost the whole period of their existence as a nation . Always labouring in their workshops at home in mechanical and aesthetic arts , they were at the same time constantly seeking employment abroad , ransacking the earth for useful or beautiful commodities , building cities , constructing harbours , founding colonies , introducing the arts of life among wild nations , mining and establishing fisheries , organising lines of land traffic , perpetually moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abundant proofs of their diligence and capacity for hard work . From Thasos in the East , where Herodotus saw " a large mountain turned topsy-turvy by the Phoenicians in their search for gold , " 315 to the Scilly Islands in the West , where workings attributable to them are still to be seen , all the metalliferous islands and coast tracts bear traces of Phoenician industry in tunnels , adits , and air-shafts , while manufactured vessels of various kinds in silver , bronze , and terra-cotta , together with figures and gems of a Phoenician type , attest still more widely their manufacturing and commercial activity . Audacity in enterprise can certainly not be denied to the adventurous race which , from the islands and coasts of the Eastern Mediterranean , launched forth upon the unknown sea in fragile ships , affronted the perils of waves and storms , and still more dreaded " monsters of the deep , " 316 explored the recesses of the stormy Adriatic and inhospitable Pontus , steered their perilous course amid all the islets and rocks of the AEgean , along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first into the Western Mediterranean basin , and then through the Straits of Gibraltar into the wild and boundless Atlantic , with its mighty tides , its huge rollers , its blinding rains , and its frequent fogs . Without a chart , without a compass , guided only in their daring voyages by their knowledge of the stars , these bold mariners penetrated to the shores of Scythia in one direction ; to Britain , if not even to the Baltic , in another ; in a third to the Fortunate Islands ; while , in a fourth , they traversed the entire length of the Red Sea , and entering upon the Southern Ocean , succeeded in doubling the Cape of Storms two thousand years before Vasco di Gama , and in effecting the circumnavigation of Africa. 317 And , wild as the seas were with which they had to deal , they had to deal with yet wilder men . Except in Egypt , Asia Minor , Greece , and perhaps Italy , they came in contact everywhere with savage races ; they had to enter into close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were almost always thieves , who were frequently cannibals , sometimes wreckers  --  who regarded foreigners as a cheap and very delicious kind of food . The pioneers of civilisation , always and everywhere , incur dangers from which ordinary mortals would shrink with dismay ; but the earliest pioneers , the first introducers of the elements of culture among barbarians who had never heard of it , must have encountered far greater peril than others from their ignorance of the ways of savage man , and a want of those tremendous weapons of attack and defence with which modern explorers take care to provide themselves . Until the invention of gunpowder , the arms of civilised men  --  swords , and spears , and javelins , and the like  --  were scarcely a match for the cunningly devised weapons  --  boomerangs , and blow-pipes , and poisoned arrows , and lassoes318  --  of the savage . The adaptability and pliability of the Phoenicians was especially shown in their power of obtaining the favourable regard of almost all the peoples and nations with which they came into contact , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Egyptians , intolerant as they usually were of strangers , should have allowed the Phoenicians to settle in their southern capital , Memphis , and to build a temple and inhabit a quarter there. 319 It is also curious and interesting that the Phoenicians should have been able to ingratiate themselves with another most exclusive and self-sufficing people , viz. the Jews . Hiram 's friendly dealings with David and Solomon are well known ; but the continued alliance between the Phoenicians and the Israelites has attracted less attention . Solomon took wives from Phoenicia ; 320 Ahab married the daughter of Ithobalus , king of Sidon ; 321 Phoenicia furnished timber for the second Temple ; 322 Isaiah wound up his prophecy against Tyre with a consolation ; 323 our Lord found faith in the Syro-Phoenician woman ; 324 in the days of Herod Agrippa , Tyre and Sidon still desired peace with Judaea , " because their country was nourished by the king 's country . " 325 And similarly Tyre had friendly relations with Syria and Greece , with Mesopotamia and Assyria , with Babylonia and Chaldaea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wants and gain the confidence of all the varieties of barbarians , the rude Armenians , the wild Arabs , the barbarous tribes of northern and western Africa , the rough Iberi , the passionate Gauls , the painted Britons , the coarse Sards , the fierce Thracians , the filthy Scyths , the savage races of the Caucasus . Tribes so timid and distrustful as those of Tropical Africa were lured into peaceful and friendly relations by the artifice of a " dumb commerce , " 326 and on every side untamed man was softened and drawn towards civilisation by a spirit of accommodation , conciliation , and concession to prejudices . If the Phoenicians are to be credited with acuteness of intellect , it must be limited to the field of practical enquiry and discovery . Whatever may be said with regard to the extent and variety of their literature  --  a subject which will be treated in another chapter  --  it can not be pretended that humanity owes to them any important conquests of a scientific or philosophic character . Herodotus , who admires the learning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 328 and the combined learning and science of the Egyptians , 329 limits his commendation of the Phoenicians to their skill in navigation , in mechanics , and in works of art. 330 Had they made advances in the abstract , or even in the mixed , sciences , in mathematics , or astronomy , or geometry , in logic or metaphysics , either their writings would have been preserved , or at least the Greeks would have made acknowledgments of being indebted to them. 331 But it is only in the field of practical matters that any such acknowledgments are made . The Greeks allow themselves to have been indebted to the Phoenicians for alphabetic writing , for advances in metallurgy , for improvements in shipbuilding , and navigation , for much geographic knowledge , for exquisite dyes , and for the manufacture of glass . There can be no doubt that the Phoenicians were a people of great practical ability , with an intellect quick to devise means to ends , to scheme , contrive , and execute , and with a happy knack of perceiving what was practically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriating them to their own use , often with improvements upon the original idea . But they were not possessed of any great genius or originality . They were , on the whole , adapters rather than inventors . They owed their idea of alphabetic writing to the Accadians , 332 their weights and measures to Babylon , 333 their shipbuilding probably to Egypt , 334 their early architecture to the same country , 335 their mimetic art to Assyria , to Egypt , and to Greece . They were not poets , or painters , or sculptors , or great architects , much less philosophers or scientists ; but in the practical arts , and even in the practical sciences , they held a high place , in almost all of them equalling , and in some exceeding , all their neighbours . We should be inclined also to assign to the Phoenicians , as a special characteristic , a peculiar capacity for business . This may be said , indeed , to be nothing more than acuteness of intellect applied in a particular way . To ourselves , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a special gift . As , beyond all question , there are many persons of extremely acute intellect who have not the slightest turn for business , or ability for dealing with it , so we think there are nations , to whom no one would deny high intellectual power , without the capacity in question . In its most perfect form it has belonged but to a small number of nations  --  to the Phoenicians , the Venetians , the Genoese , the English , and the Dutch . It implies , not so much high intellectual power , as a combination of valuable , yet not very admirable , qualities of a lower order . Industry , perseverance , shrewdness , quickness of perception , power of forecasting the future , power of organisation , boldness , promptness , are among the qualities needed , and there may be others discoverable by the skilful analyst . All these met in the Phoenicians , and met in the proportions that were needed for the combination to take full effect . Whether unscrupulousness and want of good faith are rightly assigned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the least , open to doubt . The Latin writers , with whom the reproach contained in the expression " Punica fides " originated , are scarcely to be accepted as unprejudiced witnesses , since it is in most instances a necessity that they should either impute " bad faith " to the opposite side , or admit that there was " bad faith " on their own . The aspersions of an enemy are entitled to little weight . The cry of " perfide Albion " is often heard in the land of one of our near neighbours ; but few Englishmen will admit the justice of it . It may be urged in favour of the Phoenicians that long-continued commercial success is impossible without fair-dealing and honesty ; that where there is commercial fair-dealing and honesty , those qualities become part and parcel of the national character , and determine national policy ; and , further , that in almost every one of the instances of bad faith alleged , there is at the least a doubt , of which the accused party ought to have the benefit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charges made affect the Liby-Phoenicians alone , and not the Phoenicians of Asia , with whom we are here primarily concerned , and that we can not safely , or equitably , transfer to a mother-country faults which are only even alleged against one of her colonies . Physically , the Phoenicians appear to have resembled the Assyrians and the Jews . They had large frames strongly made , well-developed muscles , curled beards , and abundant hair . In their features they may have borne a resemblance , but probably not a very strong resemblance , to the Cypriots , 336 who were a mixed people recruited from various quarters. 337 In complexion they belonged to the white race , but were rather sallow than fair . Their hair was generally dark , though it may have been sometimes red . Some have regarded the name " Phoenician " as indicating that they were of a red or red-brown colour ; 338 but it is better to regard the appellation as having passed from the country to its people , and as applied to the country by the Greeks on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHAPTER IV  --  THE CITIES Importance of the cities in Phoenicia  --  Their names and relative eminence  --  Cities of the first rank  --  Sidon  --  Tyre  - -  Arvad or Aradus  --  Marathus  --  Gebal or Byblus  --  Tripolis  --  Cities of the second rank  --  Aphaca  --  Berytus  --  Arka  --  Ecdippa  --  Accho  - -  Dor  --  Japho or Joppa  --  Ramantha or Laodicea  --  Fivefold division of Phoenicia . Phoenicia , like Greece , was a country where the cities held a position of extreme importance . The nation was not a centralised one , with a single recognised capital , like Judaea , or Samaria , or Syria , or Assyria , or Babylonia . It was , like Greece , a congeries of homogeneous tribes , who had never been amalgamated into a single political entity , and who clung fondly to the idea of separate independence . Tyre and Sidon are often spoken of as if they were metropolitical cities ; but it may be doubted whether there was ever a time when either of them could claim even a temporary authority over the whole country . Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sort of hegemony over a certain number of the inferior cities ; but there was no organised confederacy , no obligation of any one city to submit to another , and no period , as far as our knowledge extends , at which all the cities acknowledged a single one as their mistress. 41 Between Tyre and Sidon there was especial jealousy , and the acceptance by either of the leadership of the other , even temporarily , was a rare fact in the history of the nation . According to the geographers , the cities of Phoenicia , from Laodicea in the extreme north to Joppa at the extreme south , numbered about twenty-five . These were Laodicea , Gabala , Balanea , Paltos ; Aradus , with its dependency Antaradus ; Marathus ; Simyra , Orthosia , and Arka ; Tripolis , Calamus , Trieris , and Botrys ; Byblus or Gebal ; Aphaca ; Berytus ; Sidon , Sarepta , and Ornithonpolis ; Tyre and Ecdippa ; Accho and Porphyreon ; Dor and Joppa . Of the twenty-five a certain number were , historically and politically , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Orthosia , Calamus , Trieris , Botrys , Sarepta , Ornithonpolis , Porphyreon . Sarepta is immortalised by the memory of its pious widow , 42 and Orthosia has a place in history from its connection with the adventures of Trypho ; 43 but the rest of the list are little more than " geographical expressions . " There remain fifteen important cities , of which six may be placed in the first rank and nine in the second  --  the six being Tyre , Sidon , Aradus , Byblus or Gebal , Marathus , and Tripolis ; the nine , Laodicea , Simyra , Arka , Aphaca , Berytus , Ecdippa , Accho , Dor , and Joppa . It will be sufficient in the present place to give some account of these fifteen . There are some grounds for considering Sidon to have been the most ancient of the Phoenician towns . In the Book of Genesis Sidon is called " the eldest born of Canaan , " 44 and in Joshua , where Tyre is simply a " fenced city " or fort , 45 it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 47 whereas he takes no notice of Tyre . Justin makes it the first town which the Phoenicians built on arriving at the shores of the Mediterranean. 48 The priority of Sidon in this respect was , however , not universally acknowledged , since Tyre claims on some of her coins to have been " the mother-city of the Sidonians , " 49 and Marathus was also regarded as a city of the very highest antiquity. 410 The city stood in Lat. 33 ? 34 ' nearly , on the flat plain between the mountains and the shore , opposite a small promontory which projects into the sea towards the west , and is flanked towards the north-west and north by a number of rocky islands . The modern town of Saida stands close upon the shore , occupying the greater part of the peninsula and a portion of the plain on which it abuts ; but the ancient city is found to have been situated entirely in the plain , and its most western traces are almost half a mile from the nearest point of the present walls. 411 The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ port of the ancient town , which lay north of the promontory , and was well protected from winds , on the west by the principal island , which has a length of 250 yards , and on the north by a long range of islets and reefs , extending in a north-easterly direction a distance of at least 600 yards . An excellent roadstead was thus formed by nature , which art early improved into a small but commodious harbour , a line of wall being carried out from the coast northwards to the most easterly of the islets , and the only unprotected side of the harbour being thus securely closed . There is reason to believe that this work was completed anterior to the time of Alexander , 412 and was therefore due to the Phoenicians themselves , who were not blind to the advantages of closed harbours over open roadsteads . They seem also to have strengthened the natural barrier towards the north by a continuous wall of huge blocks along the reefs and the islets , portions of which are still in existence . Besides this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sidon possessed on the southern side of the peninsula a second refuge for its ships , less safe , but still more spacious . This was an oval basin , 600 yards long from north to south , and nearly 400 broad from east to west , wholly surrounded by land on three sides , the north , the east , and the south , but open for the space of about 200 yards towards the west . In fine weather this harbour was probably quite as much used as the other ; it was protected from all the winds that were commonly prevalent , and offered a long stretch of sandy shore free from buildings on which vessels could be drawn up . It is impossible to mark out the enceinte of the ancient town , or indeed to emplace it with any exactitude . Only scanty and scattered remains are left here and there between the modern city and the mountains . There is , however , towards the south an extensive necropolis , 413 which marks perhaps the southern limits of the city , while towards the east @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and tombs of various kinds , which were also probably outside the walls . Were a northern necropolis to be discovered , some idea would be furnished of the extent of the city ; but at present the plain has been very imperfectly examined in this direction . It is from the southern necropolis that the remarkable inscription was disinterred which first established beyond all possibility of doubt the fact that the modern Saida is the representative of the ancient Sidon. 414 Twenty miles to the south of Sidon was the still more important city  --  the double city  --  of Tzur or Tyre . Tzur signifies " a rock , " and at this point of the Syrian coast ( Lat. 33 ? 17 ' ) there lay at a short distance from the shore a set of rocky islets , on the largest of which the original city seems to have been built . Indentations are so rare and so shallow along this coast , that a maritime people naturally looked out for littoral islands , as affording under the circumstances the best protection against boisterous winds ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and occupied by Phoenician settlers , so in the south the rock , which became the heart of Tyre , was seized , fortified , covered with buildings , and converted from a bare stony eminence into a town . At the same time , or not much later , a second town grew up on the mainland opposite the isle ; and the two together were long regarded as constituting a single city . After the time of Alexander the continental town went to decay ; and the name of Palae-Tyrus was given to it , 415 to distinguish it from the still flourishing city on the island . The islands of which we have spoken formed a chain running nearly in parallel to the coast . They were some eleven or twelve in number . The southern extremity of the chain was formed by three , the northern by seven , small islets. 416 Intermediate between these lay two islands of superior size , which were ultimately converted into one by filling up the channel between them . A further enlargement was effected by means of substructions thrown out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the east and towards the south . By these means an area was produced sufficient for the site of a considerable town . Pliny estimated the circumference of the island Tyre at twenty-two stades , 417 or somewhat more than two miles and a half . Modern measurements make the actual present area one of above 600,000 square yards. 418 The shape was an irregular trapezium , 1,400 yards along its western face , 800 yards along its southern one , 600 along the face towards the east , and rather more along the face towards the north-east . The whole town was surrounded by a lofty wall , the height of which , on the side which faced the mainland , was , we are told , a hundred and fifty feet. 419 Towards the south the foundations of the wall were laid in the sea , and may still be traced. 420 They consist of huge blocks of stone strengthened inside by a conglomerate of very hard cement . The wall runs out from the south-eastern corner of what was the original island , in a direction a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line of the western coast , when it turns at a sharp angle , and rejoins the island at its south-western extremity . At present sea is found for some distance to the north of the wall , and this fact has been thought to show that originally it was intended for a pier or quay , and the space within it for a harbour ; 421 but the latest explorers are of opinion that the space was once filled up with masonry and rubbish , being an artificial addition to the island , over which , in the course of time , the sea has broken , and reasserted its rights. 422 Like Sidon , Tyre had two harbours , a northern and a southern . The northern , which was called the " Sidonian , " because it looked towards Sidon , was situated on the east of the main island , towards the northern end of it . On the west and south the land swept round it in a natural curve , effectually guarding two sides ; while the remaining two were protected by art . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a direction a little south of east for a distance of about three hundred yards , the space between the two lines being about a hundred feet . The northern line acted as a sort of breakwater , the southern as a pier . This last terminated towards the east on reaching a ridge of natural rock , and was there met by the eastern wall of the harbour , which ran out in a direction nearly due north for a distance of 250 yards , following the course of two reefs , which served as its foundation . Between the reefs was a space of about 140 feet , which was left open , but could be closed , if necessary , by a boom or chain , which was kept in readiness . The dimensions of this northern harbour are thought to have been about 370 yards from north to south , by about 230 from east to west , 423 or a little short of those which have been assigned to the northern harbour of Sidon . Concerning the southern harbour there is considerable difference of opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it due south of the island , and regard its boundary as the line of submarine wall which we have already described and regarded as constituting the southern wall of the town . Others locate it towards the south-east , and think that it is now entirely filled up . A canal connected the two ports , so that vessels could pass from the one to the other . The most remarkable of the Tyrian buildings were the royal palace , which abutted on the southern wall of the town , and the temples dedicated to Baal , Melkarth , Agenor , and Astarte or Ashtoreth. 424 The probable character of the architecture of these buildings will be hereafter considered . With respect to their emplacement , it would seem by the most recent explorations that the temple of Baal , called by the Greeks that of the Olympian Zeus , stood by itself on what was originally a separate islet at the south-western corner of the city , 425 while that of Melkarth occupied a position as nearly as possible central , 426 and that of Agenor was placed near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 427 The houses of the inhabitants were closely crowded together , and rose to the height of several storeys. 428 There was an open space for the transaction of business within the walls towards the east , called Eurychorus by those Phoenicians who wrote their histories in Greek. 429 The town was full of dyeing establishments , which made it difficult to traverse. 430 The docks and dockyards were towards the east . The population of the island Tyre , when it was captured by Alexander , seems to have been about forty thousand souls. 431 As St. Malo , a city less than one-third of the size , is known to have had at one time a population of twelve thousand , 432 the number , though large for the area , would seem not to be incredible . Of Palae-Tyrus , or the continental Tyre , no satisfactory account can be given , since it has absolutely left no remains , and the classical notices on the subject are exceedingly scanty . At different periods of its history , its limits and extent probably varied greatly . Its position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times it must have been , like the other coast towns , strongly fortified ; but after its capture by Alexander the walls do not seem to have been restored , and it became an open straggling town , extending along the shore from the river Leontes ( Litany ) to Ras-el-Ain , a distance of seven miles or more . Pliny , who wrote when its boundary could still be traced , computed the circuit of Palae-Tyrus and the island Tyre together at nineteen Roman miles , 433 the circuit of the island by itself being less than three miles . Its situation , in a plain of great fertility , at the foot of the south-western spurs of Lebanon , and near the gorge of the Litany , was one of great beauty . Water was supplied to it in great abundance from the copious springs of Ras-el-Ain , which were received into a reservoir of an octagonal shape , sixty feet in diameter , and inclosed within walls eighteen feet in height , 434 whence they were conveyed northwards to the heart of the city by an aqueduct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important city of Phoenicia towards the north was Arvad , or Aradus . Arvad was situated , like Tyre , on a small island off the Syrian coast , and lay in Lat. 34 ? 48 ' nearly . It was distant from the shore about two miles and a half . The island was even smaller than that which formed the nucleus of Tyre , being only about 800 yards , or less than half a mile in length , by 500 yards , or rather more than a quarter of a mile in breadth. 435 The axis of the island was from north-west to south-east . It was a bare rock , low and flat , without water , and without any natural soil . The iron coast was surrounded on three sides , the north , the west , and the south , by a number of rocks and small islets , which fringed it like the trimming of a shawl . Its Phoenician occupiers early converted this debatable territory , half sea half shore , into solid land , by filling up the interstices between the rocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rock itself , which remains to this day. 436 The north-eastern portion , which has a length of 150 yards by a breadth of 125 , is perfectly smooth and almost flat , but with a slight slope towards the east , which is thought to show that it was used as a sort of dry dock , on which to draw up the lighter vessels , for safety or for repairs. 437 The western and southern increased the area for house-building . Anciently , as at Tyre , the houses were built very close together , and had several storeys , 438 for the purpose of accommodating a numerous population . The island was wholly without natural harbour ; but on the eastern side , which faced the mainland , and was turned away from the prevailing winds , the art and industry of the inhabitants constructed two ports of a fair size . This was effected by carrying out from the shore three piers at right angles into the sea , the central one to a distance of from seventy to a hundred yards , and the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rectangular basins , one on either side of the central pier , which were guarded from winds on three sides , and only open towards the east , a quarter from which the winds are seldom violent , and on which the mainland , less than three miles off , forms a protection . The construction of the central pier is remarkable . It is formed of massive blocks of sandstone , which are placed transversely , so that their length forms the thickness of the pier , and their ends the wall on either side . On both sides of the wall are quays of concrete. 439 The line of the ancient enceinte may still be traced around the three outer sides of the island . It is a gigantic work , composed of stones from fifteen to eighteen feet long , placed transversely , like those of the centre pier , and in two places still rising to the height of five or six courses ( from thirty to forty feet ) . 440 The blocks are laid side by side without mortar ; they are roughly squared , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courses for a while take the place of one. 441 There is a want of care in the arrangement of the blocks , joints in one course being occasionally directly over joints in the course below it . The stones are without any bevel or ornamentation of any kind . They have been quarried in the island itself , and the beds of rock from which they were taken may be seen at no great distance . At one point in the western side of the island , the native rock itself has been cut into the shape of the wall , and made to take the place of the squared stones for the distance of about ten feet. 442 A moat has also been cut along the entire western side , which , with its glacis , served apparently to protect the wall from the fury of the waves. 443 We know nothing of the internal arrangements of the ancient town beyond the fact of the closeness and loftiness of the houses . Externally Aradus depended on her possessions upon the mainland both for water and for food . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with houses . Such rainwater as fell on the island was carefully collected and stored in tanks and reservoirs , 444 the remains of which are still to be seen . But the ordinary supply of water for daily consumption was derived in time of peace from the opposite coast . When this supply was cut off by an enemy Aradus had still one further resource . Midway in the channel between the island and the continent there burst out at the bottom of the sea a fresh-water spring of great strength ; by confining this spring within a hemisphere of lead to which a leathern pipe was attached the much-needed fluid was raised to the surface and received into a vessel moored upon the spot , whence supplies were carried to the island. 445 The phenomenon still continues , though the modern inhabitants are too ignorant and unskilful to profit by it. 446 On the mainland Aradus possessed a considerable tract , and had a number of cities subject to her . Of these Strabo enumerates six , viz. Paltos , Balanea , Carnus  --  which he calls the naval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 447 Marathus was the most important of these . Its name recalls the " Brathu " of Philo-Byblius448 and the " Martu " of the early Babylonian inscriptions , 449 which was used as a general term by some of the primitive monarchs almost in the sense of " Syria . " The word is still preserved in the modern " M'rith " or " Amrith , " a name attached to some extensive ruins in the plain south-east of Aradus , which have been carefully examined by M. Renan. 450 Marathus was an ancient Phoenician town , probably one of the most ancient , and was always looked upon with some jealousy by the Aradians , who ultimately destroyed it and partitioned out the territory among their own citizens. 451 The same fate befell Simyra , 452 a place of equal antiquity , the home probably of those Zemarites who are coupled with the Arvadites in Genesis. 453 Simyra appears as " Zimirra " in the Assyrian inscriptions , where it is connected with Arka , 454 which was not far distant . Its exact site , which was certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name Sumrah , which attaches to some ruins in the plain about a mile and a half north of the Eleutherus ( Nahr-el-Kebir ) and within a mile of the sea. 455 The other towns  --  Paltos , Balanea , Carnus , 456 and Enydra  --  were in the more northern portion of the plain , as was also Antaradus , now Tortosa , where there are considerable remains , but of a date long subsequent to the time of Phoenician ascendancy . Of the remaining Phoenician cities the most important seems to have been Gebal , or Byblus . Mentioned under the name of Gubal in the Assyrian inscriptions as early as the time of Jehu457 ( ab . B.C. 840 ) , and glanced at even earlier in the Hebrew records , which tell of its inhabitants , the Giblites , 458 Gebal is found as a town of note in the time of Alexander the Great , 459 and again in that of Pompey. 460 The traditions of the Phoenicians themselves made it one of the most ancient of the cities ; and the historian Philo , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Kronos or Saturn. 461 It was an especially holy city , devoted in the early times to the worship of Beltis , 462 and in the later to that of Adonis. 463 The position is marked beyond all reasonable doubt by the modern Jebeil , which retains the original name very slightly modified , and answers completely to the ancient descriptions . The town lies upon the coast , in Lat. 34 ? 10 ' nearly , about halfway between Tripolis and Berytus , four miles north of the point where the Adonis river ( now the Ibrahim ) empties itself into the sea . There is a " small but well-sheltered port , " 464 formed mainly by two curved piers which are carried out from the shore towards the north and south , and which leave between them only a narrow entrance . The castle occupies a commanding position on a hill at a little distance from the shore , and has a keep built of bevelled stones of a large size . Several of them measure from fifteen to eighteen feet in length , and are from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Giblite " stone-cutters , " but placed in their present position during the middle ages . Tripolis , situated halfway between Byblus and Aradus , was not one of the original Phoenician cities , but was a joint colony from the three principal settlements , Tyre , Sidon , and Aradus. 466 The date of its foundation , and its native Phoenician name , are unknown to us : conjecture hovers between Hosah , Mahalliba , Uznu , and Siannu , maritime towns of Phoenicia known to the Assyrians , 467 but unmentioned by any Greek author . The situation was a promontory , which runs out towards the north-west , in Lat. 34 ? 27 ' nearly , for the distance of a mile , and is about half a mile wide . The site is " well adapted for a haven , as a chain of seven small islands , running out to the north-west , affords shelter in the direction from which the most violent winds blow . " 468 The remotest of these islands is ten miles distant from the shore. 469 We are told that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had their separate quarters of the town assigned to them , each surrounded by its own wall , and lying at some little distance one from the other. 470 There are no present traces of this arrangement , which seems indicative of distrust ; but some remains have been found of a wall which was carried across the isthmus on the land side. 471 Tripolis is now Tarabolus . Aphaca , the only inland Phoenician town of any importance , is now Afka , and is visited by most travellers and tourists . It was situated in a beautiful spot at the head of the Adonis river , 472 a sacred stream fabled to run with blood once a year , at the festival which commemorated the self-mutilation of the Nature-god Adonis . Aphaca was a sort of Delphi , a collection of temples rather than a town . It was dedicated especially to the worship of the Syrian goddess , Ashtoreth or Venus , sometimes called Beltis or Baaltis , whose orgies were of so disgracefully licentious a character that they were at last absolutely forbidden by Constantine . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one or two ruins of edifices decidedly Roman in character. 473 Nor is the gorge of the Adonis any richer in ancient buildings . There was a time when the whole valley formed a sort of " Holy Land , " 474 and at intervals on its course were shown " Tombs of Adonis , " 475 analogous to the artificial " Holy Sepulchres " of many European towns in the middle ages . All , however , have disappeared , and the traveller looks in vain for any traces of that curious cult which in ancient times made Aphaca and its river one of the most noted of the holy spots of Syria and a favourite resort of pilgrims . Twenty-three miles south of Byblus was Berytus , which disputed with Byblus the palm of antiquity. 476 Berytus was situated on a promontory in Lat. 33 ? 54 ' , and had a port of a fair size , protected towards the west by a pier , which followed the line of a ridge of rocks running out from the promontory towards the north . It was not of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatness under the Romans , 477 when its harbour was much improved , and the town greatly extended. 478 By the time of Justinian it had become the chief city of Phoenicia , and was celebrated as a school of law and science. 479 The natural advantages of its situation have caused it to retain a certain importance , and in modern times it has drawn to itself almost the whole of the commerce which Europe maintains with Syria . Arka , or Arqa , the home of the Arkites of Genesis , 480 can never have been a place of much consequence . It lies at a distance of four miles from the shore , on one of the outlying hills which form the skirts of Lebanon , in Lat. 34 ? 33 , Long . 33 ? 44 ' nearly . The towns nearest to it were Orthosia , Simyra , and Tripolis . It was of sufficient consequence to be mentioned in the Assyrian Inscriptions , 481 though not to attract the notice of Strabo . Ecdippa , south of Tyre , in Lat. 33 ? 1 ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was made the northern boundary of Asher at the division of the Holy Land among the twelve tribes . The Assyrian monarchs speak of it under the same name , but mention it rarely , and apparently as a dependency of Sidon. 483 The old name , in the shortened form of " Zeb , " still clings to the place . Still further to the south , five miles from Ecdippa , and about twenty-two miles from Tyre , lay Akko or Accho , at the northern extremity of a wide bay , which terminates towards the south in the promontory of Carmel . Next to the Bay of St. George , near Beyrout , this is the best natural roadstead on the Syrian coast ; and this advantage , combined with its vicinity to the plain of Esdraelon , has given to Accho at various periods of history a high importance , as in some sense " the key of Syria . " The Assyrians , in their wars with Palestine and Egypt , took care to conquer and retain it. 484 When the Ptolemies became masters of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw its value , occupied it , strengthened its defences , and gave it the name of Ptolemais . The old appellation has , however , reasserted itself ; and , as Acre , the city played an important part in the Crusades , in the Napoleonic attempt on Egypt , and in the comparatively recent expedition of Ibrahim Pasha . It had a small port of its own to the south-east of the promontory on which it stood , which , like the other ports of the ancient Phoenicia , is at the present time almost wholly sanded up. 485 But its roadstead was of more importance than its port , and was used by the Persians as a station for their fleet , from which they could keep watch on Egypt. 486 South of Accho and south of Carmel , close upon the shore , which is here low and flat , was Dor , now Tantura , the seat of a kingdom in the time of Joshua , 487 and allotted after its conquest to Manasseh. 488 Here Solomon placed one of his purveyors , 489 and here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " governor , " about B.C. 732 , when he reduced it. 490 Dor was one of the places where the shell-fish which produced the purple dye were most abundant , and remained in the hands of the Phoenicians during all the political changes which swept over Syria and Palestine to a late period. 491 It had fallen to ruin , however , by the time of Jerome , 492 and the present remains are unimportant . The extreme Phoenician city on the south was Japho or Joppa . It lay in Lat. 32 ? 2 ' , close to the territory of Dan , 493 but continued to be held by the Phoenicians until the time of the Maccabees , 494 when it became Jewish . The town was situated on the slope of a low hill near the sea , and possessed anciently a tolerable harbour , from which a trade was carried on with Tartessus. 495 As the seaport nearest to Jerusalem , it was naturally the chief medium of the commerce which was carried on between the Phoenicians and the Jews . Thither , in the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Lebanon for the construction of the Temple and the royal palace ; and thither , no doubt , were conveyed " the wheat , and the barley , and the oil , and the wine , " which the Phoenicians received in return for their firs and cedars. 496 A similar exchange of commodities was made nearly five centuries later at the same place , when the Jews returned from the captivity under Zerubbabel. 497 In Roman times the foundation of Caesaraea reduced Joppa to insignificance ; yet it still , as Jaffa or Yafa , retains a certain amount of trade , and is famous for its palm-groves and gardens . Joppa towards the south was balanced by Ramantha , or Laodicea , towards the north . Fifty miles north of Aradus and Antaradus ( Tortosa ) , in Lat. 35 ? 30 ' nearly , occupying the slope of a hill facing the sea , with chalky cliffs on either side , that , like those of Dover , whiten the sea , and with Mount Casius in the background , lay the most northern of all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original appellation was , we are told , Ramantha , 499 a name intended probably to mark the lofty situation of the place ; 4100 but this appellation was forced to give way to the Greek term , Laodicea , when Seleucus Nicator , having become king of Syria , partially rebuilt Ramantha and colonised it with Greeks. 4101 The coins of the city under the Seleucidae show its semi-Greek , semi-Phoenician character , having legends in both languages . One of these , in the Phoenician character , is read as l'Ladika am b'Canaan , i.e. " of Laodicea , a metropolis in Canaan , " and seems to show that the city claimed not only to be independent , but to have founded , and to hold under its sway , a number of smaller towns. 4102 It may have exercised a dominion over the entire tract from Mount Casius to Paltos , where the dominion of Aradus began . Laodicea is now Latakia , and is famous for the tobacco grown in the neighbourhood . It still makes use of its ancient port , which would be fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present chokes it. 4103 It has been said that Phoenicia was composed of " three worlds " with distinct characteristics ; 4104 but perhaps the number of the " worlds " should be extended to five . First came that of Ramantha , reaching from the Mons Casius to the river Badas , a distance of about fifty miles , a remote and utterly sequestered region , into which neither Assyria nor Egypt ever thought of penetrating . Commerce with Cyprus and southern Asia Minor was especially open to the mariners of this region , who could see the shores of Cyprus without difficulty on a clear day . Next came the " world " of Aradus , reaching along the coast from the Badas to the Eleutherus , another stretch of fifty miles , and including the littoral islands , especially that of Ruad , on which Aradus was built . This tract was less sequestered than the more northern one , and contains traces of having been subjected to influences from Egypt at an early period . The gap between Lebanon and Bargylus made the Aradian territory accessible from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one of the roads which Egyptian and Assyrian conquest followed in these parts was that which passed along the coast as far as the Eleutherus and then turned eastward and north-eastward to Emesa ( Hems ) and Hamath . It must have been conquerors marching by this line who set up their effigies at the mouth of the Nahr-el-Kelb , and those who pursued it would naturally make a point of reducing Aradus . Thus this second Phoenician " world " has not the isolated character of the first , but shows marks of Assyrian , and still more of early Egyptian , influence . The third Phoenician " world " is that of Gebal or Byblus . Its limits would seem to be the Eleutherus on the north , and on the south the Tamyras , which would allow it a length of a little above eighty miles . This district , it has been said , preserved to the last days of paganism a character which was original and well marked . Within its limits the religious sentiment had more intensity and played a more important part in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Phoenician Jerusalem . By their turn of mind and by the language which they spoke , the Byblians or Giblites seem to have been , of all the Phoenicians , those who most resembled the Hebrews . King Jehavmelek , who probably reigned at Byblus about B.C. 400 , calls himself " a just king , " and prays that he may obtain favour in the sight of God . Later on it was at Byblus , and in the valleys of the Lebanon depending on it , that the inhabitants celebrated those mysteries of Astarte , together with that orgiastic worship of Adonis or Tammuz , which were so popular in Syria during the whole of the Greco-Roman period. 4105 The fourth Phoenician " world " was that of Tyre and Sidon , beginning at the Tamyras and ending with the promontory of Carmel . Here it was that the Phoenician character developed especially those traits by which it is commonly known to the world at large  --  a genius for commerce and industry , a passion for the undertaking of long and perilous voyages , an adaptability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with wild tribes of many different kinds which has rarely been equalled and never exceeded . " All that we are about to say of Phoenicia , " declares the author recently quoted , " of its rapid expansion and the influence which it exercised over the nations of the West , must be understood especially of Tyre and Sidon . The other towns might furnish sailors to man the Tyrian fleet or merchandise for their cargo , but it was Sidon first and then ( with even more determination and endurance ) Tyre which took the initiative and the conduct of the movement ; it was the mariners of these two towns who , with eyes fixed on the setting sun , pushed their explorations as far as the Pillars of Hercules , and eventually even further . " 4106 The last and least important of the Phoenician " worlds " was the southern one , extending sixty miles from Carmel to Joppa  --  a tract from which the Phoenician character was well nigh trampled out by the feet of strangers ever passing up and down the smooth and featureless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between Syria and Mesopotamia on the one hand , Philistia and Egypt on the other. 4107 CHAPTER V  --  THE COLONIES Circumstances which led the Phoenicians to colonise  --  Their colonies best grouped geographically  --  1 . Colonies of the Eastern Mediterranean  --  in Cyprus , Citium , Amathus , Curium , Paphos , Salamis , Ammochosta , Tamisus , and Soli ;  --  in Cilicia , Tarsus ;  --  in Lycia , Phaselis ;  --  in Rhodes , Lindus , Ialysus , Camirus ;  --  in Crete , and the Cyclades ;  --  in the Northern Egean ; &c.; 2 . In the Central and Western Mediterranean  --  in Africa , Utica , Hippo-Zaritis , Hippo Regius , Carthage , Hadrumetum , Leptis Minor , Leptis Major , and Thapsus ;  --  in Sicily , Motya , Eryx , Panormus , Solocis ;  --  between Sicily and Africa , Cossura , Gaulos , and Melita ;  --  in Sardinia , Caralis , Nora , Sulcis , and Tharros ;  --  in the Balearic Isles ;  --  in Spain , Malaca , Sex , Abdera. 3 . Outside the Straits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; in Spain , Tartessus , Gades , and Belon  --  Summary . The narrowness of the territory which the Phoenicians occupied the military strength of their neighbours towards the north and towards the south , and their own preference of maritime over agricultural pursuits , combined to force them , as they began to increase and multiply , to find a vent for their superfluous population in colonies . The military strength of Philistia and Egypt barred them out from expansion upon the south ; the wild savagery of the mountain races in Casius , northern Bargylus , and Amanus was an effectual barrier towards the north ; but before them lay the open Mediterranean , placid during the greater portion of the year , and conducting to a hundred lands , thinly peopled , or even unoccupied , where there was ample room for any number of immigrants . The trade of the Phoenicians with the countries bordering the Eastern Mediterranean must be regarded as established long previously to the time when they began to feel cramped for space ; and thus , when that time arrived , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except such as might arise from a too abundant amplitude of choice . Right in front of them lay , at the distance of not more than seventy miles , visible from Casius in clear weather , 51 the large and important island , once known as Chittim , 52 and afterwards as Cyprus , which played so important a part in the history of the East from the time of Sargon and Sennacherib to that of Bragadino and Mustapha Pasha . To the right , well visible from Cyprus , was the fertile tract of Cilicia Campestris , which led on to the rich and picturesque regions of Pamphylia , Lycia , and Caria . From Caria stretched out , like a string of stepping-stones between Asia and Europe , the hundred islets of the AEgean , Cyclades , and Sporades , and others , inviting settlers , and conducting to the large islands of Crete and Euboea , and the shores of Attica and the Peloponnese . It is impossible to trace with any exactness the order in which the Phoenician colonies were founded . A thousand incidental circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be called the natural or geographical order , and have caused the historical order to diverge from it ; but , on the whole , probably something like the geographical order was observed ; and , at any rate , it will be most convenient , in default of sufficient data for an historical arrangement , to adopt in the present place a geographic one , and , beginning with those nearest to Phoenicia itself in the Eastern Mediterranean , to proceed westward to the Straits of Gibraltar , reserving for the last those outside the Straits on the shores of the Atlantic Ocean . The nearest , and probably the first , region to attract Phoenician colonies was the island of Cyprus . Cyprus lies in the corner of the Eastern Mediterranean formed by the projection of Asia Minor from the Syrian shore . Its mountain chains run parallel with Taurus , and it is to Asia Minor that it presents its longer flank , while to Phoenicia it presents merely one of its extremities . Its length from east to west is 145 miles , its greatest width about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most salient features , the one running close along the north coast from Cape Kormaciti to Cape S. Andreas ; the other nearly central , but nearer the south , beginning at Cape Renaouti in the west and terminating at Cape Greco . The mountain ranges are connected by a tract of high ground towards the centre , and separated by two broad plains , 54 towards the east and west . The eastern plain is the more important of the two . It extends along the course of the Pediaeus from Leucosia , or Nicosia , the present capital , to Salamis , a distance of thirty-five miles , and is from five to twelve miles wide . The fertility of the soil was reckoned in ancient times to equal that of Egypt. 55 The western plain , that of Morfou , is much smaller , and is watered by a less important river . The whole island , when it first became known to the Phoenicians , was well wooded. 56 Lovely glens opened upon them , as they sailed along its southern coast , watered by clear streams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pine and cedar , the latter of which are said to have in some cases attained a greater size even than those of the Lebanon. 57 The range was also prolific of valuable metals. 58 Gold and silver were found in places , but only in small quantities ; iron was yielded in considerable abundance ; but the chief supply was that of copper , which derived its name from that of the island. 59 Other products of the island were wheat of excellent quality ; the rich Cyprian wine which retains its strength and flavour for well nigh a century , the henna dye obtained from the plant called copher or cyprus , the Lawsonia alba of modern botany ; valuable pigments of various kinds , red , yellow , green , and amber ; hemp and flax ; tar , boxwood , 510 and all the materials requisite for shipbuilding from the heavy timbers needed for the keel to the lightest spar and the flimsiest sail. 511 The earliest of the Phoenician settlements in Cyprus seem to have lain upon its southern coast . Here were Citium , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the geographers , which have all yielded abundant traces of a Phoenician occupation at a very distant period . Citium , now Larnaka , was on the western side of a deep bay , which indents the more eastern portion of the southern coast , between the promontories of Citi and Pyla . It is sheltered from all winds except the south-east , and continues to the present day the chief port of the island . The Phoenician settlers improved on the natural position by the formation of an artificial basin , enclosed within piers , the lines of which may be traced , though the basin itself is sanded up. 512 A plain extends for some distance inland , on which the palm-tree flourishes , and which is capable of producing excellent crops of wheat. 513 Access to the interior is easy ; for the mountain range sinks as it proceeds eastward , and between Citium and Dali ( Idalium ) , on a tributary of the Pediaeus , is of small elevation . There are indications that the Phoenicians did not confine themselves to the coast , but penetrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers . Idalium , sixteen miles north-west of Citium , and Golgi ( Athienau ) , ten miles nearly due north of the same , show traces of having supported for a considerable time a large Phoenician population , 514 and must be regarded as outposts advanced from Citium into the mountains for trading , and perhaps for mining purposes . Idalium ( Dali ) has a most extensive Phoenician necropolis ; the interments have a most archaic character ; and their Phoenician origin is indicated both by their close resemblance to interments in Phoenicia proper and by the discovery , in connection with them , of Phoenician inscriptions. 515 At Golgi the remains scarcely claim so remote an antiquity . They belong to the time when Phoenician art was dominated by a strong Egyptian influence , and when it also begins to have a partially Hellenic character . Some critics assign them to the sixth , or even to the fifth century , B.C.516 West of Citium , also upon the south coast , and in a favourable situation for trade with the interior , was Amathus . The name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there is no reason to suppose that the Hamathites were Phoenicians . Amathus , which Stephen of Byzantium calls " a most ancient Cyprian city , " 518 was probably among the earliest of the Phoenician settlements in the island . It lay in the bay formed by the projection of Cape Gatto from the coast , and , like Citium , looked to the south-east . Westward and south-westward stretched an extensive plain , fertile and well-watered , shaded by carob and olive-trees , 519 whilst towards the north were the rich copper mines from which the Amathusians derived much of their prosperity . The site has yielded a considerable amount of Phoenician remains  --  tombs , sarcophagi , vases , bowls , paterae and statuettes. 520 Many of the tombs resemble those at Idalium ; others are stone chambers deeply buried in the earth . The mimetic art shows Assyrian and Egyptian influence , but is essentially Phoenician , and of great interest . Further reference will be made to it in the Chapter on the AEsthetic Art of the Phoenicians . Still further to the west , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Zeugari and Boosoura , was the colony of Curium , on a branch of the river Kuras . Curium lay wholly open to the south-western-gales , but had a long stretch of sandy shore towards the south-east , on which vessels could be drawn up . The town was situated on a rocky elevation , 300 feet in height , and was further defended by a strong wall , a large portion of which may still be traced. 521 The richest discovery of Phoenician ornaments and objects of art that has yet been made took place at Curium , where , in the year 1874 , General Di Cesnola happened upon a set of " Treasure Chambers " containing several hundreds of rings , gems , necklaces , bracelets , armlets , ear-rings , bowls , basins , jugs , paterae , &c.,; in the precious metals , which have formed the principal material for all recent disquisitions on the true character and excellency of Phoenician art . Commencing with works of which the probable date is the fifteenth or sixteenth century B.C. , and descending at least as far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embracing , moreover , works which are purely Assyrian , purely Egyptian , and purely Greek , this collection has yet so predominant a Phoenician character as to mark Curium , notwithstanding the contrary assertions of the Greeks themselves , 523 for a thoroughly Phoenician town . And the history of the place confirms this view , since Curium sided with Amathus and the Persians in the war of Onesilus. 524 No doubt , like most of the other Phoenician cities in Cyprus , it was Hellenised gradually ; but there must have been many centuries during which it was an emporium of Phoenician trade and a centre of Phoenician influence . Where the southern coast of Cyprus begins to trend to the north-west , and a river of some size , the Bocarus or Diorizus , reaches the sea , stood the Phoenician settlement of Paphos , founded ( as was said525 ) by Cinyras , king of Byblus . Here was one of the most celebrated of all the temples of Astarte or Ashtoreth , 526 the Phoenician Nature-Goddess ; and here ruled for many centuries the sacerdotal class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been identified , and will be described in a future chapter . They have the massive character of all early Phoenician architecture . Among other Phoenician settlements in Cyprus were , it is probable , Salamis , Ammochosta ( now Famagosta ) , Tamasus , and Soli . Salamis must be regarded as originally Phoenician on account of the name , which can not be viewed as anything but another form of the Hebrew " Salem , " the alternative name of Jerusalem. 527 Salamis lay on the eastern coast of the island at the mouth of the main river , the Pediaeus . It occupied the centre of a large bay which looked towards Phoenicia , and would naturally be the place where the Phoenicians would first land . There is no natural harbour beyond that afforded by the mouth of the Pediaeus , but a harbour was easily made by throwing out piers into the bay ; and of this , which is now sanded up , the outline may be traced. 528 There are , however , no remains , either at Salamis or in the immediate neighbourhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the glories of the city belong to the history of Greece . Ammochosta was situated within a few miles of Salamis , towards the south. 529 Its first appearance in history belongs to the reign of Esarhaddon ( B.C. 680 ) , when we find it in a list of ten Cyprian cities , each having its own king , who acknowledged for their suzerain the great monarch of Assyria. 530 Soon afterwards it again occurs among the cities tributary to Asshur-bani-pal. 531 Otherwise we have no mention of it in Phoenician times . As Famagosta it was famous in the wars between the Venetians and the Turks . Tamasus , or Tamassus , was an inland city , and the chief seat of the mining operations which the Phoenicians carried on in the island in search of copper. 532 It lay a few miles to the west of Idalium ( Dali ) , on the northern flank of the southern mountain chain . The river Pediaeus flowed at its feet . Like Ammochosta , it appears among the Cyprian towns which in the seventh century B.C. were tributary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soli lay upon the coast , in the recess of the gulf of Morfou. 534 The fiction of its foundation by Philocyprus at the suggestion of Solon535 is entirely disproved by the occurrence of the name in the Assyrian lists of Cyprian towns a century before Solon 's time . Its sympathies were with the Phoenician , and not with the Hellenic , population of the island , as was markedly shown when it joined with Amathus and Citium in calling to Artaxerxes for help against Evagoras. 536 The city stood on the left bank of the river Clarius , and covered the northern slope of a low hill detached from the main range , extending also over the low ground at the foot of the hill to within a short distance of the shore , where are to be seen the remains of the ancient harbour . The soil in the neighbourhood is very rich , and adapted for almost any kind of cultivation. 537 In the mountains towards the south were prolific veins of copper . The northern coast of the island between Capes Cormaciti and S. Andreas does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are some who regard Lapethus and Cerynia as Phoenician settlements. 538 It is a rock-bound shore of no very tempting aspect , behind which the mountain range rises up steeply . Such Phoenician emigrants as held their way along the Salaminian plain and , rounding Cape S. Andreas , passed into the channel that separates Cyprus from the mainland , found the coast upon their right attract them far more than that upon their left , and formed settlements in Cilicia which ultimately became of considerable importance . The chief of these was Tars or Tarsus , probably the Tarshish of Genesis , 539 though not that of the later Books , a Phoenician city , which has Phoenician characters upon its coins , and worshipped the supreme Phoenician deity under the title of " Baal Tars , " " the Lord of Tarsus . " 540 Tarsus commanded the rich Cilician plain up to the very roots of Taurus , was watered by the copious stream of the Cydnus , and had at its mouth a commodious harbour . Excellent timber for shipbuilding grew on the slopes of the hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of floating such timber down to the sea . Cleopatra 's ships are said to have been derived from the Cilician forests , which Antony made over to her for the purpose. 541 Other Phoenician settlements upon the Cilician coast were , it is probable , Soli , Celenderis , and Nagidus . Pursuing their way westward , in search of new abodes , the emigrants would pass along the coast , first of Pamphylia and then of Lycia . In Pamphylia there is no settlement that can be with confidence assigned to them ; but in Lycia it would seem that they colonised Phaselis , and perhaps other places . The mountain which rises immediately behind Phaselis was called " Solyma ; " 542 and a very little to the south was another mountain known as " Phoenicus. " 543 Somewhat further to the west lies the cape still called Cape Phineka , 544 in which the root Phoenix ( phoinix ) is again to be detected . A large district inland was named Cabalis or Cabalia , 545 or ( compare Phoen. and Heb. gebal , mod . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phaselis was situated on a promontory projecting south-eastward into the Mediterranean , 546 and was reckoned to have three harbours , 547 which are marked in the accompanying chart . Of these the principal one was that on the western side of the isthmus , which was formed by a stone pier carried out for more than two hundred yards into the sea , and still to be traced under the water. 548 The other two , which were of smaller size , lay towards the east . The Phoenicians were probably tempted to make a settlement at the place , partly by the three ports , partly by the abundance of excellent timber for shipbuilding which the neighbourhood furnishes . " Between Phaselis and Cape Avora , a little north of it , " says a modern traveller , " a belt of large and handsome pines borders the shore for some miles . " 549 From Lycia the Asiatic coast westward and north-westward was known as Caria ; and here Phoenician settlements appear to have been numerous . The entire country was at any rate called Phoenice by some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointing out any special Phoenician settlements in this quarter , which early fell under almost exclusive Greek influence . There are ample grounds , however , for believing that the Phoenicians colonised Rhodes at the south-western angle of Asia Minor , off the Carian coast . According to Conon , 551 the earliest inhabitants of Rhodes were the Heliades , whom the Phoenicians expelled . The Phoenicians themselves were at a later date expelled by the Carians , and the Carians by the Greeks . Ergeias , however , the native historian , declared552 that the Phoenicians remained , at any rate in some parts of the island , until the Greeks drove them out . Ialysus was , he said , one of their cities . Dictys Cretensis placed Phoenicians , not only in Ialysus , but in Camirus also. 553 It is the conclusion of Kenrick that " the Phoenician settlement in Rhodes was the first which introduced civilisation among the primeval inhabitants , and that they maintained their ascendancy till the rise of the naval power of the Carians . These new settlers reduced the Phoenicians to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ialysus , and Camirus ; but " from these too they were expelled by the Dorians , or only allowed to remain at Ialysus as the hereditary priesthood of their native god . " 554 Rhodes is an island about one-fourth the size of Cyprus , with its axis from the north-east to the south-west . It possesses excellent harbours , accessible from all quarters , 555 and furnishing a secure shelter in all weathers . The fertility of the soil is great ; and the remarkable history of the island shows the importance which attaches to it in the hands of an enterprising people . Turkish apathy has , however , succeeded in reducing it to insignificance . The acquisition of Rhodes led the stream of Phoenician colonisation onwards in two directions , south-westward and north-westward . South-westward , it passed by way of Carpathus and Casus to Crete , and then to Cythera ; north-westward , by way of Chalcia , Telos , and Astypalaea , to the Cyclades and Sporades . The presence of the Phoenicians in Crete is indicated by the haven " Phoenix , " where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; 556 by the town of Itanus , which was named after a Phoenician founder , 557 and was a staple of the purple-trade , 558 and by the existence near port Phoenix of a town called " Araden . " Leben , on the south coast , near Cape Leo , seems also to have derived its name from the Semitic word for " lion . " 559 Crete , however , does not appear to have been occupied by the Phoenicians at more than a few points , or for colonising so much as for trading purposes . They used its southern ports for refitting and repairing their ships , but did not penetrate into the interior , must less attempt to take possession of the whole extensive territory . It was otherwise with the smaller islands . Cythera is said to have derived its name from the Phoenician who colonised it , and the same is also reported of Melos. 560 Ios was , we are told , originally called Phoenice ; 561 Anaphe had borne the name of Membliarus , after one of the companions of Cadmus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sidon. 563 Thera 's earliest inhabitants were of the Phoenician race ; 564 either Phoenicians or Carians had , according to Thucydides , 565 colonised in remote times " the greater part of the islands of the AEnean . " There was a time when probably all the AEgean islands were Phoenician possessions , or at any rate acknowledged Phoenician influence , and Siphnus gave its gold , its silver , 566 and its lead , 567 Cythera its shell-fish , 568 Paros its marble , Melos its sulphur and its alum , 569 Nisyrus its millstones , 570 and the islands generally their honey , 571 to increase the wealth and advance the commercial interests of their Phoenician masters . From the Sporades and Cyclades the advance was easy to the islands of the Northern AEgean , Lemnos , Imbrus , Thasos , and Samothrace . The settlement of the Phoenicians in Thasos is attested by Herodotus , who says that the Tyrian Hercules ( Melkarth ) was worshipped there , 572 and ascribes to the Phoenicians extensive mining operations on the eastern shores of the island between AEnyra and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Samothrace is indicated by the worship in those islands of the Cabeiri , 574 who were undoubtedly Phoenician deities . Whether the Phoenicians passed from these islands to the Thracian mainland , and worked the gold-mines of Mount Pangaeus in the vicinity of Philippi , may perhaps be doubtful , but such seems to have been the belief of Strabo and Pliny. 575 Strabo also believed that there had been a Semitic element in the population of Euboea which had been introduced by Cadmus ; 576 and a Phoenician settlement in Boeotia was the current tradition of the Greek writers upon primitive times , whether historians or geographers. 577 The further progress of the Phoenician settlements northward into the Propontis and the Euxine is a point whereon different opinions may be entertained . Pronectus , on the Bithynian , and Amastris , on the Paphlagonian coast , have been numbered among the colonies of the Phoenicians by some ; 578 while others have gone so far as to ascribe to them the colonisation of the entire countries of Bithynia , Mariandynia , and Paphlagonia. 579 The story of the Argonauts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penetrated into the stormy and inhospitable sea which washes Asia Minor upon the north , and even reached its deepest eastern recess ; but it is one thing to sail into seas , and , landing where the natives seem friendly , to traffic with the dwellers on them  --  it is quite another thing to attempt a permanent occupation of portions of their coasts . To do so often provokes hostility , and puts a stop to trade instead of encouraging it . The Phoenicians may have been content to draw their native products from the barbarous tribes of Northern Asia Minor and Western Thrace  --  nay , even of Southern Scythia  --  without risking the collisions that might have followed the establishment of settlements . As with the Black Sea , so with the Adriatic , the commercial advantages were not sufficient to tempt the Phoenicians to colonise . From Crete and Cythera they sent their gaze afar , and fixed it midway in the Mediterranean , at the western extremity of the eastern basin , on the shores of Sicily , and the vast projection from the coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They knew the harbourless character of the African coast west of Egypt , and the dangers of the Lesser and Greater Syrtes . They knew the fertility of the Tunisian projection , the excellence of its harbours , and the prolificness of the large island that lay directly opposite . Here were the tracts where they might expand freely , and which would richly repay their occupation of them . It was before the beginning of the eleventh century B.C.  --  perhaps some centuries before  --  that the colonisation of North Africa by the Phoenicians was taken in hand : 581 and about the same time , in all probability , the capes and isles about Sicily were occupied , 582 and Phoenician influence in a little time extended over the entire island . In North Africa the first colony planted is said to have been Utica . Utica was situated a little to the west of Carthage , at the mouth of the Mejerda or Bagradas river. 583 It stood on a rocky promontory which ran out into the sea eastward , and partially protected its harbour . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promontory , the modern Ras Sidi Ali-el-Mekki , while the mouth of the harbour , which faced to the south-east , was protected by some islands . At present the deposits of the Mejerda have blocked up almost the whole of this ancient port , and the rocky eminence upon which the city stood looks down on three sides upon a broad alluvial plain , through which the Mejerda pursues a tortuous course to the sea. 584 The remains of the ancient town , which occupy the promontory and a peninsula projecting from it , include a necropolis , an amphitheatre , a theatre , a castle , the ruins of a temple , and some remains of baths ; but they have nothing about them bearing any of the characteristics of Phoenician architecture , and belong wholly to the Roman or post-Roman period . The neighbourhood is productive of olives , which yield an excellent oil ; and in the hills towards the south-west are veins of lead , containing a percentage of silver , which are thought to bear traces of having been worked at a very early date. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , the settlement of Hippo-Zaritis , of which the name still seems to linger in the modern Bizerta . Hippo-Zaritis stood on the west bank of a natural channel , which united with the sea a considerable lagoon or salt lake , lying south of the town . The channel was kept open by an irregular flux and reflux , the water of the lake after the rainy season flowing off into the sea , and that of the sea , correspondingly , in the dry season passing into the lake. 586 At the present time the lake is extraordinarily productive of fish , 587 and the sea outside yields coral ; 588 but otherwise the advantages of the situation are not great . Two degrees further to the west , on a hill overlooking the sea , and commanding a lovely prospect over the verdant plain at its base , watered by numerous streams , was founded the colony of Hippo Regius , memorable as having been for five-and-thirty years the residence of St. Augustine . The Phoenicians were probably attracted to the site by the fertility of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abundant timber and rich iron ore of the neighbouring mountains. 589 Hippo Regius is now Bona , or rather has been replaced by that town , which lies about a mile and a half north of the ancient Hippo , close upon the coast , in the fertile tract formed by the soil brought down by the river Seybouse . The old harbour of Hippo is filled up , and the remains of the ancient city are scanty ; but the lovely gardens and orchards , which render Bona one of the most agreeable of Algerian towns , sufficiently explain and justify the Phoenician choice of the site. 590 In the same bay with Utica , further to the south , and near its inner recess , was founded , nearly three centuries after Utica , the most important of all the Phoenician colonies , Carthage . The advantages of the locality are indicated by the fact that the chief town of Northern Africa , Tunis , has grown up within a short distance of the site . It combined the excellences of a sheltered situation , a good soil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that was to be desired in ancient times and with ancient navies . These basins , partly natural , partly artificial , still exist ; 591 but their communication with the sea is blocked up , as also is the channel which connected the military harbour with the harbours of commerce . The remains of the ancient town are mostly beneath the surface of the soil , but modern research has uncovered a portion of them , and brought to light a certain number of ruins which belong probably to the very earliest period . Among these are walls in the style called " Cyclopian , " built of a very hard material , and more than thirty-two feet thick , which seem to have surrounded the ancient Byrsa or citadel , and which are still in places sixteen feet high. 592 The Roman walls found emplaced above these are of far inferior strength and solidity . An extensive necropolis lies north of the ancient town , on the coast near Cape Camart . Another early and important Phoenician settlement in these parts was Hadrumetum or Adrymes , 593 which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay on the eastern side of the great Tunisian projection , near the southern extremity of a large bay which looks to the east , and is now known as the Gulf of Hammamet . Its position was upon the coast at the edge of the vast plain called at present the " Sahel of Sousa , " which is sandy , but immensely productive of olive oil . " Millions of olive-trees , " it is said , " cover the tract , " 594 and the present annual exportation amounts to 40,000 hectolitres. 595 Ancient remains are few , but the Cothon , or circular harbour , may still be traced , and in the necropolis , which almost wholly encircles the town , many sepulchral chambers have been found , excavated in the chalk , closely resembling in their arrangements those of the Phoenician mainland . South of Hadrumetum , at no great distance , was Leptis Minor , now Lemta . The gulf of Hammamet terminates southwards in the promontory of Monastir , between which and Ras Dimas is a shallow bay looking to the north-east . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it from the larger city of the same name between the Lesser and the Greater Syrtis ; it was , however , a considerable town , as appears from its remains . These lie along the coast for two miles and a half in Lat. 35 ? 43 ' , and include the ruins of an aqueduct , of a theatre , of quays , and of jetties. 596 The neighbourhood is suited for the cultivation of the olive . The Greater Leptis ( Leptis Major ) lay at a considerable distance from the Lesser one . Midway in the low African coast which intervenes between the Tunisian projection and the Cyrenaic one , about Long . 14 ? 22 ' E. of Greenwich , are ruins , near a village called Lebda , which , it is generally agreed , mark the site of this ancient city . Leptis Major was a colony from Sidon , and occupied originally a small promontory , which projects from the coast in a north-easterly direction , and attains a moderate elevation above the plain at its base . Towards the mainland it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traced , and on the sea-side by blocks of enormous strength , which are said to resemble those on the western side of the island of Aradus. 597 In Roman times the town , under the name of Neapolis , 598 attained a vast size , and was adorned with magnificent edifices , of which there are still numerous remains . The neighbourhood is rich in palm-groves and olive-groves , 599 and the Cinyps region , regarded by Herodotus as the most fertile in North Africa , 5100 lies at no great distance to the east . Ten miles east , and a little south of Leptis Minor , 5101 was Thapsus , a small town , but one of great strength , famous as the scene of Julius Caesar 's great victory over Cato. 5102 It occupied a position close to the promontory now known as Ras Dimas , in Lat. 35 ? 39 ' , Long . 11 ? 3 ' , and was defended by a triple enclosure , whereof considerable remains are still existing . The outermost of the three lines appears to have consisted of little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Romans were accustomed to throw up whenever they pitched a camp in their wars ; but the second and third were more substantial . The second , which was about forty yards behind the first , was guarded by a deeper ditch , from which rose a perpendicular stone wall , battlemented at top . The third , forty yards further back , resembled the second , but was on an enlarged scale , and the wall was twenty feet thick. 5103 Such triple enclosures are thought to be traceable in other Phoenician settlements also ; 5104 but in no case are the remains so perfect as at Thapsus . The harbour , which lay south of the town , was protected from the prevalent northern and north-eastern winds by a huge mole or jetty , carried out originally to a distance of 450 yards from the shore , and still measuring 325 yards . The foundation consists of piles driven into the sand , and placed very close together ; but the superstructure is a stone wall thirty-five feet thick , and still rising to a height of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is probable that there were many other early Phoenician settlements on the North African seaboard ; but those already described were certainly the most important . The fertile coast tract between Hippo Regius and the straits is likely to have been occupied at various points from an early period . But none of these small trading settlements attained to any celebrity ; and thus it is unnecessary to go into particulars respecting them . In Sicily the permanent Phoenician settlements were chiefly towards the west and the north-west . They included Motya , Eryx , Panormus ( Palermo ) , and Soloeis . That the Phoenicians founded Motya , Panormus , and Soloeis is distinctly stated by Thucydides ; 5106 while Eryx is proved to have been Phoenician by its remains . Motya , situated on a littoral island less than half a mile from the western shore , in Lat. 38 ? nearly , has the remains of a wall built of large stones , uncemented , in the Phoenician manner , 5107 and carried , like the western wall of Aradus , so close to the coast as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diodorus to have been at one time a most flourishing town. 5108 The coins have Phoenician legends. 5109 Eryx lay about seven miles to the north-east of Motya , in a very strong position . Mount Eryx ( now Mount Giuliano ) , on which it was mainly built , rises to the height of two thousand feet above the plain , 5110 and , being encircled by a strong wall , was rendered almost impregnable . The summit was levelled and turned into a platform , on which was raised the temple of Astarte or Venus. 5111 An excellent harbour , formed by Cape Drepanum ( now Trapani ) , lay at its base . There were springs of water within the walls which yielded an unfailing supply . The walls were of great strength , and a considerable portion of them is still standing , and attests the skill of the Phoenician architects . The blocks in the lower courses are mostly of a large size , some of them six feet long , or more , and bear in many cases the well-known Phoenician mason-marks. 5112 They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and recall the style of the Aradian builders , but are at once less massive and arranged with more skill . The breadth of the wall is about seven feet . At intervals it is flanked by square towers projecting from it , which are of even greater strength than the curtain between them , and which were carried up to a greater height . The doorways in the wall are numerous , and are of a very archaic character , being either covered in by a single long stone lintel or else terminating in a false arch. 5113 The commercial advantages of Eryx were twofold , consisting in the produce of the sea as well as in that of the shore . The shore is well suited for the cultivation of the vine , 5114 while the neighbouring sea yields tunny-fish , sponges , and coral. 5115 Panormus ( now Palermo ) occupies a site almost unequalled by any other Mediterranean city , a site which has conferred upon it the title of " the happy , " and has rendered it for above a thousand years the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town in Europe which enjoys a more delicious climate , none so charming to look on from a distance , none more delightfully situated in a nest of verdure and flowers . Its superb mountains , with their bare flanks pierced along their base with grottoes , enclose a marvellous garden , the famous ' Shell of Gold , ' in the midst of which are seen the numerous towers and domes , the fan-like foliage of the palms , the spreading branches of the pines , and Mount Reale on the south towering over all with its vast mass of convents and churches . " 5116 The harbour lies open to the north ; but the Phoenician settlers , here as elsewhere , no doubt made artificial ports by means of piers and moles , which have , however , disappeared on this much-frequented site , where generation after generation has been continually at work building and destroying . Panormus has left us no antique remains beyond its coins , which are abundant , and show that the native name of the settlement was Mahanath. 5117 Mahanath was situated about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the island . Solus , or Soloeis , the Soluntum of the Romans ( now Solanto ) , lay on the eastern side of the promontory ( Cape Zafferana ) which shuts in the bay of Palermo on the right . It stood on a slope at the foot of a lofty hill , overlooking a small round port , and was fortified by a wall of large squared blocks of stone , 5118 which may be still distinctly traced . The site has yielded sarcophagi of an unmistakably Phoenician character , 5119 and other objects of a high antiquity which recall the Phoenician manner ; 5120 but the chief remains belong to the Greco-Roman times . The islands in the strait which separates the North African coast from Sicily were also colonised by the Phoenicians . These were three in number , Cossura ( now Pantellaria ) , Gaulos ( now Gozzo ) , and Melita ( now Malta ) . Cossura , the most western of the three , lay about midway in the channel , but nearer to the African coast , from which it is distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass of igneous rock , which was once a volcano , and which still abounds in hot springs and in jets of steam. 5121 There was no natural harbour of any size , but the importance of the position was such that the Phoenicians felt bound to occupy the island , if only to prevent its occupation by others . The soil was sterile ; but the coins , which are very numerous , 5122 give reason to suppose that the rocks were in early times rich in copper . Gaulos ( now Gozzo ) forms , together with Malta and some islets , an insular group lying between the eastern part of Sicily and the Lesser Syrtis . It is situated in Lat. 36 ? 2 ' , Long . 12 ? 10 ' nearly , and is distant from Sicily only about fifty miles . The colonisation of the island by the Phoenicians , asserted by Diodorus , 5123 is entirely borne out by the remains , which include a Phoenician inscription of some length , 5124 coins with Phoenician legends , 5125 and buildings , believed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blocks of stone employed in their construction have a length of nearly twenty feet , 5127 with a width and height proportionate ; and all are put together without cement or mortar of any kind . A conical stone of the kind known to have been used by the Phoenicians in their worship was found in one of the temples. 5128 Gaulos had a port which was reckoned sufficiently commodious , and which lay probably towards the south-east end of the island . Melita , or Malta , which lies at a short distance from Gozzo , to the south-east , is an island of more than double the size , and of far greater importance . It possesses in La Valetta one of the best harbours , or rather two of the best harbours , in the world . All the navies of Europe could anchor comfortably in the " great port " to the east of the town . The western port is smaller , but is equally well sheltered . Malta has no natural product of much importance , unless it be the honey , after which some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treeless , and the light powdery soil gives small promise of fertility . Still , the actual produce , both in cereals and in green crops , is large ; and the oranges , especially those known as mandarines , are of superior quality . Malta also produced , in ancient as in modern times , the remarkable breed of small dogs5130 which is still held in such high esteem . But the Phoenician colonisation must have taken place rather on account of the situation and the harbour than on account of the products . From Sicily and North Africa the tide of emigration naturally and easily flowed on into Sardinia , which is distant , from the former about 150 and from the latter about 115 miles . The points chosen by the Phoenician settlers lay in the more open and level region of the south and the south-west , and were all enclosed within a line which might be drawn from the coast a little east of Cagliari to the northern extremity of the Gulf of Oristano. 5131 The tract includes some mountain groups , but consists mainly of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Campidano , " which reaches across the island from Cagliari on the southern to Oristano on the western coast . This plain , if drained , would be by far the most fertile part of the island ; and was in ancient times exceedingly productive in cereals , as we learn from Diodorus. 5132 The mountains west of it , especially those about Iglesias , contain rich veins of copper and of lead , together with a certain quantity of silver. 5133 Good harbours exist at Cagliari , at Oristano , and between the island of S. Antioco and the western shore . It was at these points especially that the Phoenicians made their settlements , the most important of which were Caralis ( Cagliari ) , Nora , Sulcis , and Tharros . Caralis , or Cagliari , the present capital , lies at the bottom of a deep bay looking southwards , and has an excellent harbour , sheltered in all weathers . There are no remains of Phoenician buildings ; but the neighbourhood yields abundant specimens of Phoenician art in the shape of tombs , statuettes , vases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first of the settlements made by the Phoenicians in Sardinia ; it would attract them by its harbour , its mines , and the fertility of its neighbourhood . From Caralis they probably passed to Nora , which lay on the same bay to the south-west ; and from Nora they rounded the south-western promontory of Sardinia , and established themselves on the small island now known as the Isola di San Antioco , where they built a town which they called Sulchis or Sulcis. 5135 Sulcis has yielded votive tablets of the Phoenician type , tombs , vases , &c.[5136]; The island was productive of lead , and had an excellent harbour towards the north , and another more open one towards the south . Finally , mid-way on the west coast , at the northern extremity of the Gulf of Oristano , the Phoenicians occupied a small promontory which projects into the sea southwards and there formed a settlement which became known as Tharras or Tharros. 5137 Very extensive remains , quite unmistakably Phoenician , including tombs , cippi , statuettes in metal and clay , weapons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5138 The passage would have been easy from Sardinia to Corsica , which is not more than seven miles distant from it ; but Corsica seems to have possessed no attraction for the Phoenicians proper , who were perhaps deterred from colonising it by its unhealthiness , or by the savagery of its inhabitants . Or they may have feared to provoke the jealousy of the Tyrrhenians , off whose coast the island lay , and who , without having any colonising spirit themselves , disliked the too near approach of rivals. 5139 At any rate , whatever the cause , it seems to have been left to the Carthaginians , to bring Corsica within the range of Phoenician influence ; and even the Carthaginians did little more than hold a few points on its shores as stations for their ships. 5140 If from Sardinia the Phoenicians ventured on an exploring voyage westward into the open Mediterranean , a day 's sail would bring them within sight of the eastern Balearic Islands , Minorca and Majorca . The sierra of Majorca rises to the height of between 3,000 and 4,000 feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The occupation of the islands by " the Phoenicians " is asserted by Strabo , 5142 but we can not be sure that he does not mean Phoenicians of Africa , i.e. Carthaginians . Still , on the whole , modern criticism inclines to the belief that , even before the foundation of Carthage , Phoenician colonisation had made its way into the Balearic Islands , directly , from the Syrian coast. 5143 Some resting-places between the middle Mediterranean and Southern Spain must have been a necessity ; and as the North African coast west of Hippo offered no good harbours , it was necessary to seek them elsewhere . Now Minorca has in Port Mahon a harbour of almost unsurpassed excellence , 5144 while in Majorca there are fairly good ports both at Palma and at Aleudia. 5145 Ivica is less well provided , but there is one of some size , known as Pormany ( i.e. " Porta magna " ) , on the western side of the island , and another , much frequented by fishing-boats , 5146 on the south coast near Ibiza . The productions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early times of much importance , since the islands are not , like Sardinia , rich in metals , nor were the inhabitants sufficiently civilised to furnish food supplies or native manufactures in any quantity . If , then , the Phoenicians held them , it must have been altogether for the sake of their harbours . The colonies of the Mediterranean have now been , all of them , noticed , excepting those which lay upon the south coast of Spain . Of these the most important were Malaca ( now Malaga ) , Sex or Sexti , and Abdera ( now Adra ) . Malaca is said by Strabo to have been " Phoenician in its plan , " 5147 Abdera is expressly declared by him to have been " a Phoenician settlement , " 5148 while Sexti has coins which connect it with early Phoenician legends. 5149 The mountain range above Malaca was anciently rich in gold-mines ; 5150 Sexti was famous for its salt-pans ; 5151 Abdera lay in the neighbourhood of productive silver-mines. 5152 These were afterwards worked from Carthagena , which was a late Carthaginian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Malaga and Carthagena ( i.e. New-Town ) had well-sheltered harbours ; but the ports of Sexti and Abdera were indifferent . Outside the Straits of Gibraltar , on the shores of the Atlantic , were two further sets of Phoenician colonies , situated respectively in Africa and in Spain . The most important of those in Africa were Tingis ( now Tangiers ) and Lixus ( now Chemmish ) , but besides these there were a vast number of staples ( emporia ) without names , 5153 spread along the coast as far as Cape Non , opposite the Canary Islands . Tingis , a second Gibraltar , lay nearly opposite that wonderful rock , but a little west of the narrowest part of the strait . It had a temple of the Tyrian Hercules , said to have been older than that at Gades ; 5154 and its coins have Phoenician legends. 5155 The town was situated on a promontory running out to the north-east at the extremity of a semicircular bay about four miles in width , and thus possessed a harbour not to be despised , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once beautiful and fertile , dotted over with palms , and well calculated for the growth of fruit and vegetables . The Atlas mountains rose in the background , with their picturesque summits , while in front were seen the blue Mediterranean , with its crisp waves merging into the wilder Atlantic , and further off the shores of Spain , lying like a blue film on the northern horizon. 5156 While Tingis lay at the junction of the two seas , on the northern African coast , about five miles east of Cape Spartel , Lixus was situated on the open Atlantic , forty miles to the south of that cape , on the West African coast , looking westward towards the ocean . The streams from Atlas here collect into a considerable river , known now as the Wady-el-Khous , and anciently as the Lixus. 5157 The estuary of this river , before reaching the sea , meanders through the plain of Sidi Oueddar , from time to time returning upon itself , and forming peninsulas , which are literally almost islands. 5158 From this plain , between two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one place a rocky hill ; and here the Phoenicians built their town , protecting it along the brow of the hill with a strong wall , portions of which still remain in place. 5159 The blocks are squared , carefully dressed , and arranged in horizontal courses , without any cement . Some of them are as much as eleven feet long by six feet or somewhat more in height . The wall was flanked at the corners by square towers , and formed a sort of irregular hexagon , above a mile in circumference. 5160 A large building within the walls seems to have been a temple ; 5161 and in it was found one of those remarkable conical stones which are known to have been employed in the Phoenician worship . The estuary of the river formed a tolerably safe harbour for the Phoenician ships , and the valley down which the river flows gave a ready access into the interior . In Spain , outside the Pillars of Hercules , the chief Phoenician settlements were Tartessus , Agadir or Gades , and Belon . Tartessus has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country rather than a town ; 5162 but the statements of the Greek and Roman geographers to the contrary are too positive to be disregarded . Tartessus was a town in the opinions of Scymnus Chius , Strabo , Mela , Pliny , Festus Avienus , and Pausanias , 5163 who could not be , all of them , mistaken on such a point . It was a town named from , or at any rate bearing the same name with , an important river of southern Spain , 5164 probably the Guadalquivir . It was not Gades , for Scymnus Chius mentions both cities as existing in his day ; 5165 it was not Carteia , for it lay west of Gades , while Carteia lay east . Probably it occupied , as Strabo thought , a small island between two arms of the Guadalquivir , and gradually decayed as Gades rose to importance . It certainly did not exist in Strabo 's time , but five or six centuries earlier it was a most flourishing place. 5166 If it is the Tarshish of Scripture , its prosperity and importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose " navy of Tarshish " brought him once in every three years " gold , and silver , and ivory , and apes , and peacocks. " 5167 The south of Spain was rich in metallic treasures , and yielded gold , silver , copper , iron , lead , and tin ; 5168 trade along the west coast of Africa would bring in the ivory and apes abundant in that region ; while the birds called in our translation of the Bible " peacocks " may have been guinea-fowl . The country on either side of the Guadalquivir to a considerable distance took its name from the city , being called Tartessis. 5169 It was immensely productive . " The wide plains through which the Guadalquiver flows produced the finest wheat , yielding an increase of a hundredfold ; the oil and the wine , the growth of the hills , were equally distinguished for their excellence . The wood was not less remarkable for its fineness than in modern times , and had a native colour beautiful without dye . " 5170 Nor were the neighbouring sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large quantities off the coast , shell-fish were abundant and of unusual size , 5171 while huge eels were sometimes taken by the fishermen , which , when salted , formed an article of commerce , and were reckoned a delicacy at Athenian tables. 5172 Gades is said to have been founded by colonists from Tyre a few years anterior to the foundation of Utica by the same people. 5173 Utica , as we have seen , dated from the twelfth century before Christ . The site of Gades combined all the advantages that the Phoenicians desired for their colonies . Near the mouth of the Guadalete there detaches itself from the coast of Spain an island eleven miles in length , known now as the " Isla de Leon , " which is separated from the mainland for half its length by a narrow but navigable channel , while to this there succeeds on the north an ample bay , divided into two portions , a northern and a southern. 5174 The southern , or interior recess , is completely sheltered from all winds ; the northern lies open to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coves , and estuaries as to offer a succession of fairly good ports , one or other of which would always be accessible . The southern half of the island is from one to four miles broad ; but the northern consists of a long spit of land running out to the north-west , in places not more than a furlong in width , but expanding at its northern extremity to a breadth of nearly two miles . The long isthmus , and the peninsula in which it ends , have been compared to the stalk and blossom of a flower. 5175 The flower was the ancient Gades , the modern Cadiz . The Phoenician occupation of the site is witnessed to by Strabo , Diodorus , Scymnus Chius , Mela , Pliny , Velleius Paterculus , AElian and Arrian , 5176 and is further evidenced by the numerous coins which bear the legend of " Agadir " in Phoenician characters. 5177 But the place itself retains no traces of the Phoenician occupation . The famous temple of Melkarth , with its two bronze pillars in front bearing inscriptions , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient buildings . This is the result of the continuous occupation of the site , which has been built on successively by Phoenicians , Carthaginians , Romans , Vandals , Moors , and Spaniards . The space is somewhat confined , and the houses in ancient times were , we are told , closely crowded together , 5178 as they were at Aradus and Tyre . But the advantages of the harbour and the productiveness of the vicinity more than made up for this inconvenience . Gades may have been , as Cadiz is now said to be , " a mere silver plate set down upon the edge of the sea , " 5179 but it was the natural centre of an enormous traffic . It had easy access by the valley of a large stream to the interior with its rich mineral and vegetable products ; it had the command of two seas , the Atlantic and the Mediterranean ; it trained its sailors to affront greater perils than any which the Mediterranean offers ; and it enjoyed naturally by its position an almost exclusive commerce with the Northern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with Britain , North Germany , and the Baltic . Compared with Gades and Tartessus , Belon was an insignificant settlement . Its name5180 and coins5181 mark it as Phoenician , but it was not possessed of any special advantages of situation . The modern Bolonia , a little south of Cadiz , is thought to mark the site. 5182 We have reached now the limits of Phoenician colonisation towards the West . While their trade was carried , especially from Gades , into Luisitania and Gallaecia on the one hand , and into North-western Africa on the other , reaching onward past these districts to Gaul and Britain , to the Senegal and Gambia , possibly to the Baltic and the Fortunate Islands , the range of their settlements was more circumscribed . As , towards the north-east , though their trade embraced the regions of Colchis and Thrace , of the Tauric Chersonese , and Southern Scythia , their settlements were limited to the AEgean and perhaps the Propontis , so westward they seem to have contented themselves with occupying a few points of vantage on the Spanish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Straits , and from these stations to have sent out their commercial navies to sweep the seas and gather in the products of the lands which lay at a greater distance . The actual extent of their trade will be considered in a later chapter . We have been here concerned only with their permanent settlements or colonies . These , it has been seen , extended from the Syrian coast to Cyprus , Cilicia , Rhodes , Crete , the islands and shores of the AEgean and Propontis , the coasts of Sicily , Sardinia , and North Africa , the Balearic Islands , Southern Spain , and North-western Africa as far south as Cape Non . The colonisation was not so continuous as the Greek , nor was it so extensive in one direction , 5183 but on the whole it was wider , and it was far bolder and more adventurous . The Greeks , as a general rule , made their advances by slow degrees , stealing on from point to point , and having always friendly cities near at hand , like an army that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of space between one settlement and another , boldly planted them on barbarous shores , where they had nothing to rely on but themselves , and carried them into regions where the natives were in a state of almost savagery . The commercial motive was predominant with them , and gave them the courage to plunge into wild seas and venture themselves among even wilder men . With the Greeks the motive was generally political , and a safe home was sought , where social and civil life might have free scope for quiet development .

The architecture of the Phoenicians began with the fashioning of the native rock  --  so abundant in all parts of the country where they had settled themselves  --  into dwellings , temples , and tombs . The calcareous limestone , which is the chief geological formation along the Syrian coast , is worked with great ease ; and it contains numerous fissures and caverns , 61 which a very moderate amount of labour and skill is capable of converting into fairly comfortable dwelling-places . It is probable that the first settlers found a refuge for a time in these natural grottos , which after a while they proceeded to improve and enlarge , thus obtaining a practical power of dealing with the material , and an experimental knowledge of its advantages and defects . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to content them , and they were seized with an ambition to construct more elaborate edifices  --  edifices such as they must have seen in the lands through which they had passed on their way from the shores of the Persian Gulf to the seaboard of the Mediterranean . They could not at once , however , divest themselves of their acquired habits , and consequently , their earliest buildings continued to have , in part , the character of rock dwellings , while in part they were constructions of the more ordinary and regular type . The remains of a dwelling-house at Amrith , 62 the ancient Marathus , offer a remarkable example of this intermixture of styles . The rock has been cut away so as to leave standing two parallel walls 33 yards long , 19 feet high , and 2 1/2 feet thick , which are united by transverse party-walls formed in the same way. 63 Windows and doorways are cut in the walls , some square at top , some arched . At the two ends the main walls were united partly by the native rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of masonry from the very foundation , the southern consisted for a portion of its height of the native rock , while above that were several courses of stones carrying it up further . At Aradus and at Sidon , similarly , the town walls are formed in many places of native rock , squared and smoothed , up to a certain height , after which courses of stone succeed each other in the ordinary fashion . It is as if the Phoenician builders could not break themselves of an inveterate habit , and rather than disuse it entirely submitted to an intermixture which was not without a certain amount of awkwardness . Another striking example of the mixed system is found at a little distance from Amrith , in the case of a building which appears to have been a shrine , tabernacle , or sanctuary . The site is a rocky platform , about a mile from the shore . Here the rock has been cut away to a depth varying from three to six yards , and a rectangular court has been formed , 180 feet long by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been left a single block of the stone , still of one piece with the court , which rises to a height of ten feet , and forms the basis or pedestal of the shrine itself. 64 The shrine is built of a certain number of large blocks , which have been quarried and brought to the spot ; it has a stone roof with an entablature , and attains an elevation above the court of not less than twenty-seven feet . The dimensions of the shrine are small , not much exceeding seventeen feet each way. 65 From constructions of this mixed character the transition was easy to buildings composed entirely of detached stones put together in the ordinary manner . Here , what is chiefly remarkable in the Phoenician architecture is the tendency to employ , especially for the foundations and lower courses of buildings , enormous blocks . When the immovable native rock is no longer available , the resource is to make use of vast masses of stone , as nearly immovable as possible . The most noted example is that of the substructions which supported the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work of the Phoenician builders whom Hiram lent to Solomon. 66 These substructions , laid bare at their base by the excavations of the Palestine Exploration Fund , are found to consist of blocks measuring from fifteen to twenty-five feet in length , and from ten to twelve feet in height . The width of the blocks at the angles of the wall , where alone it can be measured , is from twelve to eighteen feet . At the south-west angle no fewer than thirty-one courses of this massive character have been counted by the recent explorers , who estimate the weight of the largest block at something above a hundred tons ! 67 A similar method of construction is found to have prevailed at Tyre , at Sidon , at Aradus , at Byblus , at Leptis Major , at Eryx , at Motya , at Gaulos , and at Lixus on the West African coast . The blocks employed do not reach the size of the largest discovered at Jerusalem , but still are of dimensions greatly exceeding those of most builders , varying , as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and being often as much as seven or eight feet in breadth and height . As the building rises , the stones diminish in size , and the upper courses are often in no way remarkable . Stones of various sizes are used , and often the courses are not regular , but one runs into another . A tower in the wall of Eryx is a good specimen of this kind of construction. 68 Where the stones are small , mortar has been employed by the builders , but where they are of a large size , they are merely laid side by side in rows or courses , without mortar or cement of any kind , and remain in place through their own mass and weight . In the earliest style of building the blocks are simply squared , 69 and the wall composed of them presents a flat and level surface , or one only broken by small and casual irregularities ; but , when their ideas became more advanced , the Phoenicians preferred that style of masonry which is commonly regarded as peculiarly , if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeply bevelled edges . The bevel is a depression round the entire side of the stone , which faces outwards , and may be effected either by a sloping cut which removes the right-angle from the edge , or by two cuts , one perpendicular and the other horizontal , which take out from the edge a rectangular bar or plinth . The Phoenician bevelling is of this latter kind , and is generally accompanied by an artificial roughening of the surface inside the bevel , which offers a strong contrast to the smooth and even surface of the bevel itself. 611 The style is highly ornamental and effective , particularly where a large space of wall has to be presented to the eye , unbroken by door or window. 612 Occasionally , but very rarely , and only ( so far as appears ) in their remoter dependencies , the Phoenicians constructed their buildings in the rude and irregular way , which has been called Cyclopian , employing unhewn polygonal blocks of various sizes , and fitting them roughly together . The temples discovered in Malta and Gozzo have masonry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connected with the preference for enormous blocks over stones of a moderate size , is the frequent combination in a single mass of distinct architectural members ; for instance , of the shaft and capital of pillars , of entire pediments with a portion of the wall below them , and of the walls of monuments with the cornice and architrave . M. Renan has made some strong remarks on this idiosyncrasy . " In the Grecian style , " he says , " the beauty of the wall is a main object with the architect , and the wall derives its beauty from the divisions between the stones , which observe symmetrical laws , and are in agreement with the general lines of the edifice . In a style of this kind the stones of a wall have , all of them , the same dimension , and this dimension is determined by the general plan of the building ; or else , as in the kind of work which is called ' pseud-isodomic , ' the very irregularity of the courses is governed by a law of symmetry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triglyphs , are , all of them , separate blocks , even when it would have been perfectly easy to have included in a single block all these various members . Such facts , as one observes frequently in Syria , where three or four architectural members are brought out from a single block , would have appeared to the Greeks monstrous , since they are the negation of all logic . " 614 In can not be denied that the habit of preferring large to small blocks , even in monuments of a very moderate size , involved the Phoenician architects in awkwardnesses and anomalies , which offend a cultivated taste ; but it should be remembered , on the other hand , that massiveness in the material conduces greatly to stability , and that , in lands where earthquakes are frequent , as they are along all the Mediterranean shores , not many monuments would have survived the lapse of three thousand years had the material employed been of a less substantial and solid character . Among the Phoenician constructions , of which it is possible to give some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the imagination , are their shrines , their temples , the walls of their towns , and , above all , their tombs . Recent researches in Phoenicia Proper , in Cyprus , Sicily , Africa , and the smaller Mediterranean islands , have brought to light numerous remains previously unknown ; the few previously known remains have been carefully examined , measured , and in some cases photographed ; and the results have been made accessible to the student in numerous well-illustrated publications . When Movers and Kenrick published their valuable works on the history of Phoenicia , and the general characteristics of the Phoenician people , it was quite impossible to do more than form conjectures concerning their architecture from a few coins , and a few descriptions in ancient writers . It is now a matter of comparatively little difficulty to set before the public descriptions and representations which , if they still leave something to be desired in the way of completeness , are accurate , so far as they go , and will give a tolerably fair idea of the architectural genius of the people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Phoenicia Proper , in positions and of a character which , in the judgment of the best antiquaries , mark them as the work of the ancient people . All these are situated on the mainland , near the site of Marathus , which lay nearly opposite the island of Ruad , the ancient Aradus . The shrine which is complete , or almost complete , bears the name of " the Maabed " or " Temple . " Its central position , in the middle of an excavated court , and its mixed construction , partly of native rock and partly of quarried stone , have been already described . It remains to give an account of the shrine or tabernacle itself. 615 This is emplaced upon the mass of rock left to receive it midway in the court , and is a sort of cell , closed in on three sides by walls , and open on one side , towards the north . The cell is formed of four quarried blocks , which are laid one over the other . These are nearly of the same size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cell on three sides , towards the east , the south , and the west . The fourth , which is larger than any of the others , constitutes the roof . It is a massive stone , carefully cut , which projects considerably in front of the rest of the building , and is ornamented towards the top with a cornice and string-course , extending along the four sides. 616 Internally the roof is scooped into a sort of shallow vault . The height of the shrine proper is about seventeen feet , and the elevation of the entire structure above the court in which it stands appears to be about twenty-seven feet . M. Renan conjectures that the projecting portion of the roof had originally the support of two pillars , which may have been either of wood , of stone , or of metal , and notes that there are two holes in the basement stone , into which the bottoms of the pillars were probably inserted. 617 He imagines that the court was once enclosed completely by the construction of a wall at its northern end , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rises within the enclosure , was allowed to overflow the entire space , so that the shrine looked down upon a basin or shallow lake and glassed itself in the waters. 618 An image of a deity may have stood in the cell under the roof , dimly visible to the worshipper between the two porch pillars . The two ruined tabernacles lie at no great distance from the complete one , which has just been described . One of them is so injured that its plan is irrecoverable ; but M. Renan carefully collected and measured the fragments of the other , and thus obtained sufficient data for its restoration. 619 It was , he believes , a monolithic chamber , with a roof slightly vaulted , like that of the Maabed , having a length of eight feet , a breadth of five , and a height of about ten feet , and ornamented externally with a very peculiar cornice . This consisted of a series of carvings , representing the fore part of an uraeus or basilisk serpent , uprearing itself against the wall of the shrine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was also an internal ornamentation of the roof , consisting of a winged circle of an Egyptian character  --  a favourite subject with the Phoenician artists620  --  the circle having an uraeus erect on either side of it , and also of another winged figure which appeared to represent an eagle. 621 The monolithic chamber was emplaced upon a block of stone , ten feet in length and breadth , and six feet in height , which itself stood upon a much smaller stone , and overhung it on all sides . A flight of six steps , cut in the upper block at either side , gave access to the chamber , which , however , as it stood in a pool of water , must have been approached by a boat . The entire height of the shrine above the water must have been about eighteen feet . Some other ruined shrines have been found in the more distant of the Phoenician settlements , and representations of them are common upon the stelae , set up in temples as votive offerings . On these last the uraeus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goddess sometimes appears , standing between the pillars which support the front of the shrine. 622 There is a decided resemblance between the Phoenician shrines and the small Egyptian temples , which have been called mammeisi , the chief difference being that the latter are for the most part peristylar. 623 M. Renan says of the Maabed , or main shrine at Amrith :  --  " L'aspect general de l'edifice est Egyptian , mais avec une certaine part d'originalite . Le bandeau et la corniche sur les quatre cotes de la stalle superiere en sont le seul ornement . Cette simplicite , cette severite de style , jointes a l'idee de force et de puissance qu'eveillent les dimensions enormes des materiaux employes , sont des caracteres que nous avons deja signales dans les monumens funeraires d'Amrith. " 624 From the shrines of the Phoenicians we may now pass to their temples , of which , however , the remains are , unfortunately , exceedingly scanty . Of real temples , as distinct from shrines , Phoenicia Proper does not present to us so much as a single specimen . To obtain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , and betake ourselves to the colonies , especially to those island colonies which have been less subjected than the mainland to the destructive ravages of barbarous conquerors , and the iconoclasm of fanatical populations . It is especially in Cyprus that we meet with extensive remains , which , if not so instructive as might have been wished , yet give us some important and interesting information . The temple of Paphos , according to the measurements of General Di Cesnola , 625 was a rectangular building , 221 feet long by 167 feet wide , built along its lower corners of large blocks of stone , but probably continued above in an inferior material , either wood or unbaked brick. 626 The four corner-stones are still standing in their proper places , and give the dimensions without a possibility of mistake . Nothing is known of the internal arrangements , unless we attach credit to the views of the savant Gerhard , who , in the early years of the present century , constructed a plan from the reports of travellers , in which he divided the building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front , and a sacrarium at the further extremity. 627 M. Gerhard also added , beyond the sacrarium , an apse , of which General Di Cesnola found no traces , but which may possibly have disappeared in the course of the sixty years which separated the observations of M. Gerhard 's informants from the researches of the later traveller . The arrangement into a nave and two aisles is , to a certain extent , confirmed by some of the later Cyprian coins , which certainly represent Cyprian temples , and probably the temple of Paphos. 628 The floor of the temple was , in part at any rate , covered with mosaic. 629 This large building , which extended over an area of 36,800 square feet , was emplaced within a sacred court , surrounded by a peribolus , or wall of enclosure , built of even larger blocks than the temple itself , and entered by at least one huge doorway . The width of this entrance , situated near a corner of the western wall , was nearly eighteen feet. 630 On one side of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bolts on which the door swung , in length six inches , and of proportionate width and depth . The peribolus was rectangular , like the temple , and was built in lines parallel to it . The longer sides measured 690 and the shorter 530 feet . One block , which was of blue granite and must have come either from Asia Minor or from Egypt , measured fifteen feet ten inches in length , with a width of seven feet eleven inches , and a depth of two feet five inches. 631 It is thought that the court was probably surrounded by a colonnade or cloister , 632 though no traces have been at present observed either of the pillars which must have supported such a cloister or of the rafters which must have formed its roof . Ponds , 633 fountains , shrubberies , gardens , groves of trees , probably covered the open space between the cloister and the temple , while well-shaded walks led across it from the gates of the enclosure to those of the sanctuary . If we allow ourselves to indulge our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temple according to the idea which the coins above represented naturally suggest , we may suppose that it did , in fact , consist of a nave , two aisles , and a cell , or " holy of holies , " the nave being of superior height to the aisles , and rising in front into a handsome facade , like the western end of a cathedral flanked by towers . Through the open doorway between the towers might be seen dimly the sacred cone or pillar which was emblematic of deity ; on either side the eye caught the ends of the aisles , not more than half the height of the towers , and each crowned with a strongly projecting cornice , perhaps ornamented with a row of uraei . In front of the two aisles , standing by themselves , were twin columns , like Jachin and Boaz before the Temple of Solomon . The aisles were certainly roofed : whether the nave also was covered in , or whether , like the Greek hypaethral temples , it lay open to the blue vault of heaven , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a few courses of hewn stone , were probably of wood , perhaps of cedar , enriched with the precious metals , and the pavement was adorned with a mosaic of many colours , " white , yellow , red , brown , and rose . " 634 Outside the temple was a mass of verdure . " In the sacred precinct , and in its dependencies , all breathed of voluptuousness , all spoke to the senses . The air of the place was full of perfumes , full of soft and caressing sounds . There was the murmur of rills which flowed over a carpet of flowers ; there was , in the foliage above , the song of the nightingale , and the prolonged and tender cooing of the dove ; there were , in the groves around , the tones of the flute , the instrument which sounds the call to pleasure , and summons to the banquet chamber the festive procession and the bridal train . Beneath the shelter of tents , or of light booths with walls formed by the skilful interlacing of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laurel spread their odours , dwelt the fair slaves of the goddess , those whom Pindar called , in the drinking-song which he composed for Theoxenus of Corinth , ' the handmaids of persuasion . ' " 635 Here and there in the precincts , sacred processions took their prescribed way ; ablutions were performed ; victims led up to the temple ; votive offerings hung on the trees ; festal dances , it may be , performed ; while in the cloister which skirted the peribolus , dealers in shrines and images chaffered with their customers , erotic poets sang their lays , lovers whispered , fortune-tellers plied their trade , and a throng of pilgrims walked lazily along , or sat on the ground , breathing in the soft , moist air , feasting their eyes upon the beauty of upspringing fountain and flowering shrub , and lofty tree , while their ears drank in the cadences of the falling waters , the song of the birds , and the gay music which floated lightly on the summer breeze . Phoenician temples had sometimes adjuncts , as cathedrals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once interesting and important . There has been discovered at Athienau in Cyprus  --  the supposed site of Golgi  --  a ruined edifice , which some have taken for a temple , 636 but which appears to have been rather a repository for votive offerings , a sort of ecclesiastical museum . A picture of the edifice , as he conceives it to have stood in its original condition , has been drawn by one of its earliest visitants . " The building , " he says , 637 " was constructed of sun-dried bricks , forming four walls , the base of which rested upon a substruction of solid stone-work . The walls were covered , as are the houses of the Cypriot peasants of to-day , with a stucco which was either white or coloured , and which was impenetrable by rain . Wooden pillars with stone capitals supported internally a pointed roof , which sloped at a low angle . It formed thus a sort of terrace , like the roofs that we see in Cyprus at the present day . This roof was composed of a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was spread a layer of rushes and coarse mats , covered with a thick bed of earth well pressed together , equally effective against the entrance of moisture and against the sun 's rays . Externally the building must have presented a very simple appearance . In the interior , which received no light except from the wide doorways in the walls , an immovable and silent crowd of figures in stone , with features and garments made more striking by the employment of paint , surrounded , as with a perpetual worship , the mystic cone . Stone lamps , shaped like diminutive temples , illumined in the corners the grinning ex-votos which hung upon the walls , and the curious pictures with which they were accompanied . Grotesque bas-reliefs adorned the circuit of the edifice , where the slanting light was reflected from the white and polished pavement-stones. " 638 In length and breadth the chamber measured sixty feet by thirty ; the thickness of the basement wall was three feet. 639 Midway between the side walls stood three rows of large square pedestals  --  regularly spaced , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which some critics regard as bases for statues , and some as supports for the pillars which sustained the roof. 640 Two stone capitals of pillars were found within the area of the chamber ; and it is conjectured that the entire disappearance of the shafts may be accounted for by their having been of wood , 641 the employment of wooden shafts with stone bases and capitals being common in Cyprus at the present time. 642 Against each of the four walls was a row of pedestals touching each other , which had certainly been bases for statues , since the statues were found lying , mostly broken , in front of them . The figures varied greatly in size , some being colossal , others mere statuettes . Most probably all were votive offerings , presented by those who imagined that they had been helped by the god of the temple to which the chamber belonged , as an indication of their gratitude . The number of pedestals found along one of the walls was seventy-two , 643 and the original number must have been at least three times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not far from Paphos , contained a very remarkable crypt , which appears to have been used as a treasure-house. 644 It was entered by means of a flight of steps which conducted to a low and narrow passage cut in the rock , and giving access to a set of three similar semi-circular chambers , excavated side by side , and separated one from another by doors . Beyond the third of these , and at right angles to it , was a fourth somewhat smaller chamber , which gave upon a second passage that it was found impossible to explore. 645 The three principal chambers were fourteen feet six inches in height , twenty-three feet long , and twenty-one feet broad . The fourth was a little smaller , 646 and shaped somewhat irregularly . All contained plate and jewels of extraordinary richness , and often of rare workmanship . " The treasure found , " says M. Perrot , " surpassed all expectation , and even all hope . Never had such a discovery been made of such a collection of precious articles , where the material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ styles most curious . There were many bracelets of massive gold , and among them two which weighed a pound apiece , and several others of a weight not much short of this . Gold was met with in profusion under all manner of forms  --  finger-rings , ear-rings , amulets , flasks , small bottles , hair-pins , heavy necklaces . Silver was found in even greater abundance , both in ornaments and in vessels ; besides which there were articles in electrum , which is an amalgam of silver with gold . Among the stones met with were rock-crystals , carnelians , onyxes , agates , and other hard stones of every variety ; and further there were paste jewels , cylinders in soft stone , statuettes in burnt clay , earthen vases , and also many objects in bronze , as lamps , tripods , candelabra , chairs , vases , arms , &c.; &c.; A certain amount of order reigned in the repository . The precious objects in gold were collected together principally in the first chamber . The second contained the silver vessels , which were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the height of about eight inches above the floor . Unfortunately the oxydation of these vessels had proceeded to such lengths , that only a very small number could be extracted from the mass , which for the most part crumbled into dust at the touch of a finger . The third chamber held lamps and fibulae in bronze , vases in alabaster , and , above all , the groups and vessels modelled in clay ; while the fourth was the repository of the utensils in bronze , and of a certain number which were either in copper or in iron . In the further passage , which was not completely explored , there were nevertheless found seven kettles in bronze . " 647 In the construction of the walls of their towns , especially of those which were the most ancient , the feature which is most striking at first sight is that on which some remarks have already been made , the attachment of the lower portion of the wall to the soil from which the wall springs . At Sidon , at Aradus , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , up to the height of ten or twelve feet , of native rock , cut to a perpendicular face , upon which were emplaced several courses of hewn stone . The principle adopted was to utilise the rock as far as possible , and then to supplement what was wanting by a superstructure of masonry . Large blocks of stone , shaped to fit the upper surface of the rock , were laid upon it , generally endways , that is , with their smallest surface outwards , their length forming the thickness of the wall , which was sometimes as much as fifteen or twenty feet. 648 The massive blocks , once placed , were almost immovable , and it was considered enough to lay them side by side , without clamps or mortar , since their own weight kept them in place . It was not thought of much consequence whether the joints of the courses coincided or not ; though care was taken that , if a coincidence occurred in two courses , it should not be repeated in the third. 649 The elevation of walls does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet , though Diodorus makes the walls of Carthage sixty feet high , 650 and Arrian gives to the wall of Tyre which faced the continent the extraordinary height of a hundred and fifty feet. 651 If we may generalise from the most perfect specimens of Phoenician town-walls that are still fairly traceable , as those of Eryx and Lixus , 652 we may lay it down , that such walls were usually flanked , at irregular intervals , by square or rectangular towers , which projected considerably beyond the line of the curtain . The towers were of a more massive construction than the wall itself , especially in the lower portion , where vast blocks were common . The wall was also broken at intervals by gates , some of which were posterns , either arched or covered in by flat stones , 653 while others were of larger dimensions , and were protected , on one side or on both , by bastions . The sites of towns were commonly eminences , and the line of the walls followed the irregularities of the ground , crowning the slopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Thapsus , where the wall had to be carried across a flat space , the wall of defence was doubled , or even tripled . The restorations of Daux654 contain , no doubt , a good deal that is fanciful ; but they give , probably , a fair idea of the general character of the so-called " triple wall " of certain Phoenician cities . The outer line , or proteikhisma , was little more than an earthwork , consisting of a ditch , with the earth from it thrown up inwards , crowned perhaps at top with a breastwork of masonry . The second line was far more elaborate . There was first a ditch deeper than the outer one , while behind this rose a perpendicular battlemented wall to the height , from the bottom of the ditch , of nearly forty feet . In the thickness of the wall , which was not much less than the height , were chambers for magazines and cisterns , while along the top , behind the parapet , ran a platform , from which the defenders discharged their arrows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the distance of about thirty yards , came the main line of defence , which in general character resembled the second , but was loftier and stronger . There was , first , a third ditch ( or moat , if water could be introduced ) , and behind it a wall thirty-five feet thick and sixty feet high , pierced by two rows of embrasures from which arrows could be discharged , and having a triple platform for the defenders . This wall was kept entirely clear of the houses of the town , and the different storeys could be reached by sloping ascents or internal staircases . It was flanked at intervals by square towers , somewhat higher than the walls , which projected sufficiently for the defenders to enfilade the assailants when they approached the base of the curtain . The tombs of the Phoenicians were , most usually , underground constructions , either simple excavations in the rock , or subterranean chambers , built of hewn stone , at the bottom of sloping passages , or perpendicular shafts , which gave access to them . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Jews . A chamber is opened in the rock , in the sides of which are hollowed out , horizontally , a number of caverns or loculi , each one intended to receive a corpse. 655 If more space is needed , a passage is made from one of the sides of the chamber to a certain distance , and then a second chamber is excavated , and more loculi are formed ; and the process is repeated as often as necessary . But chambers thus excavated were apt to collapse , especially if the rock was of the soft and friable nature so common in Phoenicia Proper and in Cyprus ; on which account , in such soils , the second kind of tomb was preferred , sepulchural chambers being solidly built , 656 either singly or in groups , each made to hold a certain number of sarcophagi . The most remarkable tombs of this class are those found at Amathus , on the south coast of Cyprus , by General Di Cesnola . They lie at the depth of from forty to fifty-five feet below the surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built of huge stones , carefully squared , some of them twenty feet in length , nine in breadth , and three in thickness , and even averaging a length of fourteen feet. 658 Two shapes occur . Some of the tombs are almost perfect cubes , the upright walls rising to a height of twelve or fifteen feet , and being then covered in by three or four long slabs of stone . Others resemble huts , having a gable at either end , and a sloping roof formed of slabs which meet and support each other . A squared doorway , from five to six feet in height , gives entrance to the tombs at one end , and has for ornament a fourfold fillet , which surrounds it on three sides . Otherwise , ornamentation is absent , the stonework of both walls and roofs being absolutely plain and bare . Internally the chambers present the same naked appearance , walls and roofs being equally plain , and the floor paved with oblong slabs of stone , about a foot and a half in length . The grouped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chambers only , one opening directly into the other , and not always similarly roofed . Occasionally , groups of three are found , and there are examples of groups of four . In these instances , the exact symmetry is remarkable . A single doorway of the usual character gives entrance to a nearly square chamber , the exact dimensions of which are thirteen feet four inches by twelve feet two inches . Midway in the side and opposite walls are three other doorways , each of them three foot six inches in width , which lead into exactly similar square chambers , having a length of twelve feet two inches , and a width of ten feet nine. 659 Chambers of the character here described contain in almost every instance stone sarcophagi . These are ranged along the walls , at a little distance from them . The chambers commonly contain two or three ; but sometimes one sarcophagus is superimposed upon another , and in this way the number occasionally reaches to six. 660 Mostly , the sarcophagi are plain , or nearly so , but are covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are elaborately carved , and constitute works of art , which are of the highest value . An account will be given of the most remarkable of these objects in the chapter on Phoenician AEsthetic Art . Another distinct type of Phoenician tomb is that which is peculiar to Nea-Paphos , and which is thought by some to have been employed exclusively by the High Priests of the great temple there. 661 The peculiarity of these burial-places is , that the sepulchral chambers are adjuncts of a quadrangular court open to the sky , and surrounded by a colonnade supported on pillars. 662 The court , the colonnade , the pillars , the entablature , and the chambers , with their niches for the dead , are all equally cut out of the rock , as well as the passage by which the court is entered , at one corner of the quadrangle . The columns are either square or rounded , the rounded ones having capitals resembling those of the Doric order ; and the entablature is also a rough imitation of the Doric triglyphs , and guttae . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , behind the pillars ; 663 and the chambers contain , beside niches , a certain number of bases for sarcophagi , but no sarcophagi have been found in them . The quadrangle is of a small size , not more than about eighteen feet each way . Thus far we have described that portion of the sepulchral architecture of the Phoenicians which is most hidden from sight , lying , as it does , beneath the surface of the soil . With tombs of this quiet character the Phoenicians were ordinarily contented . They were not , however , wholly devoid of those feelings with respect to their dead which have caused the erection , in most parts of the world , of sepulchral monuments intended to attract the eye , and to hand on to later ages the memory of the departed . Well acquainted with Egypt , they could not but have been aware from the earliest times of those massive piles which the vanity of Egyptian monarchs had raised up for their own glorification on the western side of the valley of the Nile ; nor in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus664 or the Tomb of the Maccabees. 665 Accordingly , we find them , at a very remote period , not merely anxious to inter their dead decently and carefully in rock tombs or subterranean chambers of massive stone , but also wishful upon occasions to attract attention to the last resting-places of their great men , by constructions which showed themselves above the ground , and had some architectural pretensions . One of these , situated near Amrith , the ancient Marathus , is a very curious and peculiar structure . It is known at the present day as the Burdj-el-Bezzak , 666 and was evidently constructed to be , like the pyramids , at once a monument and a tomb . It is an edifice , built of large blocks of stone , and rising to a height of thirty-two feet above the plain at its base , so contrived as to contain two sepulchral chambers , the one over the other . Externally , the monument is plain almost to rudeness , being little more than a cubic mass , broken only by two doorways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front . Internally , there is more art and contrivance . The chambers are very carefully constructed , and contain a number of niches intended to receive sarcophagi , the lower having accommodation for three and the upper for twelve bodies. 667 It is thought that originally the cubic mass , which is all that now remains , was surmounted by a pyramidical roof , many stones from which were found by M. Renan among the debris that were scattered around . The height of the monument was thus increased by perhaps one-half , and did not fall much short of sixty-five feet. 668 The cornice , which is now seen on one side only , and which is there imperfect , originally , no doubt , encircled the entire edifice . The other constructions erected by the Phoenicians to mark the resting-places of their dead are simple monuments erected near , and generally over , the tombs in which the bodies are interred . The best known is probably that in the vicinity of Tyre , which the natives call the Kabr-Hiram , or " Tomb of Hiram. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which appears to be a purely modern one ; 670 but the monument is undoubtedly ancient , perhaps as ancient as any other in Phoenicia. 671 It is composed of eight courses of huge stones superimposed one upon another , 672 the blocks having in some cases a length of eleven or twelve feet , with a breadth of seven or eight , and a depth of three feet . The courses retreat slightly , with the exception of the fifth , which projects considerably beyond the line of the fourth and still more beyond that of the sixth . The whole effect is less that of a pyramid than of a stele or pillar , the width at top being not very much smaller than that at the base . The monument is a solid mass , and is not a square but a rectangular oblong , the broader sides measuring fourteen feet and the narrower about eight feet six inches . Two out of the eight courses are of the nature of substructions , being supplemental to the rock , which supplies their place in part ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light by means of excavation . Hence the earlier travellers speak of the monument as having no more than six courses . The present height above the soil is a little short of twenty-five feet . A flight of steps cut in the rock leads down from the monument to a sepulchral chamber , which , however , contains neither sepulchral niche nor sarcophagus . But the most striking of the Phoenician sepulchral monuments are to be found in the north of Phoenicia , and not in the south , in the neighbourhood , not of Tyre and Sidon , but of Marathus and Aradus . Two of them , known as the Meghazil , 673 form a group which is very remarkable , and which , if we may trust the restoration of M. Thobois , 674 must have had considerable architectural merit . Situated very near each other , on the culminating point of a great plateau of rock , they dominate the country far and wide , and attract the eye from a long distance . One seems to have been in much simpler and better taste than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masterpiece , in respect of proportion , of elegance , and of majesty . " 675 It is built altogether in three stages . First , there is a circular basement story flanked by four figures of lions , attached to the wall behind them , and only showing in front of it their heads , their shoulders , and their fore paws . This basement , which has a height of between seven and eight feet , is surmounted by a cylindrical tower in two stages , the lower stage measuring fourteen and the upper , which is domed , ten feet . The basement is composed of four great stones , the entire tower above it is one huge monolith . An unusual and very effective ornamentation crowns both stages of the tower , consisting of a series of gradines at top with square machicolations below . The other monument of the pair , distant about twenty feet from the one already described , is architecturally far less happy . It is composed of four members , viz. a low plinth for base , above this a rectangular pedestal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a monolithic cylinder , without ornaments , which contracts slightly as it ascends ; and , lastly , a pentagonal pyramid at the top . The pedestal is exceedingly rough and unfinished ; generally , the workmanship is rude , and the different members do not assort well one with another . Still it would seem that the two monuments belong to the same age and are parts of the same plan. 676 Their lines are parallel , as are those of the subterranean apartments which they cover , and they stand within a single enclosure . Whether the same architect designed them both it is impossible to determine , but if so he must have been one of the class of artists who have sometimes happy and sometimes unhappy inspirations . Both the Meghazil are superimposed upon subterranean chambers , containing niches for bodies , and reached by a flight of steps cut in the rock , the entrance to which is at some little distance from the monuments. 677 But there is nothing at all striking or peculiar in the chambers , which are without ornament of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meghazil , is remarkable chiefly for the care taken to shelter and protect the entrance to the set of chambers which it covers. 678 The monument is a simple one . A square monolith , crowned by a strong cornice , stands upon a base consisting of two steps . Above the cornice is another monolith , the lower part squared and the upper shaped into a pyramid . The upper part of the pyramid has crumbled away , but enough remains to show the angle of the slope , and to indicate for the original erection a height of about twenty feet . At the distance of about ten yards from the base of the monument is a second erection , consisting of two tiers of large stones , which roof in the entrance to a flight of eighteen steps . These steps lead downwards to a sloping passage , in which are sepulchral niches , and thence into two chambers , the inner one of which is almost directly under the main monument . Probably , a block of stone , movable but removed with difficulty , originally closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This stone ordinarily prevented ingress , but when a fresh corpse was to be admitted , or funeral ceremonies were to be performed in one of the chambers , it could be " rolled " 679 or dragged away . Phoenician architects were , as a general rule , exceedingly sparing in the use of ornament . Neither the pillar , nor the arch , much less the vault , was a feature in their principal buildings , which affected straight lines , right-angles , and a massive construction , based upon the Egyptian . The pillar came ultimately to be adopted , to a certain extent , from the Greeks ; but only the simplest forms , the Doric and Ionic , were in use , if we except certain barbarous types which the people invented for themselves . The true arch was scarcely known in Phoenicia , at any rate till Roman times , though false arches were not infrequent in the gateways of towns and the doors of houses. 680 The external ornamentation of buildings was chiefly by cornices of various kinds , by basement mouldings , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and by the use of bevelled stones in the walls . The employment of animal forms in external decoration was exceedingly rare ; and the half lions of the circular Meghazil of Amrith are almost unique . In internal ornamentation there was greater variety . Pavements were sometimes of mosaic , and glowed with various colours ; 682 sometimes they were of alabaster slabs elaborately patterned . Alabaster slabs also , it is probable , adorned the walls of temples and houses , excepting where woodwork was employed , as in the Temple of Solomon . There is much richness and beauty in many of the slabs now in the Phoenician collection of the Louvre , 683 especially in those which exhibit the forms of sphinxes or griffins . Many of the patterns most affected are markedly Assyrian in character , as the rosette , the palm-head , the intertwined ribbons , and the rows of gradines which occur so frequently . Even the Sphinxes are rather Assyrian than Egyptian in character ; and exhibit the recurved wings , which are never found in the valley of the Nile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the original type , sufficient to show that the Phoenician artist did not care merely to reproduce . On the whole the architecture must be pronounced wanting in originality and in a refined taste . What M. Renan says of Phoenician art in general684 is especially true of Phoenician architecture . " Phoenician art , which issued , as it would seem , originally from mere troglodytism , was , from the time when it arrived at the need of ornament , essentially an art of imitation . That art was , above all , industrial ; that art never raised itself for its great public monuments to a style that was at once elegant and durable . The origin of Phoenician architecture was the excavated rock , not the column , as was the case with the Greeks . The wall replaced the excavated rock after a time , but without wholly losing its character . There is nothing that leads us to believe that the Phoenicians knew how to construct a keyed vault . The monolithic principle which dominated the Phoenician and Syrian art , even after it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exact contrary of the Hellenic style . Greek architecture starts from the principle of employing small stones , and proclaims the principal loudly . At no time did the Greeks extract from Pentelicus blocks at all comparable for size with those of Baalbek or of Egypt ; they saw no use in doing so ; on the contrary , with masses of such enormity , which it is desired to use in their entirety , the architect is himself dominated ; the material , instead of being subordinate to the design of the edifice , runs counter to the design and contradicts it . The monuments on the Acropolis of Athens would be impossible with blocks of the size usual in Syria . " 685 Thus there is always something heavy , rude , and coarse in the Phoenician buildings , which betray their troglodyte origin by an over-massive and unfinished appearance . There is also a want of originality , more especially in the ornamentation . Egypt , Assyria , and Greece have furnished the " motives " which lie at the root of almost all the decorative art that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country or in the colonies . Winged disks , uraei , scarabs , sphinxes , have been adopted from Egypt ; Assyria has furnished gradines , lotus blossoms , rosettes , the palm-tree ornament , the ribbon ornament , and the form of the lion ; Greece has supplied pillars , pediments , festoons , and chimaeras . Native talent has contributed little or nothing to the ornamentation of buildings , if we except the modification of the types which have been derived from foreign sources . Finally , there is a want of combination and general plan in the Phoenician constructions where they fall into groups . " This is sensibly felt , " according to M. Renan , " at Amrith , at Kabr-Hiram , and at Um-el-Awamid . In the remains still visible in these localities there are many fine ideas , many beautiful details ; but they do not fall under any general dominant plan , as do the buildings on the Acropolis of Athens . One seems to see a set of people who are fond of working in stone for its own sake , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to produce in common a single work , since they do not know that it is the conception of a grand whole which constitutes greatness in art . Hence the incompleteness of the monuments ; there is not a tomb to which the relations of the deceased have deemed it fitting to give the finishing touches ; there is everywhere a certain egotism , like that which in later times prevented the Mussulman monuments from enduring . A passing pleasure in art does not induce men to finish , since finishing requires a certain stiffness of will . In general , the ancient Phoenicians appear to have had the spirit of sculptors rather than of architects . They did not construct in great masses , but every one laboured on his own account . Hence there was no exact measurement , and no symmetry . Even the capitals of the columns at Um-el-Awamid are not alike ; in the portions which most evidently correspond the details are different . " 686 CHAPTER VII  --  AESTHETIC ART Recent discoveries of Phoenician artistic remains  - -  Phoenician sculpture  --  Statues and busts  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on sarcophagi  - -  Phoenicians metal castings  --  Jachin and Boaz  --  Solomon 's " Molten Sea "  --  Solomon 's lavers  --  Statuettes in bronze  - -  Embossed work upon cups and paterae  --  Cup of Praeneste  - -  Intaglios on cylinders and gems  --  Phoenician painting  --  Tinted statues  --  Paintings on terra-cotta and clay . Phoenician aesthetic art embraced sculpture , metal-casting , intaglio , and painting to a small extent . Situated as the Phoenicians were , in the immediate neighbourhood of nations which had practised from a remote antiquity the imitation of natural forms , and brought into contact by their commercial transactions with others , with whom art of every kind was in the highest esteem  --  adroit moreover with their hands , clever , active , and above all else practical  --  it was scarcely possible that they should not , at an early period in their existence as a nation , interest themselves in what they found so widely appreciated , and become themselves ambitious of producing such works as they saw everywhere produced , admired , and valued . The mere commercial instinct would lead them to supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world 's markets ; while it is not to be supposed that they were , any more than other nations , devoid of those aesthetic propensities which find a vent in what are commonly called the " fine arts , " or less susceptible of that natural pleasure which successful imitation evokes from all who find themselves capable of it . Thus , we might have always safely concluded , even without any material evidence of it , that the Phoenicians had an art of their own , either original or borrowed ; but we are now able to do more than this . Recent researches in Phoenicia Proper , in Cyprus , in Sardina , and elsewhere , have recovered such a mass of Phoenician artistic remains , that it is possible to form a tolerably complete idea of the character of their aesthetic art , of its methods , its aims , and its value . Phoenician sculpture , even at its best , is somewhat rude . The country possesses no marble , and has not even any stone of a fine grain . The cretaceous limestone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most part so pierced with small holes and so thickly sown with fossil shells as to be quite unsuited for the chisel ; and even the better blocks , which the native sculptors were careful to choose , are not free from these defects , and in no case offer a grain that is satisfactory . To meet these difficulties , the Phoenician sculptor occasionally imported his blocks either from Egypt or from the volcanic regions of Taurus and Amanus ; 71 but it was not until he had transported himself to Cyprus , and found there an abundance of a soft , but fairly smooth , compact , and homogeneous limestone , that he worked freely , and produced either statues or bas-reliefs in any considerable number. 72 The Cyprian limestone is very easy to work . " It is a whitish stone when it comes out of the quarry , but by continued exposure to the air the tone becomes a greyish yellow , which , though a little dull , is not disagreeable to the eye . The nail can make an impression on it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more rapidly than marble . But it is in the plastic arts as in literature and poetry  --  what costs but little trouble has small chance of enduring . The Cyprian limestone is too soft to furnish the effects and the contrasts which marble offers , so to speak , spontaneously ; it is incapable of receiving the charming polish which makes so strong an opposition to the dark shadows of the parts where the chisel has scooped deep . The chisel , whatever efforts it may make and however laboriously it may be applied , can not impress on such material the strong and bold touches which indicate the osseous structure , and make the muscles and the veins show themselves under the epidermis in Greek statuary . The sculptor 's work is apt to be at once finikin and lax ; it wants breadth , and it wants decision . Moreover , the material , having little power of resistance , retains but ill what the chisel once impressed ; the more delicate markings and the more lifelike touches that it once received , it loses easily through friction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sculptured figures found by M. Di Cesnola at Athienau were discovered under conditions that were quite peculiar , having passed from the shelter of a covered chamber to that of a protecting bed of dust , which had hardened and adhered to their surfaces ; and these figures had preserved an unusual freshness , and seem as if just chiselled ; but , saving these exceptions , the Cypriot figures have their angles rounded , and their projections softened down . It is like a page of writing , where the ink , before it had time to dry , preserving its sharpness of tone , has been absorbed by the blotting paper and has left only pale and feeble traces . " 73 Another striking defect in the Phoenician , or at any rate in the Cyprio-Phoenician , sculpture , and one that can not be excused on account of any inherent weakness in the material , is the thinness and flatness of the greater part of the figures . The sculptor seems to have been furnished by the stonecutter , not so much with solid blocks of stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully in front , and produced statues , which , viewed in front , are lifelike and fairly satisfactory . But to the sides and back of the slab he paid little attention , not intending that his work should be looked at from all quarters , but that the spectator should directly face it . The statues were made to stand against walls , 75 or in niches , or back to back , the heels and backs touching ; 76 they were not , properly speaking , works in the round , but rather alti relievi a little exaggerated , not actually part of the wall , but laid closely against it . A striking example of this kind of work may be seen in a figure now at New York , which appears to represent a priest , whereof a front view is given by Di Cesnola in his " Cyprus , " and a side view by Perrot and Chipiez in their " History of Ancient Art . " The head and neck are in good proportion , but the rest of the figure is altogether unduly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is almost literally a slab , scarcely fashioned at all . This fault is less pronounced in some statues than in others , and from a certain number of the statuettes is wholly absent . This is notably the case in a figure found at Golgi , which represents a female arrayed in a long robe , the ample folds of which she holds back with one hand , while the other hand is advanced , and seems to have held a lotus flower . Three graceful tresses fall on either side of the neck , round which is a string of beads or pearls , with an amulet as pendant ; while a long veil , surmounted by a diadem , hangs from the back of the head . This statue is in no respect narrow or flat , as may be seen especially from the side view given by Di Cesnola ; 77 but it is short and inelegant , though not wanting in dignity ; and it is disfigured by sandalled feet of a very disproportionate size , which stand out offensively in front . The figure has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ashtoreth ; 78 but the identification can scarcely be regarded as more than a reasonable conjecture . The general defects of Phoenician statuary , besides want of finish and flatness , are a stiff and conventional treatment , recalling the art of Egypt and Assyria , a want of variety , and a want of life . Most of the figures stand evenly on the two feet , and have the arms pendant at the two sides , with the head set evenly , neither looking to the right nor to the left , while even the arrangement of the drapery is one of great uniformity . In the points where there is any variety , the variety is confined within very narrow limits . One foot may be a little advanced ; 79 one arm may be placed across the breast , either as confined by the robe , 710 or as holding something , e.g. a bird or a flower. 711 In female figures both arms may be laid along the thighs , 712 or both be bent across the bosom , with the hands clasping the breasts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other depend in front. 714 The hair and beard are mostly arranged with the utmost regularity in crisp curls , resembling the Assyrian ; where tresses are worn , they are made to hang , whatever their number , with exact uniformity on either side. 715 Armlets and bracelets appear always in pairs , and are exactly similar ; the two sides of a costume correspond perfectly ; and in the groups the figures have , as nearly as possible , the same attitude . Repose is no doubt the condition of human existence which statuary most easily and most naturally expresses ; and few things are more obnoxious to a refined taste than that sculpture which , like that of Roubiliac , affects movement , fidget , flutter , and unquiet . But in the Phoenician sculpture the repose is overdone ; except in the expression of faces , there is scarcely any life at all . The figures do nothing ; they simply stand to be looked at . And they stand stiffly , sometimes even awkwardly , rarely with anything like elegance or grace . The heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the artists have become acquainted with Greek models ; 716 but they are frequently too large for the bodies whereto they are attached , and the face is apt to wear a smirk that is exceedingly disagreeable . This is most noticeable in the Cypriot series , as will appear by the accompanying representations ; but it is not confined to them , since it reappears in the bronzes found in Phoenicia Proper . Phoenician statues are almost always more or less draped . Sometimes nothing is worn besides the short tunic , or shenti , of the Egyptians , which begins below the navel and terminates at the knee. 717 Sometimes there is added to this a close-fitting shirt , like a modern " jersey , " which has short sleeves and clings to the figure , so that it requires careful observation to distinguish between a statue thus draped and one which has the shenti only. 718 But there are also a number of examples where the entire figure is clothed from the head to the ankles , and nothing is left bare but the face , the hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Phrygian bonnet , covers the head ; a long-sleeved robe reaches from the neck to the ankles , or sometimes rests upon the feet ; and above this is a mantle or scarf thrown over the left shoulder , and hanging down nearly to the knees . Ultimately a drapery greatly resembling that of the Greeks seems to have been introduced ; a long cloak , or chlamys , is worn , which falls into numerous folds , and is disposed about the person according to the taste and fancy of the wearer , but so as to leave the right arm free. 719 Statues of this class are scarcely distinguishable from Greek statues of a moderately good type . Phoenician sculptors in the round did not very often indulge in the representation of animal forms . The lion , however , was sometimes chiselled in stone , either partially , as in a block of stone found by M. Renan at Um-el-Awamid , or completely , as in a statuette brought by General Di Cesnola from Cyprus . The representations hitherto discovered have not very much merit . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the animal itself , had never seen the king of beasts sleeping in the shade or stretching himself and yawning as he awoke , or walking along with a haughty and majestic slowness , or springing with one bound upon his prey , but had simply studied without much attention or interest the types furnished them by Egyptian or Assyrian artists , who were familiar with the beast himself . The representations are consequently in every case feeble and conventional ; in some they verge on the ridiculous . What , for instance , can be weaker than the figure above given from the great work of Perrot and Chipiez , with its good-humoured face , its tongue hanging out of its mouth , its tottering forelegs , and its general air of imbecility ? The lioness ' head represented in the same work is better , but still leaves much to be desired , falling , as it does , very far behind the best Assyrian models . Nor were the sculptors much more successful in their mode of expressing animals with whose forms they were perfectly well acquainted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought from Cyprus and now in the museum of New York , is a very ill-shaped sheep , and the doves so often represented are very poor doves. 720 They are just recognisable , and that is the most that can be said for them . A dog in stone , 721 found at Athienau , is somewhat better , equally the dogs of the Egyptians and Assyrians . On the other hand , the only fully modelled horses that have been found are utterly childish and absurd. 722 The reliefs of the Phoenicians are very superior to their statues . They vary in their character from almost the lowest kind of relief to the highest . On dresses , on shields , on slabs , and on some sarcophagi it is much higher than is usual even in Greece . A bas-relief of peculiar interest was discovered at Athienau by General Di Cesnola , and has been represented both by him and by the Italian traveller Ceccaldi. 723 It represents Hercules capturing the cattle of Geryon from the herdsman Eurytion , and gives us reason to believe that that myth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not a Hellenic one imported into Phoenicia . The general character of the sculpture is archaic and Assyrian ; nor is there a trace of Greek influence about it . Hercules , standing on an elevated block of stone at the extreme left , threatens the herdsman , who responds by turning towards him , and making a menacing gesture with his right hand , while in his left , instead of a club , he carries an entire tree . His hair and beard are curled in the Assyrian fashion , while his figure , though short , is strong and muscular . In front of him are his cattle , mixed up in a confused and tangled mass , some young , but most of them full grown , and amounting to the number of seventeen . They are in various attitudes , and are drawn with much spirit , recalling groups of cattle in the sculptures of Assyria and Egypt , but surpassing any such group in the vigour of their life and movement . Above , in an upper field or plain , divided from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog , Orthros , running full speed towards Hercules , and scarcely checked by the arrow which has met him in mid career , and entered his neck at the point of junction between the second and the third head. 724 The bas-relief is three feet two inches in length , and just a little short of two feet in height . It served to ornament a huge block of stone which formed the pedestal of a colossal statue of Hercules , eight feet nine inches high. 725 A sarcophagus , on which the relief is low , has been described and figured by Di Cesnola , 726 who discovered it in the same locality as the sculpture which has just engaged our attention . The sarcophagus , which had a lid guarded by lions at the four corners , was ornamented at both ends and along both sides by reliefs . The four scenes depicted appear to be distinct and separate . At one end Perseus , having cut off Medusa 's head and placed it in his wallet , which he carries behind him by means of a stick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog . Medusa 's body , though sunk upon one knee , is still upright , and from the bleeding neck there spring the forms of Chrysaor and Pegasus . At the opposite end of the tomb is a biga drawn by two horses , and containing two persons , the charioteer and the owner , who is represented as bearded , and rests his hand upon the chariot-rim . The horse on the right hand , which can alone be distinctly seen , is well proportioned and spirited . He is impatient and is held in by the driver , and prevented from proceeding at more than a foot 's pace . On the longer sides are a hunting scene , and a banqueting scene . In a wooded country , indicated by three tall trees , a party , consisting of five individuals , engages in the pleasures of the chase . Four of the five are accoutred like Greek soldiers ; they wear crested helmets , cuirasses , belts , and a short tunic ending in a fringe : the arms which they carry are a spear and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an archer , and has a lighter equipment ; he wears a cloth about his loins , a short tunic , and a round cap on his head . The design forms itself into two groups . On the right two of the spearmen are engaged with a wild boar , which they are wounding with their lances ; on the left the two other spearmen and the archer are attacking a wild bull . In the middle a cock separates the two groups , while at the two extremities two animal forms , a horse grazing and a dog trying to make out a scent , balance each other . The fourth side of the sarcophagus presents us with a banqueting scene . On four couches , much like the Assyrian , 727 are arranged the banqueters . At the extreme right the couch is occupied by a single person , who has a long beard and extends a wine-cup towards an attendant , a naked youth , who is advancing towards him with a wine-jug in one hand , and a ladle or strainer in the other . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each comprising a male and a female . The male figure reclines in the usual attitude , half sitting and half lying , with the left arm supported on two pillows ; 728 the female sits on the edge of the couch , with her feet upon a footstool . The males hold wine-cups ; of the females , one plays upon the lyre , while the two others fondle with one hand their lover or husband . A fourth female figure , erect in the middle between the second and third couches , plays the double flute for the delectation of the entire party . All the figures , except the boy attendant , are decently draped , in robes with many folds , resembling the Greek . At the side of each couch is a table , on which are spread refreshments , while at the extreme left is a large bowl or amphora , from which the wine-cups may be replenished . This is placed under the shade of a tree , which tells us that the festivity takes place in a garden. 729 No one can fail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dominant influence of Greece . While the form of the tomb , and the lions that ornament the covering , are unmistakably Cyprio-Phoenician , the reliefs contain scarcely a feature which is even Oriental ; all has markedly the colouring and the physiognomy of Hellenism . Yet Cyprian artists probably executed the work . There are little departures from Greek models , which indicate the " barbarian " workman , as the introduction of trees in the backgrounds , the shape of the furniture , the recurved wings of the Gorgon , and the idea of hunting the wild bull . But the figures , the proportions , the draperies , the attitudes , the chariot , the horse , are almost pure Greek . There is a grace and ease in the modelling , an elegance , a variety , to which Asiatic art , left to itself , never attained . The style , however , is not that of Greece at its best , but of archaic Greece . There is something too much of exact symmetry , both in the disposition of the groups and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very folds of the garments are over-stiff and regular . All is drawn in exact profile ; and in the composition there is too much of balance and correspondence . Still , a new life shows itself through the scenes . There is variety in the movements ; there is grace and suppleness in the forms ; there is lightness in the outline , vigour in the attitudes , and beauty spread over the whole work . It can not be assigned an earlier date than the fifth century B.C. , and is most probably later , 730 since it took time for improved style to travel from the head-centres of Greek art to the remoter provinces , and still more time for it to percolate through the different layers of Greek society until it reached the stratum of native Cyprian artistic culture . We may contrast with the refined work of the Athienau sarcophagus the far ruder , but more genuinely native , designs of a tomb of the same kind found on the site of Amathus. 731 On this sarcophagus , the edges of which are most richly adorned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , four reliefs , two of them occupying the sides and two the ends . Those at the ends are curious , but have little artistic merit . They consist , in each case , of a caryatid figure four times repeated , representations , respectively , of Astarte and of a pygmy god , who , according to some , is Bes , and , according to others , Melkarth or Esmun. 732 The figures of Astarte are rude , as are generally her statues. 733 They have the hair arranged in three rows of crisp curls , the arms bent , and the hands supporting the breasts . The only ornament worn by them is a double necklace of pearls or round beads . The representations of the pygmy god have more interest . They remind us of what Herodotus affirms concerning the Phoenician pataikoi , which were used for the figure-heads of ships , 734 and which he compares to the Egyptian images of Phthah , or Ptah , the god of creation . They are ugly dwarf figures , with a large misshapen head , a bushy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striped tunic , and thick clumsy legs . Only one of the four figures is at present complete , the sarcophagus having been entered by breaking a hole into it at this end . The work at the sides is much superior to that at the ends . The two panels represent , apparently , a single scene . The scene is a procession , but whether funeral or military it is hard to decide. 735 First come two riders on horseback , wearing conical caps and close-fitting jerkins ; they are seated on a species of saddle , which is kept in place by a board girth passing round the horse 's belly , and by straps attached in front . The two cavaliers are followed by four bigae . The first contains the principal personages of the composition , who sits back in his car , and shades himself with a parasol , the mark of high rank in the East , while his charioteer sits in front of him and holds the reins . The second car has three occupants ; the third two ; and the fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the footmen , who close the procession . These form a group of three , and seem to be soldiers , since they bear shield and spear ; but their costume , a loose robe wrapped round the form , is rather that of civilians . The horses are lightly caparisoned , with little more than a head-stall and a collar ; but they carry on their heads a conspicuous fan-like crest. 736 MM . Perrot and Chipiez thus sum up their description of this monument :  --  " Both in the ornamentation and in the sculpture properly so-called there is a mixture of two traditions and two inspirations , diverse one from the other . The persons who chiselled the figures in the procession which fills the two principal sides of the sarcophagus were the pupils of Grecian statuaries ; they understood how to introduce variety into the attitudes of those whom they represented , and even into the movements of the horses . Note , in this connection , the steeds of the two cavaliers in front ; one of them holds up his head , the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleverly treated , especially those of the foot soldiers who bring up the rear , and resemble in many respects the costume of the Greeks . On the other hand , the types of divinity , repeated four times at the two ends of the monument , have nothing that is Hellenic about them , but are borrowed from the Pantheon of Phoenicia . Even in the procession itself  --  the train of horsemen , footmen , and chariots , which is certainly the sculptor 's true subject  --  there are features which recall the local customs and usages of the East . The conical caps of the two cavaliers closely resemble those which we see on the heads of many of the Cyprian statues ; the parasol which shades the head of the great person in the first biga is the symbol of Asiatic royalty ; lastly , the fan-shaped plume which rises above the heads of all the chariot horses is an ornament that one sees in the same position in Assyria and in Lycia , whensoever the sculptor desires to represent horses magnificently caparisoned. " 737 Sarcophagi recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adorned with reliefs superior to any previously known specimens of Phoenician art . As , however , no drawings or photographs of these sculptures have as yet reached Western Europe , it will perhaps be sufficient in this place to direct attention to the descriptions of them which an eye-witness has published in the " Journal de Beyrout. " 738 No trustworthy critical estimate can be formed from mere descriptions , and it will therefore be necessary to reserve our judgment until the sculptures themselves , or correct representations of them , are accessible . The metal castings of the Phoenicians , according to the accounts which historians give of them , were of a very magnificent and extraordinary character . The Hiram employed by Solomon in the ornamentation of the Temple at Jerusalem , who was a native of Tyre , 739 designed and executed by his master 's orders a number of works in metal , which seem to have been veritable masterpieces . The strangest of all were the two pillars of bronze , which bore the names of " Jachin " and " Boaz , " 740 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly under it. 741 These pillars , with their capitals , were between thirty-four and thirty-five feet high , and had a diameter of six feet. 742 They were cast hollow , the bronze whereof they were composed having a uniform thickness of three inches , 743 or thereabouts . Their ornamentation was elaborate . A sort of chain-work covered the " belly " or lower part of the capitals , 744 while above and below were representations of pomegranates in two rows , probably at the top and bottom of the " belly , " the number of the pomegranates upon each pillar being two hundred. 745 At the summit of the whole was a sort of " lily-work " 746 or imitation of the lotus blossom , a " motive " adopted from Egypt . Various representations of the pillars have been attempted in works upon Phoenician art , the most remarkable being those designed by M. Chipiez , and published in the " Histoire de l'Art dans l'Antiquite. " 747 Perhaps , however , there is more to be said in favour of M. de Voguee 's view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The third great work of metallurgy which Hiram constructed for Solomon was " the molten sea . " 748 This was an enormous bronze basin , fifteen feet in diameter , supported on the backs of twelve oxen , grouped in sets of three. 749 The basin stood fourteen or fifteen feet above the level of the Temple Court , 750 and was a vast reservoir , always kept full of water , for the ablutions of the priests . There was an ornamentation of " knops " or " gourds , " in two rows , about the " brim " of the reservoir ; and it must have been supplied in its lower part with a set of stopcocks , by means of which the water could be drawn off when needed . Representations of the " molten sea " have been given by Mangeant , De Voguee , Thenius , and others ; but all of them are , necessarily , conjectural . The design of Mangeant is reproduced in the preceding representation . It is concluded that the oxen must have been of colossal size in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not present the appearance of being crushed under an enormous weight. 751 Next in importance to these three great works were ten minor ones , made for the Jewish Temple by the same artist . These were lavers mounted on wheels , 752 which could be drawn or pushed to any part of the Temple Court where water might be required . The lavers were of comparatively small size , capable of containing only one-fiftieth part753 of the contents of the " molten sea , " but they were remarkable for their ornamentation . Each was supported upon a " base ; " and the bases , which seem to have been panelled , contained , in the different compartments , figures of lions , oxen , and cherubim , 754 either single or in groups . On the top of the base , which seems to have been square , was a circular stand or socket , a foot and a half in height , into which the laver or basin fitted. 755 This , too , was panelled , and ornamented with embossed work , representing lions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four wheels , which are said to have resembled chariot wheels , but which were molten in one piece , naves , spokes , and felloes together. 757 A restoration by M. Mangeant , given by Perrot and Chipiez in the fourth volume of their " History of Ancient Art , " is striking , and leaves little to be desired . Hiram is also said to have made for Solomon a number of pots , shovels , basins , flesh-hooks , and other instruments , 758 which were all used in the Temple service ; but as no description is given of any of these works , even their general character can only be conjectured . We may , however , reasonably suppose them not to have differed greatly from the objects of a similar description found in Cyprus by General Di Cesnola. 759 From the conjectural , which may amuse , but can scarcely satisfy , the earnest student , it is fitting that we should now pass to the known and actual . Phoenician metal-work of various descriptions has been found recently in Phoenicia Proper , in Cyprus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it consists of works of utility or of mere personal adornment , which belong to another branch of the present enquiry , there is a considerable portion which is more or less artistic and which rightly finds its place in the present chapter . The Phoenicians , though they did not , so far as we know , attempt with any frequency the production , in bronze or other metal , of the full-sized human form , 760 were fond of fabricating , especially in bronze , the smaller kinds of figures which are known as " figurines " or " statuettes . " They also had a special talent for producing embossed metal-work of a highly artistic character in the shape of cups , bowls , and dishes or paterae , whereon scenes of various kinds were represented with a vigour and precision that are quite admirable . Some account of these two classes of works must here be given . The statuettes commence with work of the rudest kind . The Phoenician sites in Sardinia have yielded in abundance grotesque figures of gods and men , 761 from three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be viewed as Phoenician productions , though perhaps they were not the best works which Phoenician artists could produce , but such as were best suited to the demands of the Sardinian market . The savage Sards would not have appreciated beauty or grace ; but to the savage mind there is something congenial in grotesqueness . Hence gods with four arms and four eyes , 762 warriors with huge horns projecting from their helmets , 763 tall forms of extraordinary leanness , 764 figures with abnormally large heads and hands , 765 huge noses , projecting eyes , and various other deformities . For the home consumption statuettes of a similar character were made ; but they were neither so rude nor so devoid of artistic merit . There is one in the Louvre , which was found at Tortosa , in Northern Phoenicia , approaching nearly to the Sardinian type , while others have less exaggeration , and seem intended seriously . In Cyprus bronzes of a higher order have been discovered. 766 One is a figure of a youth , perhaps AEsculapius , embracing a serpent ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have been the handle of a vase or jug ; it springs from a grotesque bracket , and terminates in a bar ornamented at either end with heads of animals . The complete bronze figure found near Curium , which is supposed to represent Apollo and is figured by Di Cesnola , 767 is probably not the production of a Phoenician artists , but a sculpture imported from Greece . The embossed work upon cups and paterae is sometimes of great simplicity , sometimes exceedingly elaborate . A patera of the simplest kind was found by General Di Cesnola in the treasury of Curium and is figured in his work. 768 At the bottom of the dish , in the middle , is a rosette with twenty-two petals springing from a central disk ; this is surrounded by a ring whereon are two wavy lines of ribbon intertwined . Four deer , with strongly recurved horns , spaced at equal intervals , stand on the outer edge of the ring in a walking attitude . Behind them and between them are a continuous row of tall stiff reeds terminating in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The reeds are thirty-two in number . We may compare with this the medallion at the bottom of a cup found at Caere in Italy , which has been published by Grifi. 769 Here , on a chequered ground , stands a cow with two calves , one engaged in providing itself with its natural sustenance , the other disporting itself in front of its dam . In the background are a row of alternate papyrus blossoms and papyrus buds bending gracefully to the right and to the left , so as to form a sort of framework to the main design . Above the cow and in front of the papyrus plants two birds wing their flight from left to right across the scene . A bronze bowl , discovered at Idalium ( Dali ) in Cyprus , 770 is , like these specimens , Egyptian in its motive , but is more ambitious in that it introduces the human form . On a throne of state sits a goddess , draped in a long striped robe which reaches to the feet , and holding a lotus flower in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left . Bracelets adorn her wrists and anklets her feet . Behind her stands a band of three instrumental performers , all of them women , and somewhat variously costumed : the first plays the double pipe , the second performs on a lyre or harp , the third beats the tambourine . In front of the goddess is a table or altar , to which a votary approaches bringing offerings . Then follows another table whereon two vases are set ; finally comes a procession of six females , holding hands , who are perhaps performing a solemn dance . Behind them are a row of lotus pillars , the supports probably of a temple , wherein the scene takes place . The human forms in this design are ill-proportioned , and very rudely traced . The heads and hands are too large , the faces are grotesque , and the figures wholly devoid of grace . Mimetic art is seen clearly in its first stage , and the Phoenician artist who has designed the bowl has probably fallen short of his Egyptian models . Animal and human forms intermixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more complicated and elaborate than the objects hitherto described , but which is , like them , strikingly Egyptian. 771 A small rosette occupies the centre ; round it is , apparently , a pond or lake , in which fish are disporting themselves ; but the fish are intermixed with animal and human forms  --  a naked female stretches out her arms after a cow ; a man clothed in a shenti endeavours to seize a horse . The pond is edged by papyrus plants , which are alternately in blossom and in bud . A zigzag barrier separates this central ornamentation from that of the outer part of the dish . Here a marsh is represented in which are growing papyrus and other water-plants . Aquatic birds swim on the surface or fly through the tall reeds . Four boats form the chief objects in this part of the field . In one , which is fashioned like a bird , there sits under a canopy a grandee , with an attendant in front and a rower or steersman at the stern . Behind him , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ females , one of whom plays a harp and another a tambourine , while the third keeps time with her hands . A man with a punt-pole directs the vessel from the stern . In the third boat , which has a freight of wine-jars , a cook is preparing a bird for the grandee 's supper . The fourth boat contains three rowers , who possibly have the vessel of the grandee in tow . The first and second boats are separated by two prancing steeds , the second and third by two cows , the third and fourth by a chariot and pair . It is difficult to explain the mixture of the aquatic with the terrestrial in this piece ; but perhaps the grandee is intended to be enjoying himself in a marshy part of his domain , where he might ride , drive , or boat , according to his pleasure . The whole scene is rather Egyptian than Phoenician or Cypriot , and one can not help suspecting that the patera was made for an Egyptian customer . There is a patera at Athens , 772 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduce the more elaborate and complicated of the Phoenician works of art in this class . It has been figured , 773 and carefully described by MM . Perrot and Chipiez in these terms :  --  " The medallion in the centre is occupied by a rosette with eight points . The zone outside this , in which are distributed the personages represented , is divided into four compartments by four figures , which correspond to each other in pairs . They lift themselves out of a trellis-work , bounded on either side by a light pillar without a base . The capitals which crown the pillars recall those of the Ionic order , but the abacus is much more developed . A winged globe , stretching from pillar to pillar , roofs in this sort of little chapel ; each is the shrine of a divinity . One of the divinities is that nude goddess , clasping her breasts with her hands , whom we have already met with in the Phoenician world more than once ; the other is a bearded personage , whose face is framed in by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a close-fitting garment , made of a material folded in narrow plaits . We do not know what name to give the personage . Each of the figures is repeated twice . The rest of the field is occupied by four distinct subjects , two of them being scenes of adoration . In one may be recognised the figure of Isis-Athor , seated on a sort of camp-stool , and giving suck to the young Horus ; 774 on an altar in front of the goddess is placed the disk of the moon , enveloped ( as we have seen it elsewhere ) by a crescent which recalls the moon 's phases . Behind the altar stands a personage whose sex is not defined ; the right hand , which is raised , holds a patera , while the left , which falls along the hip , has the ankh or crux ansata . Another of the scenes corresponds to this , and offers many striking analogies . The altar indeed is of a different form , but it supports exactly the same symbols . The goddess sits upon a throne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child ; in one hand she holds out a cup , in the other a lotus blossom . The personage who confronts her wears a conical cap , and is clothed , like the worshipper of the corresponding representation , in a long robe pressed close to the body by a girdle a cordeliere ; he has also the crux ansata , and holds in the right hand an object the character and use of which I am unable to conjecture . We may associate with these two scenes of homage and worship another representation in which there figure three musicians . The instruments are the same as usual  --  the lyre , the tambourine , and the double pipe ; two of the performers march at a steady pace ; the third , the one who beats the metal ( ? ) disk , dances , as he plays , with much vigour and spirit . In the last compartment we come again upon a group that we have already met with in one of the cups from Idalium. 775 . . . A beardless individual , clothed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a griffin , which , in struggling against the pressure , flings its hind quarters into the air in a sort of wild caper ; the conqueror , however , holds it fast by the plume of feathers which rises from its head , and plunges his sword into its half-open beak . It is this group , drawn in relief , and on a larger scale , that we meet with for a second time on the Athenian patera ; but in this case the group is augmented by a second personage , who takes part in the struggle . This is an old man with a beard who is armed with a formidable pike . Both the combatants wear conical caps upon their heads , similar to those which we have noticed as worn by a number of the statues from Cyprus ; but the cap of the right-hand personage terminates in a button , whereto is attached a long appendage , which looks like the tail of an ox . " The Egyptian character of much of this design is incontestable . The ankh , the lotus blossom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Egyptian forms ; the Isis Athor with Horus in her lap speaks for itself ; and the worshipper in front of Isis has an unmistakably Egyptian head dress . But the contest with the winged griffin is more Assyrian than Egyptian ; the seat whereon Isis sits recalls a well-known Assyrian type ; 776 one of the altars has a distinctly Assyrian character , while the band of musicians , the Astarte figures standing in their shrines , and the pillars which support , and frame in , the shrines are genuine Phoenician contributions . Artistically this patera is much upon a par with those from Dali and Athienau , which have been already described . Our space will not admit of our pursuing this subject much further . We can not give descriptions of all the twenty paterae , 777 pronounced by the best critics to be Phoenician , which are contained in the museums of Europe and America . Excellent representations of most of these works of art will be found in Longperier 's " Musee Napoleon III. , " in M. Clermont-Ganneau 's " Imagerie Phenicienne , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of MM . Perrot et Chipiez . The bowls brought from Larnaca , from Curium , and from Amathus are especially interesting. 778 We must , however , conclude our survey with a single specimen of the most elaborate kind of patera ; and , this being the case , we can not hesitate to give the preference to the famous " Cup of Praeneste , " which has been carefully figured and described in two of the three works above cited. 779 The cup in question consists of a thin plate of silver covered over with a layer of gold ; its greatest diameter is seven inches and three-fifths . The under or outside is without ornament ; the interior is engraved with a number of small objects in low relief . In the centre , and surrounded by a circle of beads , there is a subject to which we shall presently have to return . The zone immediately outside this medallion , which is not quite an inch in width , is filled with a string of eight horses , all of them proceeding at a trot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse two birds fly in the same direction . The horses ' tails are extraordinarily conventional , consisting of a stem with branches , and resembling a conventional palm branch . Outside this zone there is an exterior and a wider one , which is bounded on its outer edge by a huge snake , whose scaly length describes an almost exact circle , excepting towards the tail , where there are some slight sinuosities . This serpent , whose head reaches and a little passes the thin extremity of the tail , is " drawn , " says M. Clermont-Ganneau , " with the hand of a master . " 780 It has been compared781 with the well-known Egyptian and Phoenician symbol for the kosmos or universe , which was a serpent with its tail in its mouth . " Naturally , " he continues , 782 " the outer zone by its very position offers the greatest room for development . The artist is here at his ease , and having before him a field relatively so vast , has represented on it a series of scenes , remarkably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their subject-matter , the number of the persons introduced , and the nature of the acts which they accomplish . . . . The scenes , however , are not , as some have imagined , a series of detached fantastic subjects , arbitrarily chosen and capriciously grouped , a mere confused melee of men , animals , chariots , and other objects ; on the contrary , they form a little history , a plastic idyll , a story with a beginning , a middle , and an end . It is a narrative divided into nine scenes . " ( 1 ) An armed hero , mounted in a car driven by a charioteer , quits in the morning a castle or fortified town . He is going to hunt , and carries his bow in his left hand . Over his head is an umbrella , the badge of his high rank , and his defence against the mid-day sun . A quiver hangs at the side of his chariot . He wears a conical cap , while the driver has his head bare , and leans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shake the reins , and encourage the horses to mend their pace . ( 2 ) After the car has proceeded a certain distance , the hunter espies a stag upon a rocky hill . He stops his chariot , gets down , and leaving the driver in charge of the vehicle , ensconces himself behind a tree , and thus screened lets fly an arrow against the quarry , which strikes it midway in the chest . ( 3 ) Weak and bleeding copiously , the stag attempts to escape ; but the hunter pursues and takes possession of him without having to shoot a second time . ( 4 ) The hour is come now for a rest . The sportsman has reached a wood , in which date-bearing palms are intermingled with trees of a different kind . He fastens his game to one of them , and proceeds to the skinning and the disembowelling . Meanwhile , his attendant detaches the horses from the car , relieves them of their harness , and proceeds to feed them from a portable manger . The car , left to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pole in the air . ( 5 ) Food and drink having been prepared and placed on two tables , or altars , the hunter , seated on a throne under the shadow of his umbrella , pours a libation to the gods . They , on their part , scent the feast and draw near , represented by the sun and moon  --  a winged disk , and a crescent embracing a full orb . The feast is also witnessed by a spirit of evil , in the shape of a huge baboon or cynocephalous ape , who from a cavern at the foot of a wooded mountain , whereon a stag and a hare are feeding , furtively surveys the ceremony . ( 6 ) Remounting his chariot the hunter sets out on his return home , when the baboon quits his concealment , and rushes after him , threatening him with a huge stone . Hereupon a winged deity descends from heaven , and lifting into the air chariot , horses , charioteer , and hunter , enfolds them in an embrace and saves them . ( 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chariot is replaced on the earth . The hunter prepares his bow , places an arrow on the string , and hastily pursues his enemy , who is speedily overtaken and thrown to the ground by the horses . ( 8 ) The hunter dismounts , puts his foot upon the prostrate ape , and gives him the coup de grace with a heavy axe or mace . A bird of prey hovers near , ready to descend upon the carcase. ( 9 ) The hero remounts his chariot , and returns to the castle or city which he left in the morning. 783 We have now to return to the medallion which forms the centre of the cup . Within a circle of pearls or beads , similar to that separating the two zones , is a round space about two inches in diameter , divided into two compartments by a horizontal line . In the upper part are contained three human figures , and the figure of a dog . At the extreme left is a prisoner with a beard and long hair that falls upon his shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two arms are brought together , tied by a cord , and then firmly attached to a post . His knees are bent , but do not reach the ground , and his feet are placed with their soles uppermost against the post at its base . The attitude is one which implies extreme suffering. 784 In front of the prisoner , occupying the centre of the medallion , is the main figure of the upper compartment , a warrior , armed with a spear , who pursues the third figure , a fugitive , and seems to be thrusting his spear into the man 's back . Both have long hair , but are beardless ; and wear the shenti for their sole garment . Between the legs of the main figure is a dog of the jackal kind , which has his teeth fixed in the heels of the fugitive , and arrests his flight . Below , in the second compartment , are two figures only , a man and a dog . The man is prostrate , and seems to be crawling along the ground , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biting his left heel . The interpretation which M. Clermont-Ganneau gives to this entire scene lacks the probability which attaches to his explanation of the outer scene . He suggests that the prisoner is the hunter of the other scene , plundered and bound by his charioteer , who is hastening away , when he is seized by his master 's dog and arrested in his flight . The dog gnaws off his right foot and then attacks the left , while the fugitive , in order to escape his tormentor , has to crawl along the ground . But M. Clermont-Ganneau himself distrusts his interpretation , 785 while he has convinced no other scholar of its soundness . Judicious critics will be content to wait the further researches which he promises , whereby additional light may perhaps be thrown on this obscure matter . In its artistic character the " cup of Praeneste " claims a high place among the works of art probably or certainly assignable to the Phoenicians . The relief is high ; the forms , especially the animal ones , are spirited and well-proportioned . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " their forms and their movements are indicated with a great deal of precision and truth . " 786 They show also a fair amount of variety ; they stand , they walk , they trot , they gallop at full speed , always truthfully and naturally . The stag , the hare , and the dog are likewise well portrayed ; the ape has less merit ; he is too human , too like a mere unkempt savage . The human forms are about upon a par with those of the Assyrians and Egyptians , which have evidently served for their models , the Assyrian for the outer zone , the Egyptian for the medallion . The encircling snake , as already observed , is a masterpiece . There is no better drawing in any of the other paterae . At best they equal , they certainly do not surpass , the Praenestine specimen . The intaglios of the Phoenicians are either on cylinders or on gems , and can rarely be distinguished , unless they are accompanied by an inscription , from the similar objects obtained in such abundance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any variation , the mythological figures and emblems native to those countries  --  the forms of gods and priests , of spirits of good and evil , of kings contending with lions , of sacred trees , winged circles , and the like  --  scarcely ever introducing any novelty . The greater number of the cylinders are very rudely cut . They have been worked simply by means of a splinter of obsidian , 787 and are barbarous in execution , though interesting to the student of archaic art . The subjoined are specimens . No. 1 represents a four-winged genius of the Assyrian type , bearded , and clad in a short tunic and a long robe , seizing with either hand a winged griffin , or spirit of evil , and reducing them to subjection . In the field , towards the two upper corners , are the same four Phoenician characters , twice repeated ; they designate , no doubt , the owner of the cylinder , which he probably used as a seal , and are read as Harkhu. 788 No. 2 , which is better cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Achaemenian ) type , 789 who stands between two rampant lions , and seizes each by the forelock . Behind the second lion is a sacred tree of a type that is not uncommon ; and behind the tree is an inscription , which has been read as l'Baletan  --  i.e. " ( the seal ) of Baletan. " 790 This cylinder was found recently in the Lebanon. 791 Nos. 3 and 4 come from Salamis in Cyprus , where they were found by M. Alexandre Di Cesnola , 792 the brother of the General . No. 3 represents a robed figure holding two nondescript animals by the hind legs ; the creatures writhe in his grasp , and turn their heads towards him , as though wishing to bite . The remainder of the field is filed with detached objects , scattered at random  --  two human forms , a griffin , two heads of oxen , a bird , two balls , three crosses , a sceptre , &c.; The forms are , all of them , very rudely traced . No. 4 resembles in general character No. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures hold each other 's hands and perhaps execute a dance around some religious object . Two heads of oxen or cows , with a disk between their horns , occupy the spaces intervening between the upper parts of the figures . In the lower portion of the field , the sun and moon fill the middle space , the sun , moon , and five planets the spaces to the right and to the left . Another cylinder from the same place ( No. 5 ) 793 is tolerably well designed and engraved . It shows us two persons , a man and a woman , in the act of presenting a dove to a female , who is probably the goddess Astarte , and who willingly receives it at their hands . Behind Astarte a seated lion echoes the approval of the goddess by raising one of his fore paws , while a griffin , who wholly disapproves of the offering , turns his back in disgust . On another cylinder , which is certainly Phoenician , a rude representation of a sacred tree occupies the central position . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upraised , clad in a very common Assyrian dress . Over the sacred tree is a coarse specimen of the winged circle or disk , with head and tail , and fluttering ends of ribbon. 794 On either side stand two winged genii , dressed in long robes , and tall stiff caps , such as are often seen on the heads of Persians in the Persepolitan sculptures , and on the darics. 795 In the field is a Phoenician inscription , which is read as ... or Irphael ben Hor'adad , " Irphael , the son of Horadad. " 796 Phoenician cylinders are in glass , green serpentine , cornaline , black haematite , steatite , and green jasper. 797 They are scratched rather than deeply cut , and can not be said ever to attain to any considerable artistic beauty . Those which have been here given are among the best ; and they certainly fall short , both in design and workmanship , of many Assyrian , Babylonian , and even Persian specimens . The gems , on the other hand , are in many cases quite equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which has been pronounced " an exquisite specimen of Phoenician lapidary art , " 798 figured by General Di Cesnola in his " Cyprus . " 799 Two men in regular Assyrian costume , standing on either side of a " Sacred Tree , " grasp , each of them , a branch of it . Above is a winged circle , with the wings curved so as to suit the shape of the gem . Below is an ornament , which is six times repeated , like the blossom of a flower ; and below this is a trelliswork . The whole is cut deeply and sharply . Its Phoenician authorship is assured by its being an almost exact repetition of a group upon the silver patera found at Amathus. 7100 Of other gems equally well engraved the following are specimens . No. 1 is a scarab of cornaline found by M. de Voguee in Phoenicia Proper. 7101 Two male figures in Assyrian costume face each other , their advanced feet crossing . Both hold in one hand the ankh or symbol of life . One has in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The other has the right hand raised in the usual attitude of adoration . Between the figures , wherever there was space for them , are Phoenician characters , which are read as ... , or l'Beka  --  i.e. " ( the seal ) of Beka. " 7102 No. 2 , which has been set in a ring , is one of the many scarabs brought by General Di Cesnola from Cyprus. 7103 It contains the figure of a hind , suckling her fawn , and is very delicately carved . The hind , however , is in an impossible attitude , the forelegs being thrown forwards , probably in order to prevent them from interfering with the figure of the fawn . Above the hind is an inscription , which appears to be in the Cyprian character , and which gives ( probably ) the name of the owner . No. 3 introduces us to domestic life . A grand lady , of Tyre perhaps or Sidon , 7104 by name Akhot-melek , seated upon an elegant throne , with her feet upon a footstool , and dressed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , receives at the hands of a female attendant a bowl or wine-cup , which the latter has just filled from an oenochoe of elegant shape , still held in her left hand . The attendant wears a striped robe reaching to the feet , and over it a tunic fastened round the waist with a belt . Her hair flows down on her shoulders , while that of her mistress is confined by a band , from which depends an ample veil , enveloping the cheeks , the back of the head , and the chin . We are told that such veils are still worn in the Phoenician country. 7105 An inscription , in a late form of the Phoenician character , surrounds the two figures , and is read as ... or l'Akhot-melek ishat Joshua ( ? )  --  i.e. " ( the seal ) of Akhot-melek , wife of Joshua . " 7106 No. 4 contains the figure of a lion , cut with much spirit . MM . Perrot et Chipiez say of it  --  " Among the numerous representations of lions that have been discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a par with that on the scarab bearing the name of ' Ashenel : small as it is , this lion has something of the physiognomy of those magnificent ones which we have borrowed from the bas-reliefs of the Assyrians . Still , the intaglio is in other respects decidedly Phoenician and not Assyrian . Observe , for instance , the beetle with the wings expanded , which fills up the lower part of the field ; this is a motive borrowed from Egypt , which a Ninevite lapidary would certainly not have put in such a place . " 7107 The Phoenician inscription takes away all doubt as to the nationality . It reads as ... , or ' Ashenel , and no doubt designates the owner . No. 5 is beautifully engraved on a chalcedony . It represents a stag attacked by a griffin , which has jumped suddenly on its back . The drawing is excellent , both of the real and of the imaginary animal , and leaves nothing to be desired . The inscription , which occupies the upper part of the field to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gem was the signet of a certain Akestodaros. 7108 There are some Phoenician gems which are interesting from their subject matter without being especially good as works of art . One of these contains a representation of two men fighting. 7109 Both are armed with two spears , and both carry round shields or bucklers . The warrior to the right wears a conical helmet , and is thought to be a native Cyprian ; 7110 he carries a shield without an umbo or boss . His adversary on the left wears a loose cap , or hood , the pilos apages of Herodotus , 7111 and has a prominent umbo in the middle of his shield . He probably represents a Persian , and appears to have received a wound from his antagonist , which is causing him to sink to the ground . This gem was found at Curium in Cyprus by General Di Cesnola . Another , found at the same place , exhibits a warrior , or a hunter , going forth to battle or to the chase in his chariot. 7112 A large quiver full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The warrior and his horse ( one only is seen ) are rudely drawn , but the chariot is very distinctly made out , and has a wheel of an Assyrian type . The Salaminians of Cyprus were famous for their war chariots , 7113 of which this may be a representation . The island of Sardinia has furnished a prodigious number of Phoenician seals . A single private collection contains as many as six hundred. 7114 They are mostly scarabs , and the type of them is mostly Egyptian . Sometimes they bear the forms of Egyptian gods , as Horus , or Thoth , or Anubis ; 7115 sometimes cartouches with the names of kings as Menkara , Thothmes III. , Amenophis III. , Seti I. , &c.; 7116 sometimes mere sacred emblems , as the winged uraeus , the disk between two uraei , 7117 and the like . Occasionally there is the representation of a scene with which the Egyptian bas-reliefs have made us familiar : 7118 a warrior has caught hold of his vanquished and kneeling enemy by a lock of his hair , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brandishes above his head . Or a lion takes the place of the captive man , and is menaced in the same way . Human figures struggling with lions , and lions killing wild bulls , are also common ; 7119 but the type in these cases is less Egyptian than Oriental . Phoenician painting was not , like Egyptian , displayed upon the walls of temples , nor was it , like Greek , the production of actual pictures for the decoration of houses . It was employed to a certain extent on statues , not so as to cover the entire figure , but with delicacy and discretion , for the marking out of certain details , and the emphasising of certain parts of the design. 7120 The hair and beard were often painted a brownish red ; the pupil of the eye was marked by means of colour ; and robes had often a border of red or blue . Statuettes were tinted more generally , whole vestments being sometimes coloured red or green , 7121 and a gay effect being produced , which is said to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper which was made by the Phoenicians was upon their vessels in clay , in terra-cotta , and in alabaster . Here , though , the ornamentation was sometimes merely by patterns or bands , 7123 there were occasionally real attempts to depict animal and human forms , which , if not very successful , still possess considerable interest . The noble amphora from Curium , figured by Di Cesnola , 7124 contains above forty representations of horses , and nearly as many of birds . The shape of the horse is exceedingly conventional , the whole form being attenuated in the highest degree ; but the animal is drawn with spirit , and the departure from nature is clearly intentional . In the animals that are pasturing , the general attitude is well seized ; the movement is exactly that of the horse when he stretches his neck to reach and crop the grass. 7125 In the birds there is equal spirit and greater truth to nature : they are in various attitudes , preening their feathers , pecking the ground , standing with head erect in the usual way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stags , fish and birds of various kinds , while one has an attempt at a hippopotamus . The attempts to represent the human form are certainly not happy ; they remind us of the more ambitious efforts of Chinese and Japanese art .

The materials which she employed for them were wool , linen yarn , perhaps cotton , and , in the later period of her commercial prosperity , silk . The " white wool " of Syria was supplied to her in abundance by the merchants of Damascus , 81 and wool of lambs , rams , and goats seems also to have been furnished by the more distant parts of Arabia. 82 Linen yarn may have been imported from Egypt , where it was largely manufactured , and was of excellent quality ; 83 while raw silk is said to have been " brought to Tyre and Berytus by the Persian merchants , and there both dyed and woven into cloaks . " 84 The price of silk was very high , and it was customary in Phoenicia to intermix the precious material either with linen or with cotton ; 85 as is still done to a certain extent in modern times . It is perhaps doubtful whether , so far as the mere fabric of stuffs was concerned , the products of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Egypt and Babylonia furnished , much less to those which came from India , and passed under the name of Sindones . Two things gave to the Phoenician stuffs that high reputation which caused them to be more sought for than any others ; and these were , first , the brilliancy and beauty of their colours , and , secondly , the delicacy with which they were in many instances embroidered . We have not much trace of Phoenician embroidery on the representations of dresses that have come down to us ; but the testimony of the ancients is unimpeachable , 86 and we may regard it as certain that the art of embroidery , known at a very early date to the Hebrews , 87 was cultivated with great success by their Phoenician neighbours , and under their auspices reached a high point of perfection . The character of the decoration is to be gathered from the extant statues and bas-reliefs , from the representations on paterae , on cups , dishes , and gems . There was a tendency to divide the surface to be ornamented into parallel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single object , or two alternately . Rosettes , monsters of various kinds , winged globes with uraei , scarabs , sacred trees , and garlands or blossoms of the lotus were the ordinary " motives . " 88 Occasionally human figures might be introduced , and animal forms even more frequently ; but a stiff conventionalism prevailed , the same figures were constantly repeated , and the figures themselves had in few cases much beauty . The brilliancy and beauty of the Phoenician coloured stuffs resulted from the excellency of their dyes . Here we touch a second branch of their industrial skill , for the principal dyes used were originally invented and continuously fabricated by the Phoenicians themselves , not imported from any foreign country . Nature had placed along the Phoenician coast , or at any rate along a great portion of it , an inexhaustible supply of certain shell-fish , or molluscs , which contained as a part of their internal economy a colouring fluid possessing remarkable , and indeed unique , qualities . Some account has been already given of the species which are thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainly , to the two allied families of the Murex and the Buccinum or Purpura . Eight species of the former , and six of the latter , having their habitat in the Mediterranean , have been distinguished by some naturalists ; 89 but two of the former only , and one of the latter , appear to have attracted the attention of the Phoenicians . The Murex brandaris is now thought to have borne away the palm from all the others ; it is extremely common upon the coast ; and enormous heaps of the shells are found , especially in the vicinity of Tyre , crushed and broken  --  the debris , as it would seem , cast away by the manufacturers of old. 810 The Murex trunculus , according to some , is just as abundant , in a crushed state , in the vicinity of Sidon , great banks of it existing , which are a hundred yards long and several yards thick. 811 It is a more spinous shell than the M. brandaris , having numerous projecting points , and a generally rough and rugged appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lapillus , a mollusc not confined to the Mediterranean , but one which frequents also our own shores , and was once turned to some account in Ireland. 812 The varieties of the P. lapillus differ considerably . Some are nearly white , some greyish , others buff striped with brown . Some , again , are smooth , others nearly as rough as the Murex trunculus . The Helix ianthina , which is included by certain writers among the molluscs employed for dyeing purposes by the Phoenicians , 813 is a shell of a completely different character , smooth and delicate , much resembling that of an ordinary land snail , and small compared to the others . It is not certain , however , that the helix , though abounding in the Eastern Mediterranean , 814 ever attracted the notice of the Phoenicians . The molluscs needed by the Phoenician dyers were not obtained without some difficulty . As the Mediterranean has no tides , it does not uncover its shores at low water like the ocean , or invite man to rifle them . The coveted shell-fish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to procure them in any quantity it was necessary that they should be fished up from a depth of some fathoms . The mode in which they were captured was the following . A long rope was let down into the sea , with baskets of reeds or rushes attached to it at intervals , constructed like our lobster-traps or eel-baskets , with an opening that yielded easily to pressure from the outside , but resisted pressure from the inside , and made escape , when once the trap was entered , impossible . The baskets were baited with mussels or frogs , both of which had great attractions for the Purpurae , and were seized and devoured with avidity . At the upper end of the rope was attached to a large piece of cork , which , even when the baskets were full , could not be drawn under water . It was usual to set the traps in the evening , and after waiting a night , or sometimes a night and a day , to draw them up to the surface , when they were generally found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two ways in which the dye was obtained from the molluscs . Sometimes a hole was broken in the side of the shell , and the fish taken out entire. 816 The sac containing the colouring matter , which is a sort of vein , beginning at the head of the animal , and following the tortuous line of the body as it twists through the spiral shell , 817 was then carefully extracted , either while the mollusc was still alive , or as soon as possible after death , as otherwise the quality of the dye was impaired . This plan was pursued more especially with the larger species of Purpurae , where the sac attained a certain size ; while with a smaller kinds a different method was followed . In their case no attempt was made to extract the sac , but the entire fish was crushed , together with its shell , and after salt had been added in the proportion of twenty ounces to a hundred pounds of the pulp , three days were allowed for maceration ; heat was then applied , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed , the dye was left in a liquid state at the bottom . It was necessary that the vessel in which this final process took place should be of lead , and not of bronze or iron , since those metals gave the dye a disagreeable tinge. 818 The colouring matter contained in the sac of the Purpurae is a liquid of a creamy consistency , and of a yellowish-white hue . On extraction , it is at first decidedly yellow ; then after a little time it becomes green ; and , finally , it settles into some shade of violet or purple . Chemical analysis has shown that in the case of the Murex trunculus the liquid is composed of two elementary substances , one being cyanic acid , which is of a blue or azure colour , and the other being purpuric oxide , which is a bright red. 819 In the case of the Murex brandaris one element only has been found : it is an oxide , which has received the name of oxyde tyrien. 820 No naturalist has as yet discovered what purpose the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of the animal ; it is certainly not exuded , as sepia is by the cuttle-fish , to cloud the water in the neighbourhood , and enable the creature to conceal itself . Concerning the Phoenician process of dyeing , the accounts which have come down to us are at once confused and incomplete . Nothing is said with respect to their employment of mordants , either acid or alkali , and yet it is almost certain that they must have used one or the other , or both , to fix the colours , and render them permanent . The gamins of Tyre employ to this day mordants of each sort ; 821 and an alkali derived from seaweed is mentioned by Pliny as made use of for fixing some dyes , 822 though he does not distinctly tell us that it was known to the Phoenicians or employed in fixing the purple . What we chiefly learn from this writer as to the dyeing process is823  --  first , that sometimes the liquid derived from the murex only , sometimes that of the purpura or buccinum only , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colour , while the most approved hue was produced by an application of both dyes separately . Secondly , we are told that the material , whatever it might be , was steeped in the dye for a certain number of hours , then withdrawn for a while , and afterwards returned to the vat and steeped a second time . The best Tyrian cloths were called Dibapha , i.e. " twice dipped ; " and for the production of the true " Tyrian purple " it was necessary that the dye obtained from the Buccinum should be used after that from the Murex had been applied . The Murex alone gave a dye that was firm , and reckoned moderately good ; but the Buccinum alone was weak , and easily washed out . The actual tints produced from the shell-fish appear to have ranged from blue , through violet and purple , to crimson and rose. 824 Scarlet could not be obtained , but was yielded by the cochineal insect . Even for the brighter sorts of crimson some admixture of the cochineal dye was necessary. 825 The violet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a period in the reign of Augustus when it was the fashion ; 826 redder hues were commonly preferred ; and the choicest of all is described as " a rich , dark purple , the colour of coagulated blood . " 827 A deep crimson was also in request , and seems frequently to be intended when the term purple ( porphureos , purpureus ) is used . A third industry greatly affected by the Phoenicians was the manufacture of glass . According to Pliny , 828 the first discovery of the substance was made upon the Phoenician coast by a body of sailors whom he no doubt regarded as Phoenicians . These persons had brought a cargo of natrum , which is the subcarbonate of soda , to the Syrian coast in the vicinity of Acre , and had gone ashore at the mouth of the river Belus to cook their dinner . Having lighted a fire upon the sand , they looked about for some stones to prop up their cooking utensils , but finding none , or none convenient for the purpose , they bethought themselves of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which their ship was laden . These were placed close to the fire , and the heat was sufficient to melt a portion of one of them , which , mixing with the siliceous sand at its base , produced a stream of glass . There is nothing impossible or even very improbable in this story ; but we may question whether the scene of it is rightly placed . Glass was manufactured in Egypt many centuries before the probable date of the Phoenician occupation of the Mediterranean coast ; and , if the honour of the invention is to be assigned to a particular people , the Egyptians would seem to have the best claim to it . The process of glass-blowing is represented in tombs at Beni Hassan of very great antiquity , 829 and a specimen of Egyptian glass is in existence bearing the name of a Usurtasen , a king of the twelfth dynasty. 830 Natrum , moreover , was an Egyptian product , well known from a remote date , being the chief ingredient used in the various processes of embalming. 831 Phoenicia has no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in considerable quantity . There may have been an accidental discovery of glass in Phoenicia , but priority of discovery belonged almost certainly to Egypt ; and it is , upon the whole , most probable that Phoenicia derived from Egypt her knowledge both of the substance itself and of the method of making it . Still , there can be no doubt that the manufacture was one on which the Phoenicians eagerly seized , and which they carried out on a large scale and very successfully . Sidon , according to the ancients , 832 was the chief seat of the industry ; but the best sand is found near Tyre , and both Tyre and Sarepta also seem to have been among the places where glassworks were early established . At Sarepta extensive banks of debris have been found , consisting of broken glass of many colours , the waste beyond all doubt of a great glass manufactory ; 833 at Tyre , the traces of the industry are less extensive , 834 but on the other hand we have historical evidence that it continued to be practised there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phoenicians was of three kinds : first , transparent colourless glass , which the eye could see through ; secondly , translucent coloured glass , through which light could pass , though the eye could not penetrate it so as to distinguish objects ; and , thirdly , opaque glass , scarcely distinguishable from porcelain . Transparent glass was employed for mirrors , round plates being cast , which made very tolerable looking-glasses , 836 when covered at the back by thin sheets of metal , and also for common objects , such as vases , urns , bottles , and jugs , which have been yielded in abundance by tombs of a somewhat late date in Cyprus. 837 No great store , however , seems to have been set upon transparency , in which the Oriental eye saw no beauty ; and the objects which modern research has recovered under this head at Tyre , in Cyprus , and elsewhere , seem the work of comparatively rude artists , and have little aesthetic merit . The shapes , however , are not inelegant . The most beautiful of the objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ semi-transparent vessels of different kinds , most of them variously coloured , which have been found in Cyprus , at Camirus in Rhodes , and on the Syrian coast , near Beyrout and elsewhere. 838 These comprise small flasks or bottles , from three to six inches long , probably intended to contain perfumes ; small jugs ( oenochoae ) from three inches in height to five inches ; vases of about the same size ; amphorae pointed at the lower extremity ; and other varieties . They are coloured , generally , either in longitudinal or in horizontal stripes and bands ; but the bands often deviate from the straight line into zig-zags , which are always more or less irregular , like the zig-zags of the Norman builders , while sometimes they are deflected into crescents , or other curves , as particularly one resembling a willow-leaf . The colours are not very vivid , but are pleasing and well-contrasted ; they are chiefly five  --  white , blue , yellow , green , and a purplish brown . Red scarcely appears , except in a very pale , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncommon . Blue , on the other hand , is greatly affected , being sometimes used in the patterns , often taken for the ground , and occasionally , in two tints , forming both groundwork and ornamentation. 839 It is not often that more than three hues are found on the same vessel , and sometimes the hues employed are only two . There are instances , however , and very admirable instances , of the employment , on a single vessel , of four hues. 840 The colours were obtained , commonly , at any rate , from metallic oxides . The ordinary blue employed is cobalt , though it is suspected that there was an occasional use of copper . Copper certainly furnished the greens , while manganese gave the brown , which shades off into purple and into black . The beautiful milky white which forms the ground tint of some vases is believed to have been derived from the oxide of tin , or else from phosphate of chalk . It is said that the colouring matter of the patterns does not extend through the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outer surface , being a later addition to the vessels as first made . Translucent coloured glass was also largely produced by the Phoenicians for beads and other ornaments , and also for the imitation of gems . The huge emerald of which Herodotus speaks , 841 as " shining with great brilliancy at night " in the temple of Melkarth at Tyre , was probably a glass cylinder , into which a lamb was introduced by the priests . In Phoenician times the pretended stone is quite as often a glass paste as a real gem , and the case is the same with the scarabs so largely used as seals . In Phoenician necklaces , glass beads alternate frequently with real agates , onyxes , and crystals ; while sometimes glass in various shapes is the only material employed . A necklace found at Tharros in Sardinia , and now in the collection of the Louvre , which is believed to be of Phoenician manufacture , is composed of above forty beads , two cylinders , four pendants representing heads of bulls , and one representing the face of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by M. Renan in Phoenicia itself , is made up of glass beads imitating pearls , intermixed with beads of cornaline and agate. 843 Another class of glass ornaments consists of small flat plaques or plates , pierced with a number of fine holes , which appear to have been sewn upon garments . These are usually patterned , sometimes with spirals , sometimes with rosettes , occasionally , though rarely , with figures . Messrs . Perrot and Chipiez represent one in their great work upon ancient art , 844 where almost the entire field is occupied by a winged griffin , standing upright on its two hind legs , and crowned with a striped cap , or turban . Phoenician opaque glass is comparatively rare , and possesses but little beauty . It was rendered opaque in various ways . Messrs . Perrot and Chipiez found that in a statue of Serapis , which they analysed , the glass was mixed with bronze in the proportions of ten to three . An opaque material of a handsome red colour was thus produced , which was heavy and exceedingly hard. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much the same as those which are still employed for the production of similar objects , and involved the use of similar implements , as the blowpipe , the lathe , and the graver . The materials having been procured , they were fused together in a crucible or melting-pot by the heat of a powerful furnace . A blowpipe was then introduced into the viscous mass , a portion of which readily attached itself to the implement , and so much glass was withdrawn as was deemed sufficient for the object which it was designed to manufacture . The blower then set to work , and blew hard into the pipe until the glass at its lower extremity began to expand and gradually took a pear-shaped form , the material partially coolling and hardening , but still retaining a good deal of softness and pliability . While in this condition , it was detached from the pipe , and modelled with pincers or with the hand into the shape required , after which it was polished , and perhaps sometimes cut by means of the turning-lathe . Sand and emery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface was produced , with which little fault could be found , being smooth , uniform , and brilliant . Thus the vessel was formed , and if no further ornament was required , the manufacture was complete  --  a jug , vase , alabastron , amphora , was produced , either transparent or of a single uniform tint , which might be white , blue , brown , green , &c.,; according to the particular oxide which had been thrown , with the silica and alkali , into the crucible . Generally , however , the manufacturer was not content with so simple a product : he aimed not merely at utility , but at beauty , and proceeded to adorn the work of his hands  --  whatever it was  --  with patterns which were for the most part in good taste and highly pleasing . These patterns he first scratched on the outer surface of the vessel with a graving tool ; then , when he had made his depressions deep enough , he took threads of coloured glass , and having filled up with the threads the depressions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more to such a heat that the threads were fused , and attached themselves to the ground on which they had been laid . In melting they would generally more than fill the cavities , overflowing them , and protruding from them , whence it was for the most part necessary to repeat the polishing process , and to bring by means of abrasion the entire surface once more into uniformity . There are cases where this has been incompletely done and where the patterns project ; there are others where the threads have never thoroughly melted into the ground , and where in the course of time they have partially detached themselves from it ; but in general the fusion and subsequent polishing have been all that could be wished , and the patterns are perfectly level with the ground and seem one with it. 846 The running of liquid glass into moulds , so common nowadays , does not seem to have been practised by the Phoenicians , perhaps because their furnaces were not sufficiently hot to produce complete liquefaction . But  --  if this was so  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been unknown , since we have evidence of the existence of moulds , 847 and there are cases where several specimens of an object have evidently issued from a single matrix. 848 Beads , cylinders , pendants , scarabs , amulets , were probably , all of them , made in this way , sometimes in translucent , sometimes in semi-opaque glass , as perhaps were also the plaques which have been already described . The ceramic art of the Phoenicians is not very remarkable . Phoenicia Proper is deficient in clay of a superior character , and it was probably a very ordinary and coarse kind of pottery that the Phoenician merchants of early times exported regularly in their trading voyages , both inside and outside the Mediterranean . We hear of their carrying this cheap earthenware northwards to the Cassiterides or Scilly Islands , 849 and southwards to the isle of Cerne , which is probably Arguin , on the West African coast ; 850 nor can we doubt that they supplied it also to the uncivilised races of the Mediterranean  --  the Illyrians , Ligurians , Sicels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fragile nature of the material , and its slight value , have caused its entire disappearance in the course of centuries , unless in the shape of small fragments ; nor are these fragments readily distinguishable from those whose origin is different . Phoenicia Proper has furnished no earthen vessels , either whole or in pieces , that can be assigned to a time earlier than the Greco-Roman period , 851 nor have any such vessels been found hitherto on Phoenician sites either in Sardinia , or in Corsica , or in Spain , or Africa , or Sicily , or Malta , or Gozzo . The only places that have hitherto furnished earthen vases or other vessels presumably Phoenician are Jerusalem , Camirus in Rhodes , and Cyprus ; and it is from the specimens found at these sites that we must form our estimate of the Phoenician pottery . The earliest specimens are of a moderately good clay , unglazed . They are regular in shape , being made by the help of a wheel , and for the most part not inelegant , though they can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ornament of any kind , being apparently mere jars , used for the storing away of oil or wine ; they have sometimes painted or scratched upon them , in Phoenician characters , the name of the maker or owner . A few rise somewhat above the ordinary level , having handles of some elegance , and being painted with designs and patterns , generally of a geometrical character . A vase about six inches high , found at Jerusalem , has , between horizontal bands , a series of geometric patterns , squares , octagons , lozenges , triangles , pleasingly arranged , and painted in brown upon a ground which is of a dull grey . At the top are two rude handles , between which runs a line of zig-zag , while at the bottom is a sort of stand or base . The shape is heavy and inelegant. 852 Another vase of a similar character to this , but superior in many respects , was found by General Di Cesnola at Dali ( Idalium ) , and is figured in his " Cyprus . " 853 This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ornamented with horizontal bands , except towards the middle , where it has its greatest diameter , and exhibits a series of geometric designs . In the centre is a lozenge , divided into four smaller lozenges by a St. Andrew 's cross ; other compartments are triangular , and are filled with a chequer of black and white , resembling the squares of a chessboard . Beyond , on either side , are vertical bands , diversified with a lozenge ornament . Two hands succeed , of a shape that is thought to have " a certain elegance . " 854 There is a rim , which might receive a cover , at top , and at bottom a short pedestal . The height of the vase is about thirteen inches . In many of the Cyprian vases having a geometric decoration , the figures are not painted on the surface but impressed or incised . Messrs . Perrot and Chipiez regard this form of ornamentation as the earliest ; but the beauty and finish of several vases on which it occurs is against the supposition . There is scarcely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art , a more elegant form than that of the jug in black clay brought by General Di Cesnola from Alambra and figured both in his " Cyprus " 855 and in the " Histoire de l'Art. " 856 Yet its ornamentation is incised . If , then , incised patterning preceded painted in Phoenicia , at any rate it held its ground after painting was introduced , and continued in vogue even to the time when Greek taste had largely influenced Phoenician art of every description . The finest Phoenician efforts in ceramic art resemble either the best Egyptian or the best Greek . As the art advanced , the advantage of a rich glaze was appreciated , and specimens which seem to be Phoenician have all the delicacy and beauty of the best Egyptian faience . A cup found at Idalium , plain on the outside , is covered internally with a green enamel , on which are patterns and designs in black. 857 In a medallion at the bottom of the cup is the representation of a marshy tract overgrown with the papyrus plant , whereof we see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rushing at full speed , is the form of a wild boar . The rest of the ornamentation consists chiefly of concentric circles ; but between two of the circles is left a tolerably broad ring , which has a pattern consisting of a series of broadish leaves pointing towards the cup 's centre . Nothing can be more delicate , or in better taste , than the entire design . The most splendid of all the Cyprian vases was found at Curium , and has been already represented in this volume . It is an amphora of large dimensions , ornamented in part with geometrical designs , in part with compartments , in which are represented horses and birds . The form , the designs , and the general physiognomy of the amphora are considered to be in close accordance with Athenian vases of the most antique school . The resemblance is so great that some have supposed the vase to have been an importation from Attica into Cyprus ; 858 but such conjectures are always hazardous ; and the principal motives of the design are so frequent on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is at least possible , and the judgment of some of the best critics seems to incline in this direction . Still , on the whole , the Cyprian ceramic art is somewhat disappointing . What is original in it is either grotesque , as the vases in the shape of animals , 859 or those crowned by human heads , 860 or those again which have for spout a female figure pouring liquid out of a jug. 861 What is superior has the appearance of having been borrowed . Egyptian , Assyrian , and Greek art , each in turn , furnished shapes , designs , and patterns to the Phoenician potters , who readily adopted from any and every quarter the forms and decorations which hit their fancy . Their fancy was , predominantly , for the bizarre and the extravagant . Vases in the shape of helmets , in the shape of barrels , in the shape of human heads , 862 have little fitness , and in the Cyprian specimens have little beauty ; the mixture of Assyrian with Egyptian forms is incongruous ; the birds and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recalling the art of China and Japan . If there is elegance in some of the forms , it is seldom a very pronounced elegance ; and , where the taste is best , the suspicion continually arises that a foreign model has been imitated . Moreover , from first to last the art makes little progress . There seems to have been an arrest of development. 863 The early steps are taken , but at a certain point stagnation sets in ; there is no further attempt to improve or advance ; the artists are content to repeat themselves , and reproduce the patterns of the past . Perhaps there was no demand for ceramic art of a higher order . At any rate , progress ceases , and while Greece was rising to her grandest efforts , Cyprus , and Phoenicia generally , were content to remain stationary . Besides their ornamental metallurgy , which has been treated of in a former chapter , the Phoenicians largely employed several metals , especially bronze and copper , in the fabrication of vessels for ordinary use , of implements , arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paterae , bowls , jugs , amphorae , and cups ; 864 the implements , hatchets , adzes , knives , and sickles ; 865 the arms , spearheads , arrowheads , daggers , battle-axes , helmets , and shields ; 866 the toilet articles , mirrors , hand-bells , buckles , candlesticks , &c.; 867 the furniture , tall candelabra , tripods , and thrones. 868 The bronze is of an excellent quality , having generally about nine parts of copper to one of tin ; and there is reason to believe that by the skilful tempering of the Phoenician metallurgists , it attained a hardness which was not often given it by others . The Cyprian shields were remarkable . They were of a round shape , slightly convex , and instead of the ordinary boss , had a long projecting cone in the centre . An actual shield , with the cone perfect , was found by General Di Cesnola at Amathus , 869 and a projection of the same kind is seen in several of the Sardinian bronze and terra-cotta statuettes. 870 Shields were sometimes elaborately embossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vegetable forms. 871 Helmets were also embossed with care , and sometimes inscribed with the name of the maker or the owner. 872 Some remains of swords , probably Phoenician , have been found in Sardinia . They vary from two feet seven inches to four feet two inches in length. 873 The blade is commonly straight , and very thick in the centre , but tapers off on both sides to a sharp edge . The point is blunt , so that the intention can not have been to use the weapon both for cutting and thrusting , but only for the former . It would scarcely make such a clean cut as a modern broadsword , but would no doubt be equally effectual for killing or disabling . Another weapon , found in Sardinia , and sometimes called a sword , is more properly a knife or dagger . In length it does not exceed seven or eight inches , and of this length more than a third is occupied by the handle. 874 Below the handle the blade broadens for about an inch or an inch and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gently to a sharp point . Such a weapon appears sometimes in the hand of a statuette. 875 The bronze articles of the toilet recovered by recent researches in Cyprus and elsewhere are remarkable . The handle of a mirror found in Cyprus , and now in the Museum of New York , possesses considerable merit . It consists mainly of a female figure , naked , and standing upon a frog. 876 In her hands she holds a pair of cymbals , which she is in the act of striking together . A ribbon , passed over her left shoulder , is carried through a ring , from which hangs a seal . On her arms and shoulders appear to have stood two lions , which formed side supports to the mirror that was attached to the figure 's head . If the face of the cymbal-player can not boast of much beauty , and her figure is thought to " lack distinction , " still it is granted that the tout ensemble of the work was not without originality , and may have possessed a certain amount of elegance. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found in the Treasury of Curium , 878 and a tripod from the same place , seem to deserve a short notice . The candlesticks stand upon a sort of short pillar as a base , above which is the blossom of a flower inverted , a favourite Phoenician ornament. 879 From this rises the lamp-stand , composed of three leaves , which curl outwards , and support between them a ring into which the bottom of the lamp fitted . The tripod880 is more elaborate . The legs , which are fluted , bulge considerably at the top , after which they bend inwards , and form a curve like one half of a Cupid 's bow . To retain them in place , they are joined together by a sort of cross-bar , about half-way in their length ; while , to keep them steady , they are made to rest on large flat feet . The circular hoop which they support is of some width , and is ornamented along its entire course with a zig-zag . From the hoop depend , half-way in the spaces between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hangs a curious pendant . Besides copper and bronze , the Phoenicians seem to have worked in lead and iron , but only to a small extent . Iron ore might have been obtained in some parts of their own country , but appears to have been principally derived from abroad , especially from Spain. 881 It was worked up chiefly , so far as we know , into arms offensive and defensive . The sword of Alexander , which he received as a gift from the king of Citium , 882 was doubtless in this metal , which is the material of a sword found at Amathus , and of numerous arrowheads. 883 We are also told that Cyprus furnished the iron breast-plates worn by Demetrius Poliorcetes ; 884 and in pre-Homeric times it was a Phoenician  --  Cinyras  --  who gave to Agamemnon his breast-plate of steel , gold , and tin. 885 That more remains of iron arms and implements have not been found on Phoenician sites is probably owing to the rapid oxydisation of the metal , which consequently decays and disappears . The Hiram who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Jerusalem was , we must remember , " skilful to work , " not only " in gold , and silver , and bronze , " but also " in iron . " 886 Lead was largely furnished to the Phoenicians by the Scilly Islands , 887 and by Spain. 888 It has not been found in any great quantity on Phoenician sites , but still appears occasionally . Sometimes it is a solder uniting stone with bronze ; 889 sometimes it exists in thin sheets , which may have been worn as ornaments. 890 In Phoenicia Proper it has been chiefly met with in the shape of coffins , 891 which are apparently of a somewhat late date . They are formed of several sheets placed one over the other and then soldered together . There is generally on the lid and sides of the coffin an external ornamentation in a low relief , wherein the myth of Psyche is said commonly to play a part ; but the execution is mediocre , and the designs themselves have little merit .

With her own colonies  --  2 . With foreigners  --  Mediterranean and Black Sea trade  --  North Atlantic trade  --  Trade with the West Coast of Africa and the Canaries  --  Trade in the Red Sea and Indian Ocean . The first attempts of the Phoenicians to navigate the sea which washed their coast were probably as clumsy and rude as those of other primitive nations . They are said to have voyaged from island to island , in their original abodes within the Persian Gulf , by means of rafts. 91 When they reached the shores of the Mediterranean , it can scarcely have been long ere they constructed boats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boats were of a very rude construction . Probably , like other races , they began with canoes , roughly hewn out of the trunk of a tree . The torrents which descended from Lebanon would from time to time bring down the stems of fallen trees in their flood-time ; and these , floating on the Mediterranean waters , would suggest the idea of navigation . They would , at first , be hollowed out with hatchets and adzes , or else with fire ; and , later on , the canoes thus produced would form the models for the earliest efforts in shipbuilding . The great length , however , would soon be found unnecessary , and the canoe would give place to the boat , in the ordinary acceptation of the term . There are models of boats among the Phoenician remains which have a very archaic character , 92 and may give us some idea of the vessels in which the Phoenicians of the remoter times braved the perils of the deep . They have a keel , not ill shaped , a rounded hull , bulwarks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steersman . The oars , apparently , must have been passed through interstices in the bulwark . From this rude shape the transition was not very difficult to the bark represented in the sculptures of Sargon , 93 which is probably a Phoenician one . Here four rowers , standing to their oars , impel a vessel having for prow the head of a horse and for stern the tail of a fish , both of them rising high above the water . The oars are curved , like golf or hockey-sticks , and are worked from the gunwale of the bark , though there is no indication of rowlocks . The vessel is without a rudder ; but it has a mast , supported by two ropes which are fastened to the head and stern . The mast has neither sail nor yard attached to it , but is crowned by what is called a " crow 's nest "  --  a bell-shaped receptacle , from which a slinger or archer might discharge missiles against an enemy. 94 A vessel of considerably greater size than this , but of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank of oars only  --  is indicated by certain coins , which have been regarded by some critics as Phoenician , by others as belonging to Cilicia. 95 These have a low bow , but an elevated stern ; the prow exhibits a beak , while the stern shows signs of a steering apparatus ; the number of the oars on each side is fifteen or twenty . The Greeks called these vessels triaconters or penteconters . They are represented without any mast on the coins , and thus seem to have been merely row-boats of a superior character . About the time of Sennacherib ( B.C. 700 ) , or a little earlier , some great advances seem to have been made by the Phoenician shipbuilders . In the first place , they introduced the practice of placing the rowers on two different levels , one above the other ; and thus , for a vessel of the same length , doubling the number of the rowers . Ships of this kind , which the Greeks called " biremes , " are represented in Sennacherib 's sculptures as employed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them at the moment when their town is captured , and so escape their enemy. 96 The ships are of two kinds . Both kinds have a double tier of rowers , and both are guided by two steering oars thrust out from the stern ; but while the one is still without mast or sail , and is rounded off in exactly the same way both at stem and stern , the other has a mast , placed about midship , a yard hung across it , and a sail close reefed to the yard , while the bow is armed with a long projecting beak , like a ploughshare , which must have been capable of doing terrible damage to a hostile vessel . The rowers , in both classes of ships , are represented as only eight or ten upon a side ; but this may have arisen from artistic necessity , since a greater number of figures could not have been introduced without confusion . It is thought that in the beaked vessel we have a representation of the Phoenician war-galley ; in the vessel without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a vase found in Cyprus exhibits what would seem to have been a pleasure-vessel. 98 It is unbeaked , and without any sign of oars , except two paddles for steering with . About midship is a short mast , crossed by a long spar or yard , which carries a sail , closely reefed along its entire length . The yard and sail are managed by means of four ropes , which are , however , somewhat conventionally depicted . Both the head and stern of the vessel rise to a considerable height above the water , and the stern is curved , very much as in the war-galleys . It perhaps terminated in the head of a bird . According to the Greek writers , Phoenician vessels were mainly of two kinds , merchant ships and war-vessels. 99 The merchant ships were of a broad , round make , what our sailors would call " tubs , " resembling probably the Dutch fishing-boats of a century ago . They were impelled both by oars and sails , but depended mainly on the latter . Each of them had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single sail was attached ; 910 this was what in modern times is called a " square sail , " a form which is only well suited for sailing with when the wind is directly astern . It was apparently attached to the yard , and had to be hoisted together with the yard , along which it could be closely reefed , or from which it could be loosely shaken out . It was managed , no doubt , by ropes attached to the two lower corners , which must have been held in the hands of sailors , as it would have been most dangerous to belay them . As long as the wind served , the merchant captain used his sail ; when it died away , or became adverse , he dropped yard and sail on to his deck , and made use of his oars . Merchant ships had , commonly , small boats attached to them , which afforded a chance of safety if the ship foundered , and were useful when cargoes had to be landed on a shelving shore. 911 We have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deck until they were wanted , or attached to the ships by ropes and towed after them ; but the latter arrangement is the more probable . The war-galleys of the Phoenicians in the early times were probably of the class which the Greeks called triaconters or penteconters , and which are represented upon the coins . They were long open rowboats , in which the rowers sat , all of them , upon a level , the number of rowers on either side being generally either fifteen or twenty-five . Each galley was armed at its head with a sharp metal spike , or beak , which was its chief weapon of offence , vessels of this class seeking commonly to run down their enemy . After a time these vessels were superseded by biremes , which were decked , had masts and sails , and were impelled by rowers sitting at two different elevations , as already explained . Biremes were ere long superseded by triremes , or vessels with three banks of oars , which are said to have been invented at Corinth , 912 but which came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixth century B.C.913 In the third century B.C. the Carthaginians employed in war quadriremes , and even quinqueremes ; but there is no evidence of the employment of either class of vessel by the Phoenicians of Phoenicia Proper . The superiority of the Phoenician ships to others is generally allowed , and was clearly shown when Xerxes collected his fleet of twelve hundred and seven triremes against Greece . The fleet included contingents from Phoenicia , Cyprus , Egypt , Cilicia , Pamphylia , Lycia , Caria , Ionia , AEolis , and the Greek settlements about the Propontis. 914 When it reached the Hellespont , the great king , anxious to test the quality of his ships and sailors , made proclamation for a grand sailing match , in which all who liked might contend . Each contingent probably  --  at any rate , all that prided themselves on their nautical skill  --  selected its best vessel , and entered it for the coming race ; the king himself , and his grandees and officers , and all the army , stood or sat along the shore to see : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phoenicians of Sidon. 915 Having thus tested the nautical skill of the various nations under his sway , the great king , when he ventured his person upon the dangerous element , was careful to embark in a Sidonian galley. 916 A remarkable testimony to the excellence of the Phoenician ships with respect to internal arrangements is borne by Xenophon , who puts the following words into the mouth of Ischomachus , a Greek : 917 " I think that the best and most perfect arrangement of things that I ever saw was when I went to look at the great Phoenician sailing-vessel ; for I saw the largest amount of naval tackling separately disposed in the smallest stowage possible . For a ship , as you well know , is brought to anchor , and again got under way , by a vast number of wooden implements and of ropes and sails the sea by means of a quantity of rigging , and is armed with a number of contrivances against hostile vessels , and carries about with it a large supply of weapons for the crew , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his dwelling-house , for each of the messes . In addition , it is laden with a quantity of merchandise which the owner carries with him for his own profit . Now all the things which I have mentioned lay in a space not much bigger than a room which would conveniently hold ten beds . And I remarked that they severally lay in a way that they did not obstruct one another , and did not require anyone to search for them ; and yet they were neither placed at random , nor entangled one with another , so as to consume time when they were suddenly wanted for use . Also , I found the captain 's assistant , who is called ' the look-out man , ' so well acquainted with the position of all the articles , and with the number of them , that even when at a distance he could tell where everything lay , and how many there were of each sort , just as anyone who has learnt to read can tell the number of letters in the name of Socrates and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw this man , in his leisure moments , examining and testing everything that a vessel needs when at sea ; so , as I was surprised , I asked him what he was about , whereupon he replied  --  ' Stranger , I am looking to see , in case anything should happen , how everything is arranged in the ship , and whether anything is wanting , or is inconveniently situated ; for when a storm arises at sea , it is not possible either to look for what is wanting , or to put to right what is arranged awkwardly . ' " Phoenician ships seem to have been placed under the protection of the Cabeiri , and to have had images of them at their stem or stern or both. 918 These images were not exactly " figure-heads , " as they are sometimes called . They were small , apparently , and inconspicuous , being little dwarf figures , regarded as amulets that would preserve the vessel in safety . We do not see them on any representations of Phoenician ships , and it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bronze or glazed earthenware images of Phthah that are so common in Egypt . The Phoenicians called them pittuchim , " sculptures , " 919 whence the Greek pataikoi and the French fetiche . The navigation of the Phoenicians , in early times , was no doubt cautious and timid . So far from venturing out of sight of land , they usually hugged the coast , ready at any moment , if the sea or sky threatened , to change their course and steer directly for the shore . On a shelving coast they were not at all afraid to run their ships aground , since , like the Greek vessels , they could be easily pulled up out of reach of the waves , and again pulled down and launched , when the storm was over and the sea calm once more . At first they sailed , we may be sure , only in the daytime , casting anchor at nightfall , or else dragging their ships up upon the beach , and so awaiting the dawn . But after a time they grew more bold . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and islands relatively one to another better known , the character of the seasons , the signs of unsettled or settled weather , the conduct to pursue in an emergency , better apprehended . They soon began to shape the course of their vessels from headland to headland , instead of always creeping along the shore , and it was not perhaps very long before they would venture out of sight of land , if their knowledge of the weather satisfied them that the wind might be trusted to continue steady , and if they were well assured of the direction of the land that they wished to make . They took courage , moreover , to sail in the night , no less than in the daytime , when the weather was clear , guiding themselves by the stars , and particularly by the Polar star , 920 which they discovered to be the star most nearly marking the true north . A passage of Strabo921 seems to show that  --  in the later times at any rate  --  they had a method of calculating the rate of a ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unknown to us . It is probable that they early constructed charts and maps , which however they would keep secret through jealousy of their commercial rivals . The Phoenicians for some centuries confined their navigation within the limits of the Mediterranean , the Propontis , and the Euxine , land-locked seas , which are tideless and far less rough than the open ocean . But before the time of Solomon they had passed the Pillars of Hercules , and affronted the dangers of the Atlantic. 922 Their frail and small vessels , scarcely bigger than modern fishing-smacks , proceeded southwards along the West African coast , as far as the tract watered by the Gambia and Senegal , while northwards they coasted along Spain , braved the heavy seas of the Bay of Biscay , and passing Cape Finisterre , ventured across the mouth of the English Channel to the Cassiterides . Similarly , from the West African shore , they boldly steered for the Fortunate Islands ( the Canaries ) , visible from certain elevated points of the coast , though at 170 miles distance . Whether they proceeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the Cape de Verde Islands , in the north to the coast of Holland , and across the German Ocean to the Baltic , we regard as uncertain . It is possible that from time to time some of the more adventurous of their traders may have reached thus far ; but their regular , settled , and established navigation did not , we believe , extend beyond the Scilly Islands and coast of Cornwall to the north-west , and to the south-west Cape Non and the Canaries . The commerce of the Phoenicians was carried on , to a large extent , by land , though principally by sea . It appears from the famous chapter of Ezekiel923 which describes the riches and greatness of Tyre in the sixth century B.C. , that almost the whole of Western Asia was penetrated by the Phoenician caravans , and laid under contribution to increase the wealth of the Phoenician traders . " Thou , son of man , ( we read ) take up a lamentation for Tyre , and say unto her , O thou that dwellest at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peoples unto many isles , Thus saith the Lord God , Thou , O Tyre , hast said , I am perfect in beauty .

Syria of Damascus gives the " wine of Helbon "  --  that exquisite liquor which was the only sort that the Persian kings would condescend to drink929  --  and " white wool , " the dainty fleeces of the sheep and lambs that fed on the upland pastures of Hermon and Antilibanus . Judah and the land of Israel supply corn of superior quality , called " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rich Ammonite country930  --  together with pannag , an unknown substance , and honey , and balm , and oil . Egypt sends fine linen , one of her best known products931  --  sometimes , no doubt , plain , but often embroidered with bright patterns , and employed as such embroidered fabrics were also in Egypt , 932 for the sails of pleasure-boats . Arabia provides her spices , cassia , and calamus ( or aromatic reed ) , and , beyond all doubt , frankincense , 933 and perhaps cinnamon and ladanum. 934 She also supplies wool and goat 's hair , and cloths for chariots , and gold , and wrought iron , and precious stones , and ivory , and ebony , of which the last two can not have been productions of her own , but must have been imported from India or Abyssinia. 935 Babylonia and Assyria furnish " wrappings of blue , embroidered work , and chests of rich apparel . " 936 Upper Mesopotamia partakes in this traffic. 937 Armenia gives horses and mules . Central Asia Minor ( Tubal and Meshech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greeks of Ionia do the like . Cyprus furnishes ivory , which she must first have imported from abroad. 938 Greece Proper sends her shell-fish , to enable the Phoenician cities to increase their manufacture of the purple dye. 939 Finally , Spain yields silver , iron , tin , and lead  --  the most useful of the metals  --  all of which she is known to have produced in abundance. 940 With the exception of Egypt , Ionia , Cyprus , Hellas , and Spain , the Phoenician intercourse with these places must have been carried on wholly by land . Even with Egypt , wherewith the communication by sea was so facile , there seems to have been also from a very early date a land commerce . The land commerce was in every case carried on by caravans . Western Asia has never yet been in so peaceful and orderly condition as to dispense prudent traders from the necessity of joining together in large bodies , well provisioned and well armed , when they are about to move valuable goods any considerable distance . There have always been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plains , ready to pounce on the insufficiently protected traveller , and to despoil him of all his belongings . Hence the necessity of the caravan traffic . As early as the time of Joseph  --  probably about B.C. 1600  --  we find a company of the Midianites on their way from Gilead , with their camels bearing spicery , and balm , and myrrh , going to carry it down to Egypt. 941 Elsewhere we hear of the " travelling companies of the Dedanim , " 942 of the men of Sheba bringing their gold and frankincense ; 943 of a multitude of camels coming up to Palestine with wood from Kedar and Nebaioth. 944 Heeren is entirely justified in his conclusion that the land trade of the Phoenicians was conducted by " large companies or caravans , since it could only have been carried on in this way . " 945 The nearest neighbours of the Phoenicians on the land side were the Jews and Israelites , the Syrians of Damascus , and the people of Northern Syria , or the Orontes valley and the tract east of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have derived at all times almost the whole of the grain which they were forced to import for their sustenance . In the time of David and Solomon it was chiefly for wheat and barley that they exchanged the commodities which they exported , 946 in that of Ezekiel it was primarily for " wheat of Minnith ; " 947 and a similar trade is noted on the return of the Jews from the captivity , 948 and in the first century of our era. 949 But besides grain they also imported from Palestine at some periods wine , oil , honey , balm , and oak timber. 950 Western Palestine was notoriously a land not only of corn , but also of wine , of olive oil , and of honey , and could readily impart of its superfluity to its neighbour in time of need . The oaks of Bashan are very abundant , and seem to have been preferred by the Phoenicians to their own oaks as the material of oars. 951 Balm , or basalm , was a product of the land of Gilead , 952 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was of superior quality. 953 From the Damascene Syrians we are told that Phoenicia imported " wine of Helbon " and " white wool . " 954 The " wine of Helbon " is reasonably identified with that oinos Khalubonios which is said to have been the favourite beverage of the Persian kings. 955 It was perhaps grown in the neighbourhood of Aleppo. 956 The " white wool " may have been furnished by the sheep that cropped the slopes of the Antilibanus , or by those fed on the fine grass which clothes most of the plain at its base . The fleece of these last is , according to Heeren , 957 " the finest known , being improved by the heat of the climate , the continual exposure to the open air , and the care commonly bestowed upon the flocks . " From the Syrian wool , mixed perhaps with some other material , seems to have been woven the fabric known , from the city where it was commonly made , 958 as " damask . " According to the existing text of Ezekiel , 959 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with cotton , with embroidered robes , with purple , and with precious stones . The valley of the Orontes is suitable for the cultivation of cotton ; and embroidered robes would naturally be produced in the seat of an old civilisation , which Syria certainly was . Purple seems somewhat out of place in the enumeration ; but the Syrians may have gathered the murex on their seaboard between Mt . Casius and the Gulf of Issus , and have sold what they collected in the Phoenician market . The precious stones which Ezekiel assigns to them are difficult of identification , but may have been furnished by Casius , Bargylus , or Amanus . These mountains , or at any rate Casius and Amanus , are of igneous origin , and , if carefully explored , would certainly yield gems to the investigator . At the same time it must be acknowledged that Syria had not , in antiquity , the name of a gem-producing country ; and , so far , the reading of " Edom " for " Aram , " which is preferred by many , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commerce of the Phoenicians with Egypt was ancient , and very extensive . " The wares of Egypt " are mentioned by Herodotus as a portion of the merchandise which they brought to Greece before the time of the Trojan War. 961 The Tyrians had a quarter in the city of Memphis assigned to them , 962 probably from an early date . According to Ezekiel , the principal commodity which Egypt furnished to Phoenicia was " fine linen " 963  --  especially the linen sails embroidered with gay patterns , which the Egyptian nobles affected for their pleasure-boats . They probably also imported from Egypt natron for their glass-works , papyrus for their documents , earthenware of various kinds for exportation , scarabs and other seals , statuettes and figures of gods , amulets , and in the later times sarcophagi. 964 Their exports to Egypt consisted of wine on a large scale , 965 tin almost certainly , and probably their peculiar purple fabrics , and other manufactured articles . The Phoenician trade with Arabia was of especial importance , since not only did the great peninsula itself produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was also mainly , if not solely , through Arabia that the Indian market was thrown open to the Phoenician traders , and the precious commodities obtained for which Hindustan has always been famous . Arabia is par excellence the land of spices , and was the main source from which the ancient world in general , and Phoenicia in particular , obtained frankincense , cinnamon , cassia , myrrh , calamus or sweet-cane , and ladanum. 966 It has been doubted whether these commodities were , all of them , the actual produce of the country in ancient times , and Herodotus has been in some degree discredited , but perhaps without sufficient reason . He is supported to a considerable extent by Theophrastus , the disciple of Aristotle , who says : 967 " Frankincense , myrrh , and cassia grow in the Arabian districts of Saba and Hadramaut ; frankincense and myrrh on the sides or at the foot of mountains , and in the neighbouring islands . The trees which produce them grow sometimes wild , though occasionally they are cultivated ; and the frankincense-tree grows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Modern authorities declare the frankincense-tree ( Boswellia thurifera ) to be still a native of Hadramaut ; 968 and there is no doubt that the myrrh-tree ( Balsamodendron myrrha ) also grows there . If cinnamon and cassia , as the terms are now understood , do not at present grow in Arabia , or nearer to Phoenicia than Hindustan , it may be that they have died out in the former country , or our modern use of the terms may differ from the ancient one . On the other hand , it is no doubt possible that the Phoenicians imagined all the spices which they obtained from Arabia to be the indigenous growth of the country , when in fact some of them were importations . Next to her spices , Arabia was famous for the production of a superior quality of wool . The Phoenicians imported this wool largely . The flocks of Kedar are especially noted , 969 and are said to have included both sheep and goats. 970 It was perhaps a native woollen manufacture , in which Dedan traded with Tyre , and which Ezekiel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 971 Goat 's hair was largely employed in the production of coverings for tents. 972 Arabia also furnished Phoenicia with gold , with precious stones , with ivory , ebony , and wrought iron. 973 The wrought iron was probably from Yemen , which was celebrated for its manufacture of sword blades . The gold may have been native , for there is much reason to believe that anciently the Arabian mountain ranges yielded gold as freely as the Ethiopian , 974 with which they form one system ; or it may have been imported from Hindustan , with which Arabia had certainly , in ancient times , constant communication . Ivory and ebony must , beyond a doubt , have been Arabian importations . There are two countries from which they may have been derived , India and Abyssinia . It is likely that the commercial Arabs of the south-east coast had dealings with both. 975 Of Phoenician imports into Arabia we have no account ; but we may conjecture that they consisted principally of manufactured goods , cotton and linen fabrics , pottery , implements and utensils in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the like . The nomadic Arabs , leading a simple life , required but little beyond what their own country produced ; there was , however , a town population976 in the more southern parts of the peninsula , to which the elegancies and luxuries of life , commonly exported by Phoenicia , would have been welcome . The Phoenician trade with Babylonia and Assyria was carried on probably by caravans , which traversed the Syrian desert by way of Tadmor or Palmyra , and struck the Euphrates about Circesium . Here the route divided , passing to Babylon southwards along the course of the great river , and to Nineveh eastwards by way of the Khabour and the Sinjar mountain-range . Both countries seem to have supplied the Phoenicians with fabrics of extraordinary value , rich in a peculiar embroidery , and deemed so precious that they were packed in chests of cedar-wood , which the Phoenician merchants must have brought with them from Lebanon. 977 The wares furnished by Assyria were in some cases exported to Greece , 978 while no doubt in others they were intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , jasper , hematite , steatite , and other materials , which may sometimes have found purchasers in Phoenicia Proper , but appear to have been specially affected by the Phoenician colonists in Cyprus. 979 On her part Phoenicia must have imported into Assyria and Babylonia the tin which was a necessary element in their bronze ; and they seem also to have found a market in Assyria for their own most valuable and artistic bronzes , the exquisite embossed paterae which are among the most precious of the treasures brought by Sir Austen Layard from Nineveh. 980 The nature of the Phoenician trade with Upper Mesopotamia is unknown to us ; and it is not impossible that their merchants visited Haran , 981 rather because it lay on the route which they had to follow in order to reach Armenia than because it possessed in itself any special attraction for them . Gall-nuts and manna are almost the only products for which the region is celebrated ; and of these Phoenicia herself produced the one , while she probably did not need the other . But the natural route to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Carchemish , to Haran , and thence by Amida or Diarbekr to Van , which was the capital of Armenia in the early times . Armenia supplied the Phoenicians with " horses of common and of noble breeds , " 982 and also with mules. 983 Strabo says that it was a country exceedingly well adapted for the breeding of the horse , 984 and even notes the two qualities of the animal that it produced , one of which he calls " Nisaean , " though the true " Nisaean plain " was in Media . So large was the number of colts bred each year , and so highly were they valued , that , under the Persian monarchy the Great King exacted from the province , as a regular item of its tribute , no fewer than twenty thousand of them annually. 985 Armenian mules seem not to be mentioned by any writer besides Ezekiel ; but mules were esteemed throughout the East in antiquity , 986 and no country would have been more likely to breed them than the mountain tract of Armenia , the Switzerland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially needed . Armenia adjoined the country of the Moschi and Tibareni  --  the Meshech and Tubal of the Bible . These tribes , between the ninth and the seventh centuries B.C. , inhabited the central regions of Asia Minor and the country known later as Cappadocia . They traded with Tyre in the " persons of men " and in " vessels of brass " or copper. 987 Copper is found abundantly in the mountain ranges of these parts , and Xenophon remarks on the prevalence of metal vessels in the portion of the region which he passed through  --  the country of the Carduchians. 988 The traffic in slaves was one in which the Phoenicians engaged from very early times . They were not above kidnapping men , women , and children in one country and selling them into another ; 989 besides which they seem to have frequented regularly the principal slave marts of the time . They bought such Jews as were taken captive and sold into slavery by the neighbouring nations , 990 and they looked to the Moschi and Tibareni for a constant supply of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribes have always been in the habit of furnishing slave-girls to the harems of the East , and the Thracians , who were not confined to Europe , but occupied a great part of Asia Minor , regularly trafficked in their children. 992 Such was the extent of the Phoenician land trade , as indicated by the prophet Ezekiel , and such were , so far as is at present known , the commodities interchanged in the course of it . It is quite possible  --  nay , probable  --  that the trade extended much further , and certain that it must have included many other articles of commerce besides those which we have mentioned . The sources of our information on the subject are so few and scanty , and the notices from which we derive our knowledge for the most part so casual , that we may be sure what is preserved is but a most imperfect record of what was  --  fragments of wreck recovered from the sea of oblivion . It may have been a Phoenician caravan route which Herodotus describes as traversed on one occasion by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terminated with the Niger and the city of Timbuctoo ; and another , at which he hints as lying between the coast of the Lotus-eaters and Fezzan. 994 Phoenician traders may have accompanied and stimulated the slave hunts of the Garamantians , 995 as Arab traders do those of the Central African nations at the present day . Again , it is quite possible that the Phoenicians of Memphis designed and organised the caravans which , proceeding from Egyptian Thebes , traversed Africa from east to west along the line of the " Salt Hills , " by way of Ammon , Augila , Fezzan , and the Tuarik country to Mount Atlas. 996 We can scarcely imagine the Egyptians showing so much enterprise . But these lines of traffic can be ascribed to the Phoenicians only by conjecture , history being silent on the subject . The sea trade of the Phoenicians was still more extensive than their land traffic . It is divisible into two branches , their trade with their own colonists , and that with the natives of the various countries to which they penetrated in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except in the single instance of Carthage , trading settlements , planted where some commodity or commodities desired by the mother-country abounded , and were intended to secure to the mother-country the monopoly of such commodity or commodities . For instance , Cyprus was colonised for the sake of its copper mines and its timber ; Cilicia and Lycia for their timber only ; Thasos for its gold mines ; Salamis and Cythera for the purple trade ; Sardinia and Spain for their numerous metals ; North Africa for its fertility and for the trade with the interior . Phoenicia expected to derive , primarily , from each colony the commodity or commodities which had caused the selection of the site . In return she supplied the colonists with her own manufactured articles ; with fabrics in linen , wool , cotton , and perhaps to some extent in silk ; with every variety of pottery , from dishes and jugs of the plainest and most simple kind to the most costly and elaborate vases and amphorae ; with metal utensils and arms , with gold and silver ornaments , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and also with any foreign products or manufactures that they desired and that the countries within the range of her influence could furnish . Phoenicia must have imported into Cyprus , to suit a peculiar Cyprian taste , the Egyptian statuettes , scarabs , and rings , 997 and the Assyrian and Babylonian cylinders , which have been found there . The tin which she brought from the Cassiterides she distributed generally , for she did not discourage her colonists from manufacturing for themselves to some extent . There was probably no colony which did not make its own bronze vessels of the commoner sort and its own coarser pottery . In her trade with the nations who peopled the coasts of the Mediterranean , the Propontis , and the Black Sea , Phoenicia aimed primarily at disposing to advantage of her own commodities , secondarily at making a profit in commodities which she had obtained from other countries , and thirdly on obtaining commodities which she might dispose of to advantage elsewhere . Where the nations were uncivilised , or in a low condition of civilisation , she looked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate with all the simplest conveniences of life , with their pottery , their implements and utensils , their clothes , their arms , the ornaments of their persons and of their houses . Underselling the native producers , she soon obtained a monopoly of this kind of trade , drove the native products out of the market , and imposed her own instead , much as the manufacturers of Manchester , Birmingham , and the Potteries impose their calicoes , their cutlery , and their earthenware on the savages of Africa and Polynesia . Where culture was more advanced , as in Greece and parts of Italy , 998 she looked to introduce , and no doubt succeeded in introducing , the best of her own productions , fabrics of crimson , violet , and purple , painted vases , embossed paterae , necklaces , bracelets , rings  --  " cunning work " of all manner of kinds999  --  mirrors , glass vessels , and smelling-bottles . At the same time she also disposed at a profit of many of the wares that she had imported from foreign countries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Egypt , Babylonia , Assyria , possibly India . The muslins and ivory of Hindustan , the shawls of Kashmir , the carpets of Babylon , the spices of Araby the Blest , the pearls of the Persian Gulf , the faience and the papyrus of Egypt , would be readily taken by the more civilised of the Western nations , who would be prepared to pay a high price for them . They would pay for them partly , no doubt , in silver and gold , but to some extent also in their own manufactured commodities , Attica in her ceramic products , Corinth in her " brass , " Etruria in her candelabra and engraved mirrors , 9100 Argos in her highly elaborated ornaments. 9101 Or , in some cases , they might make return out of the store wherewith nature had provided them , Euboea rendering her copper , the Peloponnese her " purple , " Crete her timber , the Cyrenaica its silphium . Outside the Pillars of Hercules the Phoenicians had only savage nations to deal with , and with these they seem to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either peculiarly valuable or scarcely procurable elsewhere . Their trade with the Scilly Islands and the coast of Cornwall was especially for the procuring of tin . Of all the metals , tin is found in the fewest places , and though Spain seems to have yielded some anciently , 9102 yet it can only have been in small quantities , while there was an enormous demand for tin in all parts of the old world , since bronze was the material almost universally employed for arms , tools , implements , and utensils of all kinds , while tin is the most important , though not the largest , element in bronze . From the time that the Phoenicians discovered the Scilly Islands  --  the " Tin Islands " ( Cassiterides ) , as they called them  --  it is probable that the tin of the civilised world was almost wholly derived from this quarter . Eastern Asia , no doubt , had always its own mines , and may have exported tin to some extent , in the remoter times , supplying perhaps the needs of Egypt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stores of the metal which our own islands possess were laid open , and the Phoenicians with their extensive commercial dealings , both in the West and in the East , became interested in diffusing it , British tin probably drove all other out of use , and obtained the monopoly of the markets wherever Phoenician influence prevailed . Hence the trade with the Cassiterides was constant , and so highly prized that a Phoenician captain , finding his ship followed by a Roman vessel , preferred running it upon the rocks to letting a rival nation learn the secret of how the tin-producing coast might be approached in safety. 9103 With the tin it was usual for the merchants to combine a certain amount of lead and a certain quantity of skins or hides ; while they gave in exchange pottery , salt , and articles in bronze , such as arms , implements , and utensils for cooking and for the table. 9104 If the Phoenicians visited , as some maintain that they did , 9105 the coasts of the Baltic , it must have been for the purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waters of that land-locked sea , and at present especially abounds on the shore in the vicinity of Dantzic . It is very scarce elsewhere . The Phoenicians seem to have made use of amber in their necklaces from a very early date ; 9106 and , though they might no doubt have obtained it by land-carriage across Europe to the head of the Adriatic , yet their enterprise and their commercial spirit were such as would not improbably have led them to seek to open a direct communication with the amber-producing region , so soon as they knew where it was situated . The dangers of the German Ocean are certainly not greater than those of the Atlantic ; and if the Phoenicians had sufficient skill in navigation to reach Britain and the Fortunate Islands , they could have found no very serious difficulty in penetrating to the Baltic . On the other hand , there is no direct evidence of their having penetrated so far , and perhaps the Adriatic trade may have supplied them with as much amber as they needed . The trade of the Phoenicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objects the procuring of ivory , of elephant , lion , leopard , and deer-skins , and probably of gold . Scylax relates that there was an established trade in his day ( about B.C. 350 ) between Phoenicia and an island which he calls Cerne , probably Arguin , off the West African coast . " The merchants , " he says , 9107 " who are Phoenicians , when they have arrived at Cerne , anchor their vessels there , and after having pitched their tents upon the shore , proceed to unload their cargo , and to convey it in smaller boats to the mainland . The dealers with whom they trade are Ethiopians ; and these dealers sell to the Phoenicians skins of deer , lions , panthers , and domestic animals  --  elephants ' skins also , and their teeth . The Ethiopians wear embroidered garments , and use ivory cups as drinking Phoenicians convey to them ointment , elaborate vessels from Egypt , castrated swine ( ? ) , and Attic pottery and cups . These last they commonly purchase in Athens at the Feast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinkers of milk ; they make also much wine from the vine ; and the Phoenicians , too , supply some wine to them . They have a considerable city , to which the Phoenicians sail up . " The river on which the city stood was probably the Senegal . It will be observed that Scylax says nothing in this passage of any traffic for gold . We can scarcely suppose , however , that the Phoenicians , if they penetrated so far south as this , could remain ignorant of the fact that West Africa was a gold-producing country , much less that , being aware of the fact , they would fail to utilise it . Probably they were the first to establish that " dumb commerce " which was afterwards carried on with so much advantage to themselves by the Carthaginians , and whereof Herodotus gives so graphic an account . " There is a country , " he says , 9108 " in Libya , and a nation , beyond the Pillars of Hercules , which the Carthaginians are wont to visit , where they no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having disposed them after an orderly fashion along the beach , there leave them , and returning aboard their ships , raise a great smoke . The natives , when they see the sample , come down to the shore , and laying out to view so much gold as they think the wares are worth , withdraw to a distance . The Carthaginians upon this come ashore again and look . If they think the gold to be enough , they take it and go their way ; but if it does not seem to them sufficient , they go aboard ship once more , and wait patiently . Then the others approach and add to their gold , till the Carthaginians are satisfied . Neither party deals unfairly by the other : for they themselves never touch the gold till it comes up to the worth of their goods , nor do the natives ever carry off the goods until the gold has been taken away . " The nature of the Phoenician trade with the Canaries , or Fortunate Islands , is not stated by any ancient author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been worth the Phoenicians ' while to convey timber to Syria from such a distance , or we might imagine the virgin forests of the islands attracting them. 9109 The large breed of dogs from which the Canaries derived their later name9110 may perhaps have constituted an article of export even in Phoenician times , as we know they did later , when we hear of their being conveyed to King Juba ; 9111 but there is an entire lack of evidence on the subject . Perhaps the Phoenicians frequented the islands less for the sake of commerce than for that of watering and refitting the ships engaged in the African trade , since the natives were less formidable than those who inhabited the mainland. 9112 There was one further direction in which the Phoenicians pushed their maritime trade , not perhaps continuously , but at intervals , when their political relations were such as to give them access to the sea which washed Asia on the south and on the southeast . The nearest points at which they could embark for the purpose of exploring or utilising the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the two deep gulfs known as the Persian and the Arabian . It has been thought by some9113 that there were times in their history when the Phoenicians had the free use of both these gulfs , and could make the starting-point of their eastern explorations and trading voyages either a port on one of the two arms into which the Red Sea divides towards the north , or a harbour on the Persian Gulf near its north-western extremity . But the latter supposition rests upon grounds which are exceedingly unsafe and uncertain . That the Phoenicians migrated at some remote period from the shores of the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean may be allowed to be highly probable ; but that , after quitting their primitive abodes and moving off nearly a thousand miles to the westward , they still maintained a connection with their early settlements and made them centres for a trade with the Far East , is as improbable a hypothesis as any that has ever received the sanction of men of learning and repute . The Babylonians , through whose country the connection must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturally keep the Arabian and Indian traffic in their own hands ; nor can we imagine them as brooking the establishment of a rival upon their shores . The Arabians were more friendly ; but they , too , would have disliked to share their carrying trade with a foreign nation . And the evidence entirely fails to show that the Phoenicians , from the time of their removal to the Mediterranean , ever launched a vessel in the Persian Gulf , or had any connection with the nations inhabiting its shores , beyond that maintained by the caravans which trafficked by land between the Phoenician cities and the men of Dedan and Babylon. 9114 It was otherwise with the more western gulf . There , certainly , from time to time , the Phoenicians launched their fleets , and carried on a commerce which was scarcely less lucrative because they had to allow the nations whose ports they used a participation in its profits . It is not impossible that , occasionally , the Egyptians allowed them to build ships in some one or more of their Red Sea ports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a trade which may have proceeded beyond the Straits of Babelmandeb and possibly have reached Zanzibar and Ceylon . At any rate , we know that , in the time of Solomon , two harbours upon the Red Sea were open to them  --  viz. Eloth and Ezion-Geber  --  both places situated in the inner recess of the Elanitic Gulf , or Gulf of Akaba , the more eastern of the two arms into which the Red Sea divides . David 's conquest of Edom had put these ports into the possession of the Israelites , and the friendship between Hiram and Solomon had given the Phoenicians free access to them . It was the ambition of Solomon to make the Israelites a nautical people , and to participate in the advantages which he perceived to have accrued to Phoenicia from her commercial enterprise . Besides sharing with the Phoenicians in the trade of the Mediterranean , 9115 he constructed with their help a fleet at Ezion-Geber upon the Red Sea , 9116 and the two allies conjointly made voyages to the region , or country , called Ophir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and almug-wood. 9117 Ophir is , properly speaking , a portion of Arabia , 9118 and Arabia was famous for its production of gold , 9119 and also for its precious stones. 9120 Whether it likewise produced almug-trees is doubtful ; 9121 and it is quite possible that the joint fleet went further than Ophir proper , and obtained the " almug-wood " from the east coast of Africa , or from India . The Somauli country might have been as easily reached as South-eastern Arabia , and if India is considerably more remote , yet there was nothing to prevent the Phoenicians from finding their way to it. 9122 We have , however , no direct evidence that their commerce in the Indian Ocean ever took them further than the Arabian coast , about E. Long . 55 ? . CHAPTER X  --  MINING Surface gathering of metals , anterior to mining  --  Earliest known mining operations  --  Earliest Phoenician mining in Phoenicia Proper  --  Mines of Cyprus  --  Phoenician mining in Thasos and Thrace  --  in Sardinia  --  in Spain  --  Extent of the metallic treasures there  --  Phoenician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shafts , adits , and galleries  --  Roof of mines propped or arched  --  Ores crushed , pounded , and washed  --  Use of quicksilver unknown  --  Mines worked by slave labour . The most precious and useful of the metals lie , in many places , so near the earth 's surface that , in the earliest times , mining is unneeded and therefore unpractised . We are told that in Spain silver was first discovered in consequence of a great fire , which consumed all the forests wherewith the mountains were clothed , and lasted many days ; at the end of which time the surface of the soil was found to be intersected by streams of silver from the melting of the superficial silver ore through the intense heat of the conflagration . The natives did not know what to do with the metal , so they bartered it away to the Phoenician traders , who already frequented their country , in return for some wares of very moderate value. 101 Whether this tale be true or no , it is certain that even at the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " valuable metals often show themselves on the surface of the soil , either in the form of metalliferous earths , or of rocks which shine with spangles of a metallic character , or occasionally , though rarely , of actual masses of pure ore , sometimes encrusted with an oxide , sometimes bare , bright , and unmistakable . In modern times , whenever there is a rush into any gold region  --  whether California , or Australia , or South Africa  --  the early yield is from the surface . The first comers scratch the ground with a knife or with a pick-axe , and are rewarded by discovering " nuggets " of greater or less dimensions ; the next flight of gold-finders search the beds of the streams ; and it is not until the supply from these two sources begins to fail that mining , in the proper sense of the term , is attempted . The earliest mining operations , whereof we have any record , are those conducted by the Egyptian kings of the fourth , fifth and twelfth dynasties , in the Sinaitic region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mount Sinai , now known as the Wady Magharah and Sarabit-el-Khadim , copper was extracted from the bosom of the earth by means of shafts laboriously excavated in the rocks , under the auspices of these early Pharaohs. 102 Hence at the time of the Exodus the process of mining was familiar to the Hebrews , who could thus fully appreciate the promise , 103 that they were about to be given " a good land "  --  " a land whose stones were iron , and out of whose hills they might dig brass . " The Phoenicians , probably , derived their first knowledge of mining from their communications with the Egyptians , and no doubt first practised the art within the limits of their own territory  --  in Lebanon , Casius , and Bargylus . The mineral stores of these regions were , however , but scanty , and included none of the more important metals , excepting iron . The Phoenicians were thus very early in their history driven afield for the supply of their needs , and among the principal causes of their first voyages of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regions which contained the metallic treasures wherein their own proper country was deficient . It is probable that they first commenced mining operations on a large scale in Cyprus . Here , according to Pliny , 104 copper was first discovered ; and though this may be a fable , yet here certainly it was found in great abundance at a very early time , and was worked to such an extent , that the Greeks knew copper , as distinct from bronze , by no other name than that of khalkos Kuprios , whence the Roman AEs Cyprium , and our own name for the metal . The principal mines were in the southern mountain range , near Tamasus , 105 but there were others also at Amathus , Soli , and Curium. 106 Some of the old workings have been noticed by modern travellers , particularly near Soli and Tamasus , 107 but they have neither been described anciently nor examined scientifically in modern times . The ore from which the metal was extracted is called chalcitis by Pliny , 108 and may have been the " chalcocite " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ containing very nearly eighty per cent . of copper . The brief account which Strabo gives of the mines of Tamasus shows that the ore was smelted in furnaces which were heated by wood fires . We gather also from Strabo that Tamasus had silver mines . That the Phoenicians conducted mining operations in Thasos we know from Herodotus , 109 and from other writers of repute1010 we learn that they extended these operations to the mainland opposite . Herodotus had himself visited Thasos , and tells us that the mines were on the eastern coast of the island , between two places which he calls respectively AEnyra and Coenyra . The metal sought was gold , and in their quest of it the Phoenicians had , he says , turned an entire mountain topsy-turvy . Here again no modern researches seem to have been made , and nothing more is known than that at present the natives obtain no gold from their soil , do not seek for it , and are even ignorant that their island was ever a gold-producing region. 1011 The case is almost the same on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mines both of gold and silver abounded , 1012 which the Phoenicians are said to have worked , but where at the present day mining enterprise is almost at a standstill , and only a very small quantity of silver is produced. 1013 Sardinia can scarcely have been occupied by the Phoenicians for anything but its metals . The southern and south-western parts of the island , where they made their settlements , were rich in copper and lead ; and the position of the cities seems to indicate the intention to appropriate these metals . In the vicinity of the lead mines are enormous heaps of scoriae , mounting up apparently to a very remote era. 1014 The scoriae are not so numerous in the vicinity of the copper mines , but " pigs " of copper have been found in the island , unlike any of the Roman period , which are perhaps Phoenician , and furnish specimens of the castings into which the metal was run , after it had been fused and to some extent refined . The weight of the pigs is from twenty-eight to thirty-seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they are less frequent . But all the other mining operations of the Phoenicians were insignificant compared with those of which the theatre was Spain . Spain was the Peru of the ancient world , and surpassed its modern rival , in that it produced not only gold and silver , but also copper , iron , tin , and lead . Of these metals gold was the least abundant . It was found , however , as gold dust in the bed of the Tagus ; 1016 and there were mines of it in Gallicia , 1017 in the Asturias , and elsewhere . There was always some silver mixed with it , but in one of the Gallician mines the proportion was less than three per cent . Elsewhere the proportion reached to ten or even twelve and a half per cent. ; and , as there was no known mode of clearing the gold from it , the produce of the Gallician mine was in high esteem and greatly preferred to that of any other . Silver was yielded in very large quantities . " Spain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and most plentiful silver from mines of all the world . " " The Spanish silver , " says Pliny , 1019 " is the best . " When the Phoenicians first visited Spain , they found the metal held in no esteem at all by the natives . It was the common material of the cheapest drinking vessels , and was readily parted with for almost anything that the merchants chose to offer . Much of it was superficial , but the veins were found to run to a great depth ; and the discovery of one vein was a sure index of the near vicinity of more. 1020 The out-put of the Spanish silver mines during the Phoenician , Carthaginian , and Roman periods was enormous , and can not be calculated ; nor has the supply even yet failed altogether . The iron and copper of Spain are also said to have been exceedingly abundant in ancient times , 1021 though , owing to the inferior value of the metals , and to their wider distribution , but little is recorded with regard to them . Its tin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metals found in comparatively few localities , receive not infrequent mention . The Spanish tin , according to Posidonius , did not crop out upon the surface , 1022 but had to be obtained by mining . It was produced in some considerable quantity in the country of the Artabri , to the north of Lusitania , 1023 as well as in Lusitania itself , and in Gallicia ; 1024 but was found chiefly in small particles intermixed with a dark sandy earth . Lead was yielded in greater abundance ; it was found in Cantabria , in Baetica , and many other places. 1025 Much of it was mixed with silver , and was obtained in the course of the operations by means of which silver was smelted and refined. 1026 The mixed metal was called galena. 1027 Lead , however , was also found , either absolutely pure , 1028 or so nearly so that the alloy was inappreciable , and was exported in large quantities , both by the Phoenicians and the Carthaginians , and also by the Romans . It was believed that the metal had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine was deserted for a while and then re-opened , it was sure to be found more productive than it was previously. 1029 The fact seems to be simply that the supply is inexhaustible , since even now Spain furnishes more than half the lead that is consumed by the rest of Europe . Besides the ordinary metals , Spain was capable of yielding an abundance of quicksilver ; 1030 but this metal seems not to have attracted the attention of the Phoenicians , who had no use for it . The methods employed by the Phoenicians to obtain the metals which they coveted were not , on the whole , unlike those which continue in use at the present day . Where surface gold was brought down by the streams , the ground in their vicinity , and such portions of their beds as could be laid bare , were searched by the spade ; any earth or sand that was seen to be auriferous was carefully dug out and washed , till the earthy particles were cleared away , and only the gold remained . Where the metal lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a greater or less depth  --  sometimes , if we may believe Diodorus , 1031 to the depth of half a mile or more ; from these shafts horizontal adits were carried out at various levels , and from the adits there branched lateral galleries , sometimes at right angles , sometimes obliquely , which pursued either a straight or a tortuous course. 1032 The veins of metal were perseveringly followed up , and where faults occurred in them , filled with trap , 1033 or other hard rock , the obstacle was either tunnelled through or its flank turned , and the vein still pursued on the other side . As the danger of a fall of material from the roofs of the adits and galleries was well understood , it was customary to support them by means of wooden posts , or , where the material was sufficiently firm , to arch them. 1034 Still , from time to time , falls would occur , with great injury and loss of life to the miners . Nor was there much less danger where a mountain was quarried for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ galleries were driven into the mountain-side , and portions of it so loosened that after a time they detached themselves and fell with a loud crash into a mass of debris. 1035 It sometimes happened that , as the workings proceeded , subterranean springs were tapped , which threatened to flood the mine , and put an end to its further utilisation . In such cases , wherever it was possible , tunnels were constructed , and the water drained off to a lower level. 1036 In the deeper mines this , of course , could not be done , and such workings had to be abandoned , until the invention of the Archimedes ' screw ( ab . B.C. 220-190 ) , when the water was pumped up to the surface , and so got rid of. 1037 But before this date Phoenicia had ceased to exist as an independent country , and the mines that had once been hers were either no longer worked , or had passed into the hands of the Romans or the Carthaginians . When the various ores were obtained , they were first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , by frequent washings , the non-metallic elements were to a large extent eliminated , and the metallic ones alone left . These , being collected , were placed in crucibles of white clay , 1038 which were then submitted to the action of a furnace heated to the melting point . This point could only be reached by the use of the bellows . When it was reached , the impurities which floated on the top of the molten metal were skimmed off , or the metal itself allowed , by the turning of a cock , to flow from an upper crucible into a lower one . For greater purity the melting and skimming process was sometimes repeated ; and , in the case of gold , the skimmings were themselves broken up , pounded , and again submitted to the melting pot. 1039 The use of quicksilver , however , being unknown , the gold was never wholly freed from the alloy of silver always found in it , nor was the silver ever wholly freed from an alloy of lead. 1040 The Romans and Carthaginians worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painful pictures are drawn of the sufferings undergone by the unhappy victims of a barbarous and wasteful system. 1041 The gangs of slaves , we are told , remained in the mines night and day , never seeing the sun , but living and dying in the murky and foetid atmosphere of the deep excavations . It can scarcely be hoped that the Phoenicians were wiser or more merciful . They had a large command of slave labour , and would naturally employ it where the work to be done was exceptionally hard and disagreeable . Moreover , the Carthaginians , their colonists , are likely to have kept up the system , whatever it was , which they found established on succeeding to the inheritance of the Phoenician mines , and the fact that they worked them by means of slaves makes it more than probable that the Phoenicians had done so before them. 1042 When the metals were regarded as sufficiently cleansed from impurities , they were run into moulds , which took the form of bars , pigs , or ingots . Pigs of copper and lead have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may well belong to Phoenician times . There is also in the museum of Truro a pig of tin , which , as it differs from those made by the Romans , Normans , and later workers , has been supposed to be Phoenician. 1043 Ingots of gold and silver have not at present been found on Phoenician localities ; but the Persian practice , witnessed to by Herodotus , 1044 was probably adopted from the subject nation , which confessedly surpassed all the others in the useful arts , in commerce , and in practical sagacity . CHAPTER XI  --  RELIGION Strength of the religious sentiment among the Phoenicians  - -  Proofs  --  First stage of the religion , monotheistic  --  Second stage , a polytheism within narrow limits  --  Worship of Baal  - -  of Ashtoreth  --  of El or Kronos  --  of Melkarth  --  of Dagon  --  of Hadad  --  of Adonis  --  of Sydyk  --  of Esmun  --  of the Cabeiri  --  of Onca  --  of Tanith  --  of Beltis  --  Third stage marked by introduction of foreign deities  --  Character of the Phoenician worship  --  Altars and sacrifice  --  Hymns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevalence of human sacrifice and of licentious orgies  --  Institution of the Galli  --  Extreme corruption of the later religion  --  Views held on the subject of a future life  --  Piety of the great mass of the people earnest , though mistaken . There can be no doubt that the Phoenicians were a people in whose minds religion and religious ideas occupied a very prominent place . Religiousness has been said to be one of the leading characteristics of the Semitic race ; 0111 and it is certainly remarkable that with that race originated the three principal religions , two of which are the only progressive religions , of the modern world . Judaism , Christianity , and Mohammedanism all arose in Western Asia within a restricted area , and from nations whose Semitic origin is unmistakable . The subject of ethnic affinities and differences , of the transmission of qualities and characteristics , is exceedingly obscure ; but , if the theory of heredity be allowed any weight at all , there should be no difficulty in accepting the view that particular races of mankind have special leanings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not rest on any a priori arguments , or considerations of what is likely to have been . Here was a nation among whom , in every city , the temple was the centre of attraction , and where the piety of the citizens adorned every temple with abundant and costly offerings . The monarchs who were at the head of the various states showed the greatest zeal in continually maintaining the honour of the gods , repaired and beautified the sacred buildings , and occasionally added to their kingly dignity the highly esteemed office of High Priest. 0112 The coinage of the country bore religious emblems , 0113 and proclaimed the fact that the cities regarded themselves as under the protection of this or that deity . Both the kings and their subjects bore commonly religious names  --  names which designated them as the worshippers or placed them under the tutelage of some god or goddess . Abd-alonim , Abdastartus , Abd-osiris , Abdemon ( which is properly Abd-Esmun ) , Abdi-milkut , were names of the former kind , Abi-baal ( = " Baal is my father " ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , Baleazar or Baal-azur ( = " Baal protects " ) , names of the latter . The Phoenician ships carried images of the gods0114 in the place of figure-heads . Wherever the Phoenicians went , they bore with them their religion and their worship ; in each colony they planted a temple or temples , and everywhere throughout their wide dominion the same gods were worshipped with the same rites and with the same observances . In considering the nature of the Phoenician religion , we must distinguish between its different stages . There is sufficient reason to believe that originally , either when they first occupied their settlements upon the Mediterranean or before they moved from their primitive seats upon the shores of the Persian Gulf , the Phoenicians were Monotheists . We must not look for information on this subject to the pretentious work which Philo of Byblus , in the first or second century of our era , put forth with respect to the " Origines " of his countrymen , and attributed to Sanchoniatho ; 0115 we must rather look to the evidence of language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but which can not well be forged or falsified . These will show us that in the earliest times the religious sentiment of the Phoenicians acknowledged only a single deity  --  a single mighty power , which was supreme over the whole universe . The names by which they designated him were El , " great ; " Ram or Rimmon , " high ; " Baal , " Lord ; " Melek or Molech , " King ; " Eliun , " Supreme ; " Adonai , " My Lord ; " Bel-samin , " Lord of Heaven , " and the like. 0116 Distinct deities could no more be intended by such names as these than by those under which God is spoken of in the Hebrew Scriptures , several of them identical with the Phoenician names  --  El or Elohim , " great ; " Jehovah , " existing ; " Adonai , " my Lord ; " Shaddai , " strong ; " El Eliun , 0117 " the supreme Great One . " How far the Phoenicians actually realised all that their names properly imply , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a material nature , whether they viewed Him as the Creator , as well as the Lord , of the world , are problems which it is impossible , with the means at present at our disposal , to solve . But they certainly viewed Him as " the Lord of Heaven , " 0118 and , if so , no doubt also as the Lord of earth ; they believed Him to be " supreme " or " the Most High ; " and they realised his personal relation to each one of his worshippers , who were privileged severally to address Him as Adonai  --  " my Lord . " It may be presumed that at this early stage of the religion there was no idolatry ; when One God alone is acknowledged and recognised , the feeling is naturally that expressed in the Egyptian hymn of praise  --  " He is not graven in marble ; He is not beheld ; His abode is unknown ; there is no building that can contain Him ; unknown is his name in heaven ; He doth not manifest his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this happy state of things did not  --  perhaps we may say , could not  --  in the early condition of the human intelligence , last long . Fallen man , left to himself , very soon corrupts his way upon the earth ; his hands deal with wickedness ; and , in a little while , " every imagination of the thoughts of his heart is only evil continually . " 1110 When he becomes conscious to himself of sin , he ceases to be able to endure the thought of One Perfect Infinite Being , omnipotent , ever-present , who reads his heart , who is " about his path , and about his bed , and spies out all his ways . " 1111 He instinctively catches at anything whereby he may be relieved from the intolerable burden of such a thought ; and here the imperfection of language comes to his aid . As he has found it impossible to express in any one word all that is contained in his idea of the Divine Being , he has been forced to give Him many names , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Being 's attributes . But in course of time these words have lost their force  --  their meaning has been forgotten  --  and they have come to be mere proper names , designative but not significative . Here is material for the perverted imagination to work upon . A separate being is imagined answering to each of the names ; and so the nomina become numina. 1112 Many gods are substituted for one ; and the idea of God is instantly lowered . The gods have different spheres . No god is infinite ; none is omnipotent , none omnipresent ; therefore none omniscient . The aweful , terrible nature of God is got rid of , and a company of angelic beings takes its place , none of them very alarming to the conscience . In its second stage the religion of Phoenicia was a polytheism , less multitudinous than most others , and one in which the several divinities were not distinguished from one another by very marked or striking features . At the head of the Pantheon stood a god and a goddess  --  Baal and Ashtoreth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1113 " the Lord of Heaven , " was compared by the Greeks to their Zeus , and by the Romans to their Jupiter . Mythologically , he was only one among many gods , but practically he stood alone ; he was the chief of the gods , the main object of worship , and the great ruler and protector of the Phoenician people . Sometimes , but not always , he had a solar character , and was represented with his head encircled by rays. 1114 Baalbek , which was dedicated to him , was properly " the city of the Sun , " and was called by the Greeks Heliopolis . The solar character of Baal is , however , far from predominant , and as early as the time of Josiah we find the Sun worshipped separately from him , 1115 no doubt under a different name . Baal is , to a considerable extent , a city god . Tyre especially was dedicated to him ; and we hear of the " Baal of Tyre " 1116 and again of the " Baal of Tarsus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generative principle in nature  --  " the god of the creative power , bringing all things to life everywhere . " 1118 Hence , " his statue rode upon bulls , for the bull was the symbol of generative power ; and he was also represented with bunches of grapes and pomegranates in his hand , " 1119 emblems of productivity . The sacred conical stones and pillars dedicated in his temples1120 may have had their origin in a similar symbolism . As polytheistic systems had always a tendency to enlarge themselves , Baal had no sooner become a separate god , distinct from El , and Rimmon , and Molech , and Adonai , than he proceeded to multiply himself , and from Baal became Baalim , 1121 either because the local Baals  --  Baal-Tzur , Baal-Sidon , Baal-Tars , Baal-Libnan , Baal-Hermon  --  were conceived of as separate deities , or because the aspects of Baal  --  Baal as Sun-God , Baal as Lord of Heaven , Baal as lord of flies , 1122 , &c.;  --  were so viewed , and grew to be distinct objects of worship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ammon , and worshipped as Baal-Hammon . Baal is known to have had temples at Baalbek , at Tyre , at Tarsus , at Agadir1123 ( Gades ) , in Sardinia , 1124 at Carthage , and at Ekron . Though not at first worshipped under a visible form , he came to have statues dedicated to him , 1125 which received the usual honours . Sometimes , as already observed , his head was encircled with a representation of the solar rays ; sometimes his form was assimilated to that under which the Egyptians of later times worshipped their Ammon . Seated upon a throne and wrapped in a long robe , he presented the appearance of a man in the flower of his age , bearded , and of solemn aspect , with the carved horn of a ram on either side of his forehead . Figures of rams also supported the arms of his throne on either side , and on the heads of these two supports his hands rested. 1126 The female deity whose place corresponded to that of Baal in the Phoenician Pantheon , and who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Ashtoreth or Astarte . As Baal was the embodiment of the generative principle in nature , so was Ashtoreth of the receptive and productive principle . She was the great nature-goddess , the Magna Mater , regent of the stars , queen of heaven , giver of life , //
