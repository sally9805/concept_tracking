txt The Republicans of Washington held a grand . ratification meeting this evening in the open air , in front of the City Hall . Previous to the speaking , a long procession passed along Pennsylvania-avenue and several other streets . In this procession were about 3,500 persons and several bands of ? music . Among those who bore torches or lanterns were the Veteran Boys in Blue , the Garfield and Arthur clubs of the city and the suburbs , and the State Republican organizations which exist in the city . The broad walks of Pennsylvania-avenue were crowded all along the line of march . Before the arrival of the speakers and procession a national salute was fired on Armory-square . It is estimated that 20,000 persons attended the meeting , and the crowd was so large that two overflow meetings were organized . The Hon. A. M. Clapp , of the Republican , presided over the main meeting , and introduced Secretary Sherman . The Secretary said that the magnificent audience before him was more telling than anything he could say would be . No portion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in the election of a Republican President than the people of Washington . After referring to the growth , prosperity , and vast improvements in this city under Republican rule , be said the same elements of material prosperity that have marked the growth of Washington have extended from ocean to ocean . He wanted , he said , to bring out strongly the marked contrast between the Republican and Democratic Parties . " The Republican Party is a national party . It loves the whole country . It loves every man , woman , and child in it , whatever the color of his skin . It is the Democratic Party which seeks to degrade . There is the great distinction between the Republican and Democratic Parties . Ours is the national party , with hearts broad enough to cover all the country . Theirs is a sectional party . We would make a national Government . They would make a confederacy of States . When this country was in danger , and rebels sought to break up this union of ours , the Republican Party to a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rebel army . No , not one . How marked is the contrast . There was not a Democrat in the South who did not go into the rebel army and the Democrats of the North sympathized with them . When the question arose whether this country should be a free country , it was the hand of the martyred President , whose marble image now confronts you , that struck off the shackles and said : All men shall be freed . ' When the life of the Nation was at stake and the Union endangered , the Republican Party rallied around the Union . There is the difference between the parties . " Speaking of the Homestead law , he said it was brought into life by the Republican Party after it had been vetoed by a Democratic Presdent . " We believe , " he said , " that we must protect industries , build up manufactures , and set the people at work and keep them employed . When the question of honest money arose it was the Republican Party which protected the interests of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks . They would not have national money because they said anything which was nationa was unconstitutional . But the Republican Party gave the country national money , and now that national money is as good as gold . Our bonds are worth more than those of any other country , with the possible exception of Great Britain . How was it in Democratic times ? Our bonds then paid 12 per cent . interest , and 20-year bonds were sold for 85 and 90 cents on the dollar . The heart of the Republican Party beats for liberty , for national honor and national glory . The Democratic Party is in favor of State rights , opposed to everything national , and in favor of State banks and everything bad . " Referring to the Republican candidate for the Presidency , Secretary Sherman said he had known him for more than 20 years . He sprang from the people . He was educated in a hard school , and step by step he had pushed onward until he now occupies a place of the greatest distinction . He was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was better than all , a true Republican . Passing on to Gen. Hancock , the speaker referred to his education at the public expense , and said he had been fed at the public expense . He was a good military man , and if he would desert the Democratic Party , against which he has fought for four years , the Republicans would elect him to some respectable office . When the two candidates were compared the comparison was in favor of Garfield . Secretary Sherman closed by calling for " three good , rousing , Western cheers for Garfield and Arthur , " which were duly given . Among the other speakers were Prof. Greener , of Howard University ; the Hon. R. E. Fenton , and the Hon. S. S. Burdette . The Hon. A. G. Riddle , instead of a promised speech , addressed the meeting through a letter . After speaking of the intimate relations of the District and the general Government , he presented the claims of the two great parties . " We , the Republicans , " he said , " are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last 19 years  --  and these Democrats come and demand that we shall hand it over to them . Who and what are we that we should give up the Republic to the Democrats ? We rescued the broken , plundered Government from those who deliberately attempted to desttoy it 20 years ago , and that is why we came to have it . Did the Democrats as a party help us ? Who says they did ? Did they help us during those four years of war ? Who dares say that ? Did not we overcome , one by one , all these great troubles since the war ? Did the Democrats help us do this ? Come , now , who dares say they did ? Did we not fund the debt  --  restore specie payment , without their help , in spite of them ? Who can deny these things ? Is not the present prosperity of the . country due to our measures ? Had the Nation not better remain in the hands of those who are its friends and who are governed by the spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North ? " Passing to the consideration of the standardbearers of the parties , Mr. Riddle said : " Who are the candidates , and how do they stand on these  --  on all great questions ? It may be , after all , that we should be beaten , because of the superior merits of the men proposed by the Democracy . Their candidate is a soldier , a warner , a General . He is nothing else . If we were in a great war , or expected to be , and he was our greatest General , we should elect him . We are not  --  do n't mean to be . Of what possible use is a warrior to us  --  a man who merely kills other men , is expert at that , and can do no other thmg well ? We have a better man for what we want of a President . Our candidate , lowly as he was born , humble as his early years were , the qualities which made him great wore all with and in him then . God was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went on and on and on , till that which was in him led him out and up , drew the eyes of men to him till the Nation caught its ray , and now asks it to light up the way of its own great onward march . This is our man ! He did not labor for applause , or fame , or thanks . He never sought them . He acted from an enlightened love of justice , of law , and an inborn sense of duty . These things show you what the man is . The South can trust confidingly in his sense of right and justice . His heart and nature are broad enough to embrace the whole Republic . His love and sympathy go out after every created thing . The South will come to know , trust , and love him , as does the North and West now . His personal magnetism is a sweat and real power in the campaign . Detraction will not weaken it ; of itself it would decide a doubtful issue . I do not believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proceedings of the meeting at 10:30 o'clock .
