txt A careful examination of the water - route from the mouth of Churchill River , on the west shore of Hudson 's Bay , to Europe by way of Hudson . Strait was begun last Fall by the observers who were taken to their stations in July by the steamship Neptune . This vessel left Halifax on July 22 and entered Hudson Strait on or about Aug. 1 . Having located the stations , she returned to St. John 's , passing out of the strait on or about Sept. 27 . This year the stations will be visited by the Alert , and she will leave Halifax next week . The observers , who have been in the north for nearly a year , are to be brought home , but their places will be filled by others . The Alert will probably reach Hudson Strait as early as June 10 . On that date the bay will be open , but it is probable that the strait will not become navigable until some weeks later . The reports to be made by the-observers , together with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward showing . conclusively whether or not the Hudson 's Bay route can be profitably used for the ; transportation of grain from the Manitoba . . region to Europe . It seems to have been proved that the harbors on . the west shore that would be used by shippers  --  York Factory , at the mouth of the Nelson River , and Fort Churchill , at the mouth of the Churchill  --  are open for navigation for at least five months in the year . The great bay itself can be ? navigated without difficulty or danger during the same months . If the outletto the ocean were at a ' latitude as low as that of the southern extremity of the bay , the Hudson 's Bay route would soon be in use . Unfortunately , the only outlet is Hudson Strait , in the latitude of Southern Greenland . This passage is blocked with ice for a great part of the year . For how many ' months could it be navigated by a grain fleet ? This is the question for - which the Dominion Government has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem in which Manitoba , and the whole Northwest are so deeply interested depends upon what can be done in this strait , and for this reason all of the stations with one , exception werelocated on the shores of the strait or upon . islands in the passage . At its ocean outlet Hudson Strait is narrow , and at a point not far from its western extremity Fox Channel enters it from the north , bringing down huge masses of ice . The . Neptune passed through the strait without much difficulty in August and in September . She encountered no icebergs in the great inland sea , but there were many in the strait . Yet they were not regarded by Lieut . GORDON as more formidable than the icebergs encountered in the Strait of Belle Isle . In some parts of the strait there was an abundance of field ice , but the Neptune was not greatly retarded by it . The greatest obstacles were found near the entrance of Fox Channel , where , upon one side of the strait , there were sheets of solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just where it lay . The hasty examination made by the Neptune 's officers indicated that if it should be necessary to give up the project , the abandonment of it would be due to this ice at the western end of the strait , where the colder waters of the Arctio flow southward from Fox Channel . As for weather , the observations made last August seemed to prove that Hudson Strait presented no difficulties that are not encountered in the Strait of Belle Isle . If it should be found that Hudson Strait can be navigated by grain vessels for four or even three months in each year , the Government and the farmers will then ask whether it will pay to build and operate railroads from Winnipeg and the Northwest to Fort Churchill , if these roads must depend almost entirely upon shipments of grain during so small a part of the year . The Alert will carry two or three representatives of the company that proposes to build a railway from Winnipeg . Whatever shall be the result of the inquiry as regards the use of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in exploration and observations will be a good investment for the people of the Dominion .
