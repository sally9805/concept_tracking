STATES . IT can not be undesirable that the people of the United States should make themselves acquainted with the commercial policy of a people with whom they carry on an extensive commerce , and whose railroads and canals are used for the transportation of United States products in common with their own . The modern policy of Great Britain toward her colonies and dependencies is so widely different from what it was within the last half-century , that it is doubtful whether the people of the United States realize the fact that Canada is practically an independent nation , enjoying a system of government which , it may be safely affirmed , gives as much general satisfaction to its inhabitants as any that could be devised . It would be strange indeed if in a country where the utmost freedom of discussion is permitted , and which adjoins a great nation like the United States , there were no individuals entertaining a preference for republican institutions , and more especially when it is borne in mind that many influential inhabitants of our principal cities have either themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens of that country . It is , however , worthy of notice that any dissatisfaction which has been expressed with the political state of Canada has been based , not on the imperfection of the system of government , but on the obstructions to free commercial intercourse which have existed since the abrogation of the treaty of reciprocity negotiated in the year 1854 . Since the termination of that treaty agitators have , from time to time , endeavored to create disaffection among the people by representing the advantages that would result from a commercial union , which they maintain is unattainable so long as the Canadian Dominion is a dependency of Great Britain . Ample proof can be given that the untiring efforts of the few , who have endeavored to create dis // affection , have been wholly unavailing , but it is likewise desirable to convince the people of the United States that for many years Canada has enjoyed practical independence . This fact has been conceded by a writer ( Mr. Goldwin Smith ) who has no confidence in the stability of its existing institutions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " in the London " Fortnightly Review " of April , 1878 , the following passages occur : " Self-government is independence ; perfect self-government is perfect independence ; and all the questions that arise between Ottawa and Downing Street , including the recent question about appeals , are successively settled in favor of self-government . . . . In Canada , government being parliamentary and constitutional , monarchy is the delegation of a shadow . . Canada , though adorned with the paraphernalia of eight constitutional monarchies ( one central and seven provincial ) is a democracy of the most pronounced kind ; the Governor-General was not wrong in saying that she is more democratic than the United States , where the President is an elective king , and where the Senate , which , though elective is conservative , possesses great power , whereas the nominated Senate of Canada is a cipher . " In the exercise of its self-governing powers , the Canadian Parliament has recently enacted a tariff which has created a good deal of dissatisfaction in Great Britain , while in the United States an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yetaliate against that country for its persistent refusal to entertain any measure for establishing reciprocal free trade between the two countries in products and manufactures which are natural to both . It can not be denied that such an inference might be drawn from statements made in the course of heated party discussions , but the impression is by no means strictly correct . In one or two instances , to which special reference will be made , the Canadian tariff may be deemed retaliatory , but when it is borne in mind that the duties are almost invariably the same on the products and manufactures of the United States as on those of Great Britain , against which country there is no ground whatever for retaliation , it ma*y fairly be urged that the United States can have no just ground of complaint against the Canadian tariff . In order to place the subject fairly before the people of the United States , reference must be made to the imports into Canada , and to the course of its trade with Great Britain and the United States . The last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1878 , and a fair comparison can be instituted between that // year and the one ending June 30 , 1875 , there having been no material difference in the tariff . It must be borne in mind that the bulk of Canadian imports are received from Great Britain and the United States , the proportions having been , in the year 1878 , from Great Britain $37,431,180 , from the United States $48,628,189 , and from all other countries $5,136,658 . Of the goods imported from the United States $25,163,686 were admitted free of dufy , and $23,468,053 at various rates of duty , while from Great Britain $5,291,397 were free and $32,139,783 were subjected to duty . In that year there were exports of the value of $11,164,878 not the produce of Canada , of which over $9,000,000 were agricultural products . Thus the liona fide free imports from the United States must be reduced to about $14,000,000. * In the year ending June 30 , 1875 , the aggregate imports from Great Britain were $60,347,067 , and from the United States $50,802,899 . The dutiable goods from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $22,023,665 , the free goods from Great Britain $11,107,948 , and from the United States $28,779,234 . On comparing the imports of 1875 and 1878 it will be found that there was a decrease of about seventeen millions of dutiable goods from Great Britain , while there was a decrease of a little over one million from the United States ; and , when the shrinkage in the value of goods is taken into consideration , there can be no doubt that there was a considerable increase in quantity in 1878 . The duties in 1875 were in the aggregate $15,354,616 , and in 1878 $12,795,693 . While such was the decrease in the principal branch of revenue , there was an increase in the interest and sinking fund of the public debt of nearly a million . The facts stated afford conclusive proof that it was absolutely necessary to obtain additional revenue , irrespective altogether of any question either of retalia * Since this article was in type the Canadian trade returns for the year ending June 30 , 1879 , have been laid before Parliament , and it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imports from Great Britain were $80,943,703 , of which $2 ' 7,026,210 were dutiable and $3,917,493 free .

From all other countries the imports were $5,609,259 , of which about , a million were free . The falling off in imports from 1858 was about $11,000,000 . The exports not the produce of Canada amounted to $8,355,644-chiefly agricultural products-which will reduce the free imports from the United States to $11,5 ' 7 ' 7,024 . On comparing the rcturns for 18b19 with those of 18 ' 78 , it will be found that In dutiable goods there was a decrease from Great Britain of $5,113,573 , and an increase from the United States of $218,306. // tion or protection . The decrease in the imports between lihe two years is to be accounted for chiefly by the shrinkage in values caused by the commercial depression , which was severely felt both in the United States and Canada . This depression was doubtless the cause of the proportionately largely increased imports from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industries in that country are similar to those of Canada , the competition was bitterly complained of by manufacturers who were completely excluded from the markets of the United States . The great extent of the home market of the United States enables the manufacturers of that country to produce goods cheaper than they can possibly be supplied in a country with such a limited demand as that of Canada . During the period between 1873 and 1878 the demand for protective duties became very general among large classes of the Canadian people . The Canadian Administration then in power was favorable to free trade so far as was consistent with levying customs duties on articles produced and manufactured in the country . Being desirous of establishing satisfactory commercial relations with the United States , it obtained the consent of the Government of Great Britain to th' opening of a fresh negotiation with the republic . Accordingly , early in the year 1874 , Sir Edward Thornton , the resident British Minister at Washington , and the Hon. George Brown , a Senator of the Dominion , were duly accredited as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and navigation with the United States . The negotiations at Washington in 1874 are but little known to the public in the United States , owing to the refusal of the Senate to entertain a proposal which , after much deliberation , and after numerous concessions on the part of the British Commissioners , had received the approval of the Governments of Great Britain , of the United States , and of Canada . In his speech in the Canadian Senate , on the subject of the negotiations , Senator Brown adverted to the alarm which had been created in the United States , owing entirely to the ignorance which prevailed as to the provisions of the contemplated treaty . He mentioned that there had been an excited meeting of New York druggists to denounce the injurious influence of the treaty on their trade , although not a single article in their business was touched by its provisions . The leading principle of the treaty of 1854 was that natural products of both countries , including agricultural products , animals , lumber , coal , ores , wool , etc. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the valuable privilege of fishing in Canadian waters was conceded to the United States . The desire of Canada was that the new treaty should be substantially the same as that of 1854 ; but , as a strong desire was expressed by the negotiators on the part of the United States that certain manufactures , supposed to be common to both countries , should be included , the British Coinniissioners consented to their demands , and accordingly a list of manufactures was agreed to which it may be interesting to specify . It included agricultural implements of all kinds , axles of all kinds , boots and shoes of leather , boot- and shoe-making machines , buffalo-robes dressed and trimmed , cotton grain-bags , cotton denims , cotton jeans unbleached , cotton drillings unbleached ; cotton plaids and tickings ; cottonnades unbleached ; cabinet ware and furniture or parts thereof ; carriages , carts , wagons , and other wheeled vehicles , and sleighs or parts thereof ; fire-engines or parts thereof ; felt covering for boilers ; gutta-percha belting and tubing ; iron - bar , hoop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrap ; iron nails , spikes , bolts , tacks , brads , or springs ; iron castings ; Indiarubber belting and tubing ; locomotives for railways or parts thereof ; lead , sheet or pig ; leather , sole or upper ; harness and saddlery ; mill or factory or steamboat fixed engines and machines , or parts thereof ; manufactures of marble , stone , slate , or granite , manufactures of wood solely , or of wood nailed , bound , hinged , or locked with metal materials ; mangles , washing-machines , wringingmachines , and drying-machines , or parts thereof ; printing-paper for newspapers , paper-making machines , or parts thereof ; printing-type , presses , and folders , paper-cutters , ruling-machines , page-numbering machines , and stereotyping and electrotyping apparatus , or parts thereof ; refrigerators , or parts thereof ; railroad cars , carriages , and trucks , or parts thereof ; satinets of wool and cotton ; steam-engines , or parts thereof ; steel , wrought or cast , and steel plates and rails ; tin tubes and piping ; tweeds of wool solely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It may safely be affirmed that Canada did not desire nor ask for the reciprocal free admission of a single article in the foregoing list . Qn the contrary , all the manufactures were being exported from the United States to Canada at duties varying from five to seventeen and a half per cent . ad valorem , but chiefly at the higher rate . The aggregate amount of the imports of those goods in 1878 was about three million dollars , and the duties about five hundred thousand dollars , an amount which the Canadian Trea // sury could badly afford to lose . When it became known in Canada that reciprocal free trade in natural products had only been obtained by the sacrifice of the manufacturing interests in addition to the fisheries , there was considerable alarm and indignation ; but it never occurred to any one that it would be justifiable to reject an arrangement deliberately , entered into by the two Governments . When it was subsequently ascertained that the Senate of the United States had refused even to consider the President 's message , it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of relief preponderated . When the Senate rejected the treaty negotiated in England by their own Minister for the settlement of the Alabama claims , the feeling was very similar , and was caused by a failure to give due weight to the difference in the two systems of government . In Canada , as in England , there is a government which , during its incumbency of office , is armed with substantial power , and may be almost said to be absolute in its negotiations with foreign powers . The particular transaction may be severely criticised , and the opposition may endeavor to influence public opinion in a direction hostile to the Government ; but a foreign Government , when dealing either with the Imperial , or any Colonial Government , may rest assured that any agreement made with a duly accredited agent will be scrupulously carried out . The republican system is one of checks , and the government of the day can only undertake to submit a treaty to the Senate accompanied by its recommendation . It would seem advisable , in the event of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of its own citizens who are favorable to freer commercial intercourse with Canada , that it should formulate a distinct proposition which the Canadian Government would at once accept or reject . The proposition to appoint commissioners to go over the ground again , after the failure of the negotiations between the Government of the United States and Sir Edward Thornton and Senator Brown , is not likely to be acceptable . The most formidable difficulty in the way of the satisfactory settlement of this question is that the majority of the States in the Union have no interest in it , and that the volume of trade between the United States and Canada would be so small in proportion to that of the former with other countries that it is felt to be undeserving of notice . The time , however , is approaching when it will be absolutely necessary to reconsider the whole subject , in connection with the termination of the present arrangement // regarding the fisheries . The dissatisfaction with the award of the arbitrators as to the value of the fishing privileges was very general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well known that those who rejected the draft treaty are responsible for it . An extract from Senator Brown 's speech in the Canadian Senate on this point may not be without interest : " Mr. Rothery , a distinguished English jurisconsult and Registrar of the High Court of Admiralty , arrived in Canada shortly before the , late Government left office in 1873 , as the duly appointed agent of the British Government to get up the case of Canada in the fishing arbitration provided for by these articles . I know nothing of what passed between either the late or the present Government and Mr. Rothery , while he was at Ottawa ; but in passing through Toronto , on his way to Washington , Mr. Rothery saw several prominent public men with a view to acquiring information as to the value of our seacoast fisheries and the best mode of collecting evidence to sustain our claim , and among them I had the honor to be included . I availed myself of the opportunity to express to Mr. Rothery my strong conviction that the submission to any three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our great sea-fisheries was exceedingly distasteful to the great mass of the Canadian people . I reminded him that Canada in 1854 conceded these fisheries to the United States for a term of years as part of a commercial arrangement between the two countries ; and I ventured to suggest how much better it would be were the same thing repeated now , and the concession of the fisheries merged in a general treaty of commercial reciprocity for a term of years and on a mutually advantageous basis . I expressed my belief to Mr. Rothery that if he could succeed in bringing this about he would confer a great benefit on both countries , and establish good relations between them for years to come , and that probably he might find the United States Government not disinclined to entertain the proposition . Who that owns a property of enormous value would voluntarily consent to dispose of it for a price to be determined by three persons of whose very names he was ignorant ? Would he not say : Let us dispense with arbitrators ; tell me the compensation you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will dispose of it ' ? Who can tell what view may be taken of our fisheries by the umpire selected by the Austrian Ambassador ? Would the Americans be satisfied if he gave an award equal to the great estimate that we place upon them ? And what would be the feeling of our people if // he named a sum much under their expectation ? Nay , in view of the vast annual value now drawn from the St. Lawrence fisheries  --  the exhaustless character of those fisheries  --  the rapidly increasing population of this continent dependent on them for daily supplies of fish  --  and the fact that there is no other fishery in the world to enter into competition with them-what greater folly could be imagined than to have a money value placed upon these at all ? Mr. Rothery went on to Washington , and some weeks after I had the pleasure of hearing from him that he had suggested the substitution of a general commercial treaty for the fishery arbitration , and there was some hope of its being favorably entertained . But meantime the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in February of last year I was informed by them that there was some movement in Washington in favor of a renewal of the old reciprocity treaty , and they were anxious I should visit that city unofficially and ascertain what were the prospects of success . I went immediately to Washington and had the advantage of discussing the subject with many of the prominent men of the republic . I heard a very general desire expressed for the establishment of better commercial relations with Canada if terms could be arranged to mutual satisfaction ; thi* I communicated to the Government on my return home . Of the official action that followed I have no personal knowledge , but on the 17th of March a commission was issued under the great seal of Great Britain , appointing Sir Edward Thornton and myself joint plenipotentiaries on the part of her Majesty to negotiate a treaty of fisheries , commerce , and navigation , with the Government of the United States . " It must be evident , on a perusal of the foregoing extract , that the Canadian Government spared no effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an award in money , and that there was no indisposition on the part of the Government of President Grant to meet the British Commissioners in a conciliatory spirit . Senator Brown bore ample testimony to the good faith of the President in the following words : " I take this opportunity of expressing my regret that heated partisans outside the walls of Parliament should have spoken of the attitude held by the United States Government in these negotiations as if it had been intended to delude or overreach . Nothing could be more unfounded or unjust . The President of the United States , the Secretary of State , and all the other distinguished persons who took an interest in the negotiations , with // hardly an exception , showed the most friendly feeling toward Canada , and a sincere desire to bring about more satisfactory commercial relations . True , they naturally enough looked at the question from their own point of view , and sought to get an advantageous arrangement for their own country ; but they never concealed or undervalued the difficulties that stood in the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country and the financial difficulties now pressing for adjustment may , in a great measure , be attributed the unfavorable advice in the matter recently given to the President by the Senate of the United States . " In describing the manner in which the negotiations proceeded , Senator Brown stated that the American Government suggested an enlargement of the scope of the old treaty , which was agreed to . Mr. Fish suggested the enlargement of the Canadian canals , and was at once assured that the Canadian Commissioners would treat for their enlargement . Mr. Fish likewise suggested the addition of manufactures to the free list , and this was acceded to , to the extent already stated . If the impressions made on Senator Brown 's mind were correct , the difficulties which existed in 1874 , and which he believed to have caused the unfavorable advice given by the Senate , have been entirely removed . The United States has since resumed specie payments , and there are no longer financial difficulties . It has been ascertained since 1874 that the fishing privileges are , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States has been willing to acknowledge . And yet it is not many years since the strongest testimony was given by United States Commissioners to the value of the fisheries . In Mr. J. D. Andrews 's report he says , " Without participation in the sea-fisheries near the shores of the colonies our deep-sea fisheries in that region will become valueless " ; and in the report of Mr. E. II . Derby he says , " Nearly one fourth of our fishing fleet , with a tonnage of 40,000 to 50,000 tons , worth $5,000,000 to $7,000,000 annually , fish near the three-mile line of the province . " It will be most unfortunate , having reference to the fishery award , if future negotiations for privileges which are indispensable to the United States should be conducted with reference to pecuniary considerations . And it may be hoped that it has been sufficiently established that the fisheries are of great value , and that the Canadians are fully aware that they are . Reference has been already made to the dissatisfaction which prevailed among influential classes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had yielded to the pressing demand of Mr. Fish that the various manufactures already specified should be included in the free list . Senator Brown did not fail to advert to this subject in the speech from which quotations have been already made . The following are the reasons which he assigned for consenting to it : " These articles were selected with a triple object . The first was , as I have already stated , that they should be articles of common daily use among the people or affecting the prosecution of our leading industries . The second was that they should be of such a character as to be difficult to smuggle across the lines , and easy of identification as the genuine production of Canada or the States , and the third was that they should be as far as possible the productions of branches of industry natural to Canada and the United States , and in which a considerable intertraffic between the two countries might reasonably be expected . And , if the list is carefully examined , I think it will be admitted that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more impolitic than the imposition of customs duties on such articles as these ! " The failure of the negotiations at Washington in 1874 gave increased influence to the advocates of protection in Canada , and the leaders of the Parliamentary opposition proclaimed themselves the advocates of what has since been termed a national policy . When the general election took place in the autumn of 1878 the Protectionist party received the support of a considerable majority , and its leader , Sir John A. Macdonald , was in due course called upon to form a government . During the ensuing session of Parliament the tariff , which has been made the subject of so much complaint , was enacted , though not without vehement protests from the opposition . It has been already pointed out that it was absolutely necessary to increase the duties in order to obtain more revenue , and it will be found that the tariff has been defended chiefly on the ground of necessity . In one of his speeches on the subject during the past autumn , the Minister of Finance , replying to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country , said : " Those that point to the increased taxes that were necessary for Parliament to impose keep out of sight the fact that for the past four years there was an average deficiency of two millions of dollars a year , that had to be met if our credit was to be maintained . Gentlemen , the Parliament of which I am a member decided that , whatever may have been the case in the past , these accumulated deficiencies must be met , that deficiencies must be stopped in the future , // and that the income and the expenditure must be made to balance . " It can not be alleged that the reason assigned by the Minister of Finance for introducing a new tariff was not justifiable , and there is much to be said in favor of many of the alterations that were made , which are in a great measure based on the principle of the tariff of the United States . A considerable portion of the Canadian revenue is obtained from duties on woolens , cottons , hardware , and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tariff was to substitute for the ad valorem duties others in which specific and ad valorem duties were combined . It can not be denied that the protection of native industries was kept constantly in view , but it is likewise certain that the imposition of specific duties was with the view of preventing the serious loss of revenue resulting from fluctuations in the value of goods , as well as from the frauds which are invariably perpetrated when there are very high ad valorem rates of duty . Another subject requires serious consideration Under the old tariff a number of articles used in manufactures were admitted either duty free or at low duties , and as , in order to obtain revenue , it became necessary to subject these articles to duty , it *was deemed only fair to increase the duties proportionately on the finished article . Among other articles on the free list was coal , and there has always been a strong desire in Canada that this natural product of both countries should be admitted into both free of duty . As , however , the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was difficult to avoid including that article among dutiable goods at a time when increased revenue was required . There is reason to believe that a considerable revenue will be obtained from it , but it can not be denied that it is an unpopular tax , and that it bears heavily on many of the manufacturers and on the railway and steamboat companies . This may be considered one of the retaliatory taxes , and the Government has taken authority to repeal it , and some other duties , if the United States can be induced to reciprocate . It has long been the policy of the United States to encourage the direct importation of tea from China and Japan by imposing an extra duty of 10 per cent . on teas imported from places situated westward of the Cape of Good Hope . Some years ago Canada adopted a similar policy , but during the administration of the Reform Government the countervailing duty was repealed , and all tea was placed on the same footing . In the last tariff the // former policy of Sir John A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is imposed by the United States on tea imported from Canada is placed by Canada on tea imported from the United States in addition to the duty on direct importations . This may be considered retaliatory , but it would be taken off at once if the United States would set the example . The sugar duties have been a prominent subject of discussion for several years . It was maintained by the Canadian sugar-refiners that , owing to the bounties granted by the United States on the export of refined sugar , it was impossible for them to compete with the foreign refiners , and their statements were borne out to some extent by the United States Government reports . After unavailing efforts to induce the Government to impose countervailing duties on sugar , which had received the drawback , the principal sugar-refinery in Montreal closed its business , and the consequence was that Canada was largely supplied with United States sugar prior to the present tariff coming into operation . Under that tariff the duty on sugar is a combined specific and ad valoreni rate , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long price . In consequence of this change , the Montreal refinery has been reopened for business , and there has been a revival of the direct trade with the West Indies , which had been almost completely abandoned . Of the manufactured articles on which increased duties have been imposed by the present tariff , the principal are manufactures of wool , cotton , iron , and steel . The old duty on woolen manufactures was 1 ' ? j per cent . ; under the present tariff there are a variety of rates , all not enumerated being admitted at 20 per cent . ad valorern , while the rate in the United States is 50 cents per pound and 35 per cent . Clothing , which is charged as high as any other description of woolens , is 10 cents per pound and 25 per cent. , while in the United States it is 50 cents per pound and 40 per cent . The old duty on cotton goods of all kinds was 17-i- per cent . ; the present one is 20 per cent . on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , drills , ducks , etc. , not stained , painted , or printed , the ad valorem rate has been placed at 15 per cent. , with a specific duty of one cent per square yard . On jeans , denims , drillings , etc. , 2 cents per yard and 15 per cent . On cotton wadding , batting , warps , etc. , not bleached , dyed , or colored , 3 cents per pound and 15 per cent. ; on cotton clothing , 30 per cent . The aggregate imports of cottons in 1878 were about $7,000,000 , of which about two thirds were re // ceived from Great Britain , and one third from the United States . The value of the cotton-wool imported into the Dominion was under $800,000 , so that the extent of the domestic manufactures may easily be estimated . Many of the articles subjected to specific duties will be found in the list which , at Secretary Fish 's request , Senator Brown had consented to place in the free list . There has been a considerable change in the duties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tariff , pig-iron , railroad bars , iron or steel chairs , and fishplates , car-axles , and frogs , were admitted duty free ; while bar and rod iron , hoop and sheet , blooms and billets , boiler-plate , bolts and spikes , nail and spike and scrap paid only 5 per cent . Locomotive-engine frames , axles , cranks , etc. , paid 10 per cent . Under the present tariff pig and scrap iron are placed at $2 per ton ; slabs , blooms , and billets at 14 per cent. ; stoves and castings 25 per cent. , and locomotives also 25 per cent . The highest rates are 30 per cent. , and the duties range between that and 14 . On a comparison of the Canadian duties on this branch of manufacture with those of the United States , it will be found that the latter are very much higher than the former . The duty on pig and scrap iron in Canada is $2 per ton , and in the United States $7 and $8 respectively ; on slabs and blooms in Canada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent . In regard to agricultural products prior to the enactment of the present tariff , all grain was admitted duty free into Canada , and authority is given to the Government by the present tariff to remove all duties imposed by it on such products whenever any measure of reciprocity shall be agreed to by the United States . The duties imposed are 15 cents on wheat against 20 cents in the United States ; 7-* cents on Indian corn , against 10 cents ; and 50 cents per barrel on flour , against 20 per cent . As the price of many of these products is regulated by the European demand , it is to be regretted that the carrying trade of the two countries should be obstructed by customs duties which are in a great degree inoperative . In the case of Indian corn the policy of the United States is inexplicable . Canada has been , and would continue to be , a large consumer of Indian corn under free imports , and there can be little doubt that the duty will interfere very much with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and none , probably , is imported into the United States . It has been sufficiently established that , whatever may be the // demerits of the Canadian tariff , it is not one of which the United States can justly complain , especially in view of its persistent refusal to renew a treaty for reciprocal free trade between the two countries on a practical basis . There is reason to fear that a good deal of misapprehension prevails in the United States with regard to public opinion in Canada on the subject of the commercial relations between the two countries . It can not be denied by the warmest admirers of parliamentary government , which is necessarily a government by party , that its tendency is to lead opposing parties to exaggerate the shortcomings of each other . It has been already stated that the opposition to the Government of Mr. Mackenzie adopted protection to native industry as the test question at the general election for the Dominion in the autumn of 1878 , and the tariff of last year was the consequence of their success at the polls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as free-traders , has endeavored to represent the new tariff in the most objectionable point of view possible , while its supporters are willing enough that it should be considered highly protective , under the belief that public opinion is with them . The strong feeling in England has been a source of embarrassment . The exports of Canada are all admitted duty free into England , and it has not unnaturally been made a subject of great complaint that British exports should be subjected to protective duties in a colony of the Empire . A writer in the " Westminster Review " has not hesitated to give his opinion that the persistence in such a policy must lead to a dissolution of the subsisting connection , but it is highly improbable that such an opinion will find any support in Parliament worthy of notice . The Canadian opposition has not failed to recognize the justice of the complaints which have been made in Great Britain , and to charge the Conservative party with inaugurating a policy which is calculated to sever the connection . In defending themselves the Ministerialists have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at United States manufactures , and as not likely to affect the trade with Great Britain . Now , it must be constantly borne in mind that the duties are precisely the same on British and United States manufactures , and that , to whatever extent they encourage home manufactures , the trade with both countries will be obstructed . No reference has yet been made to the opinions of those who desire what they designate as a Commercial Union between the United States and Canada , and who have recently been making // efforts to persuade the people of the former country that their opinions are held in secret by many prominent politicians . It is very difficult to meet such assertions . The interest of party leaders on both sides is to expose the shortcomings of their adversaries , and most assuredly they are far from remiss in doing so . No allegation has been made by the leading party journals on either side that their opponents hold any such views as those which have been attributed to them by self-constituted agents . Neither in the Parliament of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any scheme for commercial union been suggested , nor is there any reason whatever to suppose that it would be practicable . It would render a common tariff necessary , and likewise a fair distribution of the revenue obtained from it . Assuming for the sake of argument that no opposition to such a scheme were made by Great Britain , it seems highly improbable that the United States would permit Canada to have a voice in framing a common tariff , or in adjusting the distribution of the revenue . There is no reason to suppose that even a single individual believes in the practicability of such a scheme . It is proposed by persons who are in secret advocates of the annexation of Canada to the United States , and who deem it wise to adopt a circuitous mode of accomplishing their object . Representations have lately been made that the only practicable mode of Canada 's obtaining commercial union is by separation from Great Britain , and that the chief object of the United States in refusing to negotiate a reciprocity treaty is to force Canada into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is best known to citizens of the United States ; but it is highly improbable that they will have any influence over Canadian public opinion . Unceasing efforts have likewise been made by the advocates of separation from Great Britain to create dissatisfaction with the Imperial Government . Canada has , since the period of confederation , undertaken some great public works , notably the Intercolonial Railway connecting the cities of Quebec and Halifax , the Pacific Railway , and the enlargement of the ship-canals . At the urgent solicitation of Canada , the Imperial Government has lent its aid to some of these undertakings in the form of a guarantee so as to enable Canada to obtain the money required on the most favorable terms . Those hostile to British connection have maintained that Great Britain , by affording its guarantee , has assumed a responsibility for these undertakings which are not likely to be remunerative , and were never expected to be // so ; and that the deficit in the revenue , which has been the principal cause of the high tariff , is the result of imperial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Britain has no interest in these public works , and that they were never encouraged by the Imperial Ministers . They were projected in British America for local objects , and the Imperial Government was generous enough to accede to the urgent request of Canada to assist it by its guarantee . Another argument , that has recently been employed to create dissatisfaction with Great Britain , is that Canada , as a colony , can not negotiate commercial treaties , and that if it were independent it could obtain more favorable terms from foreign nations . France does not admit Canadian exports into her markets on the same terms as the most favored nations , although Canada has always admitted French exports on the same terms as those from Great Britain . There is no reason whatever to suppose that if Canada were independent she would succeed in negotiating a commercial treaty with France on more favorable terms than she can do with the powerful influence of Great Britain , which is at all times available to the Canadian Ministers . Reference has been already made to the aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the negotiations which were conducted at Washington in 1874 by Sir Edward Thornton and Senator Brown . In considering the commercial relations between the United States and Canada , it is highly important that it should be borne in mind that peaceable separation from Great Britain , on the part of the latter , is a very improbable contingency . This opinion is not predicated on the supposition that Great Britain would be inclined to coerce Canada as she attempted to coerce the United States . There is no probability that if Canada were disposed to demand separation she would meet with opposition . Many influential British statesmen are of opinion that the colonies are not a source of strength to the mother-country , and that the adoption of a protective policy has weakened the tie which bands the two countries together . In an article contributed to the London " Fortnightly Review** by the Rt . Hon. Robert Lowe , ex-Chancellor of the Exchequer , it is said : " To those who view the probable separation of the colonies from the mother-country , at some period more or less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared with those who founded them , it may be some consolation to observe that hardly any of these settlements at the present day are answering the purposes // for which they were founded . The great object in founding a colony was undoubtedly to secure a monopoly of its trade , and , so long as we confined ourselves to that , the American colonies were among the most loyal of our fellow subjects . " Mr. Lowe 's conclusion is that , in the course of time , the larger colonies will make a claim to have a voice in imperial affairs , and he maintains that , when that day shall arrive , " there is nothing for it but separation . " But even Mr. Lowe , who is a fair representative of what may be termed the anti-Colonial party in Great Britain , admits that " our wisdom is to defer the change as long as possible . " Now , it is highly improbable that there is any desire among Canadians to have a voice in imperial affairs , assuming , for the sake of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been obvious that Imperial Federation , if practicable , would result in the colonies having to share in the cost of the military and naval services , and in all others of a strictly imperial character , and this Canada would be unlikely to consent to . There is no ground for supposing that Imperial Federation has many advocates in Canada , and it has been condemned in the strongest terms by those favorable to separation . There is no reason to believe that , provided Canada is willing to continue the connection on its present basis , any proposition either to dissolve it or to make it more burdensome will emanate from Great Britain . How , then , is a change of government to be brought about ? Up to the present time , there has been no public manifestation of discontent ; but , on the assumption that those favorable to separation , . whether from a preference for republican institutions or from a conviction that in no other way can satisfactory commercial relations with the United States be established , were able to form a party , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most remote probability of a peaceable revolution . Canada , as has been shown , has no grievance , and it would require grievances of no orslinary magnitude to induce a considerable number of people to engage in revolutionary proceedings , especiallv when those who prefer the institutions of the United States can so easily remove there without risk of life or sacrifice of property . Little over forty years have elapsed since the experiment was tried , under circumstances much more favorable than are likely to occur again . In 1837 there was a wretched system of government , and there were grievances of great magnitude , which had long been the subject of unavailing complaint by the representatives of the Canadian people , and yet it was found impossible to induce any // considerable number to engage in rebellion . A statement has been made that , in contemplation of some renewed attempt of a similar character , an influential citizen of the United States lately observed to a discontented Canadian that , however good might be the intention of the Government of that country , it might find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prevent sympathizers from joining with their Canadian neighbors , and , referring to the rebellion of 1837 , he added that " the heart of Americans was with Canadians in that struggle . " It is , of course , far from improbable that if a rebellion were to take place hereafter , as in 1837 , aid would be given in the same way ; but in such a case it is not likely that Great Britain would look on with folded arms , while the loyal Canadians were attacked by foreign sympathizers . In the old contest , if it can be called Qne , the United States Government did not interfere , and there was no difficulty between Great Britain and the United States but what was amicably settled by the diplomatists . The rebellion of 1837 was preceded by a long period of discontent , and , before there was a resort to arms , there had been strong representations from the Canadian Legislatures . It is hardly possible that with the present political institutions of Canada any discontent could provoke rebellion to authority ; indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the possibility of civil war . It is consequently delusive to spcculate on revolution as a contingency likely to occur , unless circumstances wholly unforeseen at present should arise . The conclusion to be drawn from the foregoing statements is , that the United States has no just ground to complain of the Canadian tariff ; that Canada has endeavored to renew the reciprocity treaty with the United States , and has evinced a readiness to concede all reasonable demands ; that the fishery question must very soon become again a subject for negotiation ; that there is no probability of change in the political state of Canada ; and that it is most desirable that some effort should be made by the United States to establish satisfactory commercial relations between the two countries .
