txt The death of the child of John Gore , of Millvale borough , last week , has led to striking developments . This child was found by Humane Agent M. J. Dolan locked up in a box almost dying . He had the father arrested and he was fined $15 for his inhuman treatment of the child . Although given . every care the child was too - weak and ill to recover and it died . Since then it has been learned that its life was insured for $65 in a company in this city and that including the payment of the $15 and costs imposed on the father , and the funeral expenses , the family is still ahead a small amount by the death of the child . In an interview this afternoon Humane Agent Dean said that this was not the first case of the kind that had come under his observation ; that it was a common practice among certain people to insure the lives of their children . There are three or four companies in this city , he continued , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children . These companies employ agents who visit the people of this city and Allegheny and offer to insure the lives of their children for a very small sum , to be paid on the death of the child . Their plan is to get the risks and then go around and collect 2 or 3 cents weekly . Tempted by the inducement of securing what to them is a large sum of money , these poor people neglect and ill treat their offspring . They practically kill them to get the money . The Philanthropic Mutual Benefit Society , at No. 127 Fifth-avenue , was one of the companies mentioned by the Humane Agent , and a visit there showed that a child could be insured by passing the merest sham of an examination . A perusal of the books showed that a number of children who have died lately , some wader suspicious circumstances , had been insured here . The Humane Agent now has their names and will begin a thorough investigation of all the cases .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
