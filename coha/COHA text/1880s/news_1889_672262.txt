txt Whatever previous feeling may have existed against the dangers of overhead electric wires pales Ina insignificance beside the great outcry of indignant protestation that is now sweeping over this city . The horrible death of Lineman John E. H. Feeks on Friday , while held imprisoned in a network of wires forty feet from the ground , at Chambers and Centre streets , a spectacle witnessed and shuddered at by thousands of citizens , has fanned a fire long smoldering until now it rises to a pitch that absolutely demands official interference and prompt and determined action . In elevated trains and street cars , in business houses and offices , on the Exchange floors and in the markets , in the hotels and Dates , everywhere everybody was talking of the accident and the severity of the lesson it taught . Bitter were the criticisms made against the Board of Commissioners , who , appointed five years ago to guard against the very dangers to which the people are now exposea , had so far neglected their duty that the condition of affairs baa grown worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that at least the climax has been reached and reform must come , even though it be at the sacrifice of electric street lighting . Mayor Grant was not at his office much more than two hours yesterday , but in that time he managed to put in a good day 's work . He had not fully recovered from his bad cold , but , cold or no cold , he had made up his mind to take more decided action than ever in relation to the murderous overhead elpetrie light wires . The first thing be did was to call a meeting of the Board of Electrical Control , and Commissioners Moss , Gibbens , and Hess all came . down . The death of peer Feeks had stirred them up a bit . They probably awoke yesterday morning to the fact that the public is getting very tired indeed of delay . Expert S. S. Wheeler , Commissioner Gilroy , and Corporation Couusel . Clark were also at the meeting . Mayor Grant said upon taking the chair at 11:45 : " We have only a quarter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its legality might be raised as to any action taken after 12 o'clock , as this is a half holiday . " Mr. Gibbons suggested that the clock be turned back in accordance with legislative practice , but Mayor Grunt would n't have it . Mr. Wheeler had this report to make : " With relation to the notiee aortrod by the board upon the electric lighting companies , 1 have to report as follows : " As 1 stated at the meeting of the board Thurs. day , lain unable without a larger force than that at my disposal at present to say which of the wires used for electric lighting is iu proper condition . Ou the other hand . I ant able to inform you that , notwithstanding the notice of the board , two electric lighting companies have operated since the receipt of that notice wires known to be imperfectly insulated . " These are the Brush and the United Stater Companies . Their stations are situated at the following places : Brush , 210 Elizabeth-street ; United States , 206 Felton-street. 36 Stant4mastreet , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their wires specified therein are improperly insulated and constructed contrary to the rules and regular . Lions of the board . I am unable to state definitely with regard to the other wires of these and ? thee companies whether such as are improperly Men . lated have been operated or not , not having had time to maze an inspection . " " Do you believe that those two companies are the only ones whose wires are dangerous asked the Mayor . " No , but they maintain nineteen-twentieths of the-wires I have ' Mon able to find so far In the limited time I have had . " " Are the recent deaths chargeable to their wires ' 1 " asked the Mayor . The expert said that they were , and the Mayor said : " I propose to give orders to the Commissioner of Public Works that all wires not properly insulated must be promptly cut down . " Commissioner Hess said that that was the only way , and the Mayor added that he aid not wish any two particular companies designated . in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ho said that ho would otter a resolution that the engineer of the board be directea to be prepared on Monday to otter a plan for a comprehensive system of subways to cover as much as possible . Mr. Moss 's voice was now beard . He wanted to know if the Mayor meant electric light subways . That was jhst what the Mayor did mean . " Those before all else , " said he ; " the others can wait . The wires that are dangerous must go down first . " Commissioner of Public Works Gilroy was , next brought into prominence in the hearing . The Mayor was anxious to take immediate action . The clock showed that it was almost 12 . There was no time to be lost . " There is no time to draft an order in specific terms . " said the Mayor to Mr. Gilroy , " but I. now direct you to cut down and remove such . electric light wires as have been operated in. violation of the law and rules of this board . " Sir . Gilroy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that the board 's expert would do that . ? Is this the order of the board ' ? " asked Corporation Counsel Clark . " No , " said the Mayor , " but I think the board will approve . " All . the members agreed with the Mayor , and Mr. Gibbens said that the board of itself had . no power to give the Commissioner of Public Works orders . Mayor Grant , ho wever , was not bothering Much about that question . He meant to exercise all the power he could as Mayor to get down the death-dealing wires . Following out this policy he turned his attention to Expert Wheeler 's statement that he did not have enough help . " If you can not find time to du the work , " said the Mayor to Mr. Wheeler . " you had better get some one to help you . I want a full report on Monday . " Mr. Wheelet said that he would have such a report ready . He was authorized to employ temporary assistant inspectors , Mr. Gibbons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty days without getting them through the Civil Service Board . Mr. Wheeler said that the currents should be cut off so that the cutting of wires would not be dangerous and that notice should . be sent to the companies to that effect . All the members of the board agreed with him , Mr. Wheeler said that he was ready to held/a work with Mr. Gilroy at once . - In answer to a question by the Mayor in relation to Lineman Feeks 's death , Expert Wheeler said that he bad examined the polo and wirea at Chambers and Centre streets and " that ha found there principally telegraph wires . Teem were two wires of the Electric Power Company on the pole . " There was a loop of the United States illuminating Company 's wire within half a stretch of the pole . He thought very likely that the wire Feeks was belittling might have crossed this loop by sagging . As to how the power wires got o the pole , Mr. Wheeler did not know whethe they were strung before permits were grants or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wires atter the accident and lack of time had prevented him from making a more thorough investigation . He had not heard of a lineman 's teat box having been burned out on that pole before . There were wires of different companies and classes on the pole , and he had . fought against this sort of thing for a long time . Tips Mayor said that the report was not satisfactory , and Mr. Wheeler said that he had mass no report as yet . " If you are pressed for time you must get help , " said the Mayor . The board had just adjourned until 11 o'clock to-morrow morning when Commissioner Gilroy re-entered the room , and said that he had . been informed that orders of injunction had been issued iu behalf of ; the Brush and the United States illuminating Companies . Ha wanted Corporation Counsel Clark to tell him if it was a sufficient service , or whether he should go on with his work . Treadwell Cleveland had intercepted the Commissioner just outside the Mayor 's office and had given . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service would be made as soon as copies could be prepared . Mr. Clark looked over the papers , which showed that the Brush Company and the United States Illuminating Company had obtained injunctions . He told Mr. Gilroy that as he had notice of the injunctions he could not go on . Mr. Wheeler said that he could find wires belonging to other companies that were dangerous , and Mr. Gilroy prepared to go with Mr. Wheeler in search of them .
