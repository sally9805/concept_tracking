THE GERMAN EMPIRE . THE present political system of Germany has no very close organic connection with the old empire , which in 1806 went to pieces under the blows of Napoleon , or with the confederation , which , reconstructed by Metternich , survived until the battle of Sadowa ; but there is a certain historical thread binding them all together in an order of progress which it is necessary to understand . The original empire may be said to have lasted from the death of Charlemagne to the abdication of Francis 11. -a period of about one thousand years . Fifty-four princes had held , and some of them had enjoyed , the imperial dignity . Although there was no hereditary order of succession it was not uncommon for several consecutive elections to be carried by the same family , so that the annals of the empire present a variety of dynasties , such , for instance , as that of Saxony , that of the Hohenstauffens ( the most illustrious of all ) , the Luxemburg house , the Bavarians , and the Hapsburgs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which for about three centuries had wielded paramount influence , and had easily controlled the College of Electors . This college underwent during its thousand years many vicissitudes . In theory it was in early times nearly identical with the Diet , so that every German noble who was an immediate vassal of the emperor was , or could claim to be , an elector . But the more powerful princes disputed this claim , and great confusion was the rule , until the Emperor Charles IV. , by the Golden Bull of 1356 , restricted the electoral dignity to seven persons . Three of these were ecclesiastics , viz. , the archbishops of Cologne , Mayence , and Treves ; four were secular princes , viz. , the King of Bohemia , the Margrave of Brandenburg , the Elector of Saxony , and the Count Palatine . The college retained this composition for three hundred years , while the Diet was a more numerous body , with legislative and , to a certain extent , judicial functions . By the peace of Westphalia , in 1648 , an eighth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bavaria ; and at a still later period a ninth , which was acquired by Hanover . Until 1806 these nine potentates met in the close little chamber which every tourist has seen , at Frankfort-on-the-Main , as often as an emperor died , and went through the form , which for many years had been only an empty form , of choosing a successor . The force of cohesion between the members of this singular confederation was at all times very slight , though it depended somewhat on the personal qualities of the emperor-on his will , energy , resources , and popularity . The Hohenstauffens had all of these in a large degree , and they imposed obedience upon the vassal princes , and made the empire united at home and formidable abroad . But in general the bond of union was one of forms and ceremonies rather than of strict political subordination , as understood in a modern state . Beyond certain feudal tributes , the emperor as such had no revenues . There was no imperial army , and in case of war the emperor was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vassals . The only administrative divisions of the imperial territory were the " Kreises , " or circles , which had both a military and a judicial character , but ill defined in respect to both . To use a common figure , the centrifugal was stronger than the centripetal force in the system ; and hence from an early date the leading tendency in German political development was the rise of individualism among the various states , or a few of them , and their aggrandizement at the cost of the central power . Of these states Prussia has enjoyed , though not the earliest , the most vigorous growth , and the characteristics which she // has displayed have been copied in some degree , and with some success , by most of her German sisters . The rulers of Prussia made themselves absolute ; all the petty princes of the father-land gradually did the same . Prussia early cultivated the military spirit , and every paltry Landsherr felt bound to ruin his people by the support of a standing army . Prussia established a permanent , efficient , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wholesome example was followed throughout Germany . Thus many of the features of the great Northern powers were found reproduced in pctto by two or three hundred lesser principalities ; but the frugality in finance , the audacity in the field , the fortitude under defeat , which long characterized Prussia have not been reproduced , and she has grown strong and influential , while they have remained stationary , or have *even declined . Only one state could offer her a successful rivalry . Austria was rich ; had a splendid aristocracy ; being Catholic , was supported by the Pope ; and , in spite of her pride and arrogance , commonly enjoyed more popularity than Prussia . The relation between the two powers was therefore for centuries one of secret jealousy or open hostility , until the Napoleonic campaigns of 1805 and 1806 dissolved the empire , and reduced them both for a time under the sway of France . On the downfall of Napoleon , efforts were at once made to restore the . antique structure . The Congress of Vienna was the scene of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Prussian ; and recriminations are still exchanged between the historians and publicists of the two countries in regard to that august but inharmonious council . On two points an early agreement seems to have been reached . The one was that in the work of reorganization only the interests of the princes , not those of the peoples , were to be consulted . The other was that the old empire could not be restored , that the imperial dignity should not be revived , and that a species of confederation , little different from a league or qualified alliance between the several states , was all that could be attained . The result was embodied in the Act of Confederation of June 18 , 1815 , and subsequent modifications in the so-called Final Act of May 15 , 1820 . These acts created not a Bundcsstaat , but a Staatcn bund , not a federal state , but a confederation of states  --  a distinction of vast importance both in theory and in practice , as America knows by experience . The powers intrusted to the central government by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in practice they were almost worthless . Austria was nominally the head of the confederation , but this meant little more than the honor of presiding in the Diet . An executive hardly existed . The Diet , which was the central legislative organ , and met at Frankfort-on-the-Main , could only summon the local authorities in each state to execute its decrees , and the efficacy of the summons depended on the resources or audacity of delinquent states . Disobedience wa*s punished only with great difficulty , and often not at all . In regard to the distribution of power in the Diet , a curious rule prevailed . The body met in two forms : sometimes as the Ordinary Assembly , sometimes as the General Assembly . In the former the larger states had each one vote , while the smaller states were arranged in groups , each group having likewise one vote . In the General Assembly the six kingdoms had each four votes , the next class of states each three , a third class each two , and the remaining principalities and free cities each one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Holstein . Current business was transacted by the Ordinary Assembly , where a majority decided , but graver matters , especially alterations of the fundamental law and the like , were submitted to the General Assembly , where a twothird vote was required for validity , and in some cases unanimity . A very small class of relations was intrusted to the Diet , and these were surrounded with qualifications and limitations which left the individual states practical independence , and paralyzed the imperial executive . At different epochs efforts to reform were made , but without success . The most noteworthy of these was a consequence of the revolutionary movements of 1848-49 . At that time a species of constitutional convention , composed of deputies chosen by the people with the tacit approval of the sovereigns , but without any formal authority , met at Frankfort , and debated various schemes // of relief . All of these schemes tended toward a greater degree of civil and political liberty on the one hand , and a stronger central government on the other ; but nothing tangible was achieved except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in the house of Prussia . King Frederick William IV . was . however , not the man for the crisis . Filled with rude notions of divine right and the like , he refused the crown because it was the gift only of the people , not the princes , of Germany ; the Frankfort Parliament was dissolved at the point of the bayonet , and things resumed their old course . The Danish war , so called , or the forcible seizure of Schleswig-Holstein by Austria and Prussia , showed how powerless were all the forms of the confederation against its two leading members . A still more striking illustration of their impotence was the war of 18*6 . Really a quarrel between Austria and Prussia , the war was a German conflict in this sense , that the sympathies of nearly all the lesser states were with the former , and that the Diet , encouraged by it , thundered with all its violence against Prussia , the disturber of the peace . Bismarck was undismayed by opposition in the forum or in the field . Sadowa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood . The Treaty of Prague put an end to the war , and to Austria as a German power ; and Prussia was authorized to rebuild German unity on a plan widely different from the frail structures that had previously been tried . The North German Confederation was called into being . It was composed of all the states which had formed part of the old union , except ( 1 ) Austria , which was left entirely out ; ( 2 ) certain states which lost their independence , and were annexed by Prussia ; and ( 3 ) Bavaria , Wiirtemberg , Baden , and Hesse - Darmstadt , which entered into a confederation of their own , known as the South German Confederation . Close relations were nevertheless established between the two confederations ; and in particular a military convention , providing for mutual co-operation in certain contingencies , brought Prussians and Bavarians , Saxons and Hessians , into the field as allies against France in 1870 . Finally , in the course of the war , the states of the South German Confederation were merged with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Empire . The constitutionvoL . LxnL-*o. 376-38 al differences between the old and the new systems were slight . The empire was really the continuation of the confederation , enlarged by the addition of four new states , and decorated with a more imposing name . But in order that the significance of these titular changes may be understood , a word or two of explanation is necessary . In the first place , the German term " Reich " does not designate an empire as a form of government distinguished from a kingdom , for instance , or a republic . Strictly taken , it means " realm , " or even " coinmonwealth , " while the technical term for empire is " Kaiserreich . " Thus the Roman Empire might be called a Reich , as was the old German Empire , because , for one reason , the hereditary principle in both was weak , or did not exist ; and in the present confederation , or Reich , the so-called imperial dignity , though hereditary in the royal house of Prussia is not hereditary in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever cease to be Kings of Prussia , they would cease ipso facto to be Emperors of Germany . But the Napoleonic empire in France was always called in German the " Kaiserreich , " because the imperial principle , whatever that may be , was visibly incorporated in the public law of the state . The same observation holds true of the head of the state in Germany . The press and the public in other countries speak of him commonly as the Emperor of Germany , which is incorrect . There is no such personage . The federal constitution simply declares that the Presidency of the confederation is vested in the King of Prussia , who shall bear the title of German Emperor . Our usage of language and our habits of political thought do not , indeed , make any clear difference between the title German Emperor and the title Emperor of Germany ; but to Teutonic-nay , to **25;123;TOOLONG the distinction is of vast importance . The King of Prussia is then merely President of the German realm , and there is nothing imperial about him except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperial privy purse ; no imperial civil list ; no imperial suite , or court , or palace . He is simply the King of Prussia , intrusted with certain executive functions in the German federal system . Treaties for the adhesion of the South German states to the union were coneluded // during the war , and the proclamation of the empire was made at Versailles , the German head-quarters , on the 18th of January , 1871 . In the Diet of the North German Confederation , to which those changes were submitted , only six votes were raised in opposition . The next step was to call a new Diet representing the whole empire , and to adopt a constitution suitable to the new conditions . The elections took place on the 3d of March , in accordance with the electoral law of the North German Confederation , that is to say , by universal suffrage and secret ballot . On the 21st of the same month , this body was formally opened by the Emperor in person . The draft of a constitution , laid before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was officially promulgated on the 21st of April . The constitution eomprises fourteen sections , treating respectively of the following subjects 1 , The Federal Territory ; 2 , Legislation ; 3 , The Federal Council ; 4 , The Presidency ; 5 , The Diet ; 6 , Tariff and Commercial Affairs ; 7 , Railways ; 8 , Posts and Telegraphs ; 9 , Marine and Navigation ; 10 , Consular System ; 11 , Military Affairs ; 12 , Finance ; 13 , Adjustment of Differences , etc. ; 14 , General Provisions . We propose next to give a brief statement of the character of each of these sections . 1 . The Federal Territory. - This simply enumerates the states forming the union , and needs no farther explanation . 2 . Legislation ( Reichsgesetzgebung ) . - After some general provisions in regard to the equality of citizenship throughout the empire , the equal right of all Germans to the protection of the empire , etc. , there follows , in Article 4 , the enumeration of the subjects over which the imperial legislation extends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Citizenship , Passports , and Insurance ; Import Duties , Commerce , and Federal Taxation ; Measures , Weights , Coinage , and the Issuingof Paper Money ; Banking Affairs ; Patents ; Copyright ; Railways , Posts , and Telegraphs , with some restriction in favor of Bavaria and Wiirtemberg ; Civil and Criminal Jurisprudence , within certain limits , and Judicial Procedure ; Military and Naval Affairs ; Regulations in regard to the Press and Public Meetings . Finally , it is added that the power of legislation is vested in the Federal Council ( Bundesrath ) and the Imperial Diet ( Reichstag ) , and that a valid act must be sanctioned by a majority in each of these bodies . The Emperor has , accordingly , no veto power . His only influence upon legislation is as King of Prussia , and through the Prussian delegation in the Federal Council . The method of expressing this power will appear from the account of section 3 . The Federal Council. - As its name indicates , this is the body in which the federal principle is guarded , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the different states , appointed by the authorities of each state , and subject to their instructions . It consists of fifty - eight members , distributed as follows : Prussia , 17 ; Bavaria , 6 ; Saxony and Wiirtemberg , 4 each ; Baden and Hesse , 3 each ; Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Brunswick , 2 each ; and the others , seventeen in number , 1 each . Article 6 declares that every membei ' of the union can appoint as many delegates to the Federal Council as it has votes , but that these votes must be cast as a unit . The Council decides upon all measures to be submitted to the Diet , and upon measures adopted by the Diet ; it adopts the general provisions in regard to the execution of imperial laws , etc. ; and it corrects delays or defects in such execution . Seven permanent committees are constituted from among its members for the consideration of the leading interests of the empire as above enumerated ; and in the composition of these committees , or two of them , special deference is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Saxony . No person can be at the same time member of the Federal Council and of the Diet , but every member of the former body may appear before the latter and advocate his own view of pending measures , even when it is not the view of the majority of his colleagues . The members of the Council enjoy at Berlin diplomatic immunities. 4 . The Presideney. - The reader will observe that this section , which treats of the Emperor , is not entitled " The Executive " ; and there is a reason for the distinction . The real Executive is the Federal Council , of which the Emperor is the organ ; while the class of administrative duties which belong to the latter originally and exclusively is strictly defined . Thus he sends and receives ambassadors and other foreign ministers , commands the armies , concludes treaties , and forms alliances . But to declare war , except in // case of invasion , the concurrence of the Federal Council is necessary ; and to conclude treaties upon any subject which belongs within the scope of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Council both . The Emperor summons , opens , and prorogues the Diet and the Federal Council . Orders and decrees issued by the Emperor in the name of the Emperor must be countersigned by the Chancellor , who becomes thereby responsible for the same . If any member of the confederation fails in the performance of its duties , as , for instance , refuses to contribute its quota to the treasury , it may be proceeded against in the way of forcible execution , which the Federal Council authorizes an*jv the Emperor carries into effect . The Imperial Chancellor is appointed by the Emperor , and presides in the Federal Council , a*though this duty may be delegated by him to any other member . 5 . The Imperial Diet. - This body is chosen by ballot , and consists of 382 members . Every German who has reached the age of twenty-five years has the right of suffrage , except soldiers and sailors in active service , persons under guardianship , those going through bankruptcy , paupers enjoying state support , and criminals who by sentence of court are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are also eligible as deputies . Officials even may be elected , and can take their seats without leaVe of abs*n&amp;e from their superiors . The normal duration of each Diet is three years , but it may be dissolved at any time by the concurrent act of the Emperor and the Federal Council . In regard to the right of the Diet to choose its own rules , officers , etc. , and to the privileges of its members , the provisions do not essentially differ from those prevailing in other countries . The constitution expressly says the deputies shall receive no pay or emoluments . A majority of the full legal number of members constitutes a quorum , and ordinarily questions are determined by the majority of the votes cast ; but there is a curious provision , applicable both to the Federal Council and the Diet , according to which , on all questions which do not concern the empire as a whole , only those states or the deputies of those states which are interested shall have a voice in the decision . 6 . Tariff and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperial taxes may be levied , the method , etc. , and consists of technical details not of general interest . It is to be observed that the free cities of Hamburg and Bremen are not included within the imperial customs territory , but they are bound to make a direct contribution to the treasury as compensation for this exemption . 7 . Railways. - The empire has a species of supervision over all the railways , except those of Bavaria and Wfirtemberg , first for military purposes , and secondly for the " common interest . " 8 . Posts and Telegraphs-These are exclusively imperial charges , except in the case of the two states above named . The same is true , but without any exception , of ( 9 ) the Marine and ( 10 ) the *3fonsular Establishment . 11 . The Army. - This section consists of some general provisions , and one sweeping exception . Let us first mention some of the more important provisions ; that is to say , important not in a military but in a constitutional sense . The entire army is under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colors , uniform , etc. , of Prussia is extended over the whole empire . There is one general army budget . The Emperor appoints the general officers : the local governments , however , the regimental and lesser officers . The soldiers take an oath of obedience to the Emperor , but not to the constitution  --  a grave and significant omission . The strength of the standing army was fixed temporarily at one per cent . of the population  --  a ratio which was subsequently confirmed by legislation for a term of seven years . Every German is declared liable to military service , and no substitutions or exceptions in favor of class or other privileges are permitted . Such are the general features of the military establishment ; but it is declared in a final article that most of them are not applicable to Bavaria and Wfirtemberg , which have their own separate budgets , and otherwise retain a greater degree of control over their contingents . 12 . Imperial Finances. - Yearly budgets are required . The needs of the treasury are supplied in the first place by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like beer , spirits , etc. , together with the surplus , if any , from the post and the telegraph , and the deficiency is then made up by pro rata assessments upon the separate states according to population . // These are the so-called " Matrikular-Beitriige , " which each state is privileged to raise in its own way . 13 . Settlement of Constitutional and other Disputes . - For these the Federal Council is in general a court of arbitration , but certain disputes may be referred to the Superior Court of the three free cities , which sits at Liibeck. 14 . General Provisions . - These concern modifications of the constitution . Amendments are adopted by the ordinary form of legislation , with the exception that they are regarded as defeated if there are fourteen hostile votes in the Federal Council ; while provisions which guarantee to any state special privileges or immunities can only be changed with the consent of that state . We have thus reviewed the chief formal provisions of the German constitution as they are found in the instrument itself . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the English language , to compare the system thus created with other constitutional systems , and finally to describe the attitude of German politicians and parties toward the fundamental law of their country . The German Empire is a federal state , the powers of which are derived exclusively from grants made by its members , and are enumerated in a written constitution . All powers not delegated to it by this instrument are reserved to the several states . The legislative authority is divided between , or rather is exercised concurrently by , the Federal Council and the Diet . The executive power is shared in the same manner by the Emperor and the Federal Council , with the concurrence , m respect to certain classes of treaties , of the Diet . The Emperor is irresponsible . The hereditary principle in regard to the head of the empire is vested not in a family , but in a dynasty  --  the dynasty , whatever it may be , which sits on the throne of Prussia . The only responsible minister is the Chancellor ; and except in diplomacy even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal Council . His influence in this body depends strictly , however , not on his position as Chancellor , but on the number of votes which , by virtue of some other office , he can control . If , as in the case of Bismarck , he is also head of the Prussian cabinet , he can control just seventeen votes , no more ; while if he were a Bavarian , he could control only six , if a Hessian , only three , and so on . But even seventeen votes is far short of a majority in the Council ; and it follows that Prussia , with two-thirds of the population of the empire , can easily be outvoted by the other states , which have only one - third . This inequality was a concession to the federal principle extorted by the lesser states . It has more than once baffled the Chancellor 's schemes and paralyzed his arm . And as stated above , even though the Chancellor carry the Council with him , any member of the minority may appear before the Diet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is true that he can only persuade , and has no authority even over the deputies from his own state ; but the privilege is not the less a gross anomaly . In ordinary language the empire would be called a constitutional state with a single legislative chamber ( the Diet ) , a federal ministry ( the Bundesrath ) , and a hereditary President , with very limited powers ( the Emperor ) . The empire differs , therefore , from France or England , first of all , of course , in being a federal and not a centralized state ; but , in the second place , in having no responsible ministry . Even the Chancellor has always denied any political accountability to the Diet , although he has often petulantly threatened to resign when he has met with too vigorous resistance . But resistance to him is technically resistance to the Federal Council , and aside from the practical difficulty of punishing fifty-eight persons , there is the further and formidable circumstance that these persons are the authorized delegates of their respective home governments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called to account , if at all . But in the German states parliamentary government exists rather in form than in fact , so that the cabinets , and accordingly the delegates to the Federal Council , represent in most cases the territorial princes , iot their peoples . The evils of such a system are therefore great even in theory ; and in practice they are even greater , as can be testified by any one who has noticed its working for any length of time . As in France and America , but not in England , the Diet is chosen by universal suffrage . The deputies are not required , either by law or by usage , to be residents of their districts , or even of the states to which their districts belong . In regard // to the composition of parties , the Diet resembles the French Chamber rather than the English or American Houses ; that is to say , instead of two leading parties there are a multitude of petty " fractions , " often separated one from another by the most minute differences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly goes on , no description will permanently accord with facts ; but a few leading sects preserve a fair degree of regular identity . There are on the right the " German " or Extreme Conservatives , and the " Free " or Moderate Conservatives ; in the centre , the Ultramontanes ; on the left , the National Liberals , the Progressists , and the Social Democrats . The most numerous at present are the Ultramontanes , which are , of course , united rather by ecclesiastical than by political sympathy . Next come the Extreme Conservatives and the National Liberals with about equal numbers . The Progressists and Social Democrats atone by vehemence , not to say violence , of opinion and policy for their numerical defects . There is , accordingly , no settled majority , as in England or America ; but the government rallies supporters now from one , now from the other , side of the House according to the nature of its measures . Until l87&amp; it was most often supported by the union of the National Liberals and the Moderate Conservatives ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discarded , and the two divisions of the Right , aided sometimes by the Centre , have furnished a majority for reactionary legislation . One remarkable difference between German and American federalism must be mentioned . The powers of the former in other words , of the central government , are in some respects broader , in others narrower , than with us , both in regard to the number of interests intrusted to it , and in regard to the manner of discharging the trust . Thus the imperial government can make laws upon the subject of the press and of public meetings , while the American constitution contains only certain negative declarations of principle , such as the freedom of the press , etc. , leaving to the States the care of vindicating and regulating the exercise of the right . The Germaff Empire has adopted a comprehensive penal code , while felonies and misdemeanors in general are here punished under the common law , and by other than federal tribunals . But in this country the power of direct taxation has been exercised by the general government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our regular army , unlike the German , is wholly independent of the State authorities . Thus the German constitution grants some attributes to the central government which ours denies to it , and denies some which ours grants . But the difference to which we intended more particularly to refer concerns the manner in which the federal laws are enforced . In the United States they are , of course , enforced by federal officials , executive and judicial . The marshals , the collectors of customs , the postmasters , the prosecuting attorneys , the courts which are charged with the duty of carrying out the laws of Congress , or the orders of the President , are servants of the federal government , and emanate directly from it . Not so in Germany . The empire enacts laws , and , as we have seen , on subjects which are forbidden to the American Congress ; but the execution of those laws is left to the state authorities . The imperial penal code defines crimes and provides penalties , but the application of the code belongs to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixes the rate of customs duties , but those duties are collected by the states each on its own frontiers . There is an imperial postal system and an imperial Postmaster-General , but the details of administration within each state are left to the state itself . In the customs and postal services the empire provides only a central organ for supervision and inspection . In civil and criminal jurisprudence there is an imperial High or Supreme Court , but all the lesser tribunals are local , not federal ; finally , each state 's contingent of the army is under its direction , except in respect to the general officers , and to the command in time of war . In all this the American reader will see a state of things more nearly resembling our old Confederation than the present Union . Thus it will be seen that in the execution of imperial interests or systems-the army , the post , the customs  --  the participation of the separate states as such is far more direct and more comprehensive than in America . But in addition to these " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the federal constitution , there // are others peculiar to some states , and more precisely defined in treaties . These deserve more than the brief mention which they have already received . The first and most important is the military independence of Bavaria and Wfirtemberg . Articles 57 to 68 inclusive ( Section 11 ) , of the constitution , have to do with military affairs , and of these only the first four , which announce general principles , such as the universal obligation to serve , the authority of the Emperor as commander-in-chief , etc. , apply to the two states above named . In the place of the remaining eight articles , two treaties - that of November 30 , 1870 , between the North German Confederation and Bavaria , and that of November 21 and 25 , between the Confederation and Wiirtemberg - come into force , and define the duties or exemptions of the two states . These treaties are not identica* the privileges of Bavaria being greater than those of Wiirtemberg , and amounting almost to complete independence . The Emperor has practically only the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in time of war . In Wiirtemberg , on the other hand , he names the corps commander and the commandants of fortresses , and the allowance for the Wiirtemberg contingent is incorporated in the general military budget of the empire ; but otherwise the little kingdom has its own army , which it administers in its own way . And even if the Emperor had the same powers in Bavaria and Wiirtemberg as in Hesse and Hamburg , the fact that those powers were derived , not from the constitution , but from special treaties , would of itself be politically significant . These same two states are likewise outside the imperial postal , telegraph , and railway systems . The exemption in respect to the mail service is especially one which most puzzles foreigners , who find correspondence between Bavaria or Wiirtemberg and the rest of the empire treated as foreign correspondence , and who try in vain to prepay a letter in Munich with a German imperial stamp . The telegraphs , being a branch of the postal service , follow , of course , the same rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since they do not belong to the empire , or , in general , to the states , at all ; but there is a species of imperial supervision , with a view to uniformity of system and efficiency for military service in war , which applies only with grave modifications to the two favored states . When we come to the customs department , Bavaria and Wiirtemberg fall into line , and two Hanseatic towns-Hamburg and Bremen-are the schismatics . It is well known Vhat these are free cities . So was Liibeck formerly . But Liibeck has surrendered her privilege , while the other two still insist , to the great disgust of Prince Bismarck , on remaining free ports of entry . They pay for the privilege , indeed , by an increase of their pro rctta direct contribution to the imperial treasury equal to the presunied amount which their citizens would otherwise pay in the form of import duties . But the freedom of the two great ports is an encouragement to smuggling over the Prussian frontier , and is vexatious in many ways to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the stubbornness of the Hamburg free-traders nearly led him into acts of open violence . Threats at least were freely uttered , plans of coercion were discussed by the protectionists , and there was even talk of mobilizing a regiment for actual service against the flourishing city. * Exemptions such as those of Bavaria and Wiirtemberg , of Hamburg and Bremen , are nearly as difficult to understand in a federal union like that of America as in a centralized state like France or England . But in considering them account must be taken of the peculiar historical antecedents of the German Union , and of the various types of character revealed in the states themselves . Bavaria fought , indeed , side by side with Prussia in the war of 1870-71 ; comrades in the field , they easily became brethren in the councils of peace . But through a long and eventful past , down to a period as late as 1866 , the two states had been consistent and almost hereditary enemies . Mutual distrust had kept them estranged . Prussia looked with malignant jealousy on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while Bavaria abhorred the stern military rigor of Berlin martinets . This relation was not much affected by the alliance of 1870 , nor will it ever be changed . Political interest led the southerr* states for the moment to accede to the union , but they surrendered as few of their * Since the above was written the Chancellor has carried his point , and Hamburg has entered the Zoilverein. // prerogatives as possible , and above all , they retained control of their soldiers , who in some crisis may procure them more advantageous alliances than that of Prussia . The same course of reasoning , though with different materials , applies to the free cities . That which they havetheir prosperity , their wealth , their independence-they owe to a wise commercial policy , maintained , in spite of threats and bribes , through a course of many centuries . German unity is to them worth something only when it guarantees , not menaces , this precious possession . They are first free republics , afterward German cities ; and it is folly to suppose that for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their happiness they would willingly surrender a privilege which is essential not only to their happiness , but even to their life . Prince Bismarck understood this truth tenyears ago , and acted accordingly . If he has since discarded it , the reason can not be any change in the sentiments of the two free cities themselves , but alone in new resources which he has acquired for coercing them . The internal economy of some of , the states , especially of the two South German kingdoms , has also dictated to them certain measures of self-preservation . Every concession made by Bavaria , for instance , to the empire must be regarded in two aspects . It is a surrender , in the first place , of some portion of its independence or autonomy , which is a political sacrifice ; it is a surrender , in the second place , of some of the prerogatives of the Bavarian crown , and this is a dynastic loss . This latter was of course felt more keenly at the petty German courts than any real political calamity , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dyed themselves in monarchical prejudices , were least willing to exact . They accordingly allowed those courts to soothe their vanity by the administration of their own armies , and the privilege of sending ambassadors to foreign capitals . If those privileges correspond , as they undoubtedly do , to some form or degree of political power , the fact must be ascribed not so much to the enlightened wisdom of statesmen as to the narrow selfishness of petty Teutonic princes . As in party divisions , so in parliamentary forms and procedure , Germany has copied the French system with almost servile accuracy . The Diet has its bureaus , which choose the com*nittees , spe cial and regular . The President corresponds , indeed , to the English or American Speaker , though his powers are in some respects more , in some respects less , extensive ; but the other officers of the German House find their analogues only in Paris . There are two Vice-Presidents there is no clerk as with us , but half a dozen secretaries chosen from among the members ; and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Vorstand , " or presiding board . The President , or the officer who is acting as such , can decide only points of order as they arise , while the permanent policy of the chair , etc. , is fixed by the " Vorstand " as a whole . Nothing like the Committee of the Whole is known in the Diet , nor is there any rule which requires bills to be referred , except , perhaps , appropriation bills . It follows , of course , since the German Parliament consists of but one chamber , that the provisions common to nearly all constitutions , and found even in that of Prussia , namely , that appropriation of money must originate in the Lower House , can have no place in the imperial constitution . Such bills simply follow the ordinary course . The Diet may originate bills , but it seldom uses the power ; for the government itself submits such measures as it desires , and measures which it does not desire can not succeed against its opposition . The " government " which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states , is in Germany the Federal Council . Hence it is correct to say that practically all bills originate in the Federal Council . But there are three ways in which they may be brought before this body for its action . They may be prepared , as are the appropriation bills , in the office of the Chancellor , and be submitted by him or in his name ; they may be proposed by any state , through its delegates to the Council ; or they may be drawn up by order of the Council by one of its own com*nittees . But in any case , if approved by it , they are brought before the Diet on its authority , and are defended either by the Chancellor or by any official whom the Council may designate for the purpose . After its presentation the bill becomes the property of the Diet , which may choose its own mode of treatment ; and the government can influence the choice only by indicating its preference , reserving simply the right // at any time of withdrawing the measure if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be put immediately upon its passage if a majority of the House adopts that course . It then passes through three readings , and during any of these stages it may be amended . The more common method , however , with measures of great importance and many details , especially appropriation bills , is to refer them to a committee . In committee the procedure differs little from our own , except in the circumstance that the measure , whether amended or not , is reported back to the House , not by the chairman , but by a member specially chosen for the duty , and called the " Reporter . " There are accordingly three factors represented in the discussion of a bill thus restored , namely , the Diet itself by its majority , the committee by its Reporter , and the government by the Federal Council ; and often great confusion ensues . An amendment may be proposed by the committee , and accepted by the government , but rejected by the House . It may be opposed by the government , yet accepted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government and the House . A certain number of members may even concur and propose modifications after the report of the committee , and on these too the government must pronounce . It often happens that the representatives of the government are not able to say wh*ther a proposed change is acceptable or not , and are compelled to refer to the Federal Council for instructions . And after the measure has passed this ordeal , and issues in some form or other from the next stage , it returns as a whole to the Council , which can then make it a law or throw it out ; but if it pass both the Diet and the Federal Council , the Emperor has no veto power , and is required to proclaim it in the name of the empire . The imperial constitution has now been in operation about ten years , and the trial has increased rather than lessened the number and vehemence of its cri tics . Some defects have been revealed which at the time of its adoption nobody suspected ; and throughout the whole decade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two parties which are always found in federal states  --  the party of centralization and the party of decentralization . This division does not exactly corre spond to any existing classification of parties , nor again to geographical lines . Generally speaking , the liberals are " unionists , ' * the conservatives " particularists " ; but some of the extreme radicals hold that the weakness of the central government and the dissensions between the states are favorable to civil and political liberty ; while , on the other hand , the most reckless supporters of centralization are those moderate conservatives who call themselves , par excellence , the party of Bismarck . In general , the South Germans distrust and the Prussians support all measures tending to consolidate the empire at the cost of state rights ; but there are many champions of unity among Bavarian liberals , and mans stubborn defenders of the federal principle among Prussian reactionaries . To these persons , who are one thing or the other by geographical , political , or class sympathy , must be added certain doctrinaires , who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiar views . Of all of them it is enough to say that they exercise their prejudice alike in criticising the organic law as it is , and in supporting or opposing schemes for modifying it , which are presented from time to time . From what has already been said , it will readily be understood that the Federal Council is the object of the fiercest and most persistent attacks by the friends of a closer union . It is offensive for two reasons . It is , in the first place , the organ which represents and maintains the reserved rights of the states , and in its present constitution is an insurmountable barrier to the course of centralization . This alone would make it obnoxious . But it is furthermore an irresponsible body , or at least is not responsible to public opinion except in a remote and uncertain form ; and it renders impossible the creation of a real imperial ministry , visible to the political eye , and accountable to the deputies of the people . This demand for a federal cabinet is the most urgent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but it is also the one which the state governments most stubbornly resist . It is safe to say that it will never willingly be granted . To abolish or even essentially to modify the Federal Council would be equivalent to political suicide on the part of the small states . To institute a responsible central ministry // would be to found not only a pure democracy , but a compact centralized democracy , and to introduce a regime of pl4biscites . Hence the Council in its actual form is the last bulwark alike of those who hate democracy and of those who cherish " particularism . " The attitude of the Chancellor toward this perennial issue is dictated in a measure by the nature of his office , but is satisfactory neither to the one party nor to the other . He feels keenly his impotence in the Federal Council , and is , on the whole , favorable to the centralizing tendency of the liberals . He is anxious , in other words , to enlarge the powers of the central government . But this means with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chancellor , and against the Reichstag as well as the Bundesrath . He is equally hostile to democracy and to state rights . But he is already nearly independent of the Diet ; and to emancipate him from the Federal Council would release him from all control , and make him nearly absolute . This is a prospect which liberal " unionists " and South German " separatists " regard with the same horror . For , obnoxious as the Federal Council is to the former , it is a safeguard against menaces of self-aggrandizement on the part of the Chancellor , and sometimes , by accident rather than by prudence , has averted serious danger . There are a few blind admirers of Bismarck who support any scheme for increasing his power at the cost either of the Council or of the Diet ; but the cause of consolidation means to its more rational adherents something far different from the elevation of the Chancellor to the position of an irresponsible dictator . The constitutional issue between these two parties arises in nearly every parliamentary debate , and influences the treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the great financial reforms of 1879 . Most foreign observers doubtless remember the incident now , and even understood it at the times as merely a conflict between free trade and protection , in which the latter was the victor ; and such indeed it was , though something else besides . For beneath the struggle over the tariff lay a grave constitutional question  --  a battle for power , in which the empire fought for increased authority , the Federal Council for state rights , and the Diet for parliamentary privileges . Of these the empire gained a little , the Council saved much , but the Diet lost everything . As was said above , the reader will recollect that the resources of the imperial treasury are of two kinds : first , certain indirect taxes , both customs and excise , and second , complementary to these , direct pro rata contributions of the several states . The rates of the taxes of both kinds are permanently fixed by legislative acts , and can be changed only by the same process . But the net revenue from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to year , according to the state of trade and other circumstances , so that the pro rata contributions , which make up the deficiency , have to be assessed and authorized each year . This authorization proceeds from the Diet , and the discretion of granting or withholding it is said to " secure the parliamentary principle . " This annual vote alone gives it control over the amount of imperial revenues , and it follows , therefore , that this control diminishes as fast as the income from the permanent taxes increases . But an elevation of the customs rates , which was the proposition of Bismarck in 1879 , implied , of course , just such an increase in the revenues from this source , and a corresponding independence of the pro ratct contribution . The liberals were therefore placed in a dilemma . For years they had been agitating in behalf of additional imperial taxes , and the " fiscal independence , " as it was called , of the empire ; but the Chancellor 's project would make him independent not only of the states , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would still continue to vote the budget , and thereby to control expenditures , but the revenues , or in other words , the burdens of the people , would be placed beyond the power of relief from them . Hence a conflict of duties arose , and great confusion prevailed . The question was vastly complicated by the free-trade issue cruelly attached to it . To vote the Chancellor 's bill as presented was equivalent to voting away one of the prerogatives of the Diet , while also introducing at the same time a regime of protection , which most of the liberals abhorred . They began , therefore , to array themselves in opposition . Now it happened that the Ultramontanes , who for years had been fighting the Chancellor , were generally protectionists , and were // able , by throwing in their weight with the conservatives , to decide the scale . They only asked their price . This was that the Diet should not only not receive any compensation for the privileges which under the bill it would lose , hut also that even the surplus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlays , instead of being referred to the Diet for its disposition , should be redistributed among the states by the Federal Council . This was the so-called Frankenstein proviso . As will be perceived , it rejected the claim of the Diet , and re-affirmed the rights of the states , even while the bill itself seemed to create an imperial revenue . If the measure had before bei*n objectionable to the liberals , this amendment made it absolutely unacceptable . They voted , therefore , with the opposition minority , while a coalition of conservatives and Ultramontanes , forming*a large majority , carried through at once a sweeping fiscal reform and a grave constitutional innovation . This incident suggests two observations . The one is that in the course of the high tariff movement what was at first only an economical issue became in Germany , as it did in the United States , a constitutional question , in which the relative merits of free trade and protection were almost lost to sight . The other is that the fiscal system of the empire is now practically , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitution . The income of the federal treasury now consists-as it did beforeof certain permanent revenues , and in case of a deficiency from these sources , of direct assessments upon the states by authority of the Diet . But in practice , since the introduction of the new tariff , there is expected to be a surplus , and this is to be refunded without the participation of the Diet . The practical difference is accordingly great , and the delegates of the people have lost a valuable privilege . The depression of the party of centralization is therefore far more profound than it was two years ago . Before the late fiscal revolution they had counted on Bismarck as an ally - an opinionated and conditional ally , indeed , but one who , on the whole , sympathized with their general and ultimate aims . But this has proved to be only a dream . The Chancellor has coldly sacrificed them and the cause of unity to the interest of protection , and they feel that the retrograde movement , once begun , will not soon or easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they should now begin to calculate the value of the empire , and its probable duration . In addition to constitutional embarrassments , domestic affairs impose at least one serious and permanent dilemma upon the minds of German patriots and statesmen . This concerns the physical endurance of the country . So long as Germany keeps her army up to its present standard of numbers and efficiency , she has little to fear from foreign enemies , except , perhaps , in the case of a general combination against her , which skillful diplomacy will doubtless be able to avert . But the army secures her against one danger only by exposing her uninterruptedly to another . The greater the security against attacks from abroad , the greater the risk of bankruptcy at home . The drafts which the army makes upon the youth , the civic talent , the producing classes of the country , are borne with comparative ease , because service under the flag has become a second nature with the German people , and is hardly regarded as an interruption of the normal career of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavier burden , and withal a progressive burden , to which the growth of population and wealth bears no adequate relation . Under this the country is gradually breaking down . The present generation may not see the catastrophe , nor the next , for the endurance of the German people in the matter of taxation can yet withstand severe trials ; but there is a point at which its strength , if not its patience , will fail , and under the present system that point will some day be reached . Finally , the retirement of Bismarck , which has *Ilready been often threatened , or his death , which has now become a daily possibility , would be a most serious blow to the stability of the imperial system . Of the three men who led the great movement for unity , the Emperor , Moltke , and Bismarck , the last-named could be least easily spared . The Emperor is a man of mediocre ability even as a soldier , and his son is in some respects his superior . Moltke is unquestionably a military genius ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and these will live after him . But the Chancellor has rigorously suppressed // every rising pupil , and has formed a strictly personal regime , which no successor could administer . The secret of his power will be buried with him in the grave . It is natural , therefore , that the German people should view the prospect of his loss with dismay , and be paralyzed by every unfavorable report of his condition or his feelings . This is really the great danger which threatens the empire .
