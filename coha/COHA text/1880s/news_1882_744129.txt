txt The English are discussing the proposed reforms in Parliamentary procedure with surprising freedom . It is , perhaps , the spread of radical ideas that has raised up so many advocates of a really bold and vigorous attempt ' to make the House of Commons an efficient legislative body , but whether it is radicalism or merely a belated outbreak of common sense , the changes suggested and urged are thoroughgoing enough to quite take away the breath of many of her Majesty 's subjects who have been accustomed to look upon the British Constitution as a plant of almost imperceptible growth , by no means given in its years of dignified maturity to feats rivaling the alleged performances of Joicau 's gourd and Jack 's bean-stalk . It is actually proposed to transform Parliament from a cumbrous body , sitting under the cramping rules and traditions that were invented for it in the Middle Ages , into an active , well-organized legislature of the modern type , such as every other constitutional country has , a legislature having some facilities for doing the work expected of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present system Parliament passes one or two great bills at every session , after immense labor and months of discussion . Matters of subordinate interest , but still of great importance , are never reached . The reforms lately outlined by Mr. GLADSTONE as likely to be urged by the Government at the opening of the session , now near at hand , relate to willful obstruction . The behavior of the Home Rule Party when the Coercion acts and the Land bill were under discussion has demonstrated the necessity of some form of the cloture . According to the precedent established last Spring , the Speaker may now terminate the debate when a large majority of the members so vote . This obliges the Government to depend upon recruits from the Opposition when it wishes to proceed to a division . It is now thought that the Government will try to empower the Speaker to apply the closing rule when a bare majority so orders . It is argued that if the majority is capable of legislation at all it is capable of using this power with discretion , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become an instrument for unjustly suppressing debate and tyrannizing over the minority than one voted by two-thirds or three-quarters of the members present . In some form the cloture is an acknowledged necessity . The House should have the power to control its own business , to shut off endless speech-making and the repetition of worn-out arguments , and to put a bit in the mouths of mere willful obstructionists . At present the minority may keep business at a stand-still so long as its orators can find words enough to consume the time . The second great reform is the creation of committees to relieve the House of the drudgery of getting bills into shape and of the burden of private bills . Committee work is now done by Committee of the Whole House , an extravagantly wasteful method . Local and private bills to which no large body of legislators can be made to give intelligent attention are either voted on in ignorance , with the design of getting them out of the way , or are wholly neglected , the House not finding time to take them up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the details of the budget , may be much better settled in a small committee than by the House , and as half a dozen committees may be sitting simultaneously while the House is at the same time getting on with its work , the advantages of the plan require only to be stated to be perceived even by the British public . Mr. FREDERIC HARRISON , writing OR this subject , suggests six great standing committees ? Finance , Foreign Affairs , ( including the colonies and India , ) Home Administration , Justice and Law , Trade and Manufactures , and . Defense . With each committee made up of eleven members chosen by a ballot of the House , in which every member having ten votes would be placed on the committee , Mr. HARRISON thinks that a fair proportional representation of all the various parties could be secured , and the members best qualified for committee work would be chosen . The House of Commons may very easily secure the benefits to itself and to the country which these changes in its forms would bring by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly to be expected , however , that all ' this will be done at once , although the sentiment of the country seems to be in favor of a thorough reform . Some allowance must be made for English deliberation . But to us on this side the water , accustomed to " local self-government , " other modifications , of equal desirability and importance in the benefits they would confer , will occur . Parliament attempts too much . If it charges itself with imperial legislation and affairs of general import , the work of regulating matters of restricted bearing should be committed to local councils or other minor bodies , corresponding in a general way to our State Legislatures and county boards ; and to the French Council of State , prefectures , and department councils . Ireland and Scotland may never attain to the dignity of local Parliaments , but some division of the enormous labor which is now imposed on the Westminster legislators will become imperatively necessary .                   @ @
