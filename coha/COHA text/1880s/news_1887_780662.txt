txt The field . of the most mysterious battle in the world widens every hour . It is no longer a muddy lake in - which isolated figure-heads appear from day to day wounded and stained . It has become a tremen. dons rolling ocean of iniquity . Beneath it all there was undoubtedly some vast political plot , but events have long since passed out beyond the control of the original conspirators and no one can foresee how or where it Is all going to end . IL Gravy , up to yesterday , when that enigmatical man spoke of the stolen letters and suddenly stopped the wheels , had managed the sinking ship very cleverly . When forced to stimulate , or at least not to prevent , the inquiry , the President contrived to impel the proceedings his own way . ire ordered an examination of everything and everybody , not dating from the present day , but from the time of MaoMahon . It might as well have dated from Louis XV . or Noah 's ark . Every one saw through the little game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represented nothing but a shadow , and that this shadow would never darken the political lives of those more or less implicated . Long before it could reach sown to them they would have retired to private seclusion . That was the reason that up to Thursday afternoon M. Wilson had not left the Elyeae and et . Gravy had made no oones about stating publicly that when Son-In-law Daniel did leave he would go too . A dread of all that might come unnerved even those who most desire an entire change in the Government  --  the Radicals , who deem the present republio insecure and fictitious in name , and the Royalists , who would like something else , but just what they are not quite sure . There was , too , hovering over all this indecision , the Ganger of complications arising for France from the illness of both the German Emperor and the Crown Prince . Foi all these reasons , and many others too long to enumerate , every one waited , and moderation and putting off the evil hour seemed to be the keynote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thunderbolt of the stolen letters . Suddenly M. Bouvier and even M. Perron , whom the Radicals can not forgive for taking the place of Gen. Boulanger , were moved back on the chessboard , and the shifting personality of Son-in-Iaw Wilson was again thrust forward in a glaring light . It has not yet been made public how or by whom the two stolen letters were taken and the others replaced . In any case , the fact was brought before the Chamber , and M. Piou , a member of the Right , succeeded , to the universal satisfaction , in obtaining an immediate inquiry without waiting for the finish of the present Caffarel-Limousin lawsuit . It seems impossible now for M. Gravy to remain at the head of the Government , and his retirement is regarded as a question of a most limited time . At the present writing , M. Croyer , of whom I spoke last week , seems likely to succeed M. Gravy , although the Right will push M. Ferry very hard . People begin to wonder now what effect Gen. d'Audian 's presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to be turning out far more of a fool than a knave . Mme. Limousin threatens to degenerate into a fussy old woman , with the believed-in mission that she did hold a good many wires that she worked cheek by jowl in an underhand sort of way with a good many influential people , especially with members of the Presidential family . It is certain that not only did she know M. Wilson , but she was on the most intimate terms with his foster-sister , Marion , another lady given to the mania of letter writing . Gen. Thibaudin comes out in a new and not favorable light , too . Mme. Limousin was his last love . He not only wrote to her most touchingly , beginning with their mutual devotion to their country and ending by a most unrestricted protestation of personal affection , but before leeving the Ministry he wrote begging her not to reply as he could trust neither the Post Office nor the telegraph , since he knew the tricks of both . Gen. Thibaudin , who is to be placed , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in five days , seems to be even more of an ola fool than Gen. Caffarel . Yet this very man said only a few days since that he did not know La Limousin , had never met her , and that if she had ever put in an appearance at the Ministry he should have knocked her down stairs . Gen. Boulanger 's letters are not compromising thus far , but have we seen them all . Here it was that the great qualities of Maitre Demange came in , and all the court eat breathlessly to hear his speech , ' when he could revel in those vague promises of mysterious knowledge and unforeseen complications of which he is so fond . Ho gave all his time to the theory that though the Caffarel attack was being made upon Gen. Boulanger , it had defeated itself , and that the schemers had fallen into their own trap , leaving a single forlorn victim , his client , Caffarel . In truth M. Demange did not prove much , and his pet grief seemed to be that , unlike Bazaine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Versailles , with the grand cordon of the Legion of Honor , his client Caftarel was stigmatized and degraded before judgment . Hardly had the words been spoken when the prosecuting magistrate entered to announce that a new prosecution had been commenced , the offense being the destruction , suppression , and withdrawal of documents . When asked who the offender was , the magistrate replied that he was not authorized to give further details . After a moment 's confusion , Maitre Allies , the lawyer of Limousin , requested that judgment be staid in the case of his client . Maitre Demango made the same demand for his General , and the prosecution was finally arrested for these two prisoners and for Lorentz . No one is certain of the morrow . Gen. Boulanger comes out to-morrow , and who knows what that event may signify I M. Gravy is not represented as being depressed . M. Wilson is absolutely nonchalant He does not act as if he cared the toss of a penny whether school kept or not . Mine . Limousin has devoted her leisure prison hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intends to publish . It is called " The Truth About the Decoration Buse , ness . " Mme. Ratazzi prays all the time and reads her mass book . Mine . Blanche Costard cries , and Mme. Laren , who is a distinguished member of the Protective Society for animals , is constantly worried about the wellbeing of the numerous dogs she left at home . Gen. Caffarel is entirely heart-broken . He sits hour after hour staling blankly at a wall . In the beginning of his imprisonment he made his bed and cleaned his room , saying gayly that he had not forgotten his early soldier days . Since the withdrawal of the decoration he is Restless , and apathetic . Bayle , at Mazes , spends the time playing dominoes . Lorenz moans and accuses Mme.

M. Jaen , a distinguished member of the Council , insisted that they should be . Then cries of " Viva la Commune I " were heard , and when the police attempted to defend themselves , there came a row , during which M. Joffrin was arrested . Clovis Hugues 's belt showed his Deputy 's badge , and that saved him . How in the world the police contrived to get the corpse clear away to Pere la Chaise is a mystery . Without the support of these hated tyrants even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fisticuffs and turbulence of his friends .

Joffr1n rushed off after his few hours ' detention to the HOW de Ville to exhibit the rents in his clothing , and with pride be demanded that M. Gragnon be asked to explain why the Government wished to distract attention from M. Wilson by attacking Joffrin . A vote was taken . resulting in 59 majority for the proposition .
