txt " The hero of Fort Fisher " comes back to-day in reply to Admiral Porter 's breezy talk of yesterday , but his rejoinder is not so smart or complete as those admirers of Butler would have expected from Mr. Davis 's pet . The " Bold Ben " is angry enough to have the old epituet of " Beast Butler " ap plied again at having his failure as a military man . paraded in the newspapers , but he dissembles and affects an air of playfulness in retorting upon Admiral Porter . " Says I was drunk , does he l " growled the General . " Well , suppose he does . His statement to that effect will be satisfactory testimony to the contrary to those who know him . " Then he intimated that the fight was not yet over ; in fact , it had only begun , although the General had not been able to reach his magazine while Porter has been firing at him , When he was asked how far advanced in intoxication he was when he made his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started . That speech was written four or five days before it was delivered and copies of it were sent to the various morning papers in Boston . These papers did not report my speech ; they set it up from slips furnished them . The statements made by me were neither new nor unsupported , as Porter will find out before he gets through with this matter . " Then he sketched out , by aid of a map , his understanding of the naval and military forces about tee forts below New-Orleans . " The difference between Porter and myself , " he said , " is easily seen , and the public ought net to get its mental powers shaken by overthought I say that Porter ran away down the river because he was scared by that great floating dock , the Louisiana , a hulk that had no machinery and was unable to move of her own volition . I say he warned my troops to got away as fast as possible , because the rebels were after them , and he set us an example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This charge does not rest on the unsuoported testimony of any one man . " Gen. Butler quoted from a historian who got his information about Gee . " Butler in NewOrleans " from Butler hinatelf to prove that Porter bad been frightened , not only by the Louisiana , but also by the Manassas . " Why , " peel he with emphasis , " Porter himself has never denied that . Be admits it . Attempting to smooth it over somewhat , he says he was towing his mortar vessels clown for a supply of shells . There was no necessity for it . Four or Live steamers were below , ready at any time to bring him all the shells we had . Besides , what did he want with shells I The passage of the forts had been accomplished and , after that morning , lie never tired a ebell . " Another excuse he gives for that hasty trip down the river is that he was on his way round to the rear of the forts . Now , what on earth , or on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearest point to which he could bring his mortar fleet was eight wiles from the forts , and the intervening . ittance was one dense forest . Did he propose to shell the worts that he could n't see by the aid of mortals that had not enough range to go much more than a third of the distance I Tut . Tut ! Want a foolish liar lie ii . - I see he has called to his aid a man named Higgins , anti this worthy in 1872 writes a letter every word of w Melt is false . Who is this Higgins I Gen. Duncan was in command anu he testified that the damage done to the forts was insignificant . ' God is protecting us wonderfully , ' save he iu one of his last reports . After I arrived in New-Orleans 1 sent Lieut . Weitzel , the engineer officer en my stall ' , to examine the forts and to let me know how much it would cost to repair them . He reported , anti the report is on file that . both Jackson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the latter fort barely . being scratched . , Yes , Weitzel was a Lieutenant men , although he had , years before the war , built those strong forts . in those days promotion was Slow in the Engineer Carps . No man ever cot to be a Captain until he was sixty . They did n't drink themselves to death before teat age , and they never got hurt any other way . " " I want to give Porter credit , " said Butler , " for having done a great deal . lie generally obeyed orders , but lie aid run ! MGT . He is , I understand , engaged lu preparing a full expianation of this matter . I hope he is . When he does , then it will be time enough for me to make a reply . if he does n't put his font in it I 'm very nitwit mistaken . He ca n't tell the truth , anyhow . He has attacked ins like a blackguard , hoz 1 do not propose to make any such fight . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Pm going to settle ir . I laid for him and I 've caught him , and "  --  and hero the General looked as little like al ? Boyle Roche as possiblea -- - lie is as surely murdered as he lives . Either he or I will be held up to the execration of the people of these United States , and I mime you I do not tear the conseouences . " Gen. Butler will return to Boston in a few days . He intimates that by the time he reaches his home he will be in possession of all the material he needs to enable him to make a reply to Porter , and that he expects to discharge a " broadside " at the Admiral . ? Admiral Porter laughed heartily to-night over Butler 's accusations , particularly the statement that he was scared oil by the floating dock which the Confederates had converted into a sort of immense ram . The dock had been covered with railroad iron and tilted with paddle wheels and a lot of machinery . She was not in shape , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help of tugs . Admiral Porter said he had regarded this vessel  --  which had been named the Louisiana ? as fully as formidable as the Merrimac , and ho expected the enemy would send her down the river . Instead of running away , however , he Issued a general order to the fleet of nine Union steamers to be in readiness for the Louisiana , ann when She came down they wore all to make fast to her and drop their anchors , Men were detailed to pour musket , balls into her portholes , and others were assigned to the duty of boarding her at every available point . Porter did not believe the Louisiana a could drag the anchors of the nine steamers , and he considered that if she did come down stream she must inevitably he captured . As it was , the Louisiana was set on fire by the Confederates and Dame floating down the Stream while the articles of capitulation of Forts Jackson and St. Philip were being drawn up in the Admiral 's cabin . As she came in sight Porter gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off and let her float by . He stepped into the cabin and remarked to the Confederate officers that there seemed to be sharp practice somewhere , for ' the Louisiana was floating down , on fire , and would blow up . The officers replied that they were not responsible for the Louisiana , as the naval officers did not recognize their authority . While the articles of capitulation were being signed the Louisiana biew up , about fifty yards distant . Gen. Butler 's citation of Parton 's " General Butler in New-Orleans " as corroborating his ( Marge seemed to amuse the Admiral . " Why , " said he , " Butler paid Parton to write that nook . " " Of course , " continued the Admiral , taking up another of Butler 's assertions , " Fort St. Philip was n't hit by our shells . We did n't fire at her . Fort Jackson was Ihe fort we were after , and 1,300 shells were dropped right in the centre of Fort Jackson . St. Philip was too far away , and , besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steamers could attend to her while sailing past . " Admiral Porter told , however , of one shell that did strike Fort Phillip . The fort had one ritied gun that was giving the mortar boats a good deal of annoyance . Le finally ordered a mortar to lie loaded with all the powder and shot it would carry and fired at the fort . The explosion of the big charge nearly wrecked the mortar boat , and he did not care to try that experiment again . But by what the Admiral vaned sheer good luck the shell thus fired struck squarely on the troublesome rifled gun and made a complete wreck of it . Admiral Porter denied very emphatically all of Gen. Butler 's talk about being in Now-Orleans ready to come down and receive the surrender la ! the forte . " How could Butler bo there ahead of me , " said the Admiral , " when I towed him up there myself ? " The Admiral 's description of Butler 's first appearance on the scene was anything but complimentary . Butler , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he could not tans coherently . He had a bite stick with him , cut from a lemon tree , winch he proposed to present to Porter . One of Butler 's officers came in to ask permission to send some horses ashore and , with a string of coarse oaths , the General wanted to know if he was to be taken for a liveryman and ordered the officer out of the cabin . Afterward Butler tried to give sonic orders to some of Porter 's officers and expressed great surprise when he was told that he could not give orders to the naval officers , although ho was sure no navy officer could give orders to Win . Admiral Porter ie entirely ready to meet anything else Gen. Butler may conclude to say about the battle of Now-Orleans and his share in that fight , although he Intimates a fear that rho General IS losing lila mind and does not know what lie Is talking about .
