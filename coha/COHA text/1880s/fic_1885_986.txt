THE ELEVATOR by William D. Howells I. SCENE : Through the curtained doorway of MRS . EDWARD ROBERTS 'S pretty drawing-room , in Hotel Bellingham , shows the snowy and gleaming array of a table set for dinner , under the dim light of gas-burners turned low . An air of expectancy pervades the place , and the uneasiness of MR . ROBERTS , in evening dress , expresses something more as he turns from a glance into the dining-room , and still holding the portiere with one hand , takes out his watch with the other . MR . ROBERTS to MRS . ROBERTS entering the drawing-room from regions beyond : " My dear , it 's six o'clock . What can have become of your aunt ? " MRS . ROBERTS , with a little anxiety : " That was just what I was going to ask . She 's never late ; and the children are quite heart-broken . They had counted upon seeing her , and talking Christmas a little before they were put to bed . " ROBERTS : " Very singular her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceremony with us , and not come till the hour ? " MRS . ROBERTS : " Nonsense , Edward ! She 's been detained . Of course she 'll be here in a moment . How impatient you are ! " ROBERTS : " You must profit by me as an awful example . " MRS . ROBERTS , going about the room , and bestowing little touches here and there on its ornaments : " If you 'd had that new cook to battle with over this dinner , you 'd have learned patience by this time without any awful example . " ROBERTS , dropping nervously into the nearest chair : " I hope she is n't behind time . " MRS . ROBERTS , drifting upon the sofa , and disposing her train effectively on the carpet around her : " She 's before time . The dinner is in the last moment of ripe perfection now , when we must still give people fifteen minutes ' grace . " She studies the convolutions of her train absent-mindedly . ROBERTS , joining in its perusal : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when people come in ? " MRS . ROBERTS : " Of course not . I shall get up to receive them . " ROBERTS : " That 's rather a pity . To destroy such a lovely pose . " MRS . ROBERTS : " Do you like it ? " ROBERTS : " It 's divine . " MRS . ROBERTS : " You might throw me a kiss . " ROBERTS : " No ; if it happened to strike on that train anywhere , it might spoil one of the folds . I ca n't risk it . " A ring is heard at the apartment door . They spring to their feet simultaneously . MRS . ROBERTS : " There 's Aunt Mary now ! " She calls into the vestibule , " Aunt Mary ! " DR . LAWTON , putting aside the vestibule portiere , with affected timidity : " Very sorry . Merely a father . " MRS . ROBERTS : " Oh ! Dr. Lawton ? I am so glad to see you ! " She gives him her hand : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand why she has n't come . Why ! where 's Miss Lawton ? " LAWTON : " That is precisely what I was going to ask you . " MRS . ROBERTS : " Why , she is n't here . " LAWTON : " So it seems . I left her with the carriage at the door when I started to walk here . She called after me down the stairs that she would be ready in three seconds , and begged me to hurry , so that we could come in together , and not let people know I 'd saved half a dollar by walking . " MRS . ROBERTS : " SHE 'S been detained too ! " ROBERTS , coming forward : " Now you know what it is to have a delinquent Aunt-Mary-in-law . " LAWTON , shaking hands with him : " O Roberts ! Is that you ? It 's astonishing how little one makes of the husband of a lady who gives a dinner . In my time -- a long time ago -- he used to carve . But nowadays , when everything is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abolished . Do n't you think , on the whole , Roberts , you 'd better not have come ROBERTS : " Well , you see , I had no excuse . I hated to say an engagement when I had n't any . " LAWTON : " Oh , I understand . You WANTED to come . We all do , when Mrs. Roberts will let us . " He goes and sits down by MRS . ROBERTS , who has taken a more provisional pose on the sofa . " Mrs. Roberts , you 're the only woman in Boston who could hope to get people , with a fireside of their own -- or a register -- out to a Christmas dinner . You know I still wonder at your effrontery a little ? " MRS . ROBERTS , laughing : " I knew I should catch you if I baited my hook with your old friend . " LAWTON : " Yes , nothing would have kept me away when I heard Bemis was coming . But he does n't seem so inflexible in regard to me . Where is he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know . I 'd no idea I was giving such a formal dinner . But everybody , beginning with my own aunt , seems to think it a ceremonious occasion . There are only to be twelve . Do you know the Millers ? " LAWTON : " No , thank goodness ! One meets some people so often that one fancies one 's weariness of them reflected in their sympathetic countenances . Who are these acceptably novel Millers ? " MRS . ROBERTS : " Do explain the Millers to the doctor , Edward . " ROBERTS , standing on the hearth-rug , with his thumbs in his waistcoat pockets : " They board . " LAWTON : " Genus . That accounts for their willingness to flutter round your evening lamp when they ought to be singeing their wings at their own . Well , species ? " ROBERTS : " They 're very nice young newly married people . He 's something or other of some kind of manufactures . And Mrs. Miller is disposed to think that all the other ladies are as fond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Oh ! That is not so , Edward . " LAWTON : " You defend your sex , as women always do . But you 'll admit that , as your friend , Mrs. Miller may have this foible . " MRS . ROBERTS : " I admit nothing of the kind . And we 've invited another young couple who have n't gone to housekeeping yet -- the Curwens . And HE has the same foible as Mrs. Miller . " MRS . ROBERTS takes out her handkerchief , and laughs into it . LAWTON : " That is , if Mrs. Miller has it , which we both deny . Let us hope that Mrs. Miller and Mr. Curwen may not get to making eyes at each other . " ROBERTS : " And Mr. Bemis and his son complete the list . Why , Agnes , there are only ten . You said there were twelve . " MRS . ROBERTS : " Well , never mind . I meant ten . I forgot that the Somerses declined . " A ring is heard . " Ah ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vestibule , and is heard exclaiming without : " Why , Mrs. Miller , is it you ? I thought it was my aunt . Where is Mr. Miller ? " MRS . MILLER , entering the drawing-room arm in arm with her hostess : " Oh , he 'll be here directly . I had to let him run back for my fan . " MRS . ROBERTS : " Well , we 're very glad to have you to begin with . Let me introduce Dr. Lawton . " MRS . MILLER , in a polite murmur : " Dr. Lawton . " In a louder tone : " O Mr. Roberts ! " LAWTON : " You see , Roberts ? The same aggrieved surprise at meeting you here that I felt . " MRS . MILLER : " What in the world do you mean ? " LAWTON : " Do n't you think that when a husband is present at his wife 's dinner party he repeats the mortifying superfluity of a bridegroom at a wedding ? " MRS . MILLER : " I 'm SURE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never think of giving a dinner without Mr. Miller . " LAWTON : " No ? " A ring is heard . " There 's Bemis . " MRS . MILLER : " It 's Mr. Miller . " MRS . ROBERTS : " Aunt Mary at last ! " As she bustles toward the door : " Edward , there are twelve -- Aunt Mary and Willis . " ROBERTS : " Oh , yes . I totally forgot Willis . " LAWTON : " Who 's Willis ? " ROBERTS : " Willis ? Oh , Willis is my wife 's brother . We always have him . " LAWTON : " Oh , yes , Campbell . " MRS . ROBERTS , without : " Mr. Bemis ! So kind of you to come on Christmas . " MR . BEMIS , without : " So kind of you to ask us houseless strangers . " MRS . ROBERTS , without : " I ran out here , thinking it was my aunt . She 's played us a trick , and has n't come yet . " BEMIS , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wo n't fail altogether . I have n't met her for twenty years , and I counted so much upon the pleasure -- Hello , Lawton ! " LAWTON : " Hullo , old fellow ! " They fly at each other , and shake hands . " Glad to see you again . BEMIS , reaching his left hand to MR . ROBERTS , while MR . LAWTON keeps his right : " Ah ! Mr. Roberts . " LAWTON : " Oh , never mind HIM . He 's merely the husband of the hostess . " MRS . MILLER , to ROBERTS : " What DOES he mean ? " ROBERTS : " Oh , nothing . Merely a joke he 's experimenting with . " LAWTON to BEMIS : " Where 's your boy ? " BEMIS : " He 'll be here directly . He preferred to walk . Where 's your girl ? " LAWTON : " Oh , she 'll come by and by . She preferred to drive . " MRS . ROBERTS , introducing them : " Mr. Bemis , have you met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too uneasy to resume even a provisional pose on the sofa , and walks detachedly about the room . BEMIS : " What a lovely apartment Mrs. Roberts has . " MRS . MILLER : " Exquisite ! But then she has such perfect taste . " BEMIS , to MRS . ROBERTS , who drifts near them : " We were talking about your apartment , Mrs. Roberts . It 's charming . " MRS . ROBERTS : " It IS nice . It 's the ideal way of living . All on one floor . No stairs . Nothing . " BEMIS : " Yes , when once you get here ! But that little matter of five pair up " - MRS . ROBERTS : " You do n't mean to say you WALKED up ! Why in the world did n't you take the elevator ? " BEMIS : " I did n't know you had one . " MRS . ROBERTS : " It 's the only thing that makes life worth living in a flat . All these apartment hotels have them . " BEMIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've been away from Boston so long , and am back so short a time , that I ca n't realize your luxuries and conveniences . In Florence we ALWAYS walk up . They have ascenseurs in a few great hotels , and they brag of it in immense signs on the sides of the building . " LAWTON : " What pastoral simplicity ! We are elevated here to a degree that you ca n't conceive of , gentle shepherd . Has yours got an air- cushion , Mrs. Roberts ? " MRS . ROBERTS : " An air-cushion ? What 's that ? " LAWTON : " The only thing that makes your life worth a moment 's purchase in an elevator . You get in with a glass of water , a basket of eggs , and a file of the ' Daily Advertiser . ' They cut the elevator loose at the top , and you drop . " BOTH LADIES : " Oh ! " LAWTON : " In three seconds you arrive at the ground-floor , reading your file of the ' Daily Advertiser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I saw it done in a New York hotel . The air is compressed under the elevator , and acts as a sort of ethereal buffer . " MRS . ROBERTS : " And why do n't we always go down in that way ? " LAWTON : " Because sometimes the walls of the elevator shaft give out . " MRS . ROBERTS : " And what then ? " LAWTON : " Then the elevator stops more abruptly . I had a friend who tried it when this happened . " MRS . ROBERTS : " And what did he do ? " LAWTON : " Stepped out of the elevator ; laughed ; cried ; went home ; got into bed : and did not get up for six weeks . Nervous shock . He was fortunate . " MRS . MILLER : " I should n't think you 'd want an air-cushion on YOUR elevator , Mrs. Roberts . " MRS . ROBERTS : " No , indeed ! Horrid ! " The bell rings . " Edward , YOU go and see if that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Mr. Miller , I know . " BEMIS : " Or my son . " LAWTON : " My voice is for Mrs. Roberts 's brother . I 've given up all hopes of my daughter . " ROBERTS , without : " Oh , Curwen ! Glad to see you ! Thought you were my wife 's aunt . " LAWTON , at a suppressed sigh from MRS . ROBERTS : " It 's one of his jokes , Mrs. Roberts . Of course it 's your aunt . " MRS . ROBERTS , through her set teeth , smilingly : " Oh , if it IS , I 'll make him suffer for it . " MR . CURWEN , without : " No , I hated to wait , so I walked up . " LAWTON : " It is Mr. Curwen , after all , Mrs. Roberts . Now let me see how a lady transmutes a frown of threatened vengeance into a smile of society welcome . " MRS . ROBERTS : " Well , look ! " To MR . CURWEN , who enters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Curwen ! So glad to see you . You know all our friends here -- Mrs . Miller , Dr. Lawton , and Mr. Bemis ? " CURWEN , smiling and bowing , and shaking hands right and left : " Very glad -- very happy -- pleased to know you . " MRS . ROBERTS , behind her fan to Dr. Lawton : " Did n't I do it beautifully ? " LAWTON , behind his hand : " Wonderfully ! And so unconscious of the fact that he has n't his wife with him . " MRS . ROBERTS , in great astonishment , to Mr. Curwen : " Where in the world is Mrs. Curwen ? " CURWEN : " Oh -- oh -- she 'll be here . I thought she was here . She started from home with two right-hand gloves , and I had to go back for a left , and I -- I suppose -- Good heavens ! " pulling the glove out of his pocket . " I ought to have sent it to her in the ladies ' dressing-room . " He remains with the glove held up before him , in spectacular stupefaction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying of you if she were in the dressing-room . " ROBERTS : " Mr. Curwen felt so sure she was there that he would n't wait to take the elevator , and walked up . " Another ring is heard . " Shall I go and meet your aunt NOW , my dear ? " MRS . ROBERTS : " No , indeed ! She may come in now with all the formality she chooses , and I will receive her excuses in state . " She waves her fan softly to and fro , concealing a murmur of trepidation under an indignant air , till the portiere opens , and MR . WILLIS CAMPBELL enters . Then MRS . ROBERTS breaks in nervous agitation " Why , Willis ! Where 's Aunt Mary ? " MRS . MILLER : " And Mr. Miller ? " CURWEN : " And Mrs. Curwen ? " LAWTON : " And my daughter ? " BEMIS : " And my son ? " MR . CAMPBELL , looking tranquilly round on the faces of his interrogators : " Is it a conundrum ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an effort of mock-heroic solemnity : " It is a tragedy ! O Willis dear ! it 's what you see -- what you hear ; a niece without an aunt , a wife without a husband , a father without a son , and another father without a daughter . " ROBERTS : " And a dinner getting cold , and a cook getting hot . " LAWTON : " And you are expected to account for the whole situation . " CAMPBELL : " Oh , I understand ! I do n't know what your little game is , Agnes , but I can wait and see . I 'M not hungry . " MRS . ROBERTS : " Willis , do you think I would try and play a trick on you , if I could ? " CAMPBELL : " I think you ca n't . Come , now , Agnes ! It 's a failure . Own up , and bring the rest of the company out of the next room . I suppose almost anything is allowable at this festive season , but this is pretty feeble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they are not there . " CAMPBELL : " Where are they , then ? " ALL : " That 's what we do n't know . " CAMPBELL : " Oh , come , now ! that 's a little too thin . You do n't know where ANY of all these blood-relations and connections by marriage are ? Well , search me ! " MRS . ROBERTS , in open distress : " Oh , I 'm sure something must have happened to Aunt Mary ! " MRS . MILLER : " I ca n't understand what Ellery C. Miller means . " LAWTON , with a simulated sternness : " I hope you have n't let that son of yours run away with my daughter , Bemis ? " BEMIS : " I 'm afraid he 's come to a pass where he would n't ask MY leave . " CURWEN , re-assuring himself : " Ah , she 's all right , of course . I know that " - BEMIS : " Miss Lawton ? " CURWEN : " No , no -- Mrs . Curwen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agnes ? " MRS . ROBERTS : " Indeed it is , Willis . We 've been expecting her for an hour -- of course she always comes early -- and I 'm afraid she 's been taken ill suddenly . " ROBERTS : " Oh , I do n't think it 's that , my dear . " MRS . ROBERTS : " Oh , of course you never think anything 's wrong , Edward . My whole family might die , and "  - -  MRS . ROBERTS restrains herself , and turns to MR . CAMPBELL , with hysterical cheerfulness : " Who came up in the elevator with you ? " CAMPBELL : " Me ? I did n't come in the elevator . I had my usual luck . The elevator was up somewhere , and after I 'd pressed the annunciator button till my thumb ached , I watched my chance and walked up . " MRS . ROBERTS : " Where was the janitor ? " CAMPBELL : " Where the janitor always is -- nowhere . " LAWTON : " Eating his Christmas dinner , probably . " MRS . ROBERTS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's perfectly spoiled ! Well , friends , I think we 'd better go to dinner -- that 's the only way to bring them . I 'll go out and interview the cook . " Sotto voce to her husband : " If I do n't go somewhere and have a cry , I shall break down here before everybody . Did you ever know anything so strange ? It 's perfectly -- pokerish . " LAWTON : " Yes , there 's nothing like serving dinner to bring the belated guest . It 's as infallible as going without an umbrella when it wo n't rain . " CAMPBELL : " No , no ! Wait a minute , Roberts . You might sit down without one guest , but you ca n't sit down without five . It 's the old joke about the part of Hamlet . I 'll just step round to Aunt Mary 's house -- why , I 'll be back in three minutes . " MRS . ROBERTS , with perfervid gratitude : " Oh , how GOOD you are , Willis ! You do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have ! Why could n't we have thought of sending for her ? O Willis , I can never be grateful enough to you ! But you always think of everything . " ROBERTS : " I accept my punishment meekly , Willis , since it 's in your honor . " LAWTON : " It 's a simple and beautiful solution , Mrs. Roberts , as far as your aunt 's concerned ; but I do n't see how it helps the rest of us . " MRS . MILLER to MR . CAMPBELL : " If you meet Mr. Miller " - CURWEN : " Or my wife " - BEMIS : " Or my son " - LAWTON : " Or my daughter " - CAMPBELL : " I 'll tell them they 've just one chance in a hundred to save their lives , and that one is open to them for just five minutes . " LAWTON : " Tell my daughter that I 've been here half an hour , and everybody knows I drove here with her . " BEMIS : " Tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and let him drive . " MRS . MILLER : " Tell Mr. Miller I found I had my fan after all . " CURWEN : " And Mrs. Curwen that I 've got her glove all right . " He holds it up . MRS . ROBERTS , at a look of mystification and demand from her brother : " Never mind explanations , Willis . They 'll understand , and we 'll explain when you get back . " LAWTON , examining the glove which CURWEN holds up : " Why , so it IS right ! " CURWEN : " What do you mean ? " LAWTON : " Were you sent back to get a LEFT glove ? " CURWEN : " Yes , yes ; of course . " LAWTON : " Well , if you 'll notice , this is a right one . The one at home is left . " CURWEN , staring helplessly at it : " Gracious Powers ! what shall I do ? " LAWTON : " Pray that Mrs. Curwen may NEVER come . " MR . CURWEN , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the time Mr. Campbell returns . " MRS . MILLER , with tokens of breaking down visible to MRS . ROBERTS : " I wonder what could have kept Mr. Miller . It 's so very mysterious , I " - MRS . ROBERTS , suddenly seizing her by the arm , and hurrying her from the room : " Now , Mrs. Miller , you 've just got time to see my baby . " MR . ROBERTS , winking at his remaining guests : " A little cry will do them good . I saw as soon as Willis came in instead of her aunt , that my wife could n't get through without it . They 'll come back as bright as " - LAWTON : " Bemis , should you mind a bereaved father falling upon your neck ? " BEMIS : " Yes , Lawton , I think I should . " LAWTON : " Well , it IS rather odd about all those people . You can say of one or two that they 've been delayed , but five people ca n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a coincidence . Hello ! What 's that ? " ROBERTS : " What 's what ? " LAWTON : " I thought I heard a cry . " ROBERTS : " Very likely you did . They profess to deaden these floors so that you ca n't hear from one apartment to another . But I know pretty well when my neighbor overhead is trying to wheel his baby to sleep in a perambulator at three o'clock in the morning ; and I guess our young lady lets the people below understand when she 's wakeful . But it 's the only way to live , after all . I would n't go back to the old up-and-down-stairs , house-in-a-block system on any account . Here we all live on the ground-floor practically . The elevator equalizes everything . " BEMIS : " Yes , when it happens to be where you are . I believe I prefer the good old Florentine fashion of walking upstairs , after all . " LAWTON : " Roberts , I DID hear something . Hark ! It sounded like a cry for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervous , doctor . It 's nothing . However , it 's easy enough to go out and see . " He goes out to the door of the apartment , and immediately returns . He beckons to DR . LAWTON and MR . BEMIS , with a mysterious whisper : " Come here both of you . Do n't alarm the ladies . " II . In the interior of the elevator are seated MRS . ROBERTS 'S AUNT MARY ( MRS . CRASHAW ) , MRS . CURWEN , and MISS LAWTON ; MR . MILLER and MR . ALFRED BEMIS are standing with their hats in their hands . They are in dinner costume , with their overcoats on their arms , and the ladies ' draperies and ribbons show from under their outer wraps , where they are caught up , and held with that caution which characterizes ladies in sitting attitudes which they have not been able to choose deliberately . As they talk together , the elevator rises very slowly , and they continue talking for some time before they observe that it has stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we are all here together . I ought to have been here half an hour ago , but I was kept at home by an accident to my finery , and before I could be put in repair I heard it striking the quarter past . I do n't know what my niece will say to me . I hope you good people will all stand by me if she should be violent . " MILLER : " In what a poor man may with his wife 's fan , you shall command me , Mrs. Crashaw . " He takes the fan out , and unfurls it . MRS . CRASHAW : " Did she send you back for it ? " MILLER : " I should n't have had the pleasure of arriving with you if she had n't . " MRS . CRASHAW , laughing , to MRS . CURWEN : " What did you send YOURS back for , my dear ? " MRS . CURWEN , thrusting out one hand gloved , and the other ungloved : " I did n't want two rights . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's rights ? " MRS . CURWEN : " Oh , so young and so depraved ! Are all the young men in Florence so bad ? " Surveying her extended arms , which she turns over : " I do n't know that I need have sent him for the other glove . I could have explained to Mrs. Roberts . Perhaps she would have forgiven my coming in one glove . " MILLER , looking down at the pretty arms : " If she had seen you without . " MRS . CURWEN : " Oh , you were looking ! " She rapidly involves her arms in her wrap . Then she suddenly unwraps them , and regards them thoughtfully . " What if he should bring a ten-button instead of an eight ! And he 's quite capable of doing it . " MILLER : " Are there such things as ten-button gloves ? " MRS . CURWEN : " You would think there were ten-thousand button gloves if you had them to button . " MILLER : " It would depend upon whom I had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For Mrs. Miller , for example . " MRS . CRASHAW : " We women are too bad , always sending people back for something . It 's well the men do n't know HOW bad . " MRS . CURWEN : " ' Sh ! Mr. Miller is listening . And he thought we were perfect . He asks nothing better than to be sent back for his wife 's fan . And he does n't say anything even under his breath when she finds she 's forgotten it , and begins , ' Oh , dearest , my fan '  - -  Mr . Curwen does . But he goes all the same . I hope you have your father in good training , Miss Lawton . You must commence with your father , if you expect your husband to be ' good . ' " MISS LAWTON : " Then mine will never behave , for papa is perfectly incorrigible . " MRS . CURWEN : " I 'm sorry to hear such a bad report of him . Should n't YOU think he would be ' good , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should think he would try . " MRS . CURWEN : " A diplomat , as well as a punster already ! I must warn Miss Lawton . " MRS . CRASHAW , interposing to spare the young people : " What an amusing thing elevator etiquette is ! Why should the gentlemen take their hats off ? Why do n't you take your hats off in a horse-car ? " MILLER : " The theory is that the elevator is a room . " YOUNG MR . BEMIS : " We were at a hotel in London where they called it the Ascending Room . " MISS LAWTON : " Oh , how amusing ! " MILLER , looking about : " This is a regular drawing-room for size and luxury . They 're usually such cribs in these hotels . " MRS . CRASHAW : " Yes , it 's very nice , though I say it that should n't of my niece 's elevator . The worst about it is , it 's so slow . " MILLER : " Let 's hope it 's sure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevators in America go up like express trains . " MRS . CURWEN , drawing her shawl about her shoulders , as if to be ready to step out : " Well , I never get into one without taking my life in my hand , and my heart in my mouth . I suppose every one really expects an elevator to drop with them , some day , just as everybody really expects to see a ghost some time . " MRS . CRASHAW : " Oh , my dear ! what an extremely disagreeable subject of conversation . " MRS . CURWEN : " I ca n't help it , Mrs. Crashaw . When I reflect that there are two thousand elevators in Boston , and that the inspectors have just pronounced a hundred and seventy of them unsafe , I 'm so desperate when I get into one that I could -- flirt ! " MILLER , guarding himself with the fan : " Not with me ? " MISS LAWTON , to young MR . BEMIS : " How it DOES creep ! " YOUNG MR . BEMIS , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " MRS . CRASHAW : " Why , it does n't go at all ! It 's stopped . Let us get out . " They all rise . THE ELEVATOR BOY , pulling at the rope : " We 're not there , yet . " MRS . CRASHAW , with mingled trepidation and severity : " Not there ? What are you stopping , then , for ? " THE ELEVATOR BOY : " I do n't know . It seems to be caught . " MRS . CRASHAW : " Caught ? " MISS LAWTON : " Oh , dear ! " YOUNG MR . BEMIS : " Do n't mind . " MILLER : " Caught ? Nonsense ! " MRS . CURWEN : " WE 'RE caught , I should say . " She sinks back on the seat . THE ELEVATOR BOY : " Seemed to be going kind of funny all day ! " He keeps tugging at the rope . MILLER , arresting the boy 's efforts : " Well , hold on -- stop ! What are you doing ? " THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " MILLER : " Well , do n't be so -- violent about it . You might break something . " THE ELEVATOR BOY : " Break a wire rope like that ! " MILLER : " Well , well , be quiet now . Ladies , I think you 'd better sit down -- and as gently as possible . I would n't move about much . " MRS . CURWEN : " Move ! We 're stone . And I wish for my part I were a feather . " MILLER , to the boy : " Er -- a -- er -- where do you suppose we are ? " THE ELEVATOR BOY : " We 're in the shaft between the fourth and fifth floors . " He attempts a fresh demonstration on the rope , but is prevented . MILLER : " Hold on ! Er -- er " - MRS . CRASHAW , as if the boy had to be communicated with through an interpreter : " Ask him if it 's ever happened before . " MILLER : " Yes . Were you ever caught before ? " THE ELEVATOR BOY : " No . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CRASHAW : " Ask him if the elevator has a safety device . " MILLER : " Has it got a safety device ? " THE ELEVATOR BOY : " How should I know ? " MILLER : " He says he do n't know . " MRS . CURWEN , in a shriek of hysterical laughter : " Why , he understands English ! " MRS . CRASHAW , sternly ignoring the insinuation : " Ask him if there 's any means of calling the janitor . " MILLER : " Could you call the janitor ? " THE ELEVATOR BOY , ironically : " Well , there ai n't any telephone attachment . " MILLER , solemnly : " No , he says there is n't . " MRS . CRASHAW , sinking back on the seat with resignation : " Well , I do n't know what my niece will say . " MISS LAWTON : " Poor papa ! " YOUNG MR . BEMIS , gathering one of her wandering hands into his : " Do n't be frightened . I 'm sure there 's no danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she ca n't drop . The cogs in the runs wo n't let her ! " ALL : " Oh ! " MILLER , with a sigh of relief : " I knew there must be something of the kind . Well , I wish my wife had her fan . " MRS . CURWEN : " And if I had my left glove I should be perfectly happy . Not that I know what the cogs in the runs are ! " MRS . CRASHAW : " Then we 're merely caught here ? " MILLER : " That 's all . " MRS . CURWEN : " It 's quite enough for the purpose . Could n't you put on a life-preserver , Mr. Miller , and go ashore and get help from the natives ? " MISS LAWTON , putting her handkerchief to her eyes : " Oh , dear ! " MRS . CRASHAW , putting her arm around her : " Do n't be frightened , my child . There 's no danger . " YOUNG MR . BEMIS , caressing the hand which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LAWTON : " Do n't leave me . " YOUNG MR . BEMIS : " No , no ; I wo n't . Keep fast hold of my hand . " MISS LAWTON : " Oh , yes , I will ! I 'm ashamed to cry . " YOUNG MR . BEMIS , fervently : " Oh , you need n't be ! It is perfectly natural you should . " MRS . CURWEN : " I 'm too badly scared for tears . Mr. Miller , you seem to be in charge of this expedition -- could n't you do something ? Throw out ballast , or let the boy down in a parachute ? Or I 've read of a shipwreck where the survivors , in an open boat , joined in a cry , and attracted the notice of a vessel that was going to pass them . We might join in a cry . " MILLER : " Oh , it 's all very well joking , Mrs. Curwen " - MRS . CURWEN : " You call it joking ! " MILLER : " But it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know how we 're to get out . We ca n't join in a cry , and rouse the whole house . It would be ridiculous . " MRS . CURWEN : " And our present attitude is so eminently dignified ! Well , I suppose we shall have to cast lots pretty soon to see which of us shall be sacrificed to nourish the survivors . It 's long past dinner-time . " MISS LAWTON , breaking down : " Oh , DO N'T say such terrible things . " YOUNG MR . BEMIS , indignantly comforting her : " Do n't , do n't cry . There 's no danger . It 's perfectly safe . " MILLER to THE ELEVATOR BOY : " Could n't you climb up the cable , and get on to the landing , and -- ah !  - -  get somebody ? " THE ELEVATOR BOY : " I could , maybe , if there was a hole in the roof . " MILLER , glancing up : " Ah ! true . " MRS . CRASHAW , with an old lady 's serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of anything to do for us ? " THE ELEVATOR BOY yielding to the touch of humanity , and bursting into tears : " No , ma'am , I ca n't . And everybody 's blamin ' me , as if I done it . What 's my poor mother goin ' to do ? " MRS . CRASHAW , soothingly : " But you said the runs in the cogs " - THE ELEVATOR BOY : " How can I tell ! That 's what they say . They hai n't never been tried . " MRS . CURWEN , springing to her feet : " There ! I knew I should . Oh "  --  She sinks fainting to the floor . MRS . CRASHAW , abandoning Miss Lawton to the ministrations of young Mr. Bemis , while she kneels beside Mrs. Curwen. and chafes her hand : " Oh , poor thing ! I knew she was overwrought by the way she was keeping up . Give her air , Mr. Miller . Open a -- Oh , there is n't any window ! " MILLER , dropping on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ! Wake up , Mrs. Curwen . I did n't mean to scold you for joking . I did n't , indeed . I -- I -- I do n't know what the deuce I 'm up to . " He gathers Mrs. Curwen 's inanimate form in his arms , and fans her face where it lies on his shoulder . " I do n't know what my wife would say if " - MRS . CRASHAW : " She would say that you were doing your duty . " MILLER , a little consoled : " Oh , do you think so ? Well , perhaps . " YOUNG MR . BEMIS : " Do you feel faint at all , Miss Lawton ? " MISS LAWTON : " No , I think not . No , not if you say it 's safe . " YOUNG MR . BEMIS : " Oh , I 'm sure it is ! " MISS LAWTON , renewing her hold upon his hand : " Well , then ! Perhaps I hurt you ? " YOUNG MR . BEMIS : " No , no ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind you are ! " MRS . CURWEN , opening her eyes : " Where " - MILLER , rapidly transferring her to Mrs. Crashaw : " Still in the elevator , Mrs. Curwen . " Rising to his feet : " Something must be done . Perhaps we HAD better unite in a cry . It 's ridiculous , of course . But it 's the only thing we can do . Now , then ! Hello ! " MISS LAWTON : " Papa ! " MRS . CRASHAW : " Agne-e-e-s ! " MRS . CURWEN , faintly : " Walter ! " THE ELEVATOR BOY : " Say ! " MILLER : " Oh , that wo n't do . All join in ' Hello ! ' " ALL : " Hello ! " MILLER : " Once more ! " ALL : " Hello ! " MILLER : " ONCE more ! " ALL : " Hello ! " MILLER : " Now wait a while . " After an interval : " No , nobody coming . " He takes out his watch . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , then ! " They all join in the cry , repeating it as MR . MILLER makes the signal with his lifted hand . MISS LAWTON : " Oh , it 's no use ! " MRS . CRASHAW : " They do n't hear . " MRS . CURWEN : " They WO N'T hear . " MILLER : " Now , then , three times ! " ALL : " Hello ! hello ! hello ! " III . ROBERTS appears at the outer door of his apartment on the fifth floor . It opens upon a spacious landing , to which a wide staircase ascends at one side . At the other is seen the grated door to the shaft of the elevator . He peers about on all sides , and listens for a moment before he speaks . ROBERTS : " Hello yourself . " MILLER , invisibly from the shaft : " Is that you , Roberts ? " ROBERTS : " Yes ; where in the world are you ? " MILLER : " In the elevator . " MRS . CRASHAW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROBERTS : " What ! You , Aunt Mary ! " MRS . CRASHAW : " Yes . Did n't I say so ? " ROBERTS : " Why do n't you come up ? " MILLER : " We ca n't . The elevator has got stuck somehow . " ROBERTS : " Got stuck ? Bless my soul ! How did it happen ? How long have you been there ? " MRS . CURWEN : " Since the world began ! " MILLER : " What 's the use asking how it happened ? We do n't know , and we do n't care . What we want to do is to get out . " ROBERTS : " Yes , yes ! Be careful ! " He rises from his frog-like posture at the grating , and walks the landing in agitation . " Just hold on a minute ! " MILLER : " Oh , WE sha' n't stir . " ROBERTS : " I 'll see what can be done . " MILLER : " Well , see quick , please . We have plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any . Do n't alarm Mrs. Miller , if you can help it . " ROBERTS : " No , no . " MRS . CURWEN : " You MAY alarm Mr. Curwen . " ROBERTS : " What ! Are YOU there ? " MRS . CURWEN : " Here ? I 've been here all my life ! " ROBERTS : " Ha ! ha ! ha ! That 's right . We 'll soon have you out . Keep up your spirits . " MRS . CURWEN : " But I 'm NOT keeping them up . " MISS LAWTON : " Tell papa I 'm here too . " ROBERTS : " What ! You too , Miss Lawton ? " MRS . CRASHAW : " Yes , and young Mr. Bemis . Did n't I TELL you we were all here ? " ROBERTS : " I could n't realize it . Well , wait a moment . " MRS . CURWEN : " Oh , you can trust us to wait . " ROBERTS , returning with DR . LAWTON , and MR . BEMIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the shaft : " They 're just under here in the well of the elevator , midway between the two stories . " LAWTON : " Ha ! ha ! ha ! You do n't say so . " BEMIS : " Bless my heart ! What are they doing there ? " MILLER : " We 're not doing anything . " MRS . CURWEN : " We 're waiting for you to do something . " MISS LAWTON : " Oh , papa ! " LAWTON : " Do n't be troubled , Lou , we 'll soon have you out . " YOUNG MR . BEMIS : " Do n't be alarmed , sir , Miss Lawton is all right . " MISS LAWTON : " Yes , I 'm not frightened , papa . " LAWTON : " Well , that 's a great thing in cases of this kind . How did you happen to get there ? " MILLER , indignantly : " How do you suppose ? We came up in the elevator . " LAWTON : " Well , why did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " The elevator would n't . " LAWTON : " What seems to be the matter ? " MILLER : " We do n't know . " LAWTON : " Have you tried to start it ? " MILLER : " Well , I 'll leave that to your imagination . " LAWTON : " Well , be careful what you do . You might " - MILLER , interrupting : " Roberts , who 's that talking ? " ROBERTS , coming forward politely : " Oh , excuse me ! I forgot that you did n't know each other . Dr. Lawton , Mr. Miller . " Introducing them . LAWTON : " Glad to know you . " MILLER : " Very happy to make your acquaintance , and hope some day to see you . And now , if you have completed your diagnosis " MRS . CURWEN : " None of us have ever had it before , doctor ; nor any of our families , so far as we know . " LAWTON : " Ha ! ha ! ha ! Very good ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all out of there presently . " BEMIS : " Yes , remain perfectly still . " ROBERTS : " Yes , we 'll have you out . Just wait . " MILLER : " You seem to think we 're going to run away . Why should n't we keep quiet ? Do you suppose we 're going to be very boisterous , shut up here like rats in a trap ? " MRS . CURWEN : " Or birds in a cage , if you want a more pleasing image . " MRS . CRASHAW : " How are you going to get us out , Edward ? " ROBERTS : " We do n't know yet . But keep quiet " - MILLER : " Keep quiet ! Great heavens ! we 're afraid to stir a finger . Now do n't say ' keep quiet ' any more , for we ca n't stand it . " LAWTON : " He 's in open rebellion . What are you going to do , Roberts ? " ROBERTS , rising and scratching his head : " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole in the roof . " LAWTON : " Ah , I do n't think that would do . Besides you 'd have to get a carpenter . " ROBERTS : " That 's true . And it would make a racket , and alarm the house "  - -  staring desperately at the grated doorway of the shaft . " If I could only find an elevator man -- an elevator builder ! But of course they all live in the suburbs , and they 're keeping Christmas , and it would take too long , anyway . " BEMIS : " Had n't you better send for the police ? It seems to me it 's a case for the authorities . " LAWTON : " Ah , there speaks the Europeanized mind ! They always leave the initiative to the authorities . Go out and sound the fire-alarm , Roberts . It 's a case for the Fire Department . " ROBERTS : " Oh , it 's all very well to joke , Dr. Lawton . Why do n't you prescribe something ? " LAWTON : " Surgical treatment seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ROBERTS : " If Willis were only here , he 'd find some way out of it . Well , I 'll have to go for help somewhere " - MRS . ROBERTS and MRS . MILLER , bursting upon the scene : " Oh , what is it ? " LAWTON : " Ah , you need n't go for help , my dear fellow . It 's come ! " MRS . ROBERTS : " What are you all doing here , Edward ? " MRS . MILLER : " Oh , have you had any bad news of Mr. Miller ? " MRS . ROBERTS : " Or Aunt Mary ? " MILLER , calling up : " Well , are you going to keep us here all night ? Why do n't you do something ? " MRS . MILLER : " Oh , what 's that ? Oh , it 's Mr. Miller ! Oh , where are you , Ellery ? " MILLER : " In the elevator . " MRS . MILLER : " Oh ! and where is the elevator ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MILLER : " It 's caught , and we ca n't . " MRS . MILLER : " Caught ? Oh , then you will be killed -- killed -- killed ! And it 's all my fault , sending you back after my fan , and I had it all the time in my own pocket ; and it comes from my habit of giving it to you to carry in your overcoat pocket , because it 's deep , and the fan ca n't break . And of course I never thought of my own pocket , and I never SHOULD have thought of it at all if Mr. Curwen had n't been going back to get Mrs. Curwen 's glove , for he 'd brought another right after she 'd sent him for a left , and we were all having such a laugh about it , and I just happened to put my hand on my pocket , and there I felt the fan . And oh , WHAT shall I do ? " Mrs. Miller utters these explanations and self-reproaches in a lamentable voice , while crouching close to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its meshes . MILLER : " Well , well , it 's all right . I 've got you another fan , here . Do n't be frightened . " MRS . ROBERTS , wildly : " Where 's Aunt Mary , Edward ? Has Willis got back ? " At a guilty look from her husband : " Edward ! DO N'T tell me that SHE 'S in that elevator ! Do n't do it , Edward ! For your own sake do n't . Do n't tell me that your own child 's mother 's aunt is down there , suspended between heaven and earth like -- like " - LAWTON : " The coffin of the Prophet . " MRS . ROBERTS : " Yes . DO N'T tell me , Edward ! Spare your child 's mother , if you wo n't spare your wife ! " MRS . CRASHAW : " Agnes ! do n't be ridiculous . I 'm here , and I never was more comfortable in my life . " MRS . ROBERTS , calling down the grating " Oh ! Is it you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course it is ! " MRS . ROBERTS : " You recognize my voice ? " MRS . CRASHAW : " I should hope so , indeed ! Why should n't I ? " MRS . ROBERTS : " And you know me ? Agnes ? Oh ! " MRS . CRASHAW : " Do n't be a goose , Agnes . " MRS . ROBERTS : " Oh , it IS you , aunty . It IS ! Oh , I 'm SO glad ! I 'm SO happy ! But keep perfectly still , aunty dear , and we 'll soon have you out . Think of baby , and do n't give way . " MRS . CRASHAW : " I shall not , if the elevator does n't , you may depend upon that . " MRS . ROBERTS : " Oh , what courage you DO have ! But keep up your spirits ! Mrs. Miller and I have just come from seeing baby . She 's gone to sleep with all her little presents in her arms . The children did want to see you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind that now , Aunt Mary . I 'm only too thankful to have you at all ! " MRS . CRASHAW : " I wish you did have me ! And if you will all stop talking and try some of you to do something , I shall be greatly obliged to you . It 's worse than it was in the sleeping car that night . " MRS . ROBERTS : " Oh , do you remember it , Aunt Mary ? Oh , how funny you are ! " Turning heroically to her husband : " Now , Edward , dear , get them out . If it 's necessary , get them out over my dead body . Anything ! Only hurry . I will be calm ; I will be patient . But you must act instantly . Oh , here comes Mr. Curwen ! " MR . CURWEN mounts the stairs to the landing with every sign of exhaustion , as if he had made a very quick run to and from his house . " Oh , HE will help -- I know he will ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below here with my aunt in it and Mrs. Miller 's husband " - LAWTON : " And my girl . " BEMIS : " And my boy . " MRS . CURWEN , calling up : " And your wife ! " CURWEN , horror-struck : " And my wife ! Oh , heavenly powers ! what are we going to do ? How shall we get them out ? Why do n't they come up ? " ALL : " They ca n't . " CURWEN : " Ca n't ? Oh , my goodness ! " He flies at the grating , and kicks and beats it . ROBERTS : " Hold on ! What 's the use of that ? " LAWTON : " You could n't get at them if you beat the door down . " BEMIS : " Certainly not . " They lay hands upon him and restrain him . CURWEN , struggling : " Let me speak to my wife ! Will you prevent a husband from speaking to his own wife ? " MRS . MILLER , in blind admiration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . If some one had beaten the door in at once " - MRS . ROBERTS : " Oh , Edward , dear , let him speak to his wife . " Tearfully : " Think if I were there ! " ROBERTS , releasing him : " He may speak to his wife all night . But he must n't knock the house down . " CURWEN , rushing at the grating : " Caroline ! Can you hear me ? Are you safe ? " MRS . CURWEN : " Perfectly . I had a little faint when we first stuck " - CURWEN : " Faint ? Oh ! " MRS . CURWEN : " But I am all right now . " CURWEN : " Well , that 's right . Do n't be frightened ! There 's no occasion for excitement . Keep perfectly calm and collected . It 's the only way -- What 's that ringing ? " The sound of an electric bell is heard within the elevator . It increases in fury . MRS . ROBERTS and MRS . MILLER : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BOY : " It 's somebody on the ground-floor callin ' the elevator ! " CURWEN : " Well , never mind him . Do n't pay the slightest attention to him . Let him go to the deuce ! And , Caroline ! " MRS . CURWEN : " Yes ? " CURWEN : " I -- I -- I 've got your glove all right . " MRS . CURWEN : " Left , you mean , I hope ? " CURWEN : " Yes , left , dearest ! I MEAN left . " MRS . CURWEN : " Eight-button ? " CURWEN : " Yes . " MRS . CURWEN : " Light drab ? " CURWEN , pulling a light yellow glove from his pocket : " Oh ! " He staggers away from the grating and stays himself against the wall , the mistaken glove dangling limply from his hand . ROBERTS , LAWTON , and BEMIS : " Ah ! ha ! ha ! ha ! " MRS . ROBERTS : " Oh , for shame ! to laugh at such a time ! " MRS . MILLER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . There ! The ringing 's stopped . What 's that ? " Steps are heard mounting the stairway rapidly , several treads at a time . Mr. Campbell suddenly bursts into the group on the landing with a final bound from the stairway . " Oh ! " CAMPBELL : " I ca n't find Aunt Mary , Agnes . I ca n't find anything --  not even the elevator . Where 's the elevator ? I rang for it down there till I was black in the face . " MRS . ROBERTS : " No wonder ! It 's here . " MRS . MILLER : " Between this floor and the floor below . With my husband in it . " CURWEN : " And my wife ! " LAWTON : " And my daughter ! " BEMIS : " And my son ! " MRS . ROBERTS : " And aunty ! " ALL : " And it 's stuck fast . " ROBERTS : " And the long and short of it is , Willis , that we do n't know how to get them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " LAWTON : " There 's been a great tacit confidence among us in your executive ability and your inventive genius . " MRS . ROBERTS : " Oh , yes , we know you can do it . " MRS . MILLER : " If you ca n't , nothing can save them . " CAMPBELL , going to the grating : " Miller ! " MILLER : " Well ? " CAMPBELL : " Start her up ! " MILLER : " Now , look here , Campbell , we are not going to stand that ; we 've had enough of it . I speak for the whole elevator . Do n't you suppose that if it had been possible to start her up we " - MRS . CURWEN : " We should n't have been at the moon by this time . " CAMPBELL : " Well , then , start her DOWN ! " MILLER : " I never thought of that . " To the ELEVATOR BOY : " Start her down . " To the people on the landing above : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , NOW start her up ! " A joint cry from the elevator : " Thank you ! we 'll walk up this time . " MILLER : " Here ! let us out at this landing ! " They are heard precipitately emerging , with sighs and groans of relief , on the floor below . MRS . ROBERTS , devoutly : " O Willis , it seems like an interposition of Providence , your coming just at this moment . " CAMPBELL : " Interposition of common sense ! These hydraulic elevators weaken sometimes , and ca n't go any farther . " ROBERTS , to the shipwrecked guests , who arrive at the top of the stairs , crestfallen , spent , and clinging to one another for support : " Why did n't you think of starting her down , some of you ? " MRS . ROBERTS , welcoming them with kisses and hand-shakes : " I should have thought it would occur to you at once . " MILLER , goaded to exasperation : " Did it occur to any of YOU ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ALL of us . But we naturally supposed you had tried it . " MRS . MILLER , taking possession of her husband : " Oh , what a fright you have given us ! " MILLER : " I given you ! Do you suppose I did it out of a joke , or voluntarily ? " MRS . ROBERTS : " Aunty , I do n't know what to say to you . YOU ought to have been here long ago , before anything happened . " MRS . CRASHAW : " Oh , I can explain everything in due season . What I wish you to do now is to let me get at Willis , and kiss him . " As CAMPBELL submits to her embrace : " You dear , good fellow ! If it had n't been for your presence of mind , I do n't know how we should ever have got out of that horrid pen . " MRS . CURWEN , giving him her hand : " As it is n't proper for ME to kiss you " CAMPBELL : " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be TOO modest . " MRS . CURWEN : " I think I shall have to vote you a service of plate . " MRS . ROBERTS : " Come and look at the pattern of mine . And , Willis , as you are the true hero of the occasion , you shall take me in to dinner . And I am not going to let anybody go before you . " She seizes his arm , and leads the way from the landing into the apartment . ROBERTS , LAWTON , and BEMIS follow stragglingly . MRS . MILLER , getting her husband to one side : " When she fainted , she fainted AT you , of course ! What did you do ? " MILLER : " Who ? I ! Oh ! " After a moment 's reflection : " She came to ! " CURWEN , getting his wife aside : " When you fainted , Caroline , who revived you ? " MRS . CURWEN : " Who ? ME ? Oh ! How should I know ? I was insensible . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MRS . MILLER in the middle . MRS . CURWEN yields precedence with an ironical courtesy : " After you , Mrs. Miller ! " MRS . MILLER , in a nervous , inimical twitter : " Oh , before the heroine of the lost elevator ? " MRS . CURWEN , dropping her husband 's arm , and taking MRS . MILLER 'S : " Let us split the difference . " MRS . MILLER : " Delightful ! I shall never forget the honor . " MRS . CURWEN : " Oh , do n't speak of honors ! Mr. Miller was SO kind through all those terrible scenes in the elevator . " MRS . MILLER : " I 've no doubt you showed yourself duly grateful . " They pass in , followed by their husbands . YOUNG MR . BEMIS , timidly : " Miss Lawton , in the elevator you asked me not to leave you . Did you -- ah -- mean -- I MUST ask you ; it may be my only chance ; if you meant -- never ? " MISS LAWTON , dropping her head : " I -- I -- don't -- know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WISHED never to leave you , should you send me away ? " MISS LAWTON , with a shy , sly upward glance at him : " Not in the elevator ! " YOUNG MR . BEMIS : " Oh ! " MRS . ROBERTS , re-appearing at the door : " Why , you good-for-nothing young things , why do n't you come to -- Oh ! excuse me ! " She re-enters precipitately , followed by her tardy guests , on whom she casts a backward glance of sympathy . " Oh , you NEED N'T hurry ! "
