MARY MOODY EMERSON.1 I wisn to meet the invitation with which the ladies have honored me , by offering them a portrait of real life . It is a representative life , such as could hardly have appeared out of New England ; of an age now past , and of which , I think , no types survive . Perhaps I deceive myself and overestimate its interest . It has to me a value like that which many readers find in Madame Guyon , in Rahel , in Eugiuie de Gu6rin , but it 1 Aunt of Mr. Emerson , and a potent influence on the lives of him and his brothers . This paper was read before the Woman 's Club , in Boston , several years ago , under the title Amita , which is purely original and hardly admits of a duplicate . Then it is a fruit of Calvinism and New England , and marks the precise time when the power of the old Creed yielded to the influence of Modern Science and humanity . I have found that I could only bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heroine , premising a sketch of her time and place . I report some of the thoughts and soliloquies of a country girl , poor , was also the original superscription of the Nun 's Aspiration , in his Poems ; a rendering into verse of a passage in Miss Emerson 's diary . // solitary , - . " a goody , " as she called herself , - growing from youth to age amid slender opportunities and usually very humble company . Mary Moody Emerson was born just before the outbreak of the Revolution . When introduced to Lafayette at Portland , she told him that she was " in arms " at the Concord fight . Her father , the minister of Concord , a warm patriot in 1775 , who went as a chaplain to the American army at Ticonderoga , carried his infant daughter , before he went , to his mother in Maiden , and told her to keep the child until he returned . He died , at Rutland , Vermont , of army fever , the next year , and Mary remained at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this relative , with her father 's sister , in whose house she grew up , rarely seeing her brothers and sisters in Concord . This aunt and her husband lived on a farm , were getting old , and the husband a shiftless , easy man . There was plenty of work for the little niece to do day by day , and not always bread enough in t , he house . One of her tasks , it appears , was to watch for the approach of the deputy-sheriff , who might come to confiscate the spoons or arrest the uncle for debt . Later another aunt who had become insane , was brought hither to end her days . More and sadder work for this young girl . She had no companions , lived in entire solitude with these old people , very rarely cheered by short visits from her brothers and sisters . Her mother had married again , married the minister who succeeded her husband in the parish at Concord ( Dr. Ezra Ripley ) , and had now a young family growing up around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and persuaded the family to give her up to them as a daughter , on some terms embracing a care of her future interests . She would leave the farm to her , by will . This promise was kept ; Mary came into possession of the farm many years after , and her deali ' *gs with it gave her no small trouble , though they give much piquancy to her letters in after years . Finally it was sold , and its price invested in a share of a farm in Maine , and she lived there as a boarder , with her sister , for many years . The farm was in a picturesque country , within sight of the White Mountains , with a little lake in front , at the foot of a high hill , called Bear Mountain . Not far from the hou* was a brook running over a granite floor like the Franconia Flume , and noble forests around . Every word she writes about this farm ( " Elm Vale , " Waterford ) , her dealings and vexations about it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a romance , and to those who may hereafter read her letters , will make its obscure acres amiable . In Malden she lived through all her youth and early womanhood , with the habit of visiting the families of her brothers and sisters on any necessity of theirs . Her good-will to serve in time of sickness or of pressure was known to them , and promptly claimed , and her attachment to the youths and maidens growing up in those families was secure for any trait of talent or of character . Her sympathy for young people who pleased her was almost passionate , and was sure to make her arrival in each house a holiday . Her early reading was Milton , Young , Akenside , Samuel Clarke , Jonathan Edwards , and always the Bible . Later , Plato , Plotinus , Marcus Antoninus , Stewart , Coleridge , Cousin , Herder , Locke , Madame De Sta*l , Channing , Mackintosh , Byron . Nobody can read in her manuscript , or recall the conversation of old-school people , without seeing that Milton and Young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slight , merely entertaining quality of modern bards . And Plato , Aristotle , Plot*inus , - how venerable and organic as Nature they are in her mind ! What a subject is her mind and life // for the finest novel ! When I read Dante , the other day , and his paraphrases to signify with more adequateness Christ or Jehovah , whom do you think I was reminded of ? Whom but Mary Emerson and her eloquent theol-ogy ? She had a deep sympathy with genius . When it was unhallowed , as in Byron , she had none the less , whilst she deplored and affected to denounce him . But she adored it when ennobled by character . She liked to notice that the greatest geniuses have died ignorant of their power and influence . She wished you to scorn to shine . " My opinion , " she writes , is " that a mind like Byron 's would never be satisfied with modern Unitarianism , - that the fiery depths of Calvinism , its high and mysterious elections to eternal bliss , heyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been fitted to fix his imagination . " Her wit was so fertile , and only used to strike , that she never used it for display , any more than a wasp would parade his sting . It was ever the will and not the phrase that concerned her . Yet certain expressions , when they marked a memorable state of mind in her experience , recurred to her afterwards , and she would vindicate herself as having said to Dr. R. , or Uncle IL. , so and so , at such a period of her life . But they were intensely true when first spoken . All her language was happy , but inimitable , unattainable by talent , as if caught from some dream . She calls herself " the puny pilgrim , whose sole talent is sympathy . " " I like that kind of apathy that is a triumph to overset . " She writes to her nephew Charles *Emerson , in 1833 , " I could never have adorned the garden . If I had been in aught but dreary deserts , I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haughty . I never expected connections and matrimony . My taste was formed in romance , and I knew I was not destined to please . I love God and his creation as I never else could . I scarcely feel the sympathies of this life enough to agitate the pool . This in general , one case or so excepted , and even this is a relation to God through you . T was so in my happiest early days , when you were at my side . " Destitution is the Muse of her genius , - Destitution and Death . I used to propose that her epitaph should be : " Here lies the angel of Death . " And wonderfully as she varies and poetically repeats that image in every page and day , yet not less fondly and sublimely she returns to the other , - the grandeur of humility and privation ; as thus : " The chief witness which I have had of a godlike principle of action and feeling is in the disinterested joy felt in others ' superiority . For the love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Where were thine own intellect if others had not lived ? " She had many acquaintances among the notables of the time , and now and then , in her migrations from town to town in Maine and Massachusetts , in search of a new boarding-place , discovered some preacher with sense or piety , or both . For on her arrival at any new home she was likely to steer first to the minister 's house and pray his wife to take a boarder ; and as the minister found quickly that she knew all his books and many more , and made shrewd guesses at his character and possibilities , she would easily rouse his curiosity , as a person who could read his secret and tell him his fortune . She delighted in success , in youth , in beauty , in genius , in manners . When she met a young person who interested her , she made herself acquainted and intimate with him or her at once , by sympathy , by flattery , by raillery , by anecdotes , by wit , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attracted or piqued by her interest and wit and wide acquaintance with books and with emi // nent names . She said she gave herself full swing in these sudden intimacies , for she knew she should disgust them soon , and resolved to have their best hours . " Society is shrewd to detect those who do not belong to her train , and seldom wastes her attentions . " She surprised , attracted , chided and denounced her companion by turns , and pretty rapid turns . But no intelligent youth or maiden could have once met her without remembering her with interest , and learning something of value . Scorn trifles , lift your aims : do what you are afraid to do : sublimity of character must come from sublimity of motive . These were the lessons which were urged with vivacity , in ever new language . But if her companion was dull , her impatience knew no bounds . She tired presently of dull conversations , and asked to be read to , and so disposed of the visitor . If the voice or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he or she would do an errand for her , and so dismiss them . If her companions were a little ambitious , and asked her opinions on books or matters on which she did not wish rude hands laid , she did not hesitate to stop the intruder with " How s your cat , Mrs. Tenner ? " " I was disappointed , " she writes , " in finding my little Calvinist no companion , a cold little thing who lives in society alone , and is looked up to as a specimen of genius . I performed a mission in secretly undermining his vanity , or trying to . Alas ! never done but by mortifying affliction . " From the country she writes to her sister in town , " You can not help saying that my epistle is a striking specimen of egotism . To which I can only answer that , in the country , we converse so much more with ourselves , that we are almost led to forget everybody else . The very sound of your bells and the rattling of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This seems a world rather of trying each others ' dispositions than of enjoying each others ' virtues . " She had the misfortune of spinning with a greater velocity than any of the other tops . She would tear into the chaise or out of it , into the house or out of it , into the conversation , into the thought , into the character of the stranger , - disdaining all the graduation by which her fellows time their steps ; and though she might do very happily in a planet where others moved with the like velocity , she was offended here by the phlegm of all her fellowcreatures , and disgusted them by her impatience . She could keep step with no human being . Her nephew R. W. E. wrote of her : " I am glad the friendship with Aunt Mary is ripening . As by seeing a high tragedy , reading a true poem , or a novel like Corinne , so by society with her one 's mind is electrified and purged . She is no statute-book of practical commandments , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human , but a Bible , miscellaneous in its parts , but one in its spirit , wherein are sentences of condemnation , promises , and covenants of love that make foolish the wisdom of the world with the power of God . " Our Delphiau was fantastic enough , Heaven knows , yet could always be tamed by large and sincere conversation . Was there thought and eloquence , she would listen like a child . Her aspiration and prayer would begin , and the whim and petulance in which , by diseased habit , she had grown to indulge without suspecting it , was burned up in the glow of her pure and poetic spirit , which dearly loved the Infinite . She writes : " August , 1847 . Yale . My oddities were never designed - effect of an uncalculating constitution , at first , then through isolation ; and as to dress , from duty . To be singular of choice , without singular talents and virtues , is as ridiculous as ungrateful . " " It // is so universal with all classes to avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has generally increased piety and self-love . " " As a traveler enters some fine palace , and finds all the doors closed , and he only allowed the use of some avenues and passages , so have I wandered from the cradle over the apartments of social affections , or the cabinets of natural or moral philosophy , the recesses of ancient and modern lore . All say , Forbear to enter the pales of the initiated by birth , wealth , talents , and patronage . I submit with , delight , for it is the echo of a decree from above ; and from the highway hedges where I get lodging , and from the rays which burst forth when the crowd are entering these noble saloons , whilst I stand in the doors , I get a pleasing vision , which is an earnest of the interminable skies where the mansions are prepared for the poor. ** " To live to give pain rather than pleasure ( the latter so delicious ) seems the spider-like necessity of my being on earth , and I have gone on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clay interrogate ? ' But in every actual case t is hard , and we lose sight of the first necessity , - here too amid works red with default , in all great and grand and infinite aims , yet with intentions disinterested , though uncontrolled by proper reverence for others . " When Mrs. Thoreau called on her , one day , wearing pink ribbons , she shut her eyes , and so conversed with her for a time . By and by she said , " Mrs. Thoreau , I do n't know whether you have observed that my eyes are shut . " " Yes , madam , I have observed it . " " Perhaps you would like to know the reasons ? " " Yes , I should . " " I do n't like to see a person of your age guilty of such levity in her dress . " When her cherished favorite , E. H. , was at the Vale , and had gone out to walk iu the forest with Hannah , her niece , Aunt Mary feared they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and begged him to go and look for them . The man went , and returned , saying that . he could not find them . " Go , and cry Elizabeth ! " The man rather declined this service , as he did not know Miss H. She was highly offended , and exclaimed , " God has given you a voice that you might use it in the service of your fellow-creatures . Go instantly , and call Elizabeth , ' till you find them . The man went immediately , and did as he was bid , and having found them apologized for calling thus , by telling what Miss Emerson had said to him . When some ladies of my acquaintance , by an unusual chance , found themselves in her neighborhood and visited her , I told them that she was no whistle that every mouth could play on , but a quite clannish instrument , a pibroch , for example , from which none but a native Highlander could draw music . In her solitude of twenty years , with fewest books , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without covers or title-page , so that later , when she heard much of Milton , and sought his work , she found it was her very book which she knew so well , she was driven to find Nature her companion and solace . She speaks of " her attempts in Malden to wake up the soul amid the dreary scenes of monotonous Sabbaths , when Nature looked like a pulpit . " " Malden , 1805 , November 15th . What a rich day , so fully occupied in pursuing truth that I scorned to touch a novel , which for so many years I have wanted . How insipid is fiction to a mind touched with immortal views ! " November 16th . I am so small in my expectations , that a week of industry delights . Rose before light every morn ; visited from necessity once , ' and again for books ; read Butler 's Analogy ; commented on the Scriptures ; read in a little book , Cicero 's Letters , - a few ; touched Shakspeare ; washed , carded , // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an error , nor scarcely a sacrifice , but more fullness of content in the labors of a day never was felt . There is a sweet pleasure in bending to circumstances while superior to them . " " Malden , 1807 , September . The rapture of feeling I would part from , for days more devoted to higher discipline . But when Nature beams with such excess of beauty , when the heart thrills with hope in its Author , - feels that it is related to him more than by any ties of creation , - it exults , too fondly perhaps for a state of trial . But in dead of night , nearer morning , when the eastern stars glow , or appear to glow , with more indescribable lustre , a lustre which penetrates the spirit with wonder and curiosity , - then , however awed , who can fear ? Since Sabbath , Aunt B the insane aunt was brought here . Ah ! mortifying sight ! instinct perhaps triumphs over reason and every dignified respect to herself , in her anxiety about recovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of others detains her , not one care . But it alarms me not , I shall delight to return to God . His name my fullest confidence . His sole presence ineffable pleasure . " " I walked yesterday five or more miles , lost to mental or heart existence , through fatigue , just fit for the society I went into : all mildness and the most commonplace virtue . The lady is celebrated for her cleverness , and she was never so good to me . Met a lady in the morning walk , a foreigner , - conversed on the accomplishments of Miss T. My mind expanded with novel and innocent pleasure . Ah ! were virtue and that of dear heavenly meekness attached by any necessity to a lower rank of genteel people , who would sympathize with the exalted with satisfaction ? But that is not the case , I believe . A mediocrity does seem to me more distant from eminent virtue than the extremes of station : though after all it must depend on the nature of the heart . A mediocre mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , praise or censure , society or solitude . The feverish lust of notice perhaps in all these cases would injure the heart of common refinement and virtue . " Later she writes of ' her early days in Malden , " When I get a glimpse of the revolutions of nations , - that retribution which seems forever going on in this part of creation , - I remember with great satisfaction that from all the ills suffered , in childhood and since , from others , I felt that it was rather the order of things than their individual fault . It was from being early impressed by my poor , unpractical Aunt that Providence and prayer were all in all . Poor woman ! Could her own temper in childhood and age have been subdued , how happy for herself , who had a warm heart ; but for me would have prevented those early lessons of fortitude which her caprices taught me to practice . Had I prospered in life , what a proud , excited being , even to feverishness , I might have been . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wrapped in others , frail and feverish as myself . " She alludes to the early days of her solitude , sixty years afterwards , on her own farm in Maine , speaking sadly the thoughts suggested by the rich autumn landscape around her : " Ah ! as I walked out this afternoon , so sad was wearied Nature that I felt her whisper to me , Even these leaves you use to think my better emblems have lost their charm on me too , and I weary of my pilgrimage , - tired that I must again be clothed in the grandeurs of winter , and anon be bedizened in flowers and cascades . Oh , if there be a power superior to me , - and that there is my own dread fetters proclaim , - when will He let my lights go out , my tides cease to an eternal ebb ? Oh for transformation ! // 739 I am not infinite , nor have I power or will , but bound and imprisoned , the tool of mind , even of the beings I feed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active , but passive , and can not aid the creatures which seem my progeny , - myself . But you are ingrate to tire of me , now you want to look beyond . T was I who soothed your thorny childhood , though you knew me not , and you were placed in my most leafless waste . Yet I comforted thee when going on the daily errand , fed thee with my mallows on the first young day of bread failing . More , I led thee when thou knewest not a syllable of my active Cause , ( any more than if it had been dead eternal matter , ) to that Cause ; and from the solitary heart taught thee to say , at first womanhood , Alive with God is enough , - t is rapture.

" This morning rich in existence ; the remembrance of past destitution in the deep poverty of my Aunt , and her most unhappy temper ; of bitterer days of youth and age , when my senses and understanding seemed but means of labor , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but no more ; - joy , hope and resignation unite me to him whose mysterious Will adjusts everything , and the darkest and lightest are alike welcome . Oh could this state of mind continue , death would not be longed for . " " I felt , till above twenty years old , as though Christianity were as necessary to the world as existence : - was ignorant that it was lately promulged , or partially received . " Later : " Could I have those hours in which in fresh youth I said , To obey God is joy , though there were no hereafter , I should rejoice , though returning to dust . " " Folly follows me as the shadow does the form . Yet my whole life devoted to find some new truth which will link me closer to God . And the simple principle which mt*de me say in youth and laborious poverty , that should He make me a blot on the fair face of his creation , I should rejoice in His will , has never been equaled , though it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I end days of fine health and cheerfulness without getting upward now . How did I use to think them lost ! If more liberal views of the Divine Government make me think nothing lost which carries me to His now hidden presence , there may be danger of losing and causing others the loss of that awe and sobriety so indispensable . " She was addressed and offered marriage by a man of talents , education , and good social position , whom she respected . The proposal gave her pause and much to think , but after consideration she refused it , I know not on what grounds : a few allusions to it in her diary suggest that it was a religious act , and it is easy to see that she could hardly promise herself sympathy in her religions abandonment with any but a rarelyfound partner . 1807 , January 19 , Malden alluding to the sale of her farm . Last night I spoke two sentences about that foolish place , which I most bitterly lament , - not because they were improper , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have no kind of barrier , to command our feelings . But this shall teach rue . It humbles me beyond anything I have met , to find myself for a moment affected with hope , fear , or especially anger , about interest . But I did overcome and return kindness for the repeated provocations . What is it ? My uncle has been the means of lessening my property . Ridiculous to wound him for that . He was honestly seeking his own . But at last , this very night , the bargain is closed , and I am delighted with myself : my dear self has done well . Never did I so exult in a trifle . Happy beginning of my bargain , though the sale of the place appears to me of the worst things for ' me at this time . " " January 21 . Weary at times of objects so tedious to hear and see .

Not a prospect but is dark on earth , as to knowledge and joy from externals ; but the prospect of a dying bed reflects lustre on all the rest . The evening is fine , but I dare not enjoy it . The moon and stars reproach me , because I had to do with mean fools . Should I take so much care to save a few dollars ? Never was I so much ashamed . Did I say with what rapture I might dispose of them to the poor ? Pho ! self-preservation , dignity , confidence in the future , contempt of trifles ! Alas , I am disgraced . Took a momentary revenge on - for worrying me . " January 30 . I walked to Captain Dexter 's .

It was His will that gives my superiors to shine in wisdom , friendship and ardent pursuits , while I pass my youth , its last traces , in the veriest shades of ignorance and complete destitution of society . I praise Him , though when my strength of body falters it is a trial not easily described . " " True , I must finger the very farthing candleends , - the duty assigned to my pride ; and indeed so poor are some of those allotted to join me on the weary , needy path , that t is benevolence enjoins selfdenial . Could I but dare it in the bread-and-water diet ! Could I but live free from calculation , as in the first half of life , when my poor aunt lived .

Better anything than dishonest dependence , which robs the poorer , and despoils friendship of equal connection . " In 1830 , in one of her distant homes , she reproaches herself with some sudden passion she has for visiting her old home and friends in the city , where she had lived for a while with her brother Mr. Emerson 's father and afterwards with his widow .

" " Hard to contend for a health which is daily used in petition for a final close . " " Am I , poor victim , swept on through . the sternest ordinations of nature 's laws which slay ? Yet I 11 trust . " " There was great truth in what a pious enthusiast said , that , if God should cast him into hell , he would yet clasp his hands around Him . " " Newburyport , September , 1822 .

" Our civilization is not always mend* ing our poetry . It is sauced and spiced with our complexity of arts and inventions , but lacks somewhat of the grandeur that belongs to a Done and unphilosophical age . In a religious contemplative public it would have less outward variety , but simpler and grander means ; a few pulsations of created beings , a few successions of acts , a few lamps held out in the firmament , enable us to talk of Time , make epochs , write histories , - to do more , - to date the revelations of God to man . But these lamps are held to measure out some of the moments of eternity , to divide the history of God 's operations in the birth and death of nations , of worlds .

Dissolve the body and the night is gone ; the stars are extinguished , and we measure duration by the number of our thoughts , by the activity of reason , the discovery of truths , the acquirement of virtue , the approach to God . And the gray-headed god throws his shadows all around , and his slaves catch , now at this , now at that one ; at the halo he throws around poetry or pebbles , bugs or bubbles . Sometimes they climb , sometimes creep into the meanest holes ; but they are all alike in vanishing , like the shadow of a cloud . " To her nephew Charles : " War ; what do I think of it ?

And if you tell me of the miseries of the battle-field , with the sensitive Channing ( of whose love of life 1 am ashamed ) , what of a few days of agony , what of a vulture being the bier , tomb , and parson of a hero , compared to the long years of sticking on a bed and wished away ?

T is not in the nature of existence , while there is a God , to be without the pale of excitement .

Yes , this entire solitude with the Being who makes the powers of life ! Even Fame , which lives in other states of Virtue , pails . Usefulness , if it requires action , seems less like existence than the desire of being absorbed in God , retaining consciousness . Number the waste places of the journey , - the secret martyrdom of youth , heavier than the stake , I thought ; the narrow limits which know no outlet , the bitter dregs of the cup , - and all are sweetened by the purpose of Him I love .
