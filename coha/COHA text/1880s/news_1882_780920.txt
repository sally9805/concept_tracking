txt Mr. W. H. Gilder , the Herald correspondent with the Rodgers , sends the following dispatch , dated Lena Delta , April 12 , 1882 : " Melville found the bodies of De Long 's party on March 23 . They were in two places , 500 and 1,000 yards from the wreck of the scow . Melville 's search party first started from the supply depot here two words are unintelligible to follow Ninderman 's route from Usterday to Matvey , and afterward from Matvey back toward Vsterday . The following sentence is again unintelligible . They stopped at the place which Ninderman and Noros passed the first day after they left De Long , feeling pure that the others had not got much further . There they found the wreck , and , following along the bank , they came upon a rifle barrel hung upon four sticks here six words are unintelligible . " They set the natives digging on each side of the sticks , and they soon came upon two bodies under eight feet of snow . While these men were digging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 20 feet above the river , to find a place to take bearings . He then saw a camp-kettle and the remains of a fire about a thousand yards from the tent , and , approaching , nearly stumbled upon Do Long 's hands sticking out of the snow about 30 feet from the edge of the bank . Here , under about a foot of snow , they found the bodies of De Long and Ambler about three feet apart , and Ah Sam lying at their feet , all partially covered by pieces of tent and a few pieces of blanket . All the others except Alexia they found at the place where the tent was pitched . Lee and Knack were close by in a cleft in the bank toward the west . Two boxes of records , with the medicine chest and a flag on a staff , were beside the tent . " None of the dead had boots . Their feet were covered with rags , tied on . In the pockets of all were pieces of burnt skin and of the clothing which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more or less burned , and it looked as if when dying they had crawled into the fire , Boyd lying over the fire and his clothing being burned through to the skin , which was not burned . Collins 's face was covered with a cloth . " All the bodies were carried to the top of a hill 300 feet high , about 40 versts to the southwest from where they were found , and there interred in a mausoleum constructed of wood from the scow , built in the form or a pyramid 22 feet long and 7 high , surmounted by a cross 22 feet high and a foot square , hewn out of driftwood and conspicuous at a distance of 20 versts . The mausoleum was covered with stones and is to be sodded in the Spring . The cross is inscribed with the record and names of the dead , cut in by the search party . " After completing the tomb the party separated to search the delta for traces of Chipp 's people . Melville went to the north-west part of the delta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the centre , and Bartlett the north-east . Nindermann and Bartlett found nothing . Melville has not yet returned . The search is to be extended to Cape Borchaya and the bay of that name . They expect to finish in time to reach Ialtutsk or Verhojansk before the rivers break up . If they do not finish before that time , they will have to retreat to the foot of the hills and mountains with the natives until the water falls , as the whole of the delta is ' covered with water in Spring to a heightf of four feet , and in some places to 20 feet above . the level of the river . Otherwise they would. , have buried the dead where they found them . " THE DEAD . There were 14 occupants of the first cutter under Lieut . De Long . Of these , Nindermann and Noros left their comrades to obtain assistance and were cared for by the natives . Hans Erikson , seaman , died on Oct. 7 , as appears from De Long 's records , subsequently discovered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies were discovered by Engineer Melville , as related by Mr. Gilder : Lieut . George W. De Long , Dr. James M. Ambler , Jerome J. Collins , Henry Knack , Adolf Dressler , Carl Gortz , Walter Lee . Neils lvorsen . George Boyd , Alexia , Ah Sam . The following were the occupants of the second cutter , search for which is being continued : Lieut . Charles W. Chipp , Capt . William Dunbar , Alfred Sweetman , Henry Warren , Peter Johnson , Edward Star , Albert Kelhne.
