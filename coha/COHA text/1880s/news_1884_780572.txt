txt Charles W. Sands called at the Brooklyn Police Headquarters last night , for the purpose of leaving a description of a negro who robbed his house , in Richmond Hill , near Jamaica , On Wednesday evening , and assaulted his wife in a brutal manner . The house , which is a handsome villa , stands in the centre of a large plot of ground , surrounded by a low fence . Mrs. Sands , who was alone on Wednesday evening about 5 o'clock , had occasion to go to the henhouse in the rear of the villa . As she was returning , a negro stepped out from behind the barn and followed her quickly . Becoming frightened , she ran to the back door and got inside , but before she could close it the negro got his foot between the door and the jamb . He demand-ed admittance , and , reaching inside , caught Mrs. Sands by the wrist , which he twisted until she cried out with pain . He then let go his hold on her wrist and caught her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give up further resistance to his entrance . Once inside the house he compelled Mrs. Sands to silence by the most horrible threats , and directed her to show quickly whatever was valuable that could be readily carried away . After passing through several rooms without seeing anything that excited his cupidity , he again caught hold of Mrs. Sands and attempted to take from her finger a diamond ring and a plain gold wedding ring . When she resisted he threw her to the floor and beat her with his fists until she gave up the rings . Going next into Mr. Sands 's bedroom , the negro asked Mrs. Sands if there was anything valuable concealed under the mattress of the bed . Noticing that she hesitated in per answer , the ruffian compelled her to lift up the mattress . Beneath was a quantity of silver ware which had been placed there for safe keeping . While lifting up the mattress Mrs. Sands remembered that her husband 's revolver was under the pillow of the bed , and with her disengaged hand she managed to get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negro was gathering the silver ware into a quilt Mrs. Sands ran out : of the door and down the stairs screaming loudly for help as she ran . She gained the yard at the rear of the house , and running to the fence , managed to clamber over it into the grounds or a neighbor . She had hardly succeeded in crossing the fence when the negro , to her horror , dashed out of the door and ran toward her at full speed . Just . as he reached the fence Mrs. Sands drew the revolver from her pocket and tired full at her pursuer . The hammer fell on an empty chamber and no shot was discharged . The negro , with a laugh , threw his leg over the fence , and at the same time a white man , whom Mrs. Sands had not seen before , came from behind the barn and ran toward the fence , with the apparent purpose of crossing it at another point to help the negro . Cocking the revolver . Mrs. Sands , although on the point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , and the plucky woman fired two shots in rapid succession . They had the desired effect . The negro and the white man both turned and ran , and in a few minutes had disappeared in the dusk . The shots attracted the attention of Mrs. Sands 's neighbors , but she was so exhausted when assistance reached her that she could not speak for several minutes , and was only able to point in the direction in which the ruffians had ran . When she bad sufficiently recovered to speak she related the circumstances of the robbery and the attack made on herself by the negro . When Mr. Sands got home from his business in New-York at 7 o'clock an armed band of his neighbors had already been scouring the woods in the vicinity for more than an hour . The search was kept up far into the night and resumed yesterday , but so fur without success . Mrs. Sands was so prostrated yesterday from shock and the blows she received from the negro that she was unable to leave her bed .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
