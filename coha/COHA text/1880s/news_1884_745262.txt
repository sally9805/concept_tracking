txt Englishmen are just now busily writing letters to the leading London papers denouncing the table d'h  --  te system on board the Atlantic steamers , and insisting that it shall be superseded by the restaurant system . The day is coming ' when men ? will look back in wonder at the dark age of dining , when travelers by sea or land were compelled to eat together and at specified hours . They will think it almost incredible that two hundred passengers on board a steamship should ever have been compelled to eat at the same hour and , in the presence of one another , and that ? this tyrannical and indecent rule was , on the whole , regarded with satisfaction by the majority of travelers . The habit of promiscuous dining is a relic of the days of cannibalism . It has always been the habit of cannibals to roast their missionaries or other edible human beings whole . In the scarcity of meat , which seems an inevitable condition of barbarism , no cannibal was willing to permit his neighbor to cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it by himself . When there was roast man . for dinner every hungry cannibal came ? to the table at a specified hour and ate ' his share with one eye constantly fixed on his companions to see that they did not obtain more meat than they were entitled to . The table d'h  --  te system thus adopted was preserved after nations abandoned cannibalism and became comparatively civilized , but its continued existence is utterly indefensible . There is no possible reason why a steamship passenger should be forced to eat in the presence of a hundred or more fellow-passengers or go hungry . The steamship company might , with equal Propriety , insist that all male passengers should assemble in the saloon at a fixed hour and then and there ' shave themselves , or that all passengers , without distinction of sex or previous condition of decency , should publicly brush their teeth in the presence of the Captain and of one another at precisely &o'clock; A. M. Eating is a purely physiological process . While two or three intimate friends or the members of a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing ought to be more shocking to the well-regulated mind than the act of eating in company  --  with a crowd of miscellaneous strangers . It is not merely that the methods of eating to which some of the scores of passengers on board a steamer are addicted are sure to shock a sensitive stomach , and to destroy its desire for food , but the very idea of promiscuous dining is revolting to a man of refined tastes . He does not wish to expose to the rude public gaze his personal likes and dislikes in regard to food , and he does not wish to have the dietetic confidences of strangers thrust upon him . Eating is as necessary as bathing , and , like the latter , when judiciously managed , may be made a luxury ; but to bathe in a common tank with a clamorous crowd of unknown people would be almost as objectionable as to sit clown at dinner on board the Aurania with four hundred passengers  --  to which latter horror one of the letter-writing Englishmen already referred ' to was recently subjected . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by himself , but he should have the right to choose his own hours for eating . What right has a steamship company to say that a man must breakfast at 8 o'clock or not at all ? Who made the Captain and the steward a ruler over the stomachs of his fellow-men , with authority to say when the stomachs under his control shall be filled and when they shall be empty ? One man may want to dine at noon and another at 6 o'clock . Is it right that the first should be made to go hungry and faint until evening , or that the latter should have his stomach insulted with a midday dinner ? If a steamship company can compel its passengers to eat at a fixed hour it can with equal propriety compel them to smoke at a fixed hour . We can fancy the indignation of a company of passengers who should find them- ' selves summoned by a bell to smoke at 9 o'clock A. M. , and should be informed that those who refused to smoke at that hour would not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next smoking hour might be . There are undoubtedly men to whom the table d'h  --  te is attractive . They like its noise and smell . The clatter of hundreds of knives and forks and the combined smell of fifty dishes is , grateful to them . The rush of a score of busy stewards inspirits them , and the spilling of gravy on the shoulders of other people tickles their sense of humor . They like to study the plates of their neighbors and see what they are eating , and they think it an advantage to have people seated in their immediate neighborhood to whom they can address requests to " pars the beans " or to " gim me those molasses . " The spirit of social cannibalism still exists in these curious men and women , but why should their tastes be gratified at the expense of decent people ? Stowly. but surely the table d'h  --  te system is disappearing . It will linger for a time and , like the custom of compelling two entire strangers to share the same bed , will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come . Still it is doomed , and it will not be long before the demand that steamship passengers shall be allowed to eat when they choose , and shall be entitled to a decent degree of privacy while so engaged , will be universally accepted , and the ocean table d'hote will disappear forever .
