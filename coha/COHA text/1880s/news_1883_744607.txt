txt THE TIMES 'S correspondent to-day called the attention of Judge Lawrence to the Columbus dispatch in TAE TIMES this morning as to his desire for the nomination . He said : " I have not been . am not , a seeker for the nomination . Several newspapers in Ohio have published articles in favor of my nomination wholly without any solicitation or agency on my part . I have received letters from friends declaring their purpose to support me , and these came equally without my agency . I have , appreciated their favor , but I have not decided whether I would be a candidate before the convention or not . The people should decide who the candidate shoule be , and he should be a candidate for Governor only and not for Senator . I think I have been told by more than 5U persons that if I desired they would go to work actively for me as a candidate , but I have declined to ask them to do so . You can readily learn this here in this city . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned in THE TIMES 1 " " I was Judge of the Common Pleas in Ohio from 1857 to 1864 . I believe that no man ever complained that I did not promptly attend to all my duties . I had a few months in some of the years not occupied with my duties as Judge , and which I had a right to employ as I chose . In 1662 Gov . Tod raised several regiments of three-months men . I never professed much skill as a military man , but it was difficult to get officers , and the Governor asked me to be Colonel of the Eightyfourth Ohio Regiment , and I did the best I could in that service for a hundred days when I had no court to bold . Of course , my salary was paid as Colonel . " After I returned to Ohio Judge Bowen , of Marion , advised me by a letter , which I have , to draw my quarter 's salary as Judge and distribute it among the counties of my judicial district for the benefit of soldiers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the vouchers in Ohio showing that the money was so appropriated . I never used a dollar of it . I can produce a one-armed soldier now in the Treasury Department who will tell you he received a part of the money . I might lawfully have kept both salaries , as I did all the duties required , but I did not . During the five times I was elected to Congress no Democrat or Democratic paper so far as I can remember ever made any complaint as to this . As a member of Congress I was entitled to receive about $2,500 of the extra salary under the so-called salary grab law of 1373 . I always regarded the duty of a member of Congress who was opposed to the salary law as a doubtful question , but I resolved to doubt against myself . " Anybody can prove from the records that I drew that extra salary , but if they would publish that and stop there it would be equivalent to telling a falsehood . I drew it and immediately paid it back into the Treasury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have stood to my credit , and I could have drawn it afterward , or my administrator might have done so after my death . During the time I was in Congress I had abundant opportunities by which I could have made money lawfully and unlawfully also growing out of my position . I believe no one has ventured to accuse me of making money in either of these modes . "
