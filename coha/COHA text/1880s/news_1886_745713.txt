txt The statements made to Mr. Brown and to the British Consul-General by the officers of the Oregon place the entire responsibility for the collision upon the unknown schooner . The steamship. it is alleged , was manned with a full force of lookouts , and was carrying the reguiatine iisstits . There were fully 30 members of the crew of the Oregon on her deck at the time of the collision , and the officer who was then in charge says that had the unknown schooner displayed the regulation colored lights she would have been seen and the collision avoided . Capt . Cottier did not regard it as strange or unusuai that a vessel not carrying colored lights should not have been seen by his lookouts . Tne night although clear was dark , he explained . Mr. Brown said that it was the invariable rule of the Cunard Company to have a thorough inspection made of each vessel just before it starts on a voyage . He had ascertained that the Oregon was carefully inspected in Liverpool and found to he in good condition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the officers of the Oregon for the collision great interest centred in Chief Officer William George Matthews , who was in charge of the steamship when she was struck . Numerous inquiries were made for Officer Matthews at the office of the Cunard Company , but it was late in the afternoon before General Agent Brown concluded to allow newspaper men to see him . Mr. Brown 's first inclination was to prevent any public statements being made by the officers of the Oregon in advance of the official investigation , which , he said , would be made either by the British Consul-General or the maritime authorities of London . As the day advanced , however , Mr. Brown 's attention was frequently called to the intimations of some of the passengers that the disaster was the result of negligence on the part of the chief officer of the Oregon and the men who were supposed to he on the lookout for danger . When asked if it was the desire of the Cunard Company to cover up anything relating to the collision Mr. Brown said ' No " with great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matthews and directed him to answer all questions that the representatives of the press desired to ask . Officer Matthews is 48 years old , has been a sailor about 26 years , and has been in the employ of the Cunard Company 11 years , and this was his fourth voyage on the Oregon . Ho holds a First Master 's certificate . " I went upon the bridge , and took charge of the ship about 4 A. M. , " said Officer Matthews , " and the collision occurred about 4:30 o'clock . The fourth officer was on the bridge with me . He stood ou the port side , and I stood on the starboard side . There were three men on lookout duty , two on the turtle back , and one ou the forepart of the promenade deck . The latter was able to keep a lookout and pass the word along trom the other men . The night was tolerablyclear , but the day was not broken when the collision occurred . The first sign of the proximity of another vessel to our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ port bow . It appeared to me to be a light just held up for a time , for it disappeared instantly . It was just like a flash light . I thought that it must be on a pilot boat with her mast headlight out . Pilot boats do not carry side lights . Knowing that the Captain was not going to take on a pilot until we reached the bar , I had the helm put hard sport to bring the light more broad on the bow . " ' How high was that light ? " asked one of the chief officer 's auditors . " I assumed that it was in the hands of a man standing on the deck . I saw no other lights at all ; there were no colored lights . MY first impression was that a vessel was there without any lights , and that somebody on her deck , suddenly perceiving the approach of the steamer , had grabbed the first light that came to hand and hastily held it up .

A bright light a little on the port bow . ' My order to put the helm hard aport was obeyed instantly , ( the wheelhouse was on the bridge , ) but the steamship did not have time to change her course before the collision occurred . I saw no sails nor the outline of the schooner until she was on the point of striking us . When 1 gave the order to change the ship 's course I bald not the slightelt idea there vies going to be a collision . I could not tell from the light whether the unknown vessel was moving or standing still , or in what direction she was headed . There were no regulation lights in sight . " " What did the vessel look like ? " " A large schooner . I could not see her name nor anybody on her . I could not even discern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think between my giving the order to put the helm hard a port and the collision . The schooner struck the Oregon a few feet forward or the bridge upon which I stood . The blow did not careen the steamship over . It was a sort of glancing blow . " Capt . Cottier , interrupting : " There was not much glancing about it . " 1 could not tell at what angle , " continued Mr. Matthews , " the vessel struck us . The instant 1 heard the crash I signaled the engineer to stop theenglnes , which was done at once . Then i turned to look for the schooner . The Oregon was obeying the helm and swinging around . I looked all around the horizon , but could see nothing of the schooner . I heard no noise , no shouts , or talking among the schooner 's men . No words were exchanged at any time between the two boats . Capt .

Next we heard the word being passed along that our ship was making water . " " Some of the passengers have stated that you left the bridge in the early part of your watch several minutes before the collision , and went below to get a cup of coffee and something to eat . " " That is false , " exclaimed Officer Matthews indigantly. " 1 never drink coffee , and I did not leave the bridge at all from the time that I was put in charge until some minutes after the Captain came up there and relieved me . After I got down from the bridge I had charge of lowering the two forward boats . I can not tell how long it took to get them free and ready for use , but the work was done promptly . There were no obstacles . All of the Oregon 's boats were fully equipped and in good order , I did not see any broaches of discipline on the part of the crew . There was no insubordination that I know of . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collision . At least I did not see any .

Our helm being kept hard aport had swung the Oregon completely around . It was still dark . and we could not see anything of the unknown vessel . " On the cabin list of the Oregon were the names of Messrs . Read , Charles Carpenter , and William Ileet , the two former gentlemen hailing from Chicago and the latter from Marquette , Mich . All three of them reached the deck very soon after the collision , and they declare that the atmosphere was clear and they could see for a long distance over the water . Mr. Meet averred that he could hive clearly perceived objects five or six miles away and that there was nothing but Fire Island light within the range of his vision beyond the outlines of the steamer . There was no schooner , nor was there any other vessel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pear . Archibald Ramsdell , another passenger , says that he was on deck soon after the collision , and that the night was clear and stars were shining , and he could n't understand how the accident happened . It must have been the fault of the officer in charge the Oregon or of the " outlook . " He furthi alleged that the boats and life-rafts of tl steamer were not sufficient in capacity to a commonate half the number of her passenge and crew , and that had two hours only , instet of eight , elapsed between the time of the collisit and the sinking of the craft , a great many live would have been lost . Two of the three men constituting the " 10 ? 1 out " of the Oregon when she was run down , di Oared yesterday that they first saw the Bottom ( 30 or 40 yards away from the steamer .
