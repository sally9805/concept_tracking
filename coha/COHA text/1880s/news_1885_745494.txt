txt With the debt statement of the month of June the Treasury gives to the public an abstract of the receipts and expenditures for the fiscal year . As has been expected , the former have been less and the latter more than last year . The revenue for the year ending June 30 , 1884 , was $348,579,869 92 ; for this year it was $322,590,776 14 , being a falling off of $25,989,093 78 , or , in round numbers , $26,000,000 . The decrease was made up of $14,000,000 in customs duties , $9,000 , - 000 in internal revenue duties , and $3,000,000 in miscellaneous receipts . The falling off in internal revenue has been mainly due to the decrease in the yield of the tax on spirits , and that has been belo ' the estimate because of the postpone . ment by the Treasury Departmeut of the payment of overdue taxes . Apart from this cause , however , the trade in spirits has felt more than the average depression in consequence of its previous undue extension . The decline in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off in the total imports , the value of which has been a little over $100,000,000 less than last year , and in part to the fall in prices . The rates of duty have been the same as for the previous year under the act of March 3 , 1883 . We may add that the decreased imports leave the excess of exports over imports of merchandise at about $170,000,000 , or $98,000,000 more than last year . The expenditures exceed those of last year by about $19,000,000 , ( $18,662,211 09 . ) This increase has taken place substantially in the ordinary expenditures , an increase of $3,000,000 in the pension payments being offset by a decrease of the same amount in the interest on the public debt , which has been reduced during the year , according to the old form , $63,494,708 64 . It will be remembered that the expenditures of the fiscal year just closed were the fruit of the appropriations , made at . the first , or long , session of the last Congress . A good deal was said at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economies brought about by Mr. RANDALL in his management of the Committee of Appropriations . The net result of this management is now shown in an . excess of ordinary expenditures of $19,000,000 over those authorized at the last session of the previous Congress , in. which the Republicans had a majority . Whatever may have been the intention of Mr. RANDALL  --  and we are persuaded that , apart from overruling considerations in other directions , it was a fairly good intention  --  the actual operation of his policy was costly . This was due to the fact that he chose in the first session of the Forty-eighth Congress to hold back the appropriation bills in order to prevent any legislation for the reduction of the tariff , and to the further fact that the appropriation bills thus held back became in the closing hours of the session : - entirely unmanageable . They were given their final form , to all intents and purposes , not by Congress or by the free action of each of the two houses , but by the conference committees , in which deliberation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount , while of discussion calculated to enlighten the country or secure responsibility there was absolutely none . To these facts must be added still another , which , though not of record , is sufficiently well known , namely , that the appropriation bills , in which nearly every member had a more or less direct interest , were manipulated to secure votes against the tariff reduction bill . It is not surprising that the Nation is obliged to pay a high price for Mr. RANDALL 'S peculiar tactics . It is a curious feature of the arrangement of Congressional sessions under which the Government is running that the definite results of the action regarding the finances taken by the Congress of which the House was elected in November , 1882 , is now first known , four months after that Congress has gone out of existence and eight months after a new House of Representatives has been elected . It is obvious that under such a system it is quite impossible to secure an enlightened public judgment upon the House of Representatives or any effective expression of a judgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and has but recently been stated by writers of authority , that the present arrangement exists by constitutional provision and can only be changed by an amendment of the Constitution . But this is not so . The Constitution simply requires ( Article I. , section 4 , paragraph 2 , ) that " the Congress shall assemble at least once in every year , and such meeting shall be on the first Monday in December , unless they shall by law appoint a different day . " In the early days of the Government it was impracticable to get the representatives together in the December following their election , and the custom sprang up which has since been followed . The matter is practically in the hands of Congress , and could with great advantage to the country be carefully considered and a system introduced more in accordance with the requirements of the present time .
