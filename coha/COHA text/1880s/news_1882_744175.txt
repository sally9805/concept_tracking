txt The House of Representatives , by a vote of 199 to 42 , has passed the Edmunds bill as it came from the Senate . This is a triumph for the champions of the more recent attempts to suppress polygamy . It is the knell of the " twin relic of barbarism , " as it does not seem possible that the infamous practices of the Mormon bigamists can be continued under the new condition of affairs . The provisions of the bill , which now goes to the President for his signature , are simple but effective . By it , polygamy , or bigamy , is punishable as a misdemeanor , by fine and imprisonment . And , in order to convict a man of bigamy , unlawful cohabitation , not the rite of marriage , is necessary to be proved . In prosecutions for bigamy , it shall be sufficient cause for challenge to any person drawn as juryman that he is , or has been , guilty of bigamous practices . The President , however , may grant amnesty to such persons as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the passage of the bill . No polygamist or bigamist shall be entitled to vote at any election or he eligible to any office in the Territory or under the authority of the United States . All offices of registration and election throughout the Territory of Utah are declared vacant , and all the duties pertaining to these offices shall hereafter be discharged by a commission of five persons to be appointed by the President . These Commissioners are to be drawn from not less than two political parties , and they are to control absolutely all the election machinery of the Territory , deciding who shall and who shall not register and vote , until the next meeting of the Legislature , when provision may be made for filling the offices under the Commissioners . The Democrats in the House , with few exceptions , were against the bill . But those few exceptions were enough to assure the passage of the bill whenever it should come to a vote . A. disposition of the Democrats to obstruct the passage of the bill by the usual tactics was quickly calmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In other days , when the Democracy ruled the House , it was common for party measures to be forced through under the gag law , the minority being allowed neither debate nor the privilege of amendment . This is not the way of the Republican majority , and , although assured of the support of several Democrats , when their votes would be needed on the final passage of the bill , the Republicans yesterday did not abuse their power , but conceded all the privileges asked by the minority . The two points of objection brought forward by the Democrats were against the clause disfranchising polygamists and against that which imposes the penalties without conviction in a court of law . These objections , however , were probably disingenuous . The Democrats were determined , if possible , to prevent the passage of the bill . Their purpose was to load . it down with amendments and kill it by this familiar process . If any one of the amendments offered yesterday in the House had been adopted , the bill would have been BO weakened that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition . A conference committee would have been ordered , and that would have been the end of this attempt to extirpate Mormonism . Happily , these tactics did not prevail . The Republicans were strong enough to pass the bill as it came from the Senate . When this bill becomes a law , as it speedily will , the President will appoint five Commissioners , three of whom are to be Republicans and two Democrats . These Commissioners will reorganize the political system of Utah Territory , vacating all of the subordinate offices relating to the conduct of elections , so far as these are occupied by polygamists , and filling their places with eligible persons . Where other subordinate offices are declared vacant by reason of the bigamous practices of the incumbents , the Governor has , under the organic act , the power of appointment . When the next election for members of the Legislature takes place , no polygamist will be eligible as a candidate . The next Legislature , accordingly , must needs be anti-polygamist , and this means that it will be anti-Mormon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken . That Legislature will proceed to reorganize the laws of the Territory of Utah , as far as necessary and expedient , subject to the revisory and annulling power of Congress . A more radical and sweeping scheme than this can hardly have passed Congress . It is a Republican measure , contrived for the extirpation of the loathsome cancer of polygamy . The Democratic opponents of the bill ( and only Democrats opposed it ) invariably began their hypocritical speeches by saying : " I will join hands with any gentleman in this chamber in any attempt to ' put down polygamy ; but " ? and the " but " in each case was invariably an objection to the bill which effectually prevented the speaker from supporting this particular measure . It is possible that the new law will not prove as effectual in the suppression of polygamy as its friends expect and hope . But it is a step in the right direction  --  an attempt to crush out a great and scandalous evil by law .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
