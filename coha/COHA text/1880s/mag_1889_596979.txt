LINCOLN REELEcTED . FROM the moment the Democratic convention named its candidates the stars in their courses seemed to fight against them . During the very hours when the streets of Chicago were blazing with torches , and the air was filled with the perfervid rhetoric of the peace men rejoicing over their work , Hood was preparing for the evacuation of Atlanta ; and the 1 The Rev. Dr. Thompson , calling on the President soon after this , congratulated him on the irnproved aspect of politics , and asked him whether he attrihuted it in greater part to the Chicago platform or same newspapers which laid before their readers the craven utterances of the Vallandigham platform announced the entry of Sherman into the great manufacturing metropolis of Georgiaso close together came bane and antidote . The convention had declared the war was a failure , and demanded that the Government should sue for terms of peace . Lincoln 's reply three days afterwards was a proclamation announcing to the country " the signal successes that Divine Providence has recently vouchsafed " the people at Mobile and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supreme Being in whose hands are the destinies of nations . " He also tendered , by proclamation , the national thanks to Farragut , Canby , and Granger , and to General Sherman and the gallant officers and soldiers of their respective commands , and ordered that national salutes of one hundred guns should be fired on successive days from all the arsenals and navy yards in the United States in honor of these glorious victories . Thus , amid the prayers and thanksgivings of a grateful people , and the thunder and smoke of great guns uttering from their iron throats the general joy , the presidential campaign began . The darkest hour had come just before the dawn , and the light broadened on the political campaign from beginning to end.1 One of the earliest speeches of the autumn was made by Mr. Seward at his home in Auburn , New York.2 He spoke avowedly without authority from the President , yet , as well from his intimacy with Mr. Lincoln as from his commanding place in the Administration , his speech demanded and received great attention . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the.Government of the United States , the military measures affecting slavery , which have been adopted from necessity to bring the war to a spaedy and successful end , will be continued , except so far as practical experience shall show that they can be modified advantageously , with a view to the same end . When the insurgents shall have disbanded their armies and laid down their arms the war will instantly cease ; and all the war measures then existing , including those which affect slavery , will cease also ; and all the moral , economical , andpolitical questions , as well questions affecting slavery as others , which shall then be existing between individuals and States and the Federal Government , whether they arose before the civil war began , or whether they grew out it , will , by force of the Constitution , pass over to the arbitrament of courts of law and to the councils of legislation . Referring to the Chicago declaration in favor of the immediate cessation of hostilities , and to the victory at Atlanta . " I should say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least , I should prefer to have that repeated . " 2 September 3 , 1864. // the paralyzing effect on the action of the Government which would follow the success of the Democrats upon such a platform , he asked , in that contingency , " Who can vouch for the safety of the country against the rebels during the interval which must elapse before the new Administration can constitutionally come into power ? " ' The opposition journalists immediately seized upon this as a threat that the Administration was determined to keep itself in power whatever might be the verdict of the people , and this clamor went on until the President , as we shall show , put an effectual dluietus upon it . Mr. Lincoln himself took little part in the contest . He was forced , from time to time , to assist with his presence charitable demonstrations in favor of the sick and wounded soldiers ; and being always obliged on these occasions to say a few words , he acquitted himself of these necessary tasks with dignity and discretion . He made no personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North and South with unfailing charity and moderation . Regiments of soldiers returning to their homes after their term of service was over sometimes called upon him , and in brief and pithy speeches he thanked them for calling , and always added a word or two of wise or witty political thought . Speaking to an Ohio regiment , he defined in one phrase the essential character of our republican government with more accuracy and clearness than ever Jefferson had done : I wish it might be more generally and universally understood what the country is now engaged in . We have , as all will agree , a free government , where every man has a right to be equal with every other man . In this great struggle this form of government , and every form of human rights , is endangered if our enemies succeed . . . . There is involved in this struggle the question whether your children and my children shall enjoy the privileges we have enjoyed . . . . When you return to your homes , rise up to the height of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we will carry out the great work we have commenced . To another regiment he said : I happen , temporarily , to occupy this house . I am a living witness that any one of your children may look to come here as my father 's child has done . It is in order that each one of you may have , through this free government which we have enjoyed , an open field and a fair chance for your industry , enterprise , and intelligence - that you 1 Ten days later , when Mr. Seward had returned to Washington , he said , in answer to a serenade : " The Democracy of Chicago , after waiting six weeks to see whether this war for the Union is to succeed or fail , finally concluded that it would fail , and therefore went in for a nomination and platform to make it a sure thing by a cessation of hostilities and an abandonment of the contest . At Baltimore , on the contrary , we VOL . XXXVIII. -9 ' . may all have equal privileges in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is for this that the struggle should be maintained , that we may not lose our birthright . . . . The nation is worth fighting for to secure such an inestimable jewel . Being invited to attend a Union mass meeting at Buffalo , the President at first thought of writing a letter , and we find among his papers the following fragment in his own manuscript : Yours inviting me to attend a Union mass meeting at Buffalo is received . Much is being said about peace , and no man desires peace more ardently than I. Still I am yet unprepared to give up the Union for a peace which , so achieved , could not be of much duration . The preservation of our Union was not the sole avowed object for which the war was commenced . It was commenced for precisely the reverse object  --  to destroy our Union . The insurgents commenced it by firing upon the Star of the ( Vest and on Fort Sumter , and by other similar acts . It is true , however , that the Administration accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preserving our Union and it is not true that it has since been , or will be , prosecuted by this Administration for any other object . In declaring this I only declare what I can know , and do know , to be true , and what no other man can know to be false . In taking the various steps which have led to my present position in relation to the war the public interest and my private interest have been perfectly parallel , because in no other way could I serve myself so well as by truly serving the Union . The whole field has been open to me where to choose . No place-hunting necessity has been upon me urging me to seek a position of antagonism to some other man , irrespective of whether such position might be favorable or unfavorable to the Union . Of course , I may err in judgment ; but my present position in reference to the rebellion is the result of my best judgment , and , according to that best judgment , it is the only position upon which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantial departure from it insures the success of the rebellion . An armistice  --  a cessation of hostilities - is the end of the struggle , and the insurgents would be in peaceable possession of all that has been struggled for . Any different policy in regard to the colored man deprives us of his help , and this is more than we can bear . We can not spare the hundred and forty or fifty thousand now serving us as soldiers , seamen , and laborers . This is not a question of sentiment or taste , but one of physical force , which may be measured and estimated as horsepower and steam-power are measured and estimated . Keep it , and you can save the Union . Throw it away , and the Union goes with it . Nor is it possible for any administration to retain the services of these determined that there should be no such thing as failure , and therefore we went in to save the Union by battle to the last . Sherman and Farragut have knocked the bottom out of the Chicago nominations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baltimore nominations stanch and sound . The issue is thus squarely made up - McClellan and disunion , or Lincoln and Union. ** // people with the express or implied understanding that upon the first convenient occasion they are to be re*nslaved . It can not be , and it ought not to be . After he had written thus far he seems to have changed his mind as to the good taste or the expediency of aiding even thus far in his own canvass . He therefore laid his letter aside and wrote a brief note 1 declining to address the meeting , on the ground , first , that it would be a breach of precedent , and , secondly , that if he once began to write letters it would be difficult to discriminate between meetings having equal claims . Although the dignity and self-control with which Mr. Lincoln held himself aloof from the work of the canvass has been generally acknowledged , there is one incident of the campaign which was the object of severe criticism at tile time . Governor Johnson , in accordance with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a proclamation2 specifying the manner in which the vote for presidential electors should be taken , the qualification of voters , and the oath which they should be required to take . The Democratic candidates on the electoral ticket of that State , regarding themselves aggrieved by these requirenlents of the convention and tile governor , united in a protest against this proceeding , and one of their number , a Mr. Leilyet , was sent to present the protest in person.3 In the account of his interview with the President , which he published in the newspapers , Mr. Lellyet said that tile President told him " he would manage his side of this contest in his own way , and the friends of General McClellan could manage their side in theirs . " It is not impossible that , in a moment of irritation at the presentatioll of a petition which was in itself an insinuation tilat he was making a selfish and corrupt use of his power , the President may have treated Mr. Leilyct with scant courtesy ; but he took the protest , nevertheless , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is certainly notiling of malice or of petulance in the grave and serious tone of the reply which tile President sent a few days later to the McClellan electors of Tennessee . He informed them that he ilad had no commuslication wilatever Witil Governor Johilson on the subject of his proclamation ; that he had given to the subject sucil consideration as was in his power in tile nlidst of so many pressing public duties . My conclusion is he said that I can have nothing to do with the matter , either to sustain the plan as the convention and Governor Johnson have initiaed it , or to revoke or modify itas you demand . By the Constitution and laws the President is charged 1 Lincoln to Schermerhorn , Sept. 12 , 1864 . MS. 2 Sept. 30 , 1864. 3 Oct. i6 , 1864. 4 Lincoln to William 13 . Campbell eta ! . , Oct. 22 , 1864. with no duty in the conduct of a presidential election in any State ; nor do I , in this case , perceive any military reason for his interference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the convention and Governor Johnson does not , as see msto be assumed by you , emanate from the National Executive . In no proper sense can it be considered other than as an independent movement of at least a portion of the loyal people of Tennessee . I do not perceive in the plan any menace of vio* lence or coercion towards any one . Governor Johnson , like any other loyal citizen of Tennessee , has the right to favor any political plan he chooses , and , as military governor , it is his duty to keep the peace among and for the loyal people of the State . I can not discern that by this plan he purposes any more . But you object to the plan . Leaving it alone will be your perfect security against it . Do as you please on your own account , peacefully and loyally , and Governor Johnson will not molest you , but will protect you against violence so far as in his power . I presume the conducting of a presidential election in Tennessee in strict accordance with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibility . It is scarcely necessary to add that if any election shall be held , and any vote shall be cast in the State of Tennessee for President and Vice-President of the United States , it will belong not to the military agents , nor yet to the Executive Department , but exclusively to another department of the Government , to determine whether they are entitled to be counted in conformity with the Constitution and laws of the United States . Except it be to give protection against violence , I decline to interfere in any way with any presidential election.4 The McClellan electors thereupon withdrew from the contest ; Lincoln and Johnson electors were chosen , but their votes were not counted by Congress . The most important utterance of the President during the campaign was a speech which lIe made on tile evening of the *9th of October , in which lIe referred to the construction whicil had been placed on the remarks of the Secretary of State at Auburn , already quoted . He thought the distorted and unjust conclusions which ilad been drawn from Sexvard 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come to put an end to them , and he seized , for tilat purpose , the occasion of a serenade fronl a party of loyal Marylanders who were celebrating in Washington the victory which tile party of emancipation had gained in the elections in their State . He said a few words of congratulation upon that auspicious event , and then added : A word upon another subject . Something said by the Secretary of State , in his recent speech at Auburn , has been construed by some into a threat that if I shall be beaten at the election I will , between then and the end of my constitutional term , do what I may be able to ruin the Government . Others regard the fact that the Chicago convention // adjourned , not sine die , but to meet again , if called to do so by a particular individual , as the intimation of a purpose that if their nominee shall be elected he will at once seize control of the Government . I hope the good people will permit themselves to suffer no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government , not to overthrow it . I am struggling especially to prevent others from overthrowing it . I therefore say that if I shall live I shall remain President until the 4th of next March ; and that whoever shall be constitutionally elected therefor , in Novern*er , shall be duly installed as President on the 4th of March and that , in the interval , I shall do my utmost that whoever is to hold the helm for the next voyage shall start with the best possible chance to save the ship . This is due to the people both on principle and under the Constitution . Their will , constitutionally expressed , is the ultimate law for all . If they should deliberately resolve to have immediate peace , even at the loss of their country and their liberty , I know not the power or the right to resist them . It is their own business , and they must do as they please with their own . I believe , however , they are still resolved to preserve their country and their liberty ; and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am resolved to stand by them.1 During the progress of the campaign Mr. Lincoln was frequently called upon to assist his friends , to oppose his enemies , and to exercise his powerful influence in appeasing discords in different States and districts . He interfered as little as possible , and always in the interests of the party at large , rather than in those of individuals . He took no account of the personal attitude of candidates towards himself . In the case of those who were among his intimate friends he would go no further than to demand that Government officers should not work against them . When Mr. Arnold of Chicago , who had incurred the hostility of Mr. Scripps , the postmaster at that place , complained of the opposition of that official and called upon the President to put a stop to it , the President would do nothing more than to order the offending postmaster to content himself with the exercise of his own rights as a citizen and a voter and to allow his subordinates to do the same . The postmaster answered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been doing , and that this was the source of Mr. Arnold 's complaint ; that the congressman wanted his active official assistance , and would be satisfied with nothing less . Although Arnold was an intimate and valued friend of the President , he declined to exercise any further pressure upon the postmaster , and Mr. Arnold soon afterwards withdrew from the contest . After candidates had been regularly I Autograph MS. 2 Lincoln to Ward Hunt , Aug. i6 , 1864 . MS. 3 June 20 , 1864 . MS. and fairly nominated , the President had no hesitation in doing all in his power to conciliate hostilities and to unite the party in support of them . He tolerated in these cases no factious or malicious opposition on the part of his office-holders , and he laid his hands most heavily upon those injudicious friends of his own who attempted to defeat the reelection of Republican congressmen who had not been especially friendly to him . A large number of the leading Republicans in Roscoe Conkling 's district had declared their intention to oppose him . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Republican opposition to him had its rise and origin among friends of the Secretary of State . The President commended their complaint to the attention of Mr. Seward , and answered for himself : " I am for the regular nominee in all cases , and no one could be more satisfactory to me as the nominee in that district than Mr. Roscoe Conkling . I do not mean to say there are not others as good as he in the district , but I think I know him to be at least good enough . " 2 Being informed of some hostility on the part of the custom-house officials in New York against Frederick A. Conkling , he wrote similar admonitions to them . The postmaster of Philadelphia being accused of interference against William D. Kelley , the President sent for him , and following his custom in grave matters , he read to him a reprimand which he had committed to paper in the following words : Complaint is made to me that you are using your official power to defeatiudge Kelley 's renomination to Congress . I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I do not know that the man who might supplant him would be as satisfactory ; but the correct principle , I think , is that all our friends should have absolute freedom of choice among our friends . My wish , therefore , is that you will dojust as you think fit with your own suffrage in the case , and not constrain any of your subordinates to do other than as he thinks fit with his . This is precisely the rule I inculcated and adhered to on my part when a certain other nomination now recently made was being canvassed for.3 The reform of the civil service had not at that time been formulated by its friends , nor even adopted in principle by the country at large , yet it would be difficult even in the light of this day to improve upon this statement of its essential principle as applied to the conduct of office-holders . The postmaster , of course , promised exact obedience ; but later in the summer the President was informed , on authority that he credited , that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of them was openly in favor of the renomination of Judge Kelley . Upon learning // this , Mr. Lincoln wrote to an influential friend in Philadelphia , stating these facts and adding : This , if true , is not accidental . Left to their free choice , there can be no doubt that a large number of them , probably as much or more than half , would be for Kelley . And if they are for him and are not restrained they can put it beyond question by pub. - licly saying so . Please tell the postmaster he must find a way to relieve me from the suspicion that he is not keeping his promise to me in good faith.l The postmaster felt at last the hand of iron under the velvet glove , and Kelley was renominated and reffiected , as he has been ever since  --  to the honor and advantage of his district and State . The summer was full of brief panics and flurries among the politicians , and they were continually rushing to Mr. Lincoln to urge him to action or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no instance in which he yielded to these solicitations . A matter of especial difficulty was the draft for half a million of men which had been issued on the *8th of July . Leading Republicans all over the country , fearing the effect of the draft upon the elections , begged the President to withdraw the call or suspend operations under it . Mr. Cameron , so late as the *9th of October , after the State elections had been secured , advised against the draft in Philadelphia . Mr. Chase on the same day telegraphed from Ohio , which had been carried triumphantly by the Republicans a few days before , recommending the suspension of the draft for three weeks - Chief-Justice Taney having died a week before . Judge Johnston of Ohio reports that he was with the President when a committee came from Ohio to request him to suspend the draft until after the elections , and that Mr. Lincoln quietly answered , " What is the Presidency worth to me if I have no country ? ' * IBut these solicitations were not all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field , " If the President modifies the draft to the extent of one man , or wavers in its execution , he is gone forever ; the army would vote against him . ' The politicians and the general probably exaggerated in equal measure ; the army would not have rejected him if he had seen fit to suspend the draft ; and the people stood by him in his refusal to do it . He went so far in compliance with the earnest request of the Union people in Indiana as to write to Sherman expressing his sense of the importance of allowing as many of the Indiana soldiers as possible to go home to vote . Most of the other States which voted in October allowed their soldiers to vote in the field . Indiana had not 1 Lincoln to McMichael , Aug. 5 , 1864 . MS. 2 Lincoln to Sherman , Sept. 19 , 1864 . MS. * Lincoln to Rosecrans , Sept. 26 , 1864 . MS. passed the necessary legislation for this purpose . The draft was steadily proceeding in that State , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was endangering the success of the Union party in the elections . " Anything you can safely do , " Mr. Lincoln wrote , " to let her soldiers , or any part of them , go home and vote at the State election will be greatly in point . They need not remain for the presidential elections , but may return to you at once . " 2 He was careful , however , not to urge General Sherman to any course of action which he might consider injurious . " This is , " he added , " in no sense an order , but is merely intended to impress you with the importance , to the army itself ; of your doing all you safely can , yourself being the judge of what you can safely do . " There were also reports from Missouri that Rosecrans was inclined to deny the soldiers the right of attending the elections , on the assumed ground that they would get drunk and make disturbance . The President , on being informed of this , quoted to Rosecrans the following words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " At elections see that those , and only those , are allowed to vote who are entitled to do so by the laws of Missouri , including as of those laws the restrictions laid by the Missouri convention upon those who may have participated in the rebellion . ' This , " said Lincoln , " I thought right then and think right now , and I may add I do not remember that either party complained after the election of General Schofield 's action under it . Wherever the law allows soldiers to vote , their officers must also allow it . " a The opposition to Mr. Lincoln within the ranks of his own party did not entirely die away , even after the Chicago nomination and the changed political prospect which immediately followed ' it . So late as the 20th of September Thurlow Weed wrote to Mr. Seward that The conspiracy against Mr. Lincoln collapsed on Monday last . It was equally formidable and vicious , embracing a larger number of leading men than I had supposed possible . Knowing that I was not satisfied with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my objection to Mr. Lincoln is that he has done too much for those who now seek to drive him out of the field . Their last meeting was early last week at the house of Dudley Field , which was attended by Greeley , George Wilkes , Tilton , Opdyke , Noyes , and twenty-five others of the same stripe . He also stated that a circular had been sent to leading Republicans in other States inquiring as to the feasibility of making another nomination for President at that time ; that the malcontents , finding themselves in solitude , had concluded to break up operations and try to control the regular State convention . // After every semblance of open hostility had disappeared everywhere else in the country the fire of faction still kept it alive in Missouri . A singular state of things existed there . The radical party had almost entirely absorbed the Union sentiment of the State ; the conservative * ) arty , the President 's friends , had almost ceased to exist . The incumbents of the Government offices , a few of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the radicals ; and so long as this attitude was maintained the radicals , while working vigorously for their State and local tickets , refused to avow themselves in favor of Lincoln . So far as can be ascertained the only reason for this absurd position was that the " Clay Banks , " as the conservatives were called , wished the radicals to declare for Lincoln as a pretext by which they could join the vast majority of their party , and the radicals spitefully refused to allow them this accommodation . Mr. Fletcher , the radical candidate for governor , refused during the greater part of the campaign to make any public statement that he would vote for Lincoln . His reason for this , privately given , was that he feared such an announcement would alienate from his support a large number of the more furious anti-Lincoln Germans . At last , however , he concluded to declare for the regular Republican presidential ticket , and a meeting was appointed for the purpose ; but , to the astonishment of the moderate Union men , he went no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote for McClellan , and in explanation of this singular performance he told the President 's private secretary 1 that he had found at the hotel where his speech was made a letter of the " Clay Bank " committee offering their support on condition of his declaring for Lincoln , and that he would not be coerced into it . The President sent messages to the moderate Unionists expressing his desire that the absurd and futile quarrel should come to an end , and they , to do them justice , desired nothing more . The only condition of their support which they made was that candidates should declare themselves for Lincoln , which they in turn would have been willing to do if it were not that the " Clay Banks " requested it . So far as practical results went the party was united enough Mr. Nicolay reported ; it seems to be well understood that , with the exception of very few impracticables , the Union men will cast their votes for you , for the radical congressmen , f3r the emancipation candidates , for th' State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly everybody is right and united , while in profession everybody is wrong or at cross purposes . This was surmised while the clatter of factious fighting was going on , and was abundantly proved by the result . While the radical candidate for governor only claimed that he would be elected by a majority often thousand , which claim by many of his party was considered sanguine , when the votes were counted it was found that Lincoln had carried the State by the immense majority of forty thousand . The electoral contest began with the picket firing in Vermont and Maine in September , was continued in what might be called the grand guard fighting in October , in the great States of Pennsylvania , Ohio , and Indiana , and the final battle all along the line took place in November . Vermont and Maine were carried by good Republican majorities , the canvass in the latter State having been managed by James G. Blame with a dash and energy which gave a presage of his future career . Before the October elections came on , auguries of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was little doubt in the bestinformed political circles of the result . The President , however , was too old a politician to be sure of anything until the votes were counted , and it was not without some natural trepidation that on the evening of the i ith of October he walked over to the War Department to get from the telegraphic instruments the earliest intimations of the course of the contest . The first dispatch he received contained the welcome intelligence of the election of Rutherford B. Hayes and his Republican colleague from the hard-fought Cincinnati districts . Next came dispatches announcing a Republican majority in Philadelphia and indicating a similar result in the State of Pennsylvania . The news continued very much in the same strain during the evening , and the President in the lull of dispatches read aloud to Stanton and Dana selected chapters of the Nasby papers . As the votes of the soldiers in the different camps in the vicinity of Washington began to be reported they were found to be nearly unanimous in favor of the Republican candidate , the proportion among We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the Eastern troops , although there was everywhere a majority , it was not so large . Carver Hospital , by which Lincoln and Stanton passed every day on their way to the country , gave the heaviest opposition vote reported-about one out of three . Lincoln turned to the Secretary and said , " That s hard on us , Stanton ! They know us better than the others . " The sum of the day 's work was of enormous importance . Indiana indicated a gain of thirty thousand in two years . Go&amp;ernor Morton and the entire Republican ticket were elected by twenty thousand majority , with the gain of four congressmen . Pennsylvania , whose representatives in 1 Nicolay to Lincoln , Oct. m8 , 1864 . MS. // Congress had been equally divided , now changed their proportion to fifteen against nine , and made her legislature strongly Republican in both branches , with popular majorities ranging from ten to fifteen thousand . The Unionists carded Ohio by a majority of over fifty-four thousand and effected a complete revolution in her representation in Congress ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five Republicans , she now sent to Washington seven teen Republicans and two Democrats . But the success of the day which lay nearest to the heart of the President was the adoption in Maryland of the new State constitution abolishing slavery forever on her soil . The majority was a very slender one , the vote of the soldiers in the field being necessary to save emancipation ; but it served , and the next month the Union majority was greatly increased . It would seem strange that after this decisive victory there should have been any room left for hope or confidence on the side of the opposition or for anxiety and panic among Republican politicians ; but alternating fits of confidence and despondency are inseparable from all long-continued political campaigns , and even after these overwhelming successes we find the Democratic speeches and papers full of boasting , and the private correspondence of the most experienced Republican leaders full of tremor and apprehension . The President , however , had passed through his moment of despondency , and from this time to the end entertained no shadoxv of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the *7th of October from Galena : " It is no use to deceive ourselves about this State . Everything is at sixes and sevens ; no head or tail to anything . There is imminent danger of our losing the State 's ; and more in the same strain . The President laid away the letter , writing on the envelope the single word , " Stainpeded . " Ten days later XVashburne had recovered his spirits , and wrote , " John Logan is carrying everything before him in Egypt . " Earlier in the campaign Mr. Washburne , desiring to do all in his power to forward the Union cause , had written to Grant asking l ) ermission to print a letter from him in favor of Lincoln . Grant replied that he had no objection to this , but he thought that " for the President to answer all the charges the opposition would bring against him would be like setting a maiden to work to prove her chastity . " A friend of Mr. Seward communicated to him about the same time an astonishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered that the opposition policy for the presidential campaign would be to abstain from voting . The Secretary submitted this letter to the President . To Mr. Lincoln , with his life-long observation of politics , this idea of abstention from voting seemed more amusing than threatening . He returned the letter to the Secretary WTith this indorsement : " More likely to abstain from stopping when once they get at it . " As the time drew near for the election in November a flight of rumors of intended secessionist demonstrations in the principal States of the North covered the land . The points of danger which were most clearly indicated were the cities of Chicago and New York . We have related in another place the efficient measures taken to prevent any outbreak in Chicago , with the arrest and punishment of the conspirators . The precautionary measures in other States prevented any attempt at disorder . To preserve the public peace in the city of New York and to secure the guarantee of a fair and orderly election there , General Butler was sent with a considerable force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the 5th of November declaring that troops had been detailed for duty in that district sufficient to preserve the peace of the United States , to protect public property , to prevent disorder , and to insure calm and quiet . He referred to the charge made by the opposition that the presence of Union troops might possibly have an effect upon the free exercise of the duty of voting at the ensuing election . He hotly repudiated this accusation . The armies of the United States he said are ministers of good and not of evil . . . . Those who fear them are accused by their own consciences . Let every citizen having the right to vote act according ta the inspiration of his own judgment freely . He will be protected in that right by the whole power of the Government if it shall become necessary . He denounced energetically the crime of fraudulent voting , but did not assume to himself the duty of separating the tares from the wheat . He simply warned the evil-intentioned that fraudulent voting would be detected and punished after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as usual , much exercised for fear of executive usurpation at the polls , and had issued a proclamation on the 2d of November urging the avoidance of all measures which would tend to strife or disorder . He called upon sheriffs of counties to take care that every voter should have a free ballot in the manner secured to him by the constitutional laws , and to exercise the full force of the law and call , forth , if need be , the power of their districts against the interference of the military in the vicinity of the polling-places . There was by no means a unanimous agreement among even the supporters of the Administration as to the expediency of sending // action was taken by Mr. Stanton on his own responsibility . Thurlow XVeed disapproved of it , and up to the day of election thought , on the whole , the proceeding was injurious , in spite of Butler 's admirable general order ; but Butler acted under the circumstances with remarkable judgment and discretion . He devoted the days which elapsed between his arrival and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its police arrangements , and the means at his disposal to preserve order . Every hour was occupied with a careful study of maps , of police arrangements , of telegraphic communication between his headquarters and every region of the city , and in consultations with general officers , the creation of an improvised engineer department , and the planning of a system of barricades in case of a widespread insurrection . But the object to which he gave special attention , and in which he most thoroughly succeeded , was the avoidance of any pretext for any charge of interference with the rights of citizens at the polls . On the morning of the 8th of November , although the city was absolutely in the hands of the disciplined military force which had been sent to gu arcl it , not a soldier was visible to the thousands of voters who thronged the streets ; but everybody knew that they were there , and the result was , as Butler telegraphed to Lincoln at noon on election day , " the quietest city ever seen . " To Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life . Assured of his personal success , and devoutly confident that the day of peace and the reestablishment of the Union was not far off ; he felt no elation and no sense of triumph over his opponents . His mind seemed filled with mingled feelings of deep and humble gratitude to the vast majority of his fellow-citizens who were this day testifying to him their heartfelt confidence and affection , and of a keen and somewhat surprised regret that he should be an object in so many quarters of so bitter and vindictive an opposition . He said to one of his secretaries : " It is singular that I , who am not a vindictive man , should always , except once , have been before the people for election in canvasses marked for their bitterness . When I came to Congress it was a quiet time ; but always , except that , the contests in which I have been prominent have been marked with great rancor. " 1 In the evening he went over , as was his custom , to the War Department . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the telegraph room he was handed a dispatch from Mr. Forney claiming xo , ooo Union majority in Philadelphia . The figures were so far above his estimate that he said , " Forney is a little ex 699 citable . " A moment after a dispatch came from Mr. Felton in Baltimore , " 15,000 in the city , 5000 in the State . All hail , free Maryland ! " A moment after there came messages from Boston announcing majorities for Mr , Hooper and Mr. Rice of something like 4000 each . The President , astonished , asked if this was not a clerical error for 400 , but the larger figures were soon confirmed . Mr. Rice afterwards , in speaking of these astounding majorities in districts where there was never the least charge made of irregularity at the polls , quoted an explanation made by a constituent of his , with no irreverent intention , " The Almighty must have stuffed the ballot boxes . " The entrance of General Eckert , who came in covered with mud from a fall in crossing the street , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Douglas . He said : " For such an awkward fellow , I am pretty sure-footed . It used to take a rather dexterous man to throw me . I remember the evening of the day in i8*8 that decided the contest for the Senate between Mr. Douglas and myself was something like this - dark , raining , and gloomy . I had been reading the returns and bad ascertained that we had lost the legislature , and started to go home . The path had been worn hog-backed and was slippery . Both my feet slipped from under me , but I recovered myself and lit clear ; and I said to myself ; It is a slip , and not a fall . ' " Mr. Fox , the Assistant Secretary of the Navy , indulged in some not unnatural exultation over the complete effacement of Henry Winter Davis from Maryland politics . Mr. Davis had assailed the navy with a peculiarly nialicious opposition for two years for no cause that Mr. Fdx could assign except that he was a brother-in-law of Montgomery Blair . The President would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that feeling of personal resentment than I , " he said . " Perhaps I have too little of it ; but I never thought it paid . A man has no time to spend half his life in quarrels . If any man ceases to attack me I never remember the past against him . " All the evening the dispatches kept the same tenor of widespread success - in almost all cases above the estimates . The October States showed increased majorities , and long before midnight the indications were that the State of New York had cast her ponderous vote for Lincoln , and made the verdict of the North almost unanimous in his favor , leaving General McClellan but 21 electoral votes , derived from New Jersey , Delaware , and Kentu6ky , 2 i 2 being cast for Lincoln and Johnson . It was two o'clock in the morning before the President left the War Department . At the 1 J. II. , Diary . LINCOLN REELECTED . // door he met a party of serenaders with a brass band who saluted him with music and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a speech . He made a brief response , saying that he did not pretend that those who had thought the best interests of the nation were to be subserved by the support of the present Administration embraced all the patriotism and loyalty of the country . He continued : I do believe , and I trust without personal interest , that the welfare of the country does require that such support and indorsement be given . I earnestly believe that the consequence of this day 's work ( if it be as you assume , and as now seems probable ) will be to the lasting advantage , if not to the very salvation , of the country . I can not at this hour say what has been tha result of the election . But , whatever it may be , I have no desire to modify this opinion , that all who have labored to-day in behalf of the Union organization have wrought for the best interest of their country and the world , not only for the present , but for all fotLlre ages . I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while deeply grateful for this mark of their confidence in me , if I know my heart , my gratitude is free from any taint of personal triumph . I do not impugn the motives of any one opposed to me . It is no pleasure to me to triumph over any one but I give thanks to the Almighty for this evidence of the people 's resolution to stand by free government and the rights of humanity . For several days the torrent of congratulations came pouring in . Frank Blair wrote from Georgia , where he was leading an army corps under Sherman to the sea : " The vote in this army to-day is almost unanimous for Lincoln . Give Uncle Abe my compliments and congratulations . " Grant paused for a moment in his labors in the investment of Richmond to express his sense of the vast importance and significance of the election . He thought a tremendous crisis in the history of the country had been met and triumphantly passed by the quiet and orderly conduct of the American people on the 8th of November @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrations of good-will was so characteristic that it seems to us worthy of special attention . He was absolutely free from elation or self-congratulation . He seemed to deprecate his own triumph and to sympathize rather with the beaten than the victorious party . He received notice that on the night of the ioth of November the various Republican clubs in the District of Columbia would serenade him . Not wishing to speak extempore on an occasion where his words would receive so wide a publication , he sat down and hastily wrote a speech which , while it has not received the world-wide fame of certain other of his utterances , is one of the weightiest and wisest of all his discourses . He read it at the window which opens on the north portico of the Executive Mansion , a secretary standing beside him lighting the page with a candle . " Not very graceful , " he said , " but I am growing old enough not to care much for the manner of doing things . " 1 There was certainly never an equal compliment paid to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the President 's little speech . It has long been a grave question he said whether any government not too strong for the liberties of its people can be strong enough to maintain its existence in great emergencies . On this point the present rebellion has brought our republic to a severe test , and a presidential election occurring in regular course during the rebellion has added not a little to the strain . If the loyal people united were put to the utmost of their strength by the rebellion , must they not fail when divided and partially paralyzed by a political war among themselves ? But the election was a necessity . We can not have a free government without elections ; and if the rebellion could force us to forego or postpone a national election , it might fairly claim to have already conquered and ruined us . The strife of the election is but human nature practically applied to the facts of the case . What has occurred in this case must ever recur in similar cases . Human nature will not change . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have passed through this , we shall have as weak and as strong , as silly and as wise , as bad and as good . Let us , therefore , study the incidents of this as philosophy to learn wisdom from , and none of them as wrongs to be revenged . But the election , along with its incidental and undesired strife , has done good , too . It has demonstrated that a people 's government can sustain a national election in the midst of a great civil war . Until now , it has not been known to the world that this was a possibility . It shows , also , how sound and how strong we still are . lt shows that , even among candidates of the same party , he who is most devoted to the Union and most opposed to treason can receive most of the people 's vote . It shows , also , to an extent yet unknown , that we have more men now than we had when the war began . Gold is good in its place ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold . But the rebellion continues and , now that the election is over , may not all having a common interest reunite in a common effort to save our common country ? For my own part , I have striven and shall strive to avoid placing any obstacle in the way . So long as I have been here , I have not willingly planted a thorn in any man 's bosom . While I am duly sensible to the high compliment of a reelection , and duly grateful , as I trust , to Almighty God for having directed my countrymen to a right conclusion , as I think , for their own good , it adds nothing to my satisfaction that any other man may be disappointed or pained by the result . May I ask those who have not differed with me to join with me in this same spirit towards those who have ? And now let me close by asking three // hearty cheers for our brave soldiers and seamen , and their gallant and skillful commanders.1 In this lofty and magnanimous spirit he received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these days . To a delegation from Maryland who ascribed it to his rare discretion that Maryland was then a free State he replied with deep appreciation of their courtesy , and he added : " Those who differ from and oppose us will yet see that defeat was better for their own good than if they had been successful . " He not only had no feeling of malicious triumph himself , he had no patience with it in *others . When Mr. Raymond , who represented his special friends in New York , wrote a letter breathing fire and vengeance against the officials of the custom-house , who , he said , had come near defeating him in the race for Congress , the President merely observed that it was " the spirit of such letters as that which created the factious malignity of which Mr. Raymond complained . " To all those who begged for a rigorous and exemplary course of punishment for political derelictions in the late canvass his favorite expression was , " I am in favor of short statutes of limitation in politics . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the War Department having in view the punishment of flagrant offenders in New York : " We must not sully victory with harshness . " His thoughtful and chivalrous consideration for the beaten party did not , however , prevent him from feeling the deepest gratitude for those who had labored on his side . He felt that the humblest citicen who had done his duty had claims upon him . Hearing that Deacon John Phillips of Sturbridge , Massachusetts , a man who had already completed his 104th year , and had voted at every presidential election since the foundation of the Government , had taken the pains to go to the polls to vote for him , the President wrote him a grateful letter of thanks . The example he said of such devotion to civic duties in one whose days have already been extended an average life-time beyond the Psalmist 's limit can not but be valuable and fruitful . It is not for myself only , but for the country which you have in your sphere served so long and so well , that I thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the midst of the war of the Revolution , and who had arrived at middle age before this century opened , answered in a note which greatly pleased and moved the President , as coming from one of the oldest men living on the earth . 1 Autograph MS . I feel that I have no desire to live he said but to see the conclusion of this wicked rebellion and the power of God displayed in the conversion of the nations . I believe , by the help of God , you will finish the first , and also be the means of estab lishing universal freedom and restoring peace to the Union . That the God of mercy will bless you in this great work , and through life , is the prayer of your unworthy servant , JOHN PHILLIPs . There is one phrase of the President 's speech of the ioth of November which we have quoted which is singularly illustrative , not only of the quick apprehension with which he seized upon facts of importance , but also of the accuracy and method with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the voting had closed he was able to say that the election had shown that " we have more men now than we had when the war began . " A great bundle of papers which lies before us as we write , filled with telegrams from every quarter annotated in his own neat handwriting , with a mass of figures which would have dismayed an ordinary accountant , shows the importance which he attached to this fact and the industry with which he investigated it . In his message to Congress a few weeks later he elaborated this statement with the utmost care . He showed from the comparative votes in i86o and in 1864 a net increase of votes during the three years and a half of war of * i . The accomplished statisticians of " The Tribune " almanac in the following month , after the closest study of the official returns , expressed their surprise " at the singular accuracy of the President 's figures. ** An extract from his annual message to Congress gives the best summing up of the results of the election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people within the loyal States to maintain the integrity of the Union was never more firm nor more nearly unanimous than now . The extraordinary calmness and good order with which the millions of voters met and mingled at the polls give strong assurance of this . Not only all those who supported the Union ticket so called , but a great majority of the opposing party also , may be fairly claimed to entertain and to be actuated by the same purpose . It is an unanswerable argument to this effect , that no candidate for any office whatever , high or low , has ventured to seek votes on the avowal that he was for giving up the Union . There have been much impugning of motives , and much heated controversy as to the proper means and best mode of advancing the Union cause ; but on the distinct issue of Union or no Union the politicians have shown their instinctive knowledge that there is no diversity among the people . In affording the people the fair opportunity of showing one to another and to the world this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vast value to the national cause . On the day of election General McClellan VOL . XXXVIII. - 92. // resigned his commission in the army , and the place thus made vacant was filled by the appointment of General Philip H. Sheridan , a fit type and illustration of the turn in the tide of affairs , which was to sweep from that time rapidly onward to the great and decisive national triumph . CHASE AS CHIEF-JUSTICE . CHIEF-JUSTIcE TANEY died on the 12th day of October , 1864 , during the public rejoicings that hailed the success of the Union party at the autumnal elections . He was a man of amiable character , of blameless life , of great learning , of stainless integrity ; yet such is the undiscriminating cruelty with which public opinion executes its decrees , that this aged and upright judge was borne to his grave with few expressions of regret , and even with a feeling not wholly suppressed that his removal formed a part of the good news which the autumn had brought to the upholders of the Union . Toilsome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as purity of intentions were concerned , it was marked by one of those mistakes which are never forgiven . In a critical hour of history he had made a decision contrary to the spirit of the age , contrary to the best hopes and aspirations of the nation at large . Before he had assumed the grave responsibilities of Chief-J ustice he had not been insensible to those emotions and sympathies which animated the majority of his countrymen in later years . So early as 1818 he had spoken of slavery as a blot on our aational character , and expressed the confident hope that it would effectually though gradually be wiped away . " Until it shall be accomplished , until the time shall come when we can point without a blush to the language held in the Declaration of Independence , " he said , " every friend of humanity will seek to lighten the galling chain . of slavery and better to the utmost of his power the wretched condition of the slave . " But when he assumed public office he became a part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried them unflinchingly to their logical result , so that to a mind so upright and straightforward in its operations there seemed nothing revolting in the enunciation of the dismal and inhuman propositions of the Dred Scott decision . His whole life was therefore read in the might of that one act , and when he died , the i*iation he had so faithfully served according to his lights looked upon his death as the remnoval of a barrier to human progress . The general feeling found expression in the grim and profane witticism of Senator Wade , uttered some months before , when it seemed likely that the Chief-Justice would Survive the administration of Mr. Lincoln : " No man ever prayed as I did that Taney might outlive James Buchanan 's term , and now I am afraid I have overdone it . " The friends of Mr. Chase immediately claimed that the place thus vacated belonged to him . They not only insisted that he was best fitted of all the public men in the country for the duties of that high office ; that the great issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the rights of the freedmen would be most secure with an ardent and consistent abolitionist ; that the national currency would be best cared for by its parent ; they also claimed that the place had been promised him by the President , and this claim , though not wholly true , was not without foundation . Several times during the last year or two the President had intimated in conversation with various friends of Mr. Chase that he thought favorably of appointing him Chief-Justice if a vacancy should occur . These expressions had been faithfully reported to the Secretary , and promptly entered by him in his diary at the time.1 When Mr. Curtin was a candidate for retilection as governor of Pennsylvania , John Covode came to Mr. Chase and told him if Curtin was elected governor he would shape matters in Pennsylvania so as to secure its delegates in the presidential convention , but that the majority of the loyal men in Pennsylvania preferred Mr. Chase . Mr. Chase replied that no speculations as to Governor Curtin 's future course could excuse the loyal men from supporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself ; that he , Mr. Chase , was not anxious for the Presidency ; that there was but one position in the Government which he would really like to have , if it were possible to have it without any sacrifice of principle or public interest , and that was the chief-justiceship . At this Mr. Covode expressed himself satisfied , and went away resolved to permit the renomination of Curtin , which , it may be said in passing , he could have done nothing to prevent . Mr. Chase 's eyes seemed pretty constantly fixed upon the bench in the intervals of his presidential aspirations . For a few days after his resignation his feelings against the President were of such bitterness that he seems to have given up that prospect . He was on the verge of open revolt from the party with which he had been so long associated . In his diary of the 6th of July he says : Pomeroy says lie means to go on a buffalo hunt and then to Europe . He can not support Lincoln , but wo n't desert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though not willing now to decide what duty may demand next fall . Pomeroyremarked that on the news of my resignation reaching 1 August 30 , 1863.
