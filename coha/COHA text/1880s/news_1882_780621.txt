txt Without having undertaken anything like a canvass of the Seib ate , the opnouents of the Sherman . 3 per cent funding bill are expressing the belief that It will be defeated , and by the aid of the Republicans . Mr. Sherman seems disposed to delay , the day of its defeat , for he resented , with some spirit , the suggestion of Mr. Ingalls that the debate should be brought to a close and vote taken , saying , in a tone of profound astonishment , that he regarded such a proposal to gag the Senate as most extraordinary . The debate was opened by Mr. Saulsbury , who opposed the bill as unnecessary . Tha seats about the circle which had been empty for nearly an hour , while Mr. Saulsbury spoke , filled up when Mr. Windom rose to speak . It did not take long to discover that he was op , posed to the bill . He made the point that the debt was in better condition with $550,000,00d. payable at option than it would be with $20 , t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In his judgment there was no necessity for the bill , and the only argument in favor of it was that of Mr. Sherman that it would save $1,000,000 a year . It would be better , to " let well enough alone . " Fixedness and stability were very-desirable . He would favor the proposition of Mr. Ransom to lay the bill and amendments on the table . The proposed measure was purely experimental . So far as he was concerned he did not believe that any Senator felt that the Treasury could sell the 3 , per cent . five-year bonds . if they were to be put out for 15 , 20 , or 30 years , they might be taken . It had been said that it would be a proud thing for the country the loan could be negotiated . It would if the price of the bonds should not fall below par . If they were offered , and no one would take them , it would not redound to their credit . In his estimation it was not a profitable , wise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal to himself ; for voting against the bill . They were ail liberty to refund every dollar of the 334 per cents . No assurance was given that they , should not be taken up at any time . But hg knew that people who took the 3M per cents were calculating that they were to be con , tinned , and , knowing that the income was so much , and that it would take so many years to pay them , the purchasers had bought on this calculation . He would not vote knowingly so as to change the state of things . It was , therefore , his inclination to renew the motion to lay on the table . Mr. Ingalls , who was anxious to have a vote . reached on his arrears of pensions resolution , . wanted the 3 per cent . bill voted on immediately , but Mr. Sherman , with a reproachful expression of countenance , implored the , Senate not to shut off debate . Mr. - Ingalls said : the debate had continued since Jan. 9 , and that everything except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been talked on . Mr. McPherson and Mr. Morrill sided with Mr. Sherman for a request for more time , and Mr. Windom saying that he did not wish to gag the Senate , Mr. Ingalls withdrew his resolution , to take a vote or lay the bill aside . Mr. Hill , of Georgia . who had intimated that he had some peculiar new views to advance , then took the floor and immediately challenged . the authority in law for the issue for the 334. per cent . bonds . The Constitution was danger of being swallowed up in a question of profits . With great vehemence he as- ' serted his great love for the Constitution : above all things and men , and then proceeded to read some views of a man who , if he were alive , would be characterized as an incurable old Bourbon . He meant George Washington , of whom some one had said , passing the highest enlogium on him that had been vouchsafed to men : " He wasfirst in war , first in peace , and first in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loudly . from Washington 's farewell address , Mr. Hill was interrupted by Mr. Windom 's calm voice and informed by the Minnesota , Senator that there were no 334 per cent . bonds , and he read from a debt statement to show that the 3X per cents were 5 and 6 per cents , continued at 33q , with the indorsement of the holders waiving the difference in interest . " Does the Senator really think this a violation of the Constitution I " asked Mr. Windom . Mr. Hill stopped his reading of the farewell address and shouted that he did hold such an arrangement , not only unconstitutional , but dangerous . To Mr. Windom 's question as to whether Mr. Hill would vote to give the 6 per cent . bond holders the 234 per cent . they had waived , Mr. Hill re-plied with the broad declaration he regarded ' the 334 per cents unconstitutional . Whew asked for his reasons ? he replied that he regarded the action of the Secretary of the Treasury in issuing the 33y per cents as an infringement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they could change the terms of one bond as to the rate of interest , they ! could as easily increase as diminish it and could shorten or extend the terms for which bonds were to run . The speech of Mr. Hill , was prolonged on this ground till it was too late for further business , and the Senate went into , executive session and afterward adjourned until Monday , apparently not yet ready to vote . on the Sherman bill .
