txt Whatever may be the intent and purport of the law providing for an additional inspector of election for each election district , it is pretty certain that the act of JOHN J. O'BRIEN in swearing in the list of the United Labor Party , without authority from the Police Board was illegal and of no effect . It was a brazen defiance of the authority of the Commissioners , whose subordinate he is , if not a contempt of the court to which the question of the duty of the Commissioners in the premises has been referred . Certainly Mr. O'BRIEN has no right to take the matter out of the hands of the court and decide the question for it or in any way to forestall its action . The act of the Legislature amending the law with reference to the appointment and duties of inspectors of election was clumsily drawn , and the amendment inserted on its passage through the Assembly was ambiguously worded , possibly on purpose and with the intention of evading the necessity of action by the full Board of Police Commissioners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amended , declares that " all inspectors of election and poll clerks in the city and county of New-York shall hereafter be selected and appointed by the Board of Police , " and in this respect it was left unchanged . It also provides that the two of the regular four inspectors who are to represent the party " in political minority on State issues " shall be " named solely " by such Commissioner or Commissioners as are representatives of such political minority . It has always been the understanding of the law and the practice that those " named " for the minority by one or two Commissioners , as the case may be , should receive their actual appointment from the board , as is plainly required by the opening words of the section . The amendment providing for the additional inspector says that " it shall be the duty of said Board of Police to appoint for each election district in said city and county one further and additional inspector , " &c.,; but it adds further along , " the inspectors of election appointed to represent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such Commissioner or such of the Commissioners of Police in said board as the Chairman . and Secretary of the organization of said political party in said city shall designate . " Here is where the crafty work of those amending the bill came in and the source of all the dispute and trouble . But a jumble of this kind , whether it is a trick or a blunder , will hardly be permitted to interfere with the general purpose and meaning of the law . The words , " shall be appointed solely by such Commissioner , " &c.,; are evidently inconsistent with the previous statement that " it shall be the duty of said Board of Police " to make the appointments . It is also inconsistent with the language at the beginning of the section , declaring that " all inspectors of election " shall be " selected and appointed by the Board of Police . " The Chief of the Bureau of Elections has nothing whatever to do with the appointment of inspectors , his solo duty in connection therewith being to notify and swear in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to be further noted that they must receive certificates of appointment " from the Board of Police . " and those entitled to certificates are described in the law as those who have been " nominated , approved , and sworn into office , " clearly implying that the naming by a single Commissioner is only a " nominating , " which must be " approved " by the board . The law coustrued as a whole is tolerably clear , and the phrase " appointed solely , " which is used in the amendment , must be construed as meaning the same as the " named solely " used . in the previous part of the same section . But there is one other point which seems to us to be conclusive of the whole matter and to sweep away completely all ground . for dispute as to who is entitled to the additional inspectors . There is no one entitled to them . The law explicitly says : " And if , at the next preceding municipal election , any political party or organization shall have cast for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ votes or upwards . " &c.,; the Board of Police shall appoint an additional inspector " of the political faith or opinion of said political party . " Now , HENRY GEORGE was not nominated last Fall by any political party or organization , but by a conference of labor unions . He was supported by men of all parties ? Republicans , Tammanyites . County Democrats , and Irving Hall men . No political party or organization cast for him or for any candidate on the ticket with him fifty thousand votes and upwards . His supporters wore an unorganized mass made up from labor unions and all the existing political parties . The United Labor Party , which now claims the inspectors , was not organized until several weeks after the election , and did not after its organization and does not now include by many thousands all those who voted for the George ticket . Some thousands of them are in the Irving Hall organization , some other thousands are in the Progressive Labor Party , formed only a few weeks ago , and still other thousands probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belonged . The fact is that there is no " political party or organization " now existing outside of the Democratic and Republican Parties which at the last municipal election cast for its candidates for any office fifty thousand votes and upwards , And therefore none that is entitled to the additional inspectors .
