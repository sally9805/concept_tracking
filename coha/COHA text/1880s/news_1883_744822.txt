txt In the first three months of the current fiscal year the reduction of the national debt has amounted to nearly $30,000,000 , and the Secretary of the Treasury has called for bonds to the amount of $47,000,000 , which he has undertaken to redeem . The reduction for September was greater than the reduction made in either July or August , because only a few thousand dollars were required for pension payments in September , while the pension expenses of the first two months of the fiscal year were $26,000 , - 000 . Statements recently made by the Commissioner of Pensions indicate , however , that he has again over-estimated the cost of the operations of his bureau , and that his demands upon the Treasury in the coming nine months will not seriously disturb estimates already made by the Secretary . The amount of surplus for the entire year can not be satisfactorily estimated upon the basis afforded by the reduction of debt effected in the first three months , but a prediction that the surplus will be at least $100,000,000 may be regarded as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there is now no reason to believe that it will fall below that sum . The last of the 31 per cent . bonds were called in July , and the Government began three weeks ago to redeem , the 3 per cents by calling for $15,000 , - 000 of them . It appears , therefore , that before the end of the year the Government may be forced to call and redeem at least $50,000 , - 000 more of the 3 per cent . loan . More than two-thirds of this loan  --  or about $200,000 , - 000 ? is held by the national banks and deposited in Washington as security for their circulating notes . In less than three years they must give up these bonds , and they can not afford to substitute for them 4 per cents or 441 per cents . Nor can the Government under present laws avoid undermining the national banking system by thus calling the 3 per cents , for until 1891 there will be no others which it can call . The work of redemption must go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the currency , for the banks will give up their circulation when they find that they can not keep it alive without loss . The Forty - eighth Congress will have this great problem to deal with . We can not expect , however , that it will approach the question with any desire to handle it in a sensible way . To a majority of the Demo- crats our national banking system  --  the best and most convenient banking system that this country has ever had ? is an iniquitous institution that ought to die . The majority of the Democratic House will hail with joy the statement that a serious contraction of bank circulation can be prevented only by wise legislation . If , however , the Fortyeighth Congress were inclined to deal fairly with the banks , it would find the problem very difficult to solve . Shall the banks be allowed to deposit as security State bonds instead of Government bonds ? Ought the Government to let the 3 per cents lie , and use its surplus in redeeming 41 ; per cents bought at a high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be issued for the exclusive use of the banks ? These are the questions that would be presented , and there is a great deal to be said in opposition to any one of the plans suggested by them . Admitting , however , that it would be difficult for even a friendly Congress to devise a satisfactory plan for the relief of the banks , it is very plain that this condition of things ought to lead the supporters of the banking system and those whose duty it is to study such problems to examine the subject carefully on every side , and to continually strive to find a way in which the system can be maintained and a serious contraction of the bank-note currency prevented .
