txt A tremendously important discovery has just been made by a Scientific Person who is also an Evolutionist . This discovery is set forth in a recent number of an American scientific magazine , and is nothing less than the startling truth that man is by nature a quadruped and makes a great mistake in walking upright . It is impossible to doubt the truth of this discovery . It is demonstrated in a calm , clear , and utterly indisputable way . The Scientific Person shows that man is , so to speak , a horizontal engine , and that in willfully trying to be an upright engine he deranges all his machinery and renders himself liable to all sorts of diseases and accidents . Man , according to the Scientific Person , is provided with valves situated in his blood-vessels and designed to regulate the flow of the blood to and from the heart . These valves are so constructed as to act perfectly when man places himself on all fours , but they act either with difficulty or not at all when he stands erect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a quadruped . Again , it was intended by nature that the thorax , the ribs , and the corset should support the weight of the viscera . This they would do were man to go on all fours , whereas they ceased to give any support whatever to the ' viscera when man assumed the upright position . Nature has , in accordance with her benevolent practice , striven to supply bipedal man with something that would support his viscera , but so far she has produced nothing but the waistband of the trousers , and no one will pretend that this is sufficient to hold up the heart , lungs , stomach , liver , and trousers pockets of a full-grown man , It is shown by the Scientific Person that a large number of diseases are caused by the unnatural practice of standing erect . It is hardly necessary to mention all these diseases in a journal not professedly devoted to science , but it is permissible to point out that walking erect tends to produce holes in the bottom of pockets , through which money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
