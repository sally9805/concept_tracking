REALISM AND THE ART OF FICTION . By Ar/c Bates . I much has been said , and some of it , on the whole , so well said , concerning the relation of realism to fiction , that it requires not a little hardihood again to take up a theme so well worn . Yet so vague and confused are the general ideas upon the subject that even Colonel Ingram 's double might well find his famous excuse insufficient to support a refusal to add his ideas , did he have any , to the still scanty understanding of the matter . There is much talk of the " realistic school " nowadays , but seldom any very definite comprehension of what that phrase does or should mean ; and the value of further discussion must lie in its making clear and exact opinions now hazy . The diVOL. 11. - lO. rection of the intellectual currents of an age is not to be altered by argument ; but there is satisfaction , and even profit , in learning whither we are tending , and in the endeavor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permanent standards as one is able to fix upon . II . AT the outset of any study of theories or principles one is met by the difficulty of definition . Indeed , when once a definition is satisfactorily fixed upon , the whole matter may generally be regarded as settled ; and could we at the outset of the present inquiry adequately and without challenge define realism and art , we should find all else selfobvious inference , and might contentedly end where we began . There are certain authors and certain books which are generally conceded to be " realistic , " in the technical sense of that word . In // qwq truth . imagination , and to consider in what way the imagination is most surely to 11111. be reached . The artist who addresses himself to the intellect alone , no matter qwq situations of human experience that the artist best accomplishes his legitimate object . It is this that Emerson must have had in mind when he wrote , " The poet gives us the eminent experiences only  --  a god stepping from peak to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This is by no means to be understood as signifying that art deals with the sensational , or even necessarily with the outwardly striking ; it does mean that art has chiefly to do with the emotionally intense and significant . Millet painted the most commonplace of peasants , yet he did it so emotionally , so ideally , so burningly , that the critic could say of his " Sower " that it was revolutionary . It is the men who have chosen themes for their emotional significance who have moved the world . Much of the confusion which arises in discussing these aesthetic questions springs from the fatal error of forgetting that the ultimate judgment of a work of art can no more be arrived at on the strictly intellectual plane than can the conclusions of science be gauged upon the purely emotional . It must next be considered that whatever thought or feeling passes from man to man must have its language . Every art , like every people , must have its own speech . Art has no mission to imitate nature  --  a task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; yet in most arts some species of imitation is the language which serves to embody and to convey the intention of the artist . " Painting which produces an illusion of reality , " observes Alfred Stevens , " is an artistic lie . " The reason is obvious-such painting would mean no more than the reality it duplicated . " The mission of art , " said William M. Hunt , " is to represent nature , not to imitate her ; " and he might have added that it pictures nature , not for the sake of nature , but for the sake of the emotions which are aroused by the message of which such representation is the vehicle . If one more quotation may be pardoned , the words of Fromentin may be added : " It would be idle to be a lofty spirit and a grand painter if one did not put into his work something which the reality has not . It is in this that man is more intelligent than the sun , and I thank God for it . " Too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to the imagination that art directly appeals . Imagination is that paradoxical power by which the mind receives as real what it yet knows to be fictitious . It would , perhaps , be more exact to say that , for the sake of arriving at the inner significance of a work , the mind assumes the reality of the language employed , accepting this fictitious reality as an hypothesis from which to reach the intended conclusions . To produce genuine pain and joy in the personal sense in which they are caused by actual experience is manifestly not the aim of art . In cases where events have so strongly impressed a person that he cannot hold his aesthetic sensations separate from his personal feelings , he is unable to appreciate the production of the artist . iEsthetic feeling is that emotion which the imagination receives as genuine while the reason yet knows it to be artificial . Did we really hold art as true , who could find enjoyment in a tragedy ? Did we not assume it to be real , who would be moved ? Diderot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the fact that the tears raised by a tragedy in real life and those caused by a touching narrative are very different , as if this were a limitation and indicated an inferiority on the part of art . In truth , it is herein that lies its superiority . Reality reaches the emotions through the passions ; art , through the imagination . The latter involves the voluntary surrender of the mind to a fictitious interest , an experience which is valuable because it arouses that sentiment wherein lies eli the savor of life . Art , then , is the employment of conventions to arouse aesthetic emotions . Art which concerns itself with mere imitation loses sight of this fundamental principle and becomes a simple exercise in language , whether it deal with form , sound , color , or word . IV . HAVING thus glanced , albeit inadequately enough , at the whole field of art , we come now in our inquiry more // qwq branch of natural history , and a novel merely a more or less entertaining volume on ethnology . He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with others absolutely incompatible ; which Flaubert followed with a cynicism so coldblooded that it would have rendered untrue the most exact and exhaustive treatise upon batrachians or ophidians , since even science , which at least differs from art in rejecting the intuitive , were helpless without imagination . The weakness of the position of Zola is evident . li art is not other than science , it is at best superfluous ; if it is not more farreaching , mankind has cherished a false ideal from the earliest dawn of civilization . Science has no desire to appeal to man 's emotional nature ; and , equally , art has no excuse for existence if it awakens no response save from the reason . If it be claimed that Zola 's art may be exactly what he designs to make it , and yet reach the emotion , it is to be answered that it can do this only in the same sense as does the reality , and it has already been shown that it is not with personal , but with aesthetic , emotion that the artist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the means of the quickening of the imagination . It is the artistic condemnation of the novel that really is written when it is commended because in reading it one feels that he has witnessed the career of a man as he " might have witnessed it in the world and not in a book . " Those who hold to the artistic school believe that the novelist should be of sufficient enlightenment to teach us truths which ordinary mortals could not themselves discover , however painfully they trained their powers of observation . The homely traits of vulgar persons , the argot of Paris slums , the outward characteristics of any place or people , are within the reach of any searcher ; but the artist is not alone to be the observer , he must also be the seer . It is his mission to show from what hidden , inner courses arise these outer effects . Every human being may have within himself possibilities which will make him capable of recognizing the truth of all that the inspired artist exhibits ; but only those rarely and specially gifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been agreed to call genius possess the power of understanding , untaught , themselves and their fellows . It is one thing to acknowledge a verity when it is brought home to us , and quite another originally to perceive it through whatever obscurity . The realist takes the only position tenable for him when he denies the existence of genius , since to acknowledge such a quality would be to sweep away , at once and forever , the entire claims of the realistic school . No wonder that Henry James says of realism that " it was a good fortune for a charming story-teller to have come a little before it . " V. THE difference between realism and idealism , looked at from one point of view , is merely that of selection . No novelist can set down everything which would occur in a given life ; and from all that goes to make up mortal existence , what shall be chosen ? The realist would perhaps say , " The average ; " the idealist certainly would answer , " The significant ; " or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the application would in one case be to the outer , and in the other to the inner , life  --  the result in practice being that the realist , once more to appropriate a happy phrase from Mr. James , contents himself with " the mere dead rattle that rises forever from the surface of life . " Realism , in a word , concerns itself with how human nature appears ; art , with what it is . It is the accidental versus the essentiaL The novelist has really little to do but to suppress those facts and details which do not directly bear upon the point which he wishes to bring out ; but this very suppression is regarded by the realist as an exaggeration , and as such is hateful to him . He strives for the confusion , the obscurity , the dull sense of baffled vision , which meet us in real life , and he ignores the fact that even in observing life we select and examine events and sequences of cause and effect by isolating them in the mind . The realists seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the Dutch // masters did in painting . It is as if one , perceiving the great cleverness and fidelity with which details are rendered in the Dutch paintings , should ignore the fact that it is not for these things , but for the portrayal of light and of color , that the pictures exist . When Teniers or Jan Steen paints the shop of a butcher , or a scene of vulgar debauchery in a tavern where drunken clowns assemble , he renders everything with a literalness which would be dry and brutal realism alone ; but these masters never lost sight of the fact that the intricate delicacies of light and of color were the language in which they were speaking , and that their art was an appeal to the imagina*tion . The man who sees in the Dutch school , with its subtile and suggestive gradations of values and of tone , its delights of atmosphere , dusky or goldentinted , of transparent mists , of lucent shadows , only the force of outer veracity , had better go and join himself to Peter Bell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to unite the two realists ! I have spoken already of the relation between art and emotion . It remains to note that realism rejects aesthetic emotion , the product of the imagination , and easily enough perceives that the emotion of the passions  --  the phrase being meant to stand for those selfish and practically effective feelings which are aroused by real events-cannot be produced by a confessed fiction . It therefore is forced to take the position that to call the production of an emotion an essential in art is a fallacy . It makes its appeal to the reason , and rests content with that Philistine approval . ML ANOTHER point is to be noted . The aim of art is not the expression of truth so much as the impression of truth . That work which , by whatever means , seems most true to the imagination best fulfils its art-purpose . It must not , by the very energy of its efforts to compass truth , draw attention to its necessary shortcomings . A colored statue may be more nearly true to life than one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces attention to the lack of movement and of life . As Eastlake has said , it is the imagination , not the senses , that is to be cheated . It is a case in which art protests too much by half . For the production of the impression of truth , moreover , distortion is always necessary . To act , move , speak on the stage , as one would talk and walk in real life would produce no illusion . The photographs of the horse in motion affect the imagination as pitiful and ludicrous lies . It is necessary to exaggerate to produce the effect of reality ; to be inexact in order to seem true . The observer is always unconsciously affected by the conditions of art ; he instinctively allows for the conventions which serve as its language , and the realistic novel , making no allowance for this fact , produces in the end an impression inevitably false , because of the very care taken to render it true . The aim of art being the effect of truth , it follows that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the persons addressed is not offended by the falsity inherent in the conventions employed . We are accustomed to assume that the public to which the artists of the Renaissance addressed themselves were ignorantly blind to the anachronisms with which the works of the masters of that period abound . The assumption is manifestly absurd . The educated patrons of Titian , Raphael , and their contemporaries , were as well aware as are critics to-day that men in biblical times did not wear the Italian dress of the sixteenth century . They were so keenly alive , however , to the deeper intention of the painter that historical inaccuracy did not trouble them . They regarded not so much the language as the message it carried , the motive of the work . With imaginations alert to receive the art-thought embodied by genius , they were quickened and elevated where a realist , carping at the form , would simply have been critically offended . The same thing is to be seen very markedly in the Elizabethan drama . The brilliant coterie of learned wits who led opinion at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through dukess , but through sesthetic indiffer // ence to the absurdities of geography , history , costume , and speech , over which wiseacres gravely shake their heads nowadays whenever Shakespeare 's plays come under their pedantic notice . These things they rightly regarded as accidents ; and the fact that the Italians and the Englishmen of the sixteenth century found in art a meaning so important and so absorbing as to render them indifferent to the exactness of details should at least show the realist that upon him is forced the necessity of declaring that the art-criterions of that most fruitful of modern periods were false and futile , or of acknowledging that there are standards higher than that of slavish fidelity in trifles . In the same spirit we may question if the Apollo Belvedere would be improved by being reduced to correct human proportions , and whether the Parthenon would be nobler if , instead of being made by such devices as entasis and the inclination of its corner pillars to look geometrically correct , it had been made mathematically exact and appeared out of drawing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustrates the same point , and is well worth repeating . When he was rehearsing the part of Triboulet , which he was shortly to create in Victor Hugo 's tragedy , " Le iRoi s'amuse , " he was asked how large , in making up for the stage , he should have the deformity of the hump-backed character . " I shall simply elevate my shoulders , " he answered , " in those scenes where I wish to call attention to the fact that Triboulet is hump-backed . The hump is not essential to the rOle . There are scenes where this hump ought to be forgotten by the public , and where it would obstruct the effect . If I made it part of my dress , I should be forced to keep it always the same ; but if I have merely the appearance of a hump , I shall be able to make it disappear in those passages where Triboulet ought to be simply terrible and pathetic . " " Got , " comments M. Sarcey , after relating this story , " as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poetic truth ; he felt the necessity of translating for the eyes the idea of the poet , and he understood that to throw across it the image of a deformity was to disconcert the sight and the imagination of the spectators . " No two arts are to be too closely paralleled , yet each illustrates the others . There are essential differences , of course , between the novel and the drama ; but the important principle that there is something more essential than the presentation of literal truth is common to them , because it is a fundamental condition of all art . VII . BUT even were all that has been claimed granted , the realists have still a mighty argument . Our age , they say , will not endure falsification even for the effect of truth . The idealist might ask who has made the generation thus wise in the secrets of art-craft ; but he contents himself by allowing that the statement is most lamentably true . It is the age of Bunker Hill monument , in all its veracious ugliness ; not of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beguile the eye into believing them straight lines . However much worse it may be held to be for the age , the artist must certainly reckon with the conditions that exist ; and undoubtedly there is a generation , albeit a froward one , that clings to the worship of literalism as men have been joined to the service of idols many a time before . It is , in the first place , an age in which exists a mighty spirit of doubt and of negation , and such a period is slow to trust itself to any guide save cold-blooded veracity . A decadence in faith means always a decline in art ; and , wide of the mark as the statement may at first appear , it is the doubt of the age which is responsible , however remotely , for the realism of to-day . When scepticism revolts against believing in the unknowable , there springs up always a pseudo-art which ignores or repudiates the unknown . Idealism presupposes unphrasable and indescribable emotions , which it may arouse , but not define . Realism , adapting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubled or concerned with what // can not be made tangible , devotes its entire attention to what it is pleased to call realities because they are within the cognizance of the five senses by means of which man perceives the cruder manifestations of the eternal verities . It is the natural product of a bleak and unbelieving time ; and although it takes to itself whatever honor should belong to that which leads , in reality it only follows , and follows blindly . In fact , it is far behind ; for already the reaction from agnostic negation has begun , and in a thousand ways , some of them vague and fantastic enough , the longing human need of faith is reasserting itself . This , however , while it may explain , does not by any means justify , the position of the realist . That the court of Charles the Second was unspeakably corrupt makes it evident enough why the comedy of the Restoration can hardly be read to-day ; but what apologist would claim that , since the times were filthy , it was justifiable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That a large part of mankind is to-day materialistic or agnostic explains how the artist is tempted to become realistic and negative also ; but is the fact a sufficient excuse as well that he should violate the essential laws of art ? The stronger the perversion of popular taste , the greater the need of strenuous efforts to correct it . In times of peace one might be forgiven some laxity of patriotism ; in war the indifferent man is an enemy almost worse than the avowed rebel . Shall literature not only be robbed of all its claims to nobility of purpose , but must its spoilers also cry aloud its shame in the market-place , endeavoring to cover the dishonor of their treachery by specious pretence ? Better a hundred-fold the nobility of aim of the idealist , though it were proved the most baseless delusion ever cherished by blind enthusiast , than the empty and artistically degraded theories of the realist ! The realist is the minister of the age in its own artistic debasement ; he panders to a spirit which is the most absolute Philistinism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it be able to work on to its logical end , than the absolute subversion and extinction of fiction as an art altogether . Mr. Howells , in what seem strangely self-contradictory terms , has introduced into his " Editor 's Study* ' a noticeable passage , of which the core seems to be the same idea . " When realism , " he writes , " becomes false to itself , when it heaps up facts merely , and maps life instead of picturing it , realism will perish . " These words would seem , if they stood alone , a concession of all that the most exacting idealist could ask , especially as the writer goes on to add : " Every true realist knows this instinctively , and it is , perhaps , the reason why he is careful of every fact , and feels himself bound to express or to indicate its meaning at the risk of overmoralizing . " This last sentence is *emarkable , because it contains the important statement that the true realist must express or indicate the meaning of each fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a realist , Mr. Howells means the scientific and-he might , perhaps , say the moral-not the emotional significance . Another sentence of this rather remarkable paragraph may be quoted here , although it does not exactly fit into the sequence of ideas . " In life , " Mr. Howells observes , " he the realist finds nothing insignificant ; all tells for destiny and character ; nothing that God has made is contemptible . He can not look upon human life and declare this thing or that thing unworthy of notice , any more than the scientist can declare a fact of the material world beneath the dignity of his inquiry . He feels in every nerve the equality of things and the unity of men ; his soul is exalted , not by vain shows and shadows and ideals , but by realities in which alone the truth lies " May , 1886 . " Realities in which alone the truth lies ; " if the realist perceives the fact that in realities lies something beyond and above them , and that the object of art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it concerns itself with what the senses feel to be actualities , he is not a realist at all in the technical sense of the word . The idealist it is who most earnestly and consistently insists that nothing in life is beneath the notice of art , but he adds that all shall be regarded and presented artistically , sig // nificantly . The followers of the ideal or artistic method , however , are no more likely than a trained scientist to fall frito the gigantic and irremediable error of regarding all things as of equal importance . " The equality of things " is a phrase in which is strikingly apparent the inherent weakness of realism . Certainly not from experience , not from reason , not from any examination of the principles of art , not , indeed , from any source save his own baseless theories , has the realist obtained the idea that all things are of equal importance in fiction ; yet there is no tenet of its creed which in practice realism follows more slavishly . It has even , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned itself chiefly with proving that the trifling things were equal to the most momentous experiences , being apparently convinced that the greater were able to take care of themselves . vIm To return to the claim that the age will listen and give heed only to realism , there is at least sufficient evidence that the spirit of the time is not so powerful as to make it impossible for the writer of fiction to rise above it . The " Return of the Native , " that novel of sufficient artistic merit to give distinction to the fiction of a generation , may serve as one modern instance ; " Lorna Doone , " with its warmly romantic heroism ; " Guerndale , " book of splendidly imaginative possibilities ; " The Midge , " tender as a wind-flower blown in a New England spring ; " Ramona , " in which even the obtrusively prominent philanthropy can not smother the genuine passion ; " Prince Otto , " delicious idyl of royalty ; " The Grandissimes , " for the value of which there is no measure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ score of men , with no mean number of other novels which will occur to every reader of fiction-show how possible still is artistic creation , despite whatever lack of favorable conditions . That the works of the idealist will be awarded a hearing is no less shown by facts . None of the books just mentioned has lacked for recognition , not only deep , but wide . " The Ordeal of Richard Feverel , " that live coal from the altar of genius , was given to the world nearly thirty years ago ; it is only to-day , when realism vaunteth itself in the streets , that this book has come to be widely appreciated and that new editions have been eagerly received on both sides of the Atlantic . How warmly have been welcomed , too , the recently issued translations of " P*re Goriot , " " Eug6nie Grandet , " and other of Balzac 's tales in which even the realists are constrained to recognize-and , of course , to lament  --  the presence of emotion and romance . One easily recalls , also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly had little to recommend it save that it was a protest and a reaction against realism ; of " Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde , " least meritorious of the fictions of one of the greatest of living English writers , yet informed by a fancy so lofty as almost to reach to the heights of imagination ; and of the popularity of even such se*isational and rubbishy fantasies as " King Solomon 's Mines " and " She . " Realism has insisted so incessantly upon the need of being absolutely truthful that nothing short of the impossibility of its fulfilling its own demands could save it from becoming infinitely tedious , and the reaction from its tiresome restraint has carried readers even to extremes that might seem absurd . It is to art that humanity turns to be delivered from the self it would not be . Confronted with failures , shams , disappointments , and with that worst of earthly disillusions , the vision of self , it is for a promise of higher possibilities , for the assurance that better things lie within the limits of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hence it is that works which portray noble emotions , which prove the truth of strenuous ideals , can never fail of reaching humanity or of touching it deeply . It has somewhere been said that " it remained for realism to assert that fidelity to experience and probability of motive are essential conditions of a great imaginative literature . " As a matter of fact , the most that realism can claim to have done is to have formulated the obvious truth , already tacitly observed in the practice of the most // romantic of writers of note , that we live in an age which is acute in detecting faults of technique and not imaginative enough to overlook them . The entire grounds for objecting to realism might not unfairly be summed up in the charge that it is not imaginative literature at all . It is worth while to compare this statement with the remark of Henry James , apropos of " Madame Bovary , " " that here the theory seems to have been invented after the fact . " This is , in a manner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , until modern realism was shaped by Gustave Flanbert , the principle " that fidelity to experience and probability of motive are essential conditions of a great imaginative literature " was unknown . With Homer , Shakespeare , Goethe , Fielding , Thackeray , Goldsmith , and a host of others on our library-shelves , such a position is palpably absurd . It is only true that it remained for realism , having lost the practice of this principle , to endeavor to hide the fact by the more strenuously insisting upon it in theory . The age brought it forth and endowed it with a self-consciousness in virtue of which it quickly found itself naked and ashamed ; and the garment of figleaves which it has woven is the theory by which it excuses its existence . That the popularity and the influence of the modern realistic school are generally both somewhat over-estimated seems true , yet there are obvious reasons why it is to be expected that the error should be widely received . lIJncultivated and unimaginative people find a simple and innocent pleasure in the recognition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his thought , and in detecting in them any sort of familiarity . Who has not at art-exhibitions seen the guilelessly silly women who eagerly point out one thing after another with the pathetically naive exclamations : " See , there is a cow ! " " Why , that is Bunscome 's barn ! " " Oh , do look ! If here is n't the Public Garden ! " It is to precisely this feeling , natural enough , but surely not artistically appreciative , that so-called realism chiefly appeals . It pleases the sluggish mind of the intellectual bourgeoisie to discover embalmed in print trifles which are obvious enough to be familiar to even their understanding , and small enough to come within the limits of their comprehension . It grab ifies their childish vanity with all the sense of original discovery to find in the pages of a novel precisely the words a next-door neighbor said this morning . The words may have no especial significance , no beauty , no relevancy , but these worthy people know what they are and feel the rare joy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be utterly denied them ; an emotion so shallow and so absolutely una*sthetic as to be as far beneath the dignity of art as the joy of an idiot over a bunch of windlestraws . " Small beer for small souls " would be a not inappropriate motto for these catalogues of commonplace nothings , recorded with painful minuteness . ONE never gets very far in any minute discussion of realism without coming upon the question of plot . It is one of the whims of certain representatives of the school to insist that all stories have been told ; but in reply it is surely competent to rejoin that every tale is like a sphere , in that it may be looked at from an infinite number of points , and that it is the writer 's way of treatment which determines the value of a work of fiction now , as it did in the beginning . Indeed , the novelist of to-day has over his literary predecessors a definite advantage in the fact that the stories have been all told , since attention is now so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situations , by mere effective incidents , by the accidents of the novel ; and there is , therefore , the better opportunity for the essential , the impress of the master 's hand , to attract and to hold the attention of which it alone is worthy . Had marble figures been unknown before the days of Phidias , simple amazement and curiosity at the fact that of stone he had fashioned the likeness of a man would have obscured the beauty and worth of his work , so that its true artistic message might not have been perceived . The sculptor who desired to appeal only to the lower qualities of astonishment // and curiosity might regret that he was not the first to devise the use of the conventions of his art ; and , in the same way , the novelist who addresses himself but to the surprise and to the superficial interest of his readers will have cause to lament that to him it is not given first to introduce his fellows to a novel tale . The true artist can afford to smile at such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to impress rather by the way in which he does it than by what he does . It is , of course , to something higher than to mere mechanical methods that this truth extends . Simple excellence of workmanship does , in and for itself , exert a certain influence upon the imagination by begetting pure sensuous pleasure ; but the deeper intent of the artist , the means by which he speaks to the imagination , the emotions which it is his purpose to arouse , constitute the higher forms of his method , and in them lies the true essence of original genius . These things are developed rather than in any exact sense learned ; and when appears a writer in whom show themselves strong powers of impressing upon the clay of human life , endlessly remodelled and reworked , the intents and desires of his mind and emotions , he is the true originator , the genius who gives a new revelation in each work that he produces . The stories may have all been told , but as he tells them they become as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrated . There is no longer a question of novelty ; this is the work of a master , and the work of a master is always new . x . A WORD should be said here , since it has not been said earlier , of the distortion of standards by realism , and its destruction of proportions . The attention of the writer being fixed on trifles , he unconsciously destroys all true values by giving to things unworthy of notice a prominence wholly false . Realism is apt , moreover , to substitute scruples for principles , conventionalities for convictions , and social canons for ethical laws ; selecting here , as always , the outward and obvious rather than the inner and unseen . Even when it assumes to deal with great moral issues , it is usually quibbling in the most pitiably trivial fashion . The ethical principles with which it deals must be small enough to fit the slides of the microscope , and fo the moral law , as interpreted by the senses alone , it is impossible to impart dignity or impressiveness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and heroism is too unusual and eccentric for the realist 's consideration . As a matter of fact , realism is not true to its own professions because this is impossible ; but in so far as it is consistent it can do little more than to concern itself with such laws as obviously govern the surface of life which alone they grasp . Looking at life , moreover , always intellectually , and never imaginatively , the realistic writer is untrue also in that he stands in an objective mood toward his characters . That we shall understand the true significance of a word or of an act , it is necessary to apprehend the mood of the speaker or doer , and that , too , in the most intimately subjective way . The expression of the first love of an ignorant , uncouth girl may , to one who does not imaginatively share her feelings , appear simply ludicrous ; yet , surely , he who enters into the emotions of her heart will perceive that the maidenly shrinking and passion which struggle for expression are as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tender murmurings of an llJndine or a Hilda . Has realism compared the eternal truth , then , or merely a trivial shadow of passing illusion , when it so perfectly presents the outward form and appearance of such a confession that the iuner secret is lost sight of ? It is not difficult to make the accidents obscure the essentials , especially since the tendency to do this is the besetting sin of all careless observers of life . The fatal error of regarding the surface as more real than what lies below is common enough ; but surely it should be the mission of art rather to correct than to foster this mistake . XL MucH might still be said of the faults of realism , but there is little need of // examining the minor defects of that which is already seen to be false in its essential principles . In the ultimate judgment the whole issue between realism and idealism must be decided upon the relative success of the twd methods in reaching the emotion through the imagination . Time has hitherto decided always in favor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the sake of this supreme quality , forgiven much offence against the human intellect . If there were no other reason for this , it is to be remembered that the understanding removes constantly from point to point ; advances , optimists believe ; at least , remains fixed nowhere ; while the emotions , the sentiment , the passions of mankind are essentially the same from age to age . We outgrow the knowledge of our ancestors , but the passion which their art embodies is our passion . Emotion is the salt of immortality , without which nothing can be preserved ; and although the highest and most inspiring form of art is that in which the intellect has rendered the most effective service , it is by the force of the imaginative and the passionate qualities that it is immortal . Given this , it can hardly be made too intellectual , too exact , too realistic ; but emotional it must be , first , last , and always . All that has been said in this paper has been said a hundred times before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a god-has , in half a dozen lines , summed up the whole matter of the difference between the outer vision of realism and the inward perception of idealism . What are the dust and ashes of realism beside the living fire of these sublimely glowing words of William Blake ? " I assert for myself that I do not behold the outward creation ; that to me it is hinderance , and not action . What ! ' it will be questioned , when the sun rises do you not see a round disk of fire , somewhat like a guinea ? ' Oh , no , no ! I see an innumerable company of the heavenly host , crying , Holy , holy , holy , is the Lord God Almighty ! ' I question not my corporeal eye any more than I would question a window . I look through it , not with it . "
