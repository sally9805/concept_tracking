txt Coke men are very much interested over a new move by the H. C. Frick Coke Company which has just been made public . They have secured the contract , which has been held by McClure &; Co. for 10 years , for furnishing the North Chicago Rolling Mill with coke . Both firms are members of the syndicate , and the ill feeling arising from this deal may lead to the breaking up of that monopoly . The North Chicago mill takes on an average 80 carloads of coke per day , and its business is the most desirable in the country . What influences were brought to bear in taking the contract away from McClure &; Co. are not known , but the chance is credited generally to Andrew Carnegie .

This is supposed to ne a common ground on which these gentlemen could meet , but it is also known that Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the rail trade . Mr. Potter held himself as king of the Western rail business . He was more than astonished when Mr. Uarnegie sold rails right under his nose . That temerity was sufficient to Put the Chicago manufacturer on his mottle. and the result was a bitter business rivalry . It is said , however , that they have now buried the hatchet and joined hands not only in the coke business andthe steel rail trade , but In the Vanderbilt interests . The oapaoity of the Carnegie mill is about 175,000 tons of steel rails per year , and of the North Chicago Rolling Mills in the neighborhood of 225.000 tons . As the Frick Coke Company has bought a large interest in the Joliet ovens , near Uniontown , which supply the Joliet mills , and is furnishing that company with coke , and as the Union Mill at Milwaukee is also being drawn into the combination , its strength is evident . As one of the results of this deal , the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern , a Vanderbilt road , is starting off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coke freight . Another result is that the North Chicago Rolling Mill Company is not going to erect any mill ovens or to go into the coke business on an extended plan , as has been stated . The company may hold the land and put up a few ovens , but it will only be as a menace to the operators from whom they will buy their coke . Till the first of July , their contract with McClure &; Co. holds . Then the new contract will begin .
