txt The world has been slow in learning the uses of cats . The ancient Egyptians used them as implements of religion ; but , like other people , they never put them to any practical use except in connection with mice . Of course , cats have occasionally been made to do service in the shape of alleged stewed rabbit and veal pie , but it can not be properly said that the cat is a useful table animal . Few people , if asked " What is the cat good for ? " would return any intelligent and serious answer . It has been reserved for an American scientific person in the present year of grace to discover that cats may be made of inestimable value in protecting buildings from lightning , and that this is undoubtedly the true object of the cat 's existence . It can not have escaped notice that cats are never struck by lightning . All other animals are liable to death from this cause . A large number of horses , cows , and sheep are annually killed by lightning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are sometimes struck by the electric bolt , but no one has ever seen a cat that died from a stroke of lightning . It is as well established as any scientific fact can be that the cat enjoys a unique and total immunity from lightning , and times without number when the electric fluid has struck a house and prostrated a room full of people , the family cat lying on the hearth-rug has not had a hair of her tail injured . It is also well established that lightning never strikes the back fences of city houses . It may strike steeples and chimneys , it may fall upon horse cars and carriages and dogkennels , but it never touches a back fence . There must be a reason for this , and Prof. Schmidt , of the University of West Virginia , has discovered the reason . The fact that neither cats nor back fences are struck by lightning indicates a close relation between the two . It suggests that either the fence protects the cats or that the cats protect the fence . Prof. Schmidt , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no self-protecting power inherent in. back fences . He found that a spark from a Leyden jar could be passed directly through any back fence , and on one occasion , having placed a section of back fence on the top of a house , he actually saw it struck and totally destroyed by a thunder-bolt . It was thus made reasonably certain that the immunity from lightning enjoyed by back fences is due to the cats which constantly infest them , and as cats are never struck by lightning it follows that there must be something peculiar in. their electrical condition . Now , every one knows that a cat is simply full of the very best quality of positive electricity . If she is rubbed a little in the dark , the electricity streams from her in a shower of sparks . In this respect she differs widely from all other domestic animals . ' You may take a pig or a horse or a cow into the dining-room closet and rub it for hours , but it will not give out a spark . The electricity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same quality as the electricity of the clouds. , Electricians assure us that electricity of one kind is never attracted by any object charged with the same kind of electricity . Thus , a house in order to be struck by the positive electricity of the clouds must be ? charged with negative electricity , and if by ; any chance it is full of positive electricity it is perfectly safe . , It is the positive electricity of the cat which renders that able animal safe in the severest thunder-storm . The positive electricity of the thunder-bolt slides off the cat as easily and safely as rain from the back of a duck . The lightning of the clouds may aim at a cat all day , but it can not hit her , and wherever the cat may be she will protect her immediate neighborhood from lightning not only as well as , but far better than , any lightning-rod . This is the reason why back fences are never struck by lightning . As a rule they are hardly ever free from cats . Prof. Schmidt has made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the square root of which is equal to three times the length of the cat , including the tail . As an average full-grown cat measures 18 inches from tip to tip , she protects a surface of 2,916 square inches , or a section of back fence 54 inches in length . Thus , three cats and a small kitten , arranged at equal intervals from one another , are amply sufficient to protect the back fence of an ordinary city lot from lightning , and as an average of twelve cats to a back fence is always to be found , we need not wonder that our back fences are safe . If we substitute for the lightning-rods , which are supposed to protect our houses , but which rarely do protect them , a quantity of cats , disasters from lightning will be unknown . This work of protecting houses is the true mission of the cat . The animal at whom we aim boot-jacks and bad lan- ' guage when we find her perched on our roof is really rendering us an important service for which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schmidt has made his grand , discovery of the protective power of cats we may expect to see a complete change of public sentiment in relation to them . Our insurance companies will insure no houses which are not well provided with cats . On the roof of every house will be placed cat-kennels with constant supplies of milk and tender mice , so as to make home attractive to the cats . The aim of every householder will be to have his roof fairly blossom with cats , and the more he can induce to reside permanently on his roof , the safer he will feel and the lower will be his insurance premium . The day of triumph for cats has been long delayed , but it has come at last . Hereafter , whenever a thunder-storm is in progress we shall find men and women sitting with their arms full of cats , and invoking blessings on the only sure protection against the bolts that laugh at lightning-rods and mock at feather beds.                @ @ @ @ @
