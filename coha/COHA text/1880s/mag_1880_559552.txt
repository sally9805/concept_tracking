THERE is , we know , a religion common to all men of sense ; though men of sense never say what that religion may be . There may be more reasons than one for their reticence . A man of sense is well aware that he can say what he pleases without shocking the most delicate orthodoxy . He requires no cryptographic art to hide his meaning , for plain letters are ciphers to all who are not men of sense . The average reader is frightened by the use of certain counters , not by the ideas which they symbolize for the understanding . Refrain from dotting your i 's and crossing your t 's , and your utterance will be for him an insoluble mystery . He would be shocked if you said in plain terms " there is no God " ; but it is easy to give quite an orthodox and edifying turn to the sentiment . We have all read defenses of agnosticism , which pass for assaults upon the wicked " deist , " and elaborate expositions of downright materialism intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , often wish to avoid scandal rather than to conceal their sentiments from their peers . They trust to a freemasonry which exists among themselves , and presents an impenetrable barrier to the sagacity of fools . One may guess that the esoteric creed drops some articles of the orthodox faith ; but the man of sense , while he has a contemptuous smile for any one who ( as M. Renan says of St. Paul ) " believes heavily , " or takes all creeds seriously , has a hearty dislike for the man who too openly discards the established tenets . Why drop a veil so easily worn ? Religion is , after all , useful ; and we are even bound-for the sensible man can take a high moral tone when he pleases  --  to invent the God who does not exist . But how are we to be guided in these troublesome days , when rash persons have insisted upon revealing the open secret , and the esoteric creed of the sensible man has been proclaimed so that they who run may read ? On the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better hold your tongue . We at least , who have no new gospel to preach , will not set up for prophets . Let us look on as calmly as may be at the huge turmoil of conflicting controversy ; smile with equal calmness at the bigots who would damn people for losing their way in the dark ; at the pompous dogmatists who would face it out that they can see as clearly as in broad daylight ; at the feather-headed enthusiasts who take the first will-o ' - the- wisp for a safe guide , and patch up a new religion out of scraps and tatters of half-understood science ; and at the simple-minded philosophers who fancy in all seriousness that men are about to become reasoning animals . Vanity Fair is a queer place at best ; and , amid all the confused outcries that rise ceaselessly from its noisy inhabitants , the screams and curses of rival religious quacks are surely the fittest to provoke a bitter smile . We may pity the poor pilgrim groaning in Doubting Castle , and despise the impotent fury of Giant Pope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charlatans and humbugs in the Fair itself , though they are masquerading in the most imposing of robes , is best met with silent contempt . Let us trust that , somehow or other , the mad bustle will subside in time ; that the great world will blunder in its own clumsy fashion into some tolerable order ; and some scum of effete superstition be worked off in the chaotic fermentation . Meanwhile let us cultivate our little area of garden , knowing well that , long before a brighter day dawns , we too shall have been swept off into the great darkness , and our little crotchets and nostrums have become as ludicrous as those of our forefathers . Let us possess our souls in peace , and acknowledge that Swift has pretty well summed up the fittest epilogue for Jove to pronounce upon the farce of the world , " I damn such fools ! " Truth may be hidden in a sneer , and the language of the satirist may be translated into most amiable phraseology . Substitute the sentimental for the scornful tone , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Intellectual indolence , which shrinks from the painful effort of rearranging first principles , joins with a real scrupulosity as to hurting the feelings of babes and sucklings , to give force to the sensible man 's remonstrance against stirring the waters needlessly . The judgment of common sense is not final , but it always has a certain presumption in its favor . We must at least show why it is so plausible . It is easy enough to retort by calling names , by accusing your sensible adversary of cynicism , falsehood , and want of faith in the power of truth . But , when one descends from mere generalities , one feels that a view which // commends itself not only to the wary , to the prudent , and the worldly-wise , but to many generous and lofty natures , deserves a more distinct answer . It should be met , so far as it can be met , poinL by point , and any element of truth which it contains should be fairly and frankly acknowledged . And any answer should begin by admitting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can , I think , be no doubt as to where the strength lies . It is plain that the appeal for reticence would be thrown away upon any one who seriously believed himself able to answer the great question , What is to be the religion of the future ? If I have a gospel , I am bound to proclaim it . But , so long as that question remains unanswered and unanswerable , there is a practical difficulty which , however overlooked or denied , recurs in one form or other with provoking persistency . You may cut the knot by a simple declaration that truth is above everything ; but you do not clear away the honest scruples of your antagonist : he still shrinks from the duty , even if he acknowledges it , and replies by awkward cases of conscience . It is very easy and at the present time very safe to tilt against the established creeds ; the men who assail them are often animated by the purest love of truth ; and yet , when all is said and done , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left to decay of themselves , and to doubt the morality of informing our grandmother that she is an old fool . Let us , however , look at the question a little more distinctly . And , in the first place , let us admit fully and frankly that the problem about the religion of the future is simply insoluble . Inspired prophecy is out of date ; and , though we talk about scientific prediction in such matters , the phrase is little better than a mockery . To predict history is to make a guess with an indefinite chance of error . Perhaps we may say pretty confidently that the dead will not come to life , nor two and two be proved to make five ; but to give any precise form to our vague anticipations of the future is simply to court the ridicule of posterity-if posterity is silly enough to study our guesses . There is , indeed , a royal road to prophecy in this particular case , which is taken often enough . My opinion , says each man , is true ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follows that my opinion , whatever it may be , represents the future faith of the world . However satisfactory to the individual mind , there are difficulties about using this argument in controversy . Doubtless to believe an opinion is to believe that it is true , and to doubt that truth'will ultimately prevail is to suppose that the de // velopment of thought is nothing but a vague fluctuation hither and thither of endless and contradictory blundering . And yet the man who can believe that his own conception is definitive and complete , and that truth is to be fully reached the day after to-morrow , shows that be possesses the sanguine temper and dogmatic self-confidence which are , indeed , conditions of the successful propagation of a creed , but which are very far from being sufficient conditions of success . Too many philosophers and preachers have announced themselves to be in possession of the truth to leave us much confidence in such predictions . M. Comte was very confident of the future of his church ; but it has not yet covered the civilized world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the one thing certain is that all creeds have perished . Socrates is a man2 therefore Socrates is mortal , passes for a good syllogism . May we not say , with an equal show of a sound , inductive basis , Positivism is a religion , therefore positivism will die ? I hold , after a fashion , the pleasant old doctrine that truth has a tendency to prevaiL I believe that we may discern in the past history of mankind a slow approximation toward truth  --  a gradual substitution of more comprehensive and accurate views of the world for the narrower and less verifiable  --  and I need not expound the familiar arguments for that doctrine . It follows , too , that in believing any doctrine we believe also that it will slowly force its way to a wider recognition in the clash and conflict of rival creeds . We believe it to be part of that solid core of truth which is gradually freeing itself from superincumbent masses of error and assumption . But we have still to ask how far this doctrine can be applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , from the triumph of Christianity that it included more truth than the beliefs which it ousted ; or , from the assumed truth of any new creed of our own , that it will triumph over the adverse force of existing orthodoxy ? Here we have at once to confront a fact which lies on the very surface of history . The doctrine of a continuous and uniform progress of opinion is simply untenable . Historians of philosophy manage occasionally to twist the records of past thought into a confirmation of some such view . But , to gain even a show of continuity , they have to limit their view to a few scattered men of exceptional eminence . They make one bound from the ancient to the modern world , or , if they admit a few stepping-stones in the interval , they at least assume periods of many centuries when thought was stagnant or retrograde , and when countless millions remained // in placid ignorance , plunged in errors long detected by the few . The torch is not really passed from hand to hand by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glimpse of distant lights across profound valleys or rather vast breadths of continent steeped in supine indifference . Religious thought is as little continuous as philosophical . If you are a disbeliever in Christian theology , you can hardly deny that ancient philosophers had reached truths destined to long ages of oblivion , and opened paths which had fallen into complete disuse till again opened by inquirers in the last few generations . If you are a Christian , you hold implicitly that truths once recognized by the strongest minds have become obscure or been openly rejected as modern society has become more enlightened , but , upon this hypothesis , more corrupt . It may be possible to detect a slow evolution in certain profound conceptions which underlie all methods of thought ; but it is impossible to deny that the evolution is extremely slow , often imperceptible , and consistent with the rise and decay of various forms of religious belief , and therefore , presumably , with the growth of new error or the loss of ancient truth . If there has been a slow accumulation of treasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much that it once thought valuable , and probably lost for long periods much which had intrinsic worth . The rationalist may well feel that on many points he would sympathize more closely with Marcus Aurelius than with St. Paul . The Stoical view of the world and life may appear to him worthier , freer from antiquated mythology , and more congenial to modern thought than that of the great apostle . And yet the Christian triumphed ; and why ? For reasons which the Christian apologist never tires of enforcing , and of which I am quite content to assume the substantial accuracy . It triumphed , doubtless , because it was better suited to human nature , that is , the nature of average men of the time ; because philosophy flew above their heads , while religion grasped their imagination , provided an utterance for their emotions , and presented an ideal character which they could love and understand . The pri*na-fctcie inference , indeed , is not that which the apologist wishes to draw . A creed may thrive because it falls in with the weakness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it is easily assimilated at once with the current superstitions and the current philosophy ; because it gives that halftruth which is for the time the most congenial to the popular mind . There is something in Charles II . ' s explanation of the // preacher 's success-that " his nonsense suited their nonsense " ; and , in short , there is a presumption that a religion fitted to the actual stage of mental development must be so far unfitted for the most advanced minds . The apologist is therefore anxious to point out that , though the creed exactly meets the wants of the time , its purity and perfection prove that it could not be the product of the time . We can understand its success when once originated ; we can not understand its originating , except from some superhuman intelligence . And here , again , omitting the illegitimate leap to the supernatural , we can fully admit the general force of the argument . To discover a creed capable of clothing the vague emotions of that and so many succeeding generations , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order , or , more probably , the com* bined operation of many men of genius combined in unconscious cooperation by the collective sentiment of their age . The phenomenon is of the same kind which it is a commonplace to notice in a sphere only one degree less exalted . Given your man of geniusyour Shakespeare or Dante-we can dimly see how he was created by the conditions of the time . He is great in virtue of his capacity for gathering into one focus and uttering in articulate language the thoughts and emotions indistinctly fermenting in the minds of innumerable contemporaries . Yet no one can predict the appearance of a man of genius , or show deductively that a Shakespeare must have arisen under Elizabeth . The founder of a religion belongs to an order still more exalted than that of poets , philosophers , or statesmen . When he has solved the problem , the answer is simple enough . Till he has solved it , we are still blindly groping in the dark , conscious of a want , but totally unable to give it distinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It may be true-let us hope it to be true-that the hour will always bring the man ; that we have Shakespeares by the dozen ready to burst into song whenever springtime comes ; that society , like the air , is everywhere full of germs of genius requiring only the occurrence of the particular degree of temperature necessary to give them life and vigor . Yet we are still as unable as ever to say what are the conditions productive of those flowering times in art or literature which have made a few great epochs remarkable to all future ages ; no advance of social science brings us perceptibly nearer to a power of prediction ; and , as no human being can foretell the advent of the next world-poet , still less foretell what his poem will be like , it would be even more futile to guess at the date or the contents of the next great religious message . // If a religion were simply a philosophy , we should have some specious basis for speculation . Comte , for example , traces the gradual ebb of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one sphere of knowledge after another and liberates the direct vision from the distorting haze of superstition . When the stars no longer require the guidance of gods , we get a rational astronomy ; and by a similar process we shall reach a really scientific system of sociology and ethics , resting on demonstration instead of assumption , and free from the element of mystery . But , as Comte again maintained , we should still no more have a religion than we have an architecture when we understand the laws of mechanics , or a music when we understand the laws of sound . Of Comte 's attempt to take the next step , I need say nothing . His religion has been ridiculed , I think , more than enough ; but I can not doubt that it has the fatal flaw of every attempt to construct by rule and line what can only be done , if it can be done at all , by the genial energy of a creative imagination . The strange thing is that , recognizing so clearly the nature of the task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeeding in it . A religion is the synthesis of a philosophy and a poetry . It is the product of a theory of the universe working in the imagination of a people until it projects itself into vivid concrete symbolism . It must have a double aspect , corresponding on one side to the conceptions which men have actually framed of the constitution of the world in which they live , and , on the other , embodying those conceptions in a shape capable of being grasped by the imagination and of serving as a framework to the profound but indistinct emotions which it suggests . The ordinary theological antithesis between faith and reason corresponds to the distinction . A creel must appeal to men 's direct and " intuitive " perceptions as well as to their logical faculties . It must be capable of being presented dogmatically as well as proved by chains of syllogisms . Most men , of course , do not reason at all , and accept their religion as they accept their science-at second hand . The man of science believes the truths of astronomy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he believes that they are provable , and has had them directly presented to him by vivid and intelligible pictures . The ideal religion would be suited in the same way both to the philosophic and the popular mind . Only in this case the condition is incomparably more difficult of fulfillment . Even in physical science , direct vision lags behind analysis and demonstration ; and it often requires the highest // imaginative power to see the results of a mathematical proof , though each step of proof may be fully understood . But to convert a philosophy into a religion , to give to abstract speculation the form and coloring which alone can bring it within reach of the ordinary understanding , is a task requiring the loftiest genius under the most congenial influences . It is this double aspect of any vigorous religion which baffles not only our powers of prediction , but even of conjecture as to the future of faith . What form of belief will satisfy at once the philosophic thought and the popular impulses of the time ? How is it to attract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our narrow circle of intellectual daylight and the poor and ignorant who are moved only by the direct power of the creed to grasp their imaginations and stimulate their emotions ? If it alienates one class , it can only render more chaotic the chaotic mass of struggling superstition ; if it alienates the other , it can not spread beyond a professor 's lecture-room . Even if we have a decided opinion as to the philosophical doctrines which are ultimately to prevail , we shall still be only at the threshold of the problem . How can they be made acceptable to the struggling masses of society ? If not made acceptable , how can we be sure that they will not be crushed ? If thought is to advance , we say , this must be its final stage . But how do we know that the final stage is at hand ? May not philosophers once more find that they are losing their hold upon their hearers ; that they have gone too fast and too far ; and that , being in a small minority , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There may be a retrograde movement in the tidal wave which has often advanced so fitfully and irregularly . We have reached the edge of the promised land , but who can tell that the race may not be turned back to wander for forty years or forty centuries in the wilderness ? The philosophical movement destroys the old forms of emotional utterance ; and , till new forms have been elaborated , the emotions remain as a disturbing force . How willmen satisfy the needs hitherto met by the various forms of worship ? What will be the heaven and hell of the future ? Will men pray at all , and , if so , to whom ? How will they express what have been called the supernatural dictates of the conscience ? What will be the precise meaning given to such words as holy , spiritual , and divine , which have hitherto expressed some of the profoundest moods of which we are consciGus ? Or is it possible that we shall simply shut up our churches and keep our museums and theatres ; and that all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatest organizations will flow in other channels without producing any social catastrophe ? Theologians ask such questions to pronounce the answer impossible . They can not conceive any answer but their own ; and calmly assume that the destruction or radical transformation of the old symbols is equivalent to the destruction of the things symbolized , and the alteration of the human nature which created them . For my part , I can not even understand the doctrine that the conscience ( for example ) was created by a belief in hell , and will perish when hell ceases to be credible . It seems to me clear that the conscience created the old hell , and will presumably create a new one , sufficient for practical purposes , whenever the ancient mythology decays . But , if it is asked , What will be the precise form which is to supersede the old ? I can only reply , that is the question to be solved by the coming generations and the coming men of genius . Nor can I , or any one , tell how far the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including many ancient elements or a definitive acceptance of the soundest philosophical principles . The problem is not one of abstract reasoning , but of practice . We have to inquire how an artistic form is to be given to the ancient chorus of lamentation and aspiration which has been steaming up for so many ages from the race of men , not how we are to formulate with scientific accuracy the accumulating body of ascertained truth . We are not simply looking forward to the next stage in the evolution of a theory , but guessing what will be the resultant of a confused struggle of conflicting impulses , whose success is only affected indirectly by the truth of the doctrines which they embody . The rashness of any attempt to unravel the mystery of the future might be abundantly confirmed , if confirmation be necessary , from past experience . We should perhaps find the best guidance , in any attempt at prophesying the future of religion , from studying the history of the last great revolution of faith . The analogy between the present age and that which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been missed by very many observers . The most superficial acquaintance with the general facts shows how close a parallel might be drawn by a competent historian . There are none of the striking manifestations of the present day to which it would not be easy to produce an analogy , though in some respects on a smaller scale . Now , as // then , we can find mystical philosophers trying to evolve a satisfactory creed by some process of logical legerdemain out of theosophical moonshine ; and amiable and intelligent persons laboring hard to prove that the old mythology could be forced to accept a rationalistic interpretation-whether in regard to the inspection of entrails or prayers for fine weather ; and philosophers framing systems of morality entirely apart from the ancient creeds and sufficiently satisfactory to themselves , while hopelessly incapable of impressing the popular mind ; and politicians , conscious that the basis of social order was being sapped by the decay of the faith in which it had arisen , and therefore attempting the impossible task of galvanizing dead creeds into some semblance of vitality ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a luxurious society whose intelligence was an ineffectual safeguard against the most groveling errors ; and a dogged adherence of formalists and conservatives to ancient ways , and much empty profession of barren orthodoxy ; and , beneath all , a vague disquiet , a breaking up of ancient social and natural bonds , and a blind groping toward some more cosmopolitan creed and some deeper satisfaction for the emotional needs of mankind . Yet , there is one thing which we do not see , and at which we can not guess : What sect is analogous to the ancient Christians ? Who are the Christians of the present day ? Which , in all the huddle of conflicting creeds , is the one which is destined to emerge in triumph ? Will it triumph because its theory contains most truth , or because it contains that mixture of truth and error which is most congenial to the circumstances of the time ? If we could have asked an ancient philosopher for his forecast of the future during the first century of the propagation of Christianity , he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contempt , and pointed out to his own satisfaction the miserable gullibility of its professors and the inherent absurdity of the tenets which they professed . And yet the creed triumphed . Why should not some creed which to us - whether Christians or infidels-seems equally absurd have in it the seeds of victory ? Nothing could have seemed more revolting to the philosopher than the doctrine of the atonement and of the crucified God . We are beginning to admit that in a certain sense both the philosopher and the object of his contempt might be right . The dogma is quite as incredible to a modern thinker as to the ancient philosopher . Yet he may think that it contained the assertion of a principle-distorted and perverted as much as you pleasewhich // the philosopher had left out of account ; and supplied a want which he could not satisfy , because he did not feel it . May there not be doctrines , apparently too absurd for discussion , which are spreading in obscure regions far below the surface of conscious and articulate thought , and destined to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assume that superstition is henceforth impossible , I should at least be glad to know distinctly upon what grounds our security rests . Is it that we individually are so much wiser than our forefathers ? I do not wish to underrate modern progress , but surely there is something grotesque in the hypothesis that the average shopkeeper or artisan of the present day is too clever to believe in the creeds of his forefathers . I fancy that no one has yet ascertained that the brain of to-day is more capacious than the brains of the contemporaries of Ca*sar or St. Paul . Or if I fancy for a moment that minds trained by modern schools are above the reach of sophistry , the doctrine becomes very untenable when I take a journey , say , in the Metropolitan Railway from Kensington to Blackfriars . Take a cursory glance on such an occasion at any of your companions ; look at that respectable grocer studying the " Daily Telegraph " ; or the intelligent citizen absorbed in the records of the great Mr. Peace , prince of burglars and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by arguments about the principle of evolution and the survival of the fittest ? Will the teaching of Comte , or Mr. Herbert Spencer , or Hegel , be as savory to him as the rhetoric of his dissenting oracle ? Is he likely to see through fallacies which imposed upon Augustine or Aquinas ? Macaulay prophesied that the Catholic Church would endure for ever , on the ground that , if Sir Thomas More could believe in the nonsense of transubstantiation , men might always believe in it . If some modern intellects are in advance of More , the great bulk are still far behind him . To found any hopes of an emancipation from superstition upon a belief in the elevation of the average intellectual standard is , indeed , to build upon a flimsy foundation . I am quite unable to see that the cultivation of the masses has reached a point at which-I will not say Catholicism , but-paganism is made impossible by the intelligence of mankind . If even witchcraft has become obsolete , it is not because its absurdity has been demonstrated , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the phenomenon of a survival of superstition in the upper classes is too common to excite astonishment . A mind which can be edified by the tricks of a " medium " is saved , not by intrinsic ability , but // 449 by the accidents of time and place , from sharing the grossest superstitions of Zulus or Esquimaux . Nor , indeed , if we inquire into the average state of mind even of people who profess to discuss philosophical problems , is the result much more encouraging . Discussions of the first principles of religions belief have lately become common in popular magazines . People argue about materialism or idealism , about the existence of God and a soul , and another world , with a freedom which is a remarkable symptom in many ways ; and to which I certainly have no objection . I do not think for one moment that such inquiries should be restricted to a class of specialists , or that anybody should be discouraged from frank revelations of his state of mind . They are often very interesting ; but neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that most people think it an ample qualification for the most difficult problems to be tolerably familiar with a few technical words . The result is , that most disputants go into a modern line of battle armed with antiquated bows and arrows . They placidly confute positions which were abandoned by their advetsaries two or three centuries ago . They argue about freewill , for example , or materialism-I will not say , as if they had never read the latest discussions upon those ancient controversies , but as if they bad been predecessors of Jonathan Edwards and Berkeley . Or , in a rather different direction , it would be almost amusing , if it were not rather irritating , to note the impossibility of impressing upon the ordinary disputant the fact that a man may disbelieve in hell without disbelieving in the value of all morality . He can see no difference between a denial that murderers will be tormented for ever and an assertion that murder is unobjectionable . The most amiable and candid critics will inform you that to deny the supernatural character of morality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denying the existence of supernatural sanctions , you are not only unconsciously removing a useful safeguard of morality , but consciously and explicitly denying that there is any difference between right and wrong . But I need not gather illustrations of a fact which no serious thinker will deny , that much argumentation on such matters rests on simple misunderstanding ; and it is inevitable that it should be so : for religious development is a complex process of which the logical aspect is only one , and , it may be , a subordinate factor . The question of its importance in determining the whole must depend upon the relation between the select few who are accessible to reason and the // vast majority who are profoundly indifferent to truths not immediately applicable to practical purposes . What hold do thinkers possess upon the masses ? How does a change of scientific or philosophical inceptions become operative upon popular religious beliefs ? The philosophers may be compared to the brain of the so-called social organism ; but then the organism is one of a very low type . It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and only indirectly stimulated and coi5rdinated by the central organ . Impulses may continue to be propagated upon which the brain has little influence ; though it may be that there is sufficient unity to make the cooperation of the brain necessary to continuous and energetic vitality . Philosophers may condemn the old creed as effete ; men of sense may simply shrug their shoulders when a serious attempt is made to apply its teaching to contravene their palpable interests ; but they are equally contemptuous , and not without some prima facie justification , when the attempt is made to supplant it by more satisfactory doctrine . They feel instinctively that philosophy has not found the necessary leverage to move the world . It has not the power to put any real stress upon the ordinary mass of mankind . No creed can be said to have a genuine vitality which is not one of the forces to be taken into account in the actual , everyday conduct of life , which can not make itself heard , if not actually obeyed , in the blind struggles of passion which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man of sense can give reasons enough for doubting whether the thinking part of his fellows represent any such genuine force . There is no want of ominous symptoms of prefound movements slowly evolving themselves in the subterranean strata of society  --  to which scarcely a gleam penetrates from the polite upper world of civilization and plausible philosophy . We may listen , if we will , to stifled rumblings significant of inarticulate discontent , gradually accumulating like explosive gases in confined caverns , till some sudden convulsion may rend the whole existing fabric into chaotic fragments . Society sometimes seems to resemble Milton 's " small night-foundering skiff " moored to the scaly rind of Leviathan . If the huge dumb monster fairly rouses himself , can we hope to put the hook of philosophy in his nostrils , or send him to sleep with judicious opiates of sociology and political economy , and demonstrations of the general fitness of things ? I have lately read lamentations over the supposed incompatibility between democracy and free-trade principles . Scientific expositions of the // 451 mischief done by protection are likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illiterate rulers of the future . It sounds probable enough ; and to me the only surprising thing seems to be the agreeable opinion that people were ever really persuaded by the arguments of Adam Smith . Free trade , I imagine , triumphed in England because the people who wanted bread cheap were stronger than the people who wanted it dear ; the twaddle so often talked about the great " law of supply and demand " is enough to show the hopeless illogicality of even pretentious advocates of economical orthodoxy . Toleration , again , has become a popular name in politics ; and I sincerely hope that it is being slowly drilled into people 's minds . Yet it would be hard to prove that it really rests upon any stronger basis than that of general indifference . We do n't burn people for not believing what we do n't believe ourselves , and so far we are right ; but is it quite plain that , if the world were again agreed in believing anything , it would refrain from enforcing it by the old physical arguments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeper issues than those of tariffs-when Lazarus and Dives come , if they ever come , to a downright tussle-I can not feel certain that philosophers will be allowed to arbitrate . They may give a watchword here and there ; they may influence some of the commanding intellects , and so indirectly affect the contest ; but I fear that their best arguments may be as ineffectual as the trumpetblast of modern times to the destruction of a city walL The improbability that ancient creeds should simply revive must , therefore , depend upon other conditions than the increase of the average intelligence . It seems , it is true , to be a law that there can be no resurrection of decaying mythologies . They cease , after a time , to stimulate the imagination , and are no longer the spontaneous growth of the intellectual and social forces of the day . No conscious process of rehabilitation can , then , give them real vitality . The more elaborate the attempt to revive , the more painfully dead and mechanical is the result . The new impulses can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to conform to the cut-anddried theories of innovators . In one case , it is attempted to make a river flow in its old bed when the whole configuration of a continent is altered ; in the other , to force it into a neat rectangular canal defined by mathematical rule and measure . To explain fully how and why creeds perish and are renewed would be to give a complete answer to the most perplexing problems of social science . Yet we may admit the negative conclusion that it is rarely a process // of simple and continuous advance . It ' is not a case in which the greater minds can form their own conclusions and impose them directly upon the vulgar . The so-called leader is as much a follower , and guides by sharing the popular impulse . But neither could the mass advance at all without its leaders . The man of genius can not simply dictate , but he may insinuate some element of advanced thought . There is a reciprocity , a continual give and take , in which the conquering creed is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , though it undergoes some transformation in the process . It is natural that men who realize this difficulty should attempt to soften the transition by some dexterous process of conciliation , which may allow the old to melt gradually into the new , and give on one side free play to the expansion of philosophical thought , while on the other it leaves the mass in possession of their ancient symbols . Why should not the new thoughts leaven the ancient mass without setting up any convulsive action ? To avoid revolution is the great aim of sensible men , for they see how vast is the cost and how doubtful the gain , and if they can be avoided by a judicious reticence on the part of philosophers , by allowing speculation to filtrate gradually through the pores of the old creed , is it not folly to attempt to force upon the average mass doctrines which they can never understand , and which will only cause odium to their cxpounders ? You can not impose your new creed upon mankind , even if you had a definitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quietly and unconsciously ? I will not here insist upon the difficulty that the proposal covers simple insincerity , and that what would be very convenient , if it were a spontaneous or unconscious process , involves an uncomfortable approach to deliberate lying and equivocation when it is deliberately adopted from motives of policy . But the truth seems to be that the whole process is inappropriate to the conditions of the time . It amounts to proposing that we should try to annihilate a danger by ignoring it . As a matter of fact , an ancient creed ends by working itself so thoroughly into alliance with the conservative forces of society that it is no longer possible to separate the two interests . Its influence is rigorously dependent upon the strong conviction of the governing classes that the old creed is bound up with the old order . The supported creed , which is popular with all the old women in the world , certainly a most estimable and venerable class , is also bound to support their prejudices . Their great desire-natural to their age and sex-is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belief is valuable in their eyes because ( though not solely because ) it is the symbol of all opposition to the subversive and revolutionary forces . If you could prove that Christianity really meant to aid , not denounce Communism , the effect would be to destroy the faith of its adherents . The alliance between the various conservative forces of the world is far too intimate and close , and the hostility between conservatives and revolutionists far too bitter and deadly , to allow of any conciliation by dexterous manipulation of dogmas . If 4*here is no great social struggle underlying the religious movement , it may no doubt be easier than people suppose to reconcile the purely intellectual differences , and to make the old dogmas mean anything or nothing . But if the revolt against the doctrine is chiefly a symptom of a more profound and internecine struggle beneath the surface , the proposal to cover the divergence by terms capable of being used by both parties is doomed to inevitable failure . The proposal to take the wind out of the sails of agitators  --  to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true reformer-is very plausible , and may succeed so long as the agitation is superficial ; but , when passions are really inflamed and the contest has become bitter , each party feels that it is a juggle . The hatred between republicans and priests in France does not depend upon mere questions of speculative thought , and , so far from welcoming any mode of softening the difference of creed , they would be glad to accentuate them and to provide fresh modes of insulting each other 's feelings . In such a case the philosophic warfare is but the superficial symptom of a deeper social struggle , and the fate of the creed is bound up with the fate of the organization by which it is defended . Nor can we suppose that the alliance is merely accidental . The objections to a creed which weigh with a philosopher are not those , as I have suggested , which weigh with or perversely affect the masses . A creed is not destroyed immediately by attacks of a philosophical kind , though they may give a fatal blow to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it is only when whole classes come into existence , ready for revolt upon other than speculative grounds , that the spark could produce an explosion . The prevalence of disbelief among the masses must be accounted for by the various causes which have undermined the whole of European society with the raw materials of revolutionary movement . But we may also assume that , unable as the masses may be to appreciate the more purely intellectual grounds of dissatisfaction , they have a dumb instinct which // makes them more or less prepared to accept the conclusions of the abstract reasoner . Christianity itself was doubtless the product of an analogous spirit of social discontent . But in its origin it proposed a remedy no longer appropriate to modern wants ; and greatly as it has been developed , and radically as its modern supporters may differ from its original apostles , it has not been developed in the required direction . The old doctrine , for example , makes poverty sacred and inevitable , instead of regarding it as an evil to be extirpated , which places all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its conditions , and to be reached only through a supernatural catastrophe , instead of hoping everything from gradual development , and a recognition that the world can only be conquered by accepting its conditions as unalterable . This is but one aspect of a divergence between two modes of thought , which is too deeply impressed in their very structure to be overlooked or surmounted , and which corresponds not merely to a speculative difference , but to a new direction impressed upon human aspirations and upon a change of fundamental conceptions which has been thoroughly worked into the emotions as well as the beliefs of mankind . Though people may not think more clearly than of old , they have slowly assimilated certain results of the progressive development of thought , and society has acquired a different structure , which makes the ancient teaching inapplicable . To state these obvious considerations in the briefest terms is enough to show the complexity of the problem , and to raise a strong presumption against any hasty solution . To develop them completely would require a knowledge of the actual conditions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the necessary degree , and a power of impartial judgment upon the most exciting questions which is as rare as the requisite intellectual grasp . To infer from them with any confidence what will be the outlines of the creed of the future would require the insight of the rarest genius to be superadded to the other qualifications of a competent observer . To my mind , therefore , it is simply absurd for any man to answer with the slightest confidence the challenge of the hasty inquirer , What is to be the religion of the future ? I have not the slightest idea . I am perfectly certain of my own ignorance , and I have a strong impression that almost every one else is equally ignorant . I can see , as every one else can see , that a vast social and intellectual transformation is taking place  --  and taking place , probably , with more rapidity now than at almost any historical period . I can dimly // guess at some of the main characteristics of the process . I can discover some conditions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will probably influence the result . I can not doubt that some ancient doctrines have lost their vitality , and that some new beliefs must be recognized by one who would influence the minds of the coming generations . I can not believe in the simple resurrection of effete religious ideas ; nor , on the other hand , do I believe that the ideas which still have life have as yet been effectually embodied in any system which professes to take the place of the old . In saying this , I take myself to be simply expressing the conviction of most men who think upon such topics at all ; though it is , for obvious reasons , natural for many writers to affect to themselves and others more confidence than they feel at the bottom of their hearts , both in the completeness and in the approaching victory of their own creed . It is as well to get rid of that as of other affectations , and to admit frankly that the future is shrouded in impenetrable darkness . I can not say what will be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doubtless all the elements which it contains will be somehow represented in the next crystallization of opinion ; but I envy , or rather I do not envy , the confidence of any man who takes upon himself to define its precise character . The argument of the more hopeful would be that , after all , modern science is what people call a " great fact . " The existence of a vast body of definitively established truths , forming an organized and coherent system , giving proofs of its vitality by continuous growth and of its ability by innumerable applications to our daily wants is not only an important element in the question , but it is the most conspicuous point of difference between the purely intellectual conditions of the contemporary evolution and that which resulted in the triumph of Christianity . Here is the fixed fulcrum , an unassailable nucleus of definite belief , round which all other beliefs must crystallize . It supplies a ground , intelligible in some relations to the ordinary mind , upon which the philosopher may base his claims to respect . Whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern scientific theories ; for a direct assault is hopeless , and to ignore science is impossible .. The enormous apologetic literature destined to reconcile faith and reason is a sufficient proof that the reconciliation is a necessity for the old faith  --  and that it is an impossibility . The ablest thinkers are always taking up the impossible problem afresh ; and the emptiest charlatan tries to surround himself with some halo of scientific // twaddle . Science , moreover , touches men 's interests at so many points , that it has the key of the position . The common sense of mankind , as well as their lower passions , would crush any open attack upon the tangible material results of modern scientific progress . Science means steam-engines , telegraphy , and machinery , and , whether the reflection be consolatory or the reverse , we may be fully confident that all the power of all the priests and all the philosophers in the world would be as idle wind if directed against these palpable daily conveniences . And , undoubtedly , this consideration is enough to imply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account . There are directions in which the incompatibility between its results and those of the old creeds is felt by ordinary minds . We still pray fo1r a fine harvest ; but we really consult the barometer , and believe more in the prophecies of meteorologists than in an answer to our prayers ; Te Deurns for victories excite more ridicule than sympathy ; and we encounter the cholera by improved systems of drainage without attributing much value to fasting and processions . In other words , the old belief in the supernatural is so far extinct that it could not be restored without encountering some of the most vigorous beliefs of the time . Science need so far fear no direct antagonism . But it is easy for the theologian to withdraw ostensibly from the positions which are obviously untenable . A believer in transubstantiation has no more scruples than his neighbor in using the telegraph , and the most orthodox doctrines about the Trinity imply no physiological heresy . No one can doubt that Newton 's discoveries have greatly modified the old conception of the universe implied in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have been accepted and are enforced in all sincerity by the most orthodox theologians . We see , indeed , ingenious mathematicians at the present day trying to force the latest discoveries in physics into the service of old-fashioned theology ; and the operation is performed so skillfully as to pass for a genuine argument with the intelligent public . The danger is not that scientific results will be attacked , but it is conceivable , at least , that the scientific spirit may be emasculated . You may destroy a limb as certainly , though not as quickly , by a ligature as by an amputation . The line of argument is ready at hand . You have only to object to the abuse instead of the use of the scientific spirit ; to allow people to invent as many telegraphs as they please , so long as they do n't draw unpleasant conclusions from scientific discoveries . You may denounce specialists who insist // upon using physiological facts as weapons against theology , whereas nobody has a right to mix theology and science except in support of arguments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indulgence of an idle curiosity , and proposes to discourage all researches which have no definite aim of immediate utility . The sentimentalist appeals from the head to the heart , and pronounces a love of truth to be immoral whenever it hurts his feelings . The Catholic , of course , attacks the all-corroding energy of the intellect , and tries to enslave iDarwinism as his precursors enslaved Aristotle . Though the common sense of mankind may regret such assaults when they come into conflict with useful results , it may not be so clear about the methods to which the results are owing . The boundless curiosity of the scientific mind , its resolution to test every dogma-whatever the authority on which it reposes  --  to sift and resift all established beliefs , are undoubtedly troublesome and inconvenient to the indolent , that is , to the vast majority . It can scarcely be regarded as certain that some form of creed may not become popular which would tend to stifle thought and sap the sources of its energy . A political empire may be ruined from internal weakness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of science is of such a nature that , unless it extends , it must decline . It is not impossible , surely , though I do not assert it to be probable , that the creed of the future may flatter the natural weakness of mankind by gradually diminishing the interest in scientific inquiry . Popular writers are fond of describing Utopias in which man 's power over Nature has indefinitely increased , and machinery been applied to hitherto unimaginable results . An imaginative writer might , I fancy , employ himself to equally good purpose in describing a state of things in which some mechanical discoveries should remain , but serve only as a memorial of a distant past , their principles forgotten , their use only known by tradition ; in which the power of discovery should have perished , and a steam-engine be the object of superstitious reverence-like a gun in the hands of a savage-as a mysterious survival from the days of the ancient demigods . To bring about such a result , it would only be necessary so far to emasculate the intellect that men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the borders of science . There are abundant precedents for decay as well as for progress , and regions enough in which authority has succeeded in shifting the impulse to active thought . Why should we regard such an ellipse of intellectual energy as henceforth impossible ? // I need go no further . When we think of such things-of the vast complexity of the processes by which new religions evolve themselves , of the small influence of purely intellectual considerations with the vast bulk of mankind , of the enormous improbability of any speedy extirpation of error , of the difficulty of impressing men 's imaginations , even when you have convinced their reasons-we can hardly doubt , it seems to me , that the sensible man has a very strong case indeed . Why should we be so impatient of error ? The enormous majority of the race has , on any hypothesis , been plunged in superstitions of various kinds , and , on the whole , it has found that it could thrive and be decently happy and contented in its ignorance . Science declines to accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sudden dispersion of the mists that have obscured the human intelligence for so many ages . If they grow a little thinner in our time , we may well be content ; but is it not childish to be impatient about the rate of development of these vast secular processes ? Why be in such a hurry to " change the errors of the Church of Rome for those of the church of the Future " ? The generations come and go , and the external form of their creeds changes rapidly enough ; but the substance changes little . Philosophers wrangle over the old doubts , and even old pagan superstitions survive in but slight modifications in the midst of Christian populations . The study of " sociology " shows at least - if it shows nothing else-that even the most trifling customs survive vast periods of apparently revolutionary change . Why should we expect to transform in a day or in a century the fundamental beliefs of mankind ? It is certainly well to moderate our anticipations . I feel , indeed , the heartiest respect for the enthusiasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season and out of season , and accept the reproaches of the world as gratifying testimony of their fidelity to truth . Undoubtedly they may frequently err  --  the man must be fortunate , indeed , who has never to reproach himself for such errors-by forgetting the duty of courtesy and tenderness for the weak and the stupid . Reformers are often too anxious to tell fools of their folly , and to reproach unduly those who are behind the times . It is difficult to draw the line accurately between a justifiable reticence and a mean equivocation ; it is easy to confound the obvious duty of telling no lies with the more questionable practice of proclaiming , at all hazards , every conclusion as soon as you have reached it . But it is needless to insist upon a // point involving some difficult casuistry . The orthodox may be safely trusted to give all necessary emphasis to that aspect of the question which is least favorable to full utterance of thought . That class , in particular , which is accustomed to argue by a sneer , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same weapons . I simply take note of the fact , which all will admit , that the employment of such poisoned arrows should be forbidden on all sides ; but I confess that to me the most serious danger does not appear to be that an excessive love of truth and plainness of speech will ever become unduly prevalent . Buoyancy of spirit and confidence in the approaching decease of the devil are indeed only too likely to be checked by the considerations to which I have referred . I can not , for my part , understand how the frame of mind which is eager for proselytes should survive very early youth . I would not conceal my own views , but neither could I feel anxious to thrust them upon others ; and that , for the very simple reason that conversion appears to me to be an absurdity . You can not change a man 's thoughts about things as you can change the books in his library . The mind is not a box , which can have opinions inserted and extracted at pleasure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an organic growth and the natural product of a man 's mental development under the various conditions in which he is placed . To promote his intellectual activity , to encourage him to think , and to put him in the way of thinking rightly , is a plain duty ; but to try to insert ready-made opinions into his mind by dint of authority is to contradict the fundamental principles of free inquiry . Persons who believe in miraculous intervention , and the magical efficacy of special beliefs , may consistently compass sea and land to make one proselyte ; they may scatter tracts , hoping that the sight of a text will upset the convictions of a lifetime , or , as some fanatics are said to do , baptize the dying infants of the heathen to give them a passport to heaven . But the man who counts upon no supernatural assistance can only endeavor to help his fellow creature by stimulating any faint spark of intellectual activity  --  a task which is generally difficult enough for any human power . Nor , again , is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply no answer to the question which will determine-however illogically  --  the choice of many most amiable and excellent people . If a man will not abandon a religion till he has another to put in its place , we must confess that his demand // can not be met . The creed of the future , whatever it may be , exists only in germ . You can not give to a believer anything in place of his cult , of the sacred symbols which reflect his emotions , of the whole system of disciplined and organized modes of worship , of prayers , of communion with his fellows , which to him are the great attractions of his religion . You can not even tell him what system is likely to replace them hereafter , or whether human nature is so constituted that it will be able simply to drop the old without replacing it by anything directly analogous . And , therefore , you must admit that for the present a man who would abandon the old doctrines is compelled to stand alone . He must find sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his intellect ; he must be able to dispense with the old consolations of heaven and hell ; he must be content to admit explicitly that the ancient secret has not been revealed , and to hold that people will be able to get on somehow or other , even if the most ignorant and stupid cease to consider it a solemn duty to dogmatize with the utmost confidence upon matters of which the wisest know absolutely nothing and never expect to know anything . Undoubtedly this is to accept a position from which many people will shrink and it is pleasanter to the ordinary mind to reject it summarily as untenable , or to run up some temporary refuge of fine phrases and try to believe in its permanence . I only say that I do not see how an honest dissenter from the orthodox opinions can act otherwise . How we are to act in regard to individuals is a problem which admits of much casuistry , and in regard to which I can only express the belief that such problems generally solve themselves pretty easily for people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The duty of those who take any part in forming what is called public opinion is less complex . It resolves itself into a simple acceptance of the undeniable facts . It is impossible to overlook the distinction between philosophical speculation and the propagation of a new creed . If a man is not a St. Paul or even a St. John the Baptist , he should not take the tone of an apostle or a prophet . He may fully ) celieve in the soundness of the doctrines which he preaches , and believe in their ultimate victory ; but he may equally recognize the undeniable fact that he is at most only contributing to lay the philosophical basis of a religion , not propagating a fully developed religion . The part is strictly subordinate , though it may be essential . The utmost that he can do is to help to clear the air from effete superstitions , to extricate // 461 moral truths from the misleading associations with which they have been entangled , and to encourage , as far as in him lies , the spread of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . The vast and enormously complex processes which are taking place can not be governed and regulated by any single mind . A man who fancies that he can dictate a complete system to the world only shows that he is arrogant to the verge of insanity . Some little may be done by any honest thinker-by any one who really aims at advancing inquiry , instead of trying to throw dust in people 's eyes . He may help , according to the measure of his powers , to stimulate the impulses which are on the side of free thought , and which are the best guarantee for a healthy instead of a morbid development . It is not merely the right but the duty of every one competent to the task to do what in him lies to strengthen the fitful and uncertain influence of a sound intellect upon the vast and intricate jumble of conflicting opinions in the world at large . The man of sense will probably condemn him , if good sense is taken to mean an enlightened regard for our own private interest ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . But if good sense means chiefly a sound estimate of a man 's real position and talents , and a judicious application of his talents to honorable ends , a sensible man will surely approve of every vigorous exposition-not given in an irritating and insulting spirit-of the truths which must be the groundwork of a satisfactory religion ; for the degree in which that mysterious creed of the future is founded upon tenable and verifiable philosophy must be the measure of its success in laying down permanent principles for the regulation of human conduct . Modest expectations and calm estimates of a man 's real value to the world are not productive of any high degree of enthusiasm ; but perhaps , in the long run , they are useful qualities .
