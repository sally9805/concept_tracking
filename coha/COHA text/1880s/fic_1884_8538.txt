Colonel Belgardo When will my star shine forth ? no ray yet  --  how like a fool do I look ! thus kicking my heels here to get a wink from a fair damsel 's black eye .  --  What devil was it tempted me to fall in love ? and with the daughter of my enemy too ! one who would rejoice to see me and my whole family ruined ! I am paid off for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! how hast thou offended the little god , that he should lead thee into such a scrape as this ? is it manly in me thus to turn manufacturer of billet-doux , ballad-maker , rhymster ?  --  Oh , I 'm mad !  --  But yesterday I was in deep thought for an hour , contriving a motto for my mistress 's garter . Oh it must be  --  ah , see , my love appears ; and with her she brings an spology for all these deadly sins of mine . ( Carvlina appears at the window . ) She shines upon me like a happy constellation.  --  Joy , love and pleasure are her satellites , and I 'm in heaven when I behold her . Car . Carolina And pray , colonel , where did you learn this fine speech ? Bel . Colonel Belgardo You are the book I study  --  What think you , shall I ever get you by heart ? Car . Carolina Not if you go on so , like a dunce , as you have begun .  --  You speak so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned to write . Bel . Colonel Belgardo What means my Venus ? Car . Carolina Why , I mean nothing less than that your last letter fell into the hands of my father , who swears vengeance against you , and has locked me up here till don Alphonso comes to marry me . Bel . Colonel Belgardo Unfortunate indeed ! Car . Carolina Unfortunate indeed !  --  and is that all you have to say ? have you no scheme ? ca n't you jump into the window ? ca n't you turn the house inside outward ? ca n't you blow it up with gunpowder ? what can you do ? Bel . Colonel Belgardo Nothing . Car . Carolina Then you are no man for me , and I 'll marry Alphonso . Bel . Colonel Belgardo Nay , nay , not so fast :  --  pray what sort of a man is this Alphonso ? Car . Carolina Oh , he is a man made in a proper mould  --  a man whom ladies sigh for  --  a very pattern of gallantry  --  one who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady he could do nothing . Bel . Colonel Belgardo Are you sure he is all this ? Car . Carolina Not quite  --  I only have his character from report . Bel . Colonel Belgardo Has your father ever seen him ? Car . Carolina No . Bel . Colonel Belgardo Alphonso is from Seville  --  is he not ? Car . Carolina Yes , when he 's here , he 'll be from Seville . Bel . Colonel Belgardo And when will that be ? Car . Carolina He is expected every day ; so if you can do any thing you had best do it quickly . Enter Mirtello . Mir . Mirtello Sir , sir , don Gortez is coming this way . Bel . Colonel Belgardo A happy omen ! he comes just at the moment I want him . Car . Carolina Now , colonel set your wits to work ; release me from this prison , and I am content to be your prisoner for life . Exit from the window . Bel . Colonel Belgardo Oh such a thought , Mirtillo !  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll mind to be within hearing ; perhaps I may want your assistance . Mir . Mirtello I shall be ready , sir . ( retires . ) Enter Don Gortez . Bel . Colonel Belgardo Am I never to get a sight of this wench ? don Gortez keeps her so closely confined that I 'm afraid I shall be obliged to go back to my friend Alphonso without executing my commission . Gor . Don Gortez What does he say ? his friend Alphonso ! Bel . Colonel Belgardo A pretty errand this of mine , truly , to examine another man 's mistress , and like an appraiser , draw out at inventory of her charms ; as , item  --  two languishing eyes , very useful articles , but being faney goods , not easily valued ; a ruby mouth , worth at least  --  oh ! worth kissing ; teeth of pearl ; and a tongue  --  oh ! that 's an article that might be dispensed with ; few men who would not be glad to leave that out of their marriage portion . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I might view this chest of beauty ! Gor . Don Gortez Pray , sir , are you taking a plan of that house ? Bel . Colonel Belgardo No , it 's something in the house that I want to take a plan of . Gor . Don Gortez What you wish to take a draught , do you ? Bel . Colonel Belgardo Yes sir ; and the lady I would draw upon is in that very house : can you give me so much credit as will admit me to the acquaintance of don Gortez ? Gor . Don Gortez Why I do nt know but I could . Bel . Colonel Belgardo And will you ? Gor . Don Gortez I must know your business . Bel . Colonel Belgardo First promise me not to mention a syllable to Gortez . Gor . Don Gortez Oh , I 'll never tell him , if you do nt . Bel . Colonel Belgardo Thus then it is  --  I have a most particular friend , one don Alphonso of Seville . Gor . Don Gortez Well , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Gortez to marry his daughter , and has sent me  --  now be sure you do nt tell Gortez . Gor . Don Gortez Not a word , not a word . Bel . Colonel Belgardo He has sent me , his most particular friend  --  we were at college together  --  Gor . Don Gortez Well , and he has sent you  --  Bel . Colonel Belgardo To see this wench , that I may let him know what sort of commodity she is , as he has heard that she is hump-backed , lame of one leg , has red eyes , black teeth , a yellow skin , gray hair , white lips , and few other negative beauties which do n't exactly accord with his taste . Gor . Don Gortez A hump-back ! and lame too ! this must be some trick of that rascal Belgardo , that billet-doux making puppy , that  --  Bel . Colonel Belgardo Belgardo ! Belgardo ! I think I know that name ; I kicked a fellow of that name once . Gor . Don Gortez Did you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel Belgardo Oh , the fellow is an arrant coward ! Gor . Don Gortez Oh ! then I 'll kick him myself whenever I meet him . Give me your hand ; I like you because you hate Belgardo.  --  I am Don Gortez  --  Enter Alphonso. the same you wish to know . Bel . Colonel Belgardo Then my friend is betrayed . Alph . Don Alphonso Well met. then , Don Gortez , I was just going to enquire for you . Gor . Don Gortez Your business , sir ? Alph . Don Alphonso I am Don Alphonso , just arrived from Seville , the son of your friend Don Testy . Now to my plan ! ( aside ) Gor . Don Gortez Don Alphonso , I rejoice to see you ; you was the last man we were speaking of . Your friend there  --  Alph . Don Alphonso My friend !  --  where ? Gor . Don Gortez Come , come , I know it all . Alph . Don Alphonso Know what ? Gor . Don Gortez Why that you sent your friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ( aside ) ha ! ha ! ha !  --  so , you really believe that fellow to be Alphonso , your intended son-in-law . Gor . Don Gortez To be sure I do . Bel . Colonel Belgardo ( going up to Alphonso ) Why do you think , sir , to pass yourself for don Alphonso ? Alph . Don Alphonso Alphonso is my name . Bel . Colonel Belgardo Of Seville ? Alph . Don Alphonso Of Seville . Bel . Colonel Belgardo Impudence unheard of ! Gor . Don Gortez What then , this is not don Alphonso ! Bel . Colonel Belgardo Alphonso ! no , this fellow is a barber , he shaved me about ten days ago .  --  Sirrah , have you forgotten the beating I gave you for cutting me on the left cheek ? oh , thou abominable barber ! thou bason of Saturday night 's suds !  --  thou vile mustachio-trimmer ! thou shalt be trimmed for this , thou wicked barber ! Alph . Don Alphonso Is this meant to me ?  --  I carry a sword , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What , you have learned to play the gentleman , have you ;  --  you 'll challenge me !  --  oh , thou cut-throat barber ; for shame , for shame ! go home and shave your customers ; be wise , be wise . Gor . Don Gortez Ay ! go home , you sha n't shave us . Alph . Don Alphonso You too , don Gortez , you shall repent this . Gor . Don Gortez No , but you will  --  you sha n't lead me by the nose , master Barber : have you got a razor about you ? if you have , open a vein  --  it will save the hangman trouble . Alph . Don Alphonso Don Gortez , I see you are imposed on ; read this letter ; that will tell you who I am . Bel . Colonel Belgardo What , forgery too ! oh wicked world ! oh barbarous barber ! ( snatches the letter and tears it ) you see I would'nt have thee hanged  --  escape , escape ! this is perhaps your first offence  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and run . Alph . Don Alphonso This language you shall answer for : don Gortez , you are deceived , grossly deceived ! Gor . Don Gortez No , no ; I am not , you ca n't deceive me ; I knew you to be a barber by the cut of your mustachios . Alph . Don Alphonso As you are an old man , don Gortez , I shall not notice what you have said : besides , you are imposed on  --  my father 's servant will be here presently , he will convince you of your error . Bel . Colonel Belgardo The fellow has contrived this well : you might have been cheated if I had not come so opportunely . Gor . Don Gortez Stop , stop , I 'll pose the villain ; now mind ; pray what 's this servant 's name ? Alph . Don Alphonso His name is Sticko . Gor . Don Gortez Why , that is his name indeed ; I have heard my old friend often speak of Sticko , and laugh about his stuttering . Bel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure enough ; how has the fellow learnt that ?  --  poor Sticko , I know stuttering Sticko very well ; would he were here , it should be to thy confusion ! ( making signs to Mirtillo at the side ) Eh ! as I live here he comes . Mirtillo enters , and is passing to don Gortez 's house , having been seen listening to the foregoing conversation . Bel . Colonel Belgardo Ah , Sticko ! how do you do , Sticko ? I am glad to see you . ( to Mirtillo stopping him ) Alph . Don Alphonso I 'm astonished . Bel . Colonel Belgardo Where is your master , Sticko ? Mir . Mirtello Co  --  co  --  coming he  --  he  --  here s  --  s  --  soon . Bel . Colonel Belgardo There , he 's coming here soon . Sticko , did you know this fellow ? Mir . Mirtello Ye  --  ye  --  yes , I saw him bastinadoed for picking pockets . ( stuttering ) Gor .

Don Alphonso In a few hours my father will arrive ; he will convince you , don Gortez , of your error : you , sir , shall give me satisfaction for your behaviour , the satisfaction of a gentleman ! ( to Belgardo ) Gor . Don Gortez A gentleman ! a pretty gentleman truly !  --  come sir , let us leave this gentleman . I am very much indebted to you , I 'm sure ; though I think it was n't right for your friend Alphonso to send you on such an errand ;  --  but come  --  I 'm much beholding to you . Bel . Colonel Belgardo Oh , not in the least , I have only done my duty in exposing an impostor . Gor . Don Gortez Come , sir , come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow , if you do nt take yourself off as fast as you can , I 'll send an officer after you , I will , you rascal  --  I 'll put an iron in the fire for you  --  I 'll give you a dressing  --  I 'll comb your head , Mr. Barber .  --  Zounds ! did you think to impose upon don Gortez ?  --  if you are seen in town again , I 'll have your back shaved with the strappado. exit into the house . ( as Belgardo is following him Alphonso pulls him back ) Alph . Don Alphonso Nay , nay , you escape not thus , I have business with you . Bel . Colonel Belgardo Fellow , I do nt want shaving . Alph . Don Alphonso You shall fight me , sir . Bel . Colonel Belgardo What ! is this your gratitude ?  --  have I not saved you from the gallows ? Alph . Don Alphonso A truce of words , sir ! I shall use but few  --  you are a coward ! Bel . Colonel Belgardo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  then I must take a turn with you . Alph . Don Alphonso Yonder I see a place which is more retired  --  follow me. exit with Sticko Bel . Colonel Belgardo ( going up to the door ) Excuse me for a few moments , Don Gortez  --  I shall but see this barber in the stocks , and then return  --  now for death or victory ! exit , followed by Mirtillo SCENE II .  --  Another street . Enter Numpo , apparently very much fatigued . Numpo . Numpo If I budge one step further , I am the veriest varlet that ever footed it  --  perhaps all this time that I am running after fortune , fortune may be running after me  --  if so , I wish the lady was a little lighter of foot ; I 'll stay here awhile , however , and give her a chance of coming up with me  --  My toes have been peeping out of my shoes for these last ten miles , to see if they were near their journey 's end  --  oh ! corns and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !  --  I am as tired as a dog , as lame as a cat , as hungry as a horse , as dry as a doornail , and as poor as the devil  --  O for a cool cup of canary , and the hind quarter of a kid , to cure this cursed capering of my bowels ! they are all dancing jigs to a hungry tune , and the music , to say the truth of it , is none of the pleasantest  --  I must try and quiet ' am , for I feel myself mightily disposed to nap  --  hush if you keep this rumbling and grumbling ( lying down ) egad there is no sleep for me  --  my lodging is on the ground floor , very airy , and cheap too  --  I wish I could get a dinner on the same terms . Of all my ills hunger is the worst ; I can swallow any thing but that  --  good night , Numpo , pleasant dreams !  --  hush !  --  be quiet ! ( sleeps ) Enter Belgardo and Mirtillo hastily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to be done ? here I can not stay . Mir . Mirtello Then , sir , let us trust to our heels . Bel . Colonel Belgardo What ! and leave Caroline ? no , that will never do  --  how unlucky  --  I tried all I could to disarm him  --  but he pushed me so close that I was obliged to wound him in my own defence . Mir . Mirtello My dear sir , you are losing time ; the guard will pursue you immediately . Bel . Colonel Belgardo Hah ! what 's here ? ( seeing Numpo )  --  if I could disguise myself in this sleeping fellow 's clothes I might easily elude the guard  --  what think you ? Mir . Mirtello There is no time to think  --  you must resolve quickly . Bel . Colonel Belgardo Assist me then ( they change Numpo 's cloak , &c.; &c.); quick , quick the fellow will lose nothing by the exchange  --  there  --  there  --  so now I am equipt . Mir . Mirtello Leave the rest to me , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tavern where we passed the night ; now manage this well Mirtillo , and all will be right yet . exit . Mir . Mirtello Do n't fear me . Now my friend you must be informed of your advancement ; come , awake , awake ! he wakes him , and retires . Numpo , starting up . What ! hey ! is dinner ready ? who is there ? St. Jago , what do I see ? ( rubbing his eyes ) well this is certainly a most excellent dream , if I did not know myself to be Numpo , I should think I was somebody else  --  and if I did not know that this was an old brown cloak , I could swear that it was scarlet and gold . ( standing up ) Why , am I really Numpo ? I certainly am ; I know by this craving in my stomach  --  I ca n't remember being measured for this  --  I 'll try it on , however  --  ha ! a very good fit ; I hope there is a full purse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; well , it 's no matter ; people will be afraid to ask me for money now . ( he puts on the hat ) I feel very fierce in this hat .  --  Now for the sword ( puts it on awkwardly ) now Numpo , if you do n't fight your way through the world , it 's your own fault .  --  I wonder where my regiment lies  --  garrisoned in some castle in the air , I suppose .  --  I am very poorly attended here for a man of my consequence : where are all my servants ?  --  here , Pedro ! Lopez ! Numpo ! you lazy dogs , where are you all ?  --  by my sword I swear , I 'll discharge you every one ! Enter Mirtillo . Mir . Mirtello Here I am , sir . Num . Numpo ( much surprised ) Yes , yes , I see you are there ; but who you are , or what you are , curse me if I know ! Mir . Mirtello Your servant , Mirtello.  --  Did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did not call you colonel  --  did you call me colonel ? Mir . Mirtello Yes , colonel . Num . Numpo Huzza ! Huzza ! Mir . Mirtello No , sir , not in the huzzars ; you are in the foot you know . Num . Numpo ( aside ) If I am , I do nt stand in my own shoes . Mir . Mirtello I attend your commands , sir . Num . Numpo ( aside ) What a cursed fool this fellow is ! if he is not drunk , I 'm asleep . Mir . Mirtello I am ready to wait upon you colonel . Num . Numpo Colonel , who ? Mir . Mirtello You sir , colonel Belgardo , my master . Num . Numpo Now one of us two must be confoundedly mistaken . Pray , do nt you think I am somewhat altered since you saw me last ? Mir . Mirtello Not in the least , sir . Num . Numpo Why , somehow or other I do nt feel like the came man . Mir . Mirtello O @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same commanding countenance , and the same genteel carriage . Num . Numpo ( aside ) The devil you do !  --  put on your spectacles , my dear fellow . Mir . Mirtello I never wear any , sir . Num . Numpo It 's time you did then , for you ca n't see clear . Mir . Mirtello I certainly do , sir . Num . Numpo Then certainly I am dreaming  --  come here  --  bite my finger . Oh ! oh ! you need not have bitten so hard . I am awake , however , I am sure of that now ; and I begin to believe that I really am a colonel .  --  I do n't know how it is ; I do n't feel quite myself . Mir . Mirtello No wonder , sir , that you should feel a little disordered after escaping such danger . Num . Numpo Danger ! what danger ? Mir . Mirtello O sir , it 's impossible you can have forgotten what has happened within these two hours . Num . Numpo Upon my soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened , I believe , I had even forgotten that I was a colonel , till you reminded me of it ; but I recollect it now perfectly well . Mir . Mirtello Ay , sir , you have been put a little out of your way by the duel . Num . Numpo What duel ? Mir . Mirtello The duel you fought just now . Num . Numpo Oh !  --  ay , I remember  --  I killed the fellow , did not I ? Mir . Mirtello Indeed you did , sir . Num . Numpo Ay , I never do things by halves ; he knew what would come of his affronting me . Well now , as sure as I am a colonel , I forgot the fellow 's name , and what I quarrelled with him about . Mir . Mirtello Alphonso was his name ; he was your rival in the love of don Gortez 's daughter . Num . Numpo Impudent varlet ! I recollect now . Mir . Mirtello He certainly has his desert ; he knew how well Donna Carolina loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could she help it ? but do you think she really does love me ? Mir . Mirtello Oh , to distraction ? Num . Numpo What a lucky dog I am !  --  come along my fine fellow ; I 'll marry her directly . Mir . Mirtello Gently , gently ; you know , sir , her father opposes on account of the hatred between your families  --  five of his house have already fallen beneath the sword of your ancestors . Num . Numpo And if this old rascal continues obstinate , he shall be the sixth . Oh Numpo ! Numpo ! Mir . Mirtello Mirtillo is my name  --  at your service , sir . Num . Numpo I do n't like that name ; Numpo is a much prettier name . I formerly had a servant called Numpo , an excellent fellow , a fine young man ; you shall take his name . Mir . Mirtello That Numpo is a sad graceless dog , an idle rascal , a great liar , a drunken vagabond  --  Num . Numpo He knows me. ( aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no doubt he has been hanged long since . Num . Numpo ( aside ) No , no , not yet  --  I do nt like to hear poor Numpo run down : I 'll be even with him . ( puts his hand in his pocket ) Oh !  --  oh ! dear ! here 's a job , not a farthing left . Mir . Mirtello What is the matter , sir ? Num . Numpo What is the matter , sir ?  --  why you have robbed me , sir ? you have stolen thirty pistoles out of my pocket ; I 'll swear I had them in this right hand pocket when I went to sleep  --  give them up , sir ! Mir . Mirtello ( aside ) You shall smart for this lie . Sir , you know I am honest ; you have left your purse at your ledgings . Num . Numpo have I ? you go fetch it then , and I will forgive you . Mir . Mirtello ( aside ) You 'll be fetched now , I believe ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my master ,  --  Now the sport begins ! Num . Numpo Who are those coming this way ? Mir . Mirtello Some soldiers of your regiment . Enter Serjeant , and six guards . Serj . Serjeant It is he  --  colonel 's uniform  --  servant in brown livery  --  yes it answers the description exactly . ( going up to Num ) Num . Numpo Halt ! halt , I say !  --  why the rascal takes no more notice than if he was deaf .  --  do n't you know your colonel ? do you mutiny , rascals ? I 'll have you all tied up to the halberds , and flogged within an inch of your lives . Serj . Serjeant A little more civility if you please , sir ! we are only doing our duty ; you must come with us . Num . Numpo I must ! must I ? do you see this ? ( putting his hand on his sword ) to the right about , and march off , or I 'll give you a steel dumpling . Serj . Serjeant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( drawing it ) Yes , you shall have your bellyful of it . Mir . Mirtello O my dear master ! they are come to take you up for killing Alphonso . Serj . Serjeant Mind that  --  his servant acknowledges that he is the man . ( presenting his bayonet ) Give me your sword sir . Num . Numpo Well do nt be in a passion  --  there , take it . So now I can walk more at my ease . Serj . Serjeant Now sir , follow me if you please . Num . Numpo But I do not please , sir . Serj . Serjeant Then I must use force . Num . Numpo Oho , if that 's the case , a word with you : I 'm not the man you take me to be , I 'm no more a colonel than you are !  --  Lord help your silly head ! I 'm only Numpo . Mir . Mirtello My dear Master , I see you are going mad again . Serj . Serjeant Mad ! oh , then it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( they seize him ) Num . Numpo Ah ! rascal  --  villian  --  liar !  --  you know I am no colonel  --  let me go , let me go  --  knock that fellow down . Mir . Mirtello Now he raves ; pray do nt hurt him ! Num . Numpo O dear ? O dear ! I shall be hanged in a mistake .  --  Take that rascal he is the murderer ; let me go  --  I tell you I 'm Numpo , honest Numpo ; as good a fellow as ever you knew in all your life . Serj . Serjeant Come along , we ca n't stay here all day . Num . Numpo The sooner you go the better then .  --  Take up that villian ; he has robbed me of 30 pistoles , and so now he wants to get me hanged out of the way . Serj . Serjeant Away , away ! Num . Numpo Murder ! murder ! theives ! they drag him off  --  Mirtillo goes off . ACT II . Scene I.  --  A Street . Enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I hope you approve my proceedings . Bel . Colonel Belgardo Approve ; I applaud you , Mirtillo . Mir . Mirtello I had rather you would reward me , sir , if you please . Bel . Colonel Belgardo Well  --  but , Mirtillo , how are we to proceed ? I almost despair  --  we must strike a stroke before don Testy arrives , or the game is all up , you know :  --  besides , Alphonso will be abroad soon ; his wound , I am glad to find , is only trifling . Mir . Mirtello See , see , see ! as I live yonder is my pupil ! he has escaped from the guard , and runs this way as if a score of devils were after him . Bel . Colonel Belgardo Step aside ; and let me observe him : I think I can make him useful to us. ( they withdraw ) Enter Numpo  --  he is very much out of breath and looking anxiously about him . Num . Numpo Puh !  --  oh lord ! oh lord ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at last , however .  --  I have been damnably ill-treated in the service , and I 'll throw up my commission ; so come off ! ( pulls off cloak , &c.); and if ever I put on another man 's coat again , I 'll be content to be hanged in it . If colonels get nothing but kicks and thumps as a reward for their services as I have , I should think they 'd all be glad to be upon half-pay  --  Oh Numpo ! Numpo ! what trick will fortune play off upon you now . Enter Belgardo . Bel . Colonel Belgardo Is it possible ?  --  my eyes must deceive me  --  no , it is he . Num . Numpo But it is not , though . ( fearfully ) Bel . Colonel Belgardo My dear don Alphonso , can it be you whom I see ? Num . Numpo Don Alphonso ! !  --  by the lord they 'll call me Tippoo Saib presently I suppose . Bel . Colonel Belgardo But my dear don Alphonso , how is it that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the open street , and in that strage dress too ? Num . Numpo Why I 'll tell you how it is :  --  you see I happen to have a particular dislike to hanging : now if you are found of it , you have only to put on this cloak and hat , and they 'll soon tuck you up . Bel . Colonel Belgardo What have you been at ?  --  I am afraid , Alphonso , you have had one of your old fits . Num . Numpo I do nt know what you mean by old fits ; but I was very near having a hanging fit , only I thought fit to take a fit of running away . Bel . Colonel Belgardo I mean a mad fit .  --  Saint Dominick assist you ! Num . Numpo I tell you what ; I know I 'm possessed of a devil ; he has got into my stomach ; but if saint Dominick or any other saint would appear to him in the shape of a large leg of mutton stuck round with turnips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very hungry fiend ; only hark how he roars . Bel . Colonel Belgardo Nay , prithee , Alphonso  --  Num . Numpo Do nt Alphonso me ! my name is Numpo , and I 'll stick to it . Bel . Colonel Belgardo The Devil you will !  --  and do you really think that your name is Numpo ? Num . Numpo What do you think ! Bel . Colonel Belgardo Why I think that you are mad ; and I must apply Dr. Drencho 's remedy to you . Num . Numpo Dr. Drencho  --  Dr. damnable !  --  pray what is his remedy ? Bel . Colonel Belgardo He ordered that , whenever you had this fit of fancying yourself Numpo , you should be beaten with a good thick stick till you come to yourself again . Num . Numpo I do n't like Dr. Drencho 's physic , and I had rather be any body than be beaten : so pray tell me , has this Alphonso been fighting any duels lately ? Bel . Colonel Belgardo You know you have not . Num @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any body ? Bel . Colonel Belgardo Nay , nay , ramember Dr. Drencho ! Num . Numpo I certainly must be bewitched  --  now only hear me : when I came to this place , I will take my oath that my name was Numpo . Bel . Colonel Belgardo Take care ! Num . Numpo Oh ! I know its Alphonso now .  --  Well , as I said before , my name was Numpo ; only I took a short nap , and the devil changed me into one colonel Belgardo , and sent half a dozen of his imps after me : they took me up for killing Don Alphonso ; and I have no sooner got out of their fiery clutches , and thrown off this cloak , but I am changed into that very Don Alphonso that I killed in a duel . Bel . Colonel Belgardo My dear friend how you wander ! Num . Numpo Yes , I know that very well , I wish I never had wandered , have made a most devout pilgrimage of it , for I am sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel Belgardo Now you must make haste home with me , and I 'll prepare you for a visit to your intended wife , donna Carolina . Num . Numpo Are you sure I sha n't get into any scrape ? Bel . Colonel Belgardo Pshaw ! leave this fooling , Alphonso , and remember Dr. Drencho . Num . Numpo Oh ! the bare thought of him will make me swallow any thing . But pray only answer me one question  --  If I am Don Alphonse , what is become of Numpo ? I should like to know that . Bel . Colonel Belgardo I believe there are several people would be glad to know that ; for he has been a great rogue , and they are on the look out for him : I heard an inquiry just now . Num . Numpo ( aside ) What the devil ! have you found me out here already ? ( to Belgardo ) So you thought I was mad , did you ? and I made you believe that I had forgotten my name ?  --  well that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Colonel Belgardo So you was only joking , then ? Num . Numpo Yes , nothing else , ha ! ha !  --  did not I do it well ? Bel . Colonel Belgardo Excellent , indeed . Num . Numpo Now then I 'll go with you ; and if ever I call myself Numpo again , then send Dr. Drencho to me  --  that 's all . Bel . Colonel Belgardo Now , my friend Alphonso , follow me , and we 'll go and pay a visit to your intended father-in-law and the beautiful Carolina . exit Num . Numpo My intended father-in-law and the beautiful Carolina ;  --  well , if I know what all this means I 'll never put meat in my mouth again ; it 's most confoundedly comical . It seems there 's a woman at the bottom of it , and so I suspect mischief .  --  Well , no matter  --  good-by Numpo ! you and I shake hands and part : and , to say the truth , I do nt care if I never see you again ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fellow : and the sooner you and I cut acquaintance , the better for us both . exit . Scene II  --  a chamber in Don Gortez 's house , Enter Carolina and Ursula . Car . Carolina Come , now , my dear Ursula ! tell me all about it . Urs . Ursula Ah ! I warrant I shall be finely used if your father finds out that I go on your naughty errands , Car . Carolina Well , but , my dear Ursula ! never mind that now , I am quite impatient to hear  --  Urs . Ursula Impatient !  --  ay , child , it 's very natural that you should be impatient ; I am sure , when I was of your age , when Perez  --  no , not Perez , but  --  Car . Carolina Some other time tell me that , my good Ursula , at present tell me of Belgardo . Urs .

Carolina For shame , Ursula ! will you never tell me what answer you bring ? Urs . Ursula Yes , in faith , I will child ; but when I think of my poor boy  --  no boy neither , he 's as much of a man as any that serves his majesty  --  when I think that I may perhaps never see him again , I can not help crying . Car . Carolina I suppose I must wait till your son comes home again , before I shall get an answer from you . Urs . Ursula Ah , I wish he was at home again with all my heart . Car . Carolina How can you be so cruel , Ursula , as to keep me in this suspense . Urs . Ursula But , my dear child , only think of your cross , crusty , old father  --  Enter Don Gortez. was to know that I do as I do for you , I am sure he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sees Don Gortez and runs off . ) Gor . Don Gortez So , my lady Sulks , you encourage that old hag to abuse your father , do you ? Car . Carolina Indeed , sir , not I ; but if you will be cross , I can not help her saying what she thinks , you know . Gor . Don Gortez Ah ! it 's mighty well ; but I 'll alter your tone ; I 'll have no more of these airs ; if you do n't do as I bid you , you shall dance out of my doors . Car . Carolina Indeed , sir , I had much rather be turned out of doors , than be forced to marry against my inclination . Gor . Don Gortez You had , had you ? Car . Carolina Yes , sir !  --  so now you know my mind , and you may turn me out as soon as you please . Gor . Don Gortez What ! you want to go after your colonel Belgardo , do you ? no , no , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whilst there are such things as bolts and bars , I shall take the liberty to  --  Car . Carolina Take away my liberty ? Gor . Don Gortez Exactly so ; I 'll cool that rebellious blood of your 's  --  bread and water is an admirable medicine for your disorder . Car . Carolina I can not say I appreve the prescription . Gor . Don Gortez Well , well , I shall try it .  --  Zounds ! I thought girls at your age were glad to get any thing in the shape of a husband . Car . Carolina Ah , sir ! but we like to choose one ourselves . Gor . Don Gortez No , no ; I have saved you the trouble of that . Enter a Servant . Ser . Servant Sir , Don Alphonso is arrived . Gor . Don Gortez I 'll be with him directly  --  tell him so . Exit Servant .

Numpo Well , what sort of a chap is this old Gortez ? Bel . Colonel Belgardo Oh , a merry old fellow ! you must be familiar with him ; he hates ceremony . Num . Numpo It 's very well that he does ; for he 's not likely to get much of it from me , I can tell you that . Bel . Colonel Belgardo ( aside ) Indeed I do n't think he is . Num . Numpo Oh , I dare say the old boy and I shall soon make matters hit . You know I 'm very much inclined to be comical.  --  But I say , though , how d'ye think I shall come on with the daughter ? Bel . Colonel Belgardo There ca n't be the least doubt of your success ; that easy gaiety of manner , that captivating expression of countenance , that elegance of deportment , and that politeness and attention for which you have been always so much admired , can not fail to captivate the fair sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what a change of air will do ;  --  a little while ago , I was thought so ugly , that the girls used to call me Pug . Bel . Colonel Belgardo Ha ! ha ! ha ! Num . Numpo Yes , they did ; but I have changed skins with somebody now , and it seems I have got the best of the bargain . Bel . Colonel Belgardo For heaven sake , Alphonso , recollect yourself ! Num . Numpo I can not , if you would give me the world : I can recollect Numpo very well , but curse me if I can recollect myself . Bel . Colonel Belgardo If you talk in this way to Don Gortez , Dr. Drencho will  --  Num . Numpo Mum , mum ; I 'll take care . Bel . Colonel Belgardo Here comes Don Gortez ; walk that way whilst I prepare him for your reception . Num . Numpo Mind you tell him of my politeness and all that ; it will save him the trouble of finding it out , you know . Enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what , is it you ? what is the reason I have not seen you before ? Bel . Colonel Belgardo Why , sir , that barber has been so troublesome to me , that really it is not without some difficulty that I wait on you now with my friend Alphonso . Gor . Don Gortez What , is that he ? ( with surprise . ) Bel . Colonel Belgardo Yes , sir , this is Alphonso . Gor . Don Gortez What ! that  --  that is Alphonso , is it hey ? Bel . Colonel Belgardo My friend is a man of very timid disposition , rather shy in his manner : give me leave to introduce you .  --  Don Alphonso , this is Don Gortez . Num . Numpo Well , how are you , my old boy ? as I am to be your son , the sooner we are acquainted the better you know ; so give me your hand ,  --  ( shakes it violently )  --  there ! what do you stare at ? are you frightened ? Bel . Colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( aside ) Gor . Don Gortez ( aside ) Very shy upon my word ! Num . Numpo Why wo n't you speak ? zounds , what are you afraid of ? I 'm none of your stiff-necked ones ; do n't mind me  --  make free , make free . Gor . Don Gortez Your friend 's very timid in his disposition . ( to Belgardo . ) Bel . Colonel Belgardo This behaviour is all put on , I assure you . Gor . Don Gortez I wish he 'd put it off , for I do n't think it 's very becoming . Num . Numpo What are you two whispering about there ?  --  eh ! do you call that manners ? Gor . Don Gortez I am astonished ! Num . Numpo Come , let 's have a look at this wench of your 's : you know one 's not to buy a pig in a poke ; that 's not the way to do things  --  is it , old Gortez ? Gor . Don Gortez Old Gortez !  --  zounds , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say though , Gortez , it 's devilish shabby of you not to ask one to eat or drink ; have you got any cold meat in the house ? where 's the kitchen ? I 'll go and take a snack with the cook  --  I 'm always for a whet before dinner ; I like to give my stomach a thump with a cold duck , or some such thing  --  I 'll be with you again directly ; I shall soon smell out the kitchen . Exit . Gor . Don Gortez I wish you 'd smell your way out of my house .  --  Why , this Alphonso is a strange genius . Bel . Colonel Belgardo A genius ! Oh yes , sir , he 's a man of taste . Gor . Don Gortez ' T is for a cold duck then , I believe , and a whet before dinner . Bel . Colonel Belgardo Is it possible that you do n't see through all this ? Gor . Don Gortez See ! not I indeed ! Bel . Colonel Belgardo Don Gortez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short acquaintance I esteem so much , that I can not bear to see you imposed upon in any way whatever , even though it be by my own friend . Gor . Don Gortez Sir , I am very much beholden to you . Bel . Colonel Belgardo Oh , not at all , not at all ; I can not bear with any patience to see so good a father cheated . Gor . Don Gortez Well , but how though ? Bel . Colonel Belgardo Why thus ; Don Alphonso merely puts on this behaviour to disgust you , that you may deny your daughter to him ; he having as I told you before , heard that she is not exactly according to his choice  --  the hump-back , red eyes , &c.; Gor . Don Gortez Oh , if that is all I hav'nt much fear but he will like her when he sees her . Bel . Colonel Belgardo Well , sir , so much the better ; but if you will take my advice , as you seem much to desire this match , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't notice his strange behaviour , but introduce your daughter to him , and I 'll hurry them off to church  --  then leave the rest to my management . Gor . Don Gortez You are a worthy , good man , sir , and I 'll do as you advice ; I do n't know how to thank you  --  but for you , that rascally Belgardo might have been in my family by this time . Bel . Colonel Belgardo Oh , I 'll take care of him ; never fear , sir ! I always have an eye for him  --  he 's a sad fellow  --  I dare say he would'nt mind what means he pursued to gain his ends . Gor . Don Gortez Ay , I dare say he thinks to juggle me ; but I am not so easily deceived  --  I 'm too cautious , too circumspect . Bel . Colonel Belgardo O yes , sir , you are too wary to fall a dupe to his shallow artifices . Gor . Don Gortez I hate him and all his family ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll tell him so . Bel . Colonel Belgardo He shall be your son-in-law for all that , my worthy Don . ( aside . ) Gor . Don Gortez O , here comes my daughter . Bel . Colonel Belgardo A beautiful girl !  --  my friend Alphonso will be in raptures when he sees her . Enter Carolina . Car . Carolina Belgardo ! Bel . Colonel Belgardo ( stopping her ) Ma'am ! I beg you will never speak of Belgardo ;  --  for my friend Alphonso I beg it , madam . Car . Carolina Sir , I shall deny you nothing . Gor . Don Gortez Heyday , here 's a change  --  I am overjoyed ! Bel . Colonel Belgardo How fortunate is the man who is to be the possessor of so much beauty and loveliness ; were he not my friend , I should envy him . Gor . Don Gortez And if I had another daughter , she should be your 's . This gentleman , Carolina , you must receive as my friend . Car . Carolina Sir , I shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gortez My dear sir , I am under infinite obligations to you  --  you 'll explain to my daughter . Enter Numpo , a napkin under his chin , eating . Num . Numpo Well , dad , here I am  --  egad , you are a fine fellow , you keep a rare good larder  --  I was devilish hungry . ( eating ) Gor . Don Gortez So it seems . Num . Numpo Have you got any wine in the cellar ? Gor . Don Gortez Yes , plenty . Num . Numpo It seems likely to stay there , for you hav'nt the manners to ask one to drink .  --  I want something to quench my thirst . Gor . Don Gortez You shall have it directly ; but I did not know that you was fond of drinking in the morning . Num . Numpo Well , but come , where 's this daughter of your 's ? Gor . Don Gortez Carolina , my dear , this is Don Alphonso ! Num . Numpo Egad , Gortez , she 'll do rarely . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a husband ? hey ! Gor . Don Gortez O sir , your friend here has said so much in your favour , that  --  Num . Numpo That you are all impatient to be married . Come , I know that 's it . Car . Carolina Why , then , sir , if I must speak , I  --  Num . Numpo You see I know how to manage matters with the girls , hey Gortez !  --  I never stand shilly shally with them . Oh ! I have been a devil among them in my time . Gor . Don Gortez Oh , I do n't doubt it . Enter Servant . Ser . Servant Sir , Don Alphonso 's father , Don Testy , is arrived . Bel . Colonel Belgardo And the devil along with them . ( aside ) Gor . Don Gortez I 'll be with him directly . Exit Servant . Bel . Colonel Belgardo My dear sir , I would not have him find Alphonso here , and not married , for the world ; you know his hasty temper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's to be done ? Bel . Colonel Belgardo I only know one way of avoiding his displeasure ; there 's not a moment to lose . I 'll go and see the young couple married immediately . Gor . Don Gortez Will you ? that 's very kind of you  --  run off with them , and make haste back . There , there , no ceremony  --  away ! quick , quick ! lose no time , whilst I go and meet my friend Don Testy . Exit Ursula runs in . Urs . Ursula I have overheard it all  --  make haste , for Don Testy is now coming up stairs  --  you hav'nt a moment to lose ; here 's your cloak and veil . Bel . Colonel Belgardo How the deuce to get rid of my friend here ( looks off ) heavens ! the door is beset  --  there is a serjeant and half a dozen soldiers . Num . Numpo ( alarmed ) What ! Page 27 Bel . Colonel Belgardo Whom can they want ? Num . Numpo Oh ! it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you have any pity on a poor fellow , who never did any harm ; put me any where  --  under your clothes . ( to Ursula . ) Urs . Ursula Go into that room , you 'll find plenty of my clothes ; you may easily disguise yourself . Bel . Colonel Belgardo Quick ! quick ! they are coming in . Num . Numpo You 'll stay for me . Exit into the room . Bel . Colonel Belgardo Now fortune , I defy thee ! Exeunt Bel . Car . and Urs . Enter Don Gortez and Testy . Gor . Don Gortez My old friend , I rejoice to see you ! Tes . Don Testy Old friend !  --  pish ! do you use all your old friends thus ? Gor . Don Gortez Why , what 's the matter ? Tes . Don Testy Matter !  --  pshaw ! matter enough . Gor . Don Gortez How have I offended you ? Tes . Don Testy Offended !  --  pish ! pshaw ! nonsense ! Gor .

Don Gortez Well ; come , come , do n't be in an ill humour ; consider this is your son 's wedding day . Tes . Don Testy Wedding day ! - pshaw ! it shall be no such thing . Gor . Don Gortez Sha' n't it ? ( smiling . ) Tes . Don Testy Sha' n't it !  --  no ! what are you sneering at , hey ? Gor . Don Gortez I think it will be the wedding-day . Tes .

Don Testy Here presently !  --  pish ! why is n't he here now ? Gor . Don Gortez If you must know the truth of it , he 's gone to be married . Tes . Don Testy Gone to be married ! gone to the devil ! I 'll marry him , a forward puppy !  --  and you to take advantage of my absence  --  nothing settled , nothing done  --  zounds ! I shall murder him !
