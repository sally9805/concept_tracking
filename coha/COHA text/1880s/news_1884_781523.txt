txt Young Mr. LANGSTON , the colored man who has just killed two other colored men in Washington , seems to fancy that it is character and not color that makes " the nigger . " One of his victims , the colored man WILLIAMS , was engaged in the humane and Christian task of trying to separate two men who were fighting . The conduct of WILLIAMS was the more creditable to him ' for the reason that the fight to which he was trying to put a stop was a fight between a negro and a white man , and that the white man was getting much the worst of it . Mr. LANGSTON resented the interference of WILLIAMS , insisted that the fight should go on , and in the course of his remarks called WILLIAMS " a nigger . " If the epithet had reference merely to color , Mr. LANGSTON 'S remark bore a close resemblance to the famous charge brought by the pot against the kettle . As , however , Mr. LANGSTON 'S father was formerly some variety of " Professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the , young man could hardly be ignorant of his own color . We must then assume that Mr. LANGSTON believes that the epithet " nigger " describes a man 's conduct rather than his color . If this be true , it is a great pity that Mr. LANGSTON does not strive to become " a nigger . " Poor WILLIAMS acted in a way deserving of the highest praise , and was thereupon called " a nigger " by a man who wished to encourage a brutal fight , and who was armed and ready to commit murder . Between the peace-maker " nigger " and the brawling murderer there is a wide difference . but the more " nizzers " and the fewer Langstons we have the better it will be for the community .
