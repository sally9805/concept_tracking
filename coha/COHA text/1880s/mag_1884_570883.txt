ARTICLE 11. - THE RELIGIOUS FACTOR IN EDUCATION . THERE js an old irrational feud between the human heart and intellect . One form of it appears in the jealousies and antagonisms of religion and learning . Such conflict ought to be impossible where there is a worthy estimate of man . What man is determines the problem of his training . The capacity of his being is the measure of his becoming . A worthy idea of his person , place , use , and destination pledges a broad conception of his education . Education is nothing less than the development and training of all the potencies that have been lodged in man . It concerns itself with the full contents of his being and with all his possibilities . The claims of education are precisely the claims of manhood . If the ideal of manhood be low the product of training will be meagre and inadequate . The claims of religion upon education are precisely the claims of a complete manhood . If a man is worth educating at all he is worth educating roundly as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manhood it is a crime against that manhood to ignore its rights or cripple its possibilities . It must be acknowledged that religion , in some form , has always been an immense power in the history of the human race . It has always been in fact the dominant power . Nor is it likely that it will cease to be in any most advanced period of the future . So long as man is forced by the necessities of his own being to recognize a power ' which is other and more than himself and other and more than the universe in which he lives , so long religion will hold its supremacy , and this supremacy will be hardly the less apparent in whatever effort to suppress , pervert or limit its claims . No healthy growth can ever ignore it or pervert it or crowd it into a place of subordination or insignificance . This meagre wo rld.power can never successfully dis . place that which represents what lies beyond the world . It is too real and too essential . The religious seems to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history // and tradition is primeval religion . Beyond this we have noth .. ing but speculation . It may be that we do not know prehistoric or pre-traditional man . But primitive man so far as we know him feels the invisible long before he understands much of the visible . There is a something in him that pushes him . into tI ) e presence of a power behind the Universe , before the inteflect has fairly grappled with the problem of such a power . The problem of origin and destination is summarily solved before the mind has had time to fairly comprehend the elements of the problem . Man does not attain to the idea of God by the action of the powers of nature upon his creative imagination . It is not the product of experience , meditation , teaching or even revelation simply . There were nothing to educate or cultivate " if there were not already presupposed an original God-consciousness as its practical basis and condition . " A higher world and a higher power thrust themselves into the forefront of all our investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mythology antedates history , and mythology is " religion gone mad . " Religion is before philosophy or science or whatever highest product of the human intellect . Men begin to reflect , and generate philosoph* , to investigate and generate science , to recollect and produce history , to utter their thoughts and produce literature , to give expression to feeling and the sense of beauty in the forms of imagination and produce poetry and art . But already they have begun to fee , in dim , vague fashion , the reality of an invisible realm and the presence of invisible personalities and powers , which they do not profess to understand and already religion is born . And they have presentiment of the invisible powers before they have understanding of them . Religion is before theology . All earliest attempts , so far as we know them , in science , philosophy , history , literature , poetry or art , are religious , and this because man can not crowd back from his highest and noblest activities the realm of the unseen and unknown that lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existence there stretches an ocean at whose shores man stands longingly . While he is thinking and speculating upon the origin of things he finds already within him the necessity to try the vastness of the ocean that lies before him and bring back some // report . Indeed there comes a report out of the great deep even before he has sought to launch . What we know of the invisible is given as revelation . And yet too , religion and theology are the necessity of the soul 's outreach and striving to know what lies beyond . We are forever mingling these two realms . It is the vital force of a nature that has capacity for religion *that effects this . Existence begins in religion , and it must end . with it . It begins in the simplicities of undeveloped and untrained manhood . It must end in the complexity and completeness of the perfect man . It begins as a crude , confused product of nature perverted by finiteness and sin . It must end as the consummate product of a divine and human effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscious freedom and virtue . It begins in a garden . It must end in a city . Eden and the New Jerusalem ! Here is religion without and religion with the developed contents of manhood . But always religion .. If the Bible had intended to give a philosophical rather than a religiously historical and prophetic statement of the beginning a and endings of religion in the history of humanity , it could not have done it more successfully . Here we find the religious as the earliest historic consciousness . Man walks as a child with God . Without training he is not without religion . And in the consummation we behold still the dominance of religion . Intellect and power , art and achievement bring their glory and honor into the City of God , where religion is enthroned in all its fullness and majesty of power . The New Jerusalem is a city with all the splendors of decoration , but it is the city of God . Religion must crown as well as begin the history of the race . Man must be trained to the utmost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religiously . Education can never suppress nor displace religion . It can only pervert it , and in doing so perverts itself . Its highest aim is to develop . religion into fullness of significance and power . The end of history is the kingdom of God . Religion haa often been a blind , dark power , but always a power , and one whose greatness might easily suggest that it will not take care of itself ; will not take itself out of the way ; can not be explained out of existence ; can not be trained into permanent silence ; will not be ignored , and can not be majestically put to . // confusion by the power of intellectual arrogance . If religion were only a co*irdinate factor in our education it would demand all that any other factor demands , for its rights are as great , and an education that would crowd it out of recognition would only be a garbled and false and so a dangerous education . Even those who allow it no higher dignity or significance than belongs to a product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion represents the realm of the absolute , and is the central and imperative power in man , the case is other and more . Religion does not come into man 's consciousness simply as a product of his thought . It is not a product of the intellectual activity in its speculation upon the origin of all things , as Rationalism claims . It is not a theoretic , but a practical power . It is more than knowledge of the infinite . It is knowledge realized as obligation . In religion we do not find man exacted upon by the powers and mysteries of the universe over against which he stands in his weakness and ig. norance and dependence . Nor do we find him exacting upon himself in his isolation and centrality and supremacy . Nor do we find one department of his being exacting upon another . We find the whole man subject to an authority without him . Nor yet is religion wholly in the conscience , as moralism holds . It is not in the feeling alone , as mysticism holds . Nor is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Religion is realized only as the " unity of the soul revealed in feeling , willing , and knowing , " and that soul in its unity becomes the organ of the revealing activity of God . Religion , therefore , as an authority from the realm of the absolute claims the whole man . It is the " surrender of man to God in the thought of what is true , in the will for what is good , in the feeling of blessedness , as an immediate life from faith , in which man brings his life to God in order to receive true life from God . " Religion , then , is the root of manhood , as well as its crown , and all rational and systematic development must proceed from this center . A something there must be in man which is to him what life is in the development of organism . This somewhat is the religious factor in him . Only as religion finds place in the growth and development of manhood do we attain to symmetry and completeness . // But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also furnishes material which educates . It not only demands a place , and a commanding place , in every comprehensive educational product , it also provides that which aids in the development of that product . Whatever educates , whatever quickens , develops and trains the elements of manhood , is the material of education . Every capacity as it develops itself yields a product which in turn becomes an agency not only for the still larger development of that particular capacity but for the development of many others besides . The linguistic and mathematical capacities have furnished a vast store of material for the further development of these capacities , and the same is true of all others . But it is more to the purpose that they have all furnished large material for general education , and the worth , by the larger estimate , of any particular educational product is not simply in what it does for the capacity to which it corresponds , but in what it does for the broader and cornpleter education of men . We do not study languages and mathematics solely with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skill . They are necessary to any broad and thorough education . Religion also yields material for its own fuller and completer development and culture . Religion as an historic product is always necessary to the training and culture of the religious capacities . Without it the capacity for religion would deteriorate . But we claim for religion a larger place than this in the education of men , and the claim we make also illustiates its supremacy . Religion has furnished a vast amount of material for general education . No one capacity has contributed so much to the general elevation of man . No single department of learning has the educational record that religion has . It has made an impression upon every department of human activity . It has colored the world 's thinking and influenced the world 's training as no other power has or can . Often , no doubt , a bad discoloration and perversion . But this , not because it had no legitimate place in the direction of human development , but only because it was itself a perverted religion . A revival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of learning . The best trained races are the religious races . The experience of // the power of religion quickens and expands the intellectual* faculties . Dealing with the loftiest themes it furnishes material for the most eager striving of all the powers of the soul . He who should undertake to eliminate the products of the religious activity from the material of education would find how vast is its range and how vital its energy . No education of any sort is possible independently of the operation of certain fundamental energies of manhood which rightly interpreted have a. religious significance , and which exist because man is a religious being . All human development is conditioned by the activities of faith . We rest implicitly on certain first things that are given as the condition of all reliable knowledge , and these postulates of knowledge when rationally interpreted are found to have a religious significance , are found to refer themselves back to somewhat that lies outside the subject and outside the visible universe , and exist only because they run back and bed themselves in the religious nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attaches himself to a power beyond the universe . Faith in any form or relation is the gift of God to the nature He made dependent on Him . A religious significance must be found also in the outgoing of the energies of manhood that finds place in the processes of education . We are full of energies that are pressing with more or less of definiteness , although in large measure without conscious recognition towards some goal . They have a teleological significance . This significance is recognized in the necessity of man to seek after completeness , and it has more than an ethical meaning . It has its root in the religious nature , it bespeaks a beyond as the goal of man 's perfection , and it implies a background of divine energy and intelligence . So also is it true that in the processes of education the action of conscience is necessary , and conscience must ever remain an enigma unless there be found in it a religious significance and the implication of a religious relation . Enter any department of activity that furnishes material for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a place religion finds in it . Poetry for example , has always found its highest inspirations in religion . The domain of religion is its choicest foraging ground . The greatest poems of any age or // race are religious . We can afford to lose the poems that are earth-born , but the world were poor indeed without these products of a heavenly inspiration . The supernatural is necessary to the grandest emotions and imaginings of the human soul . The poet is the seer of more than earthly vision . Paganism crowns him priest of the gods , and Revelation recog. nizes him as the prophet of Jehovah . Men are already specu.lating as to the probable result , in the domain of imagination7 of the decay of religion . As well speculate with respect to the flight of the eagle whose wings are clipped and from whose gaze the heavens are withdrawn . The best art touches the do . main of religion , it finds there its choicest material and its strongest incentive . It is not its highest vocation to train the eye or cultivate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soul . It is not to reproduce material forms with mechanical correctness , but to embody ideas that are furnished from the higher realms of thought and feeling . That art which has had the mightiest influence in human life , has brought its creations from the realm of the invisible . Christianity has produced the highest art of all time , and it is this Christian art which in turn has educated Christendom . Religion finds place in philosophy . A true science of man will contemplate him not as a fragment , but in his totality . No man takes correct account of himself or adequately understands himself , who does not know himself in his relations . No man can be understood in his isolation . The phenomena of consciousness contain religion . There is given freedom and law , duty and authority in the very idea of man . What can we know of him apart from that which is highest in him ? A psychology is impossible without ethics , and ethics contain still insolvent enigmas without religion . To know the ground and law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problem is still unsolved *till he finds God . The larger and more important contents of consciousness are moral and religious . They are material for philosophic investigation and they furnish material which philosophy , as a product of human effort , uses in the work of education . Philosophy must of necessity concern itself with the same questions as religion and theology . What can a man know about himself who never raises the question of // his source and destination ? What can he know about himself , without understanding the nature and function of conscience* without some worthy conception of law and obligation and right , without some explanation of the unsatisfied longings and strivings of his being after an unattained ideal ? The different departments of social science touch upon the domain *of religion . The epidemic of shallowness in political philosophy is passing away . It is recognized that the social sciences must deal with profounder than merely material questions , and that to have a rational , they must have a moral and even religious basis . Men can not adequately apprehend their social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What is the genesis of government and what its sanction ? Is it grounded in man 's lower or in his higher nature ? Is it wholly a product of man in his independence and isolation from a higher power , or does there appear in the very authority and majesty with which men invest it the presence of a higher power ? Is government grounded in right , and does it strive to express and realize that right ? And what is the ground and source of that right ? What is the basis of obligation , what the source of authority , what the nature and sanction of punishment ? These are questions which men are obliged to deal with . While men are discussing questions of prudence , questions of right thrust themselves into their faces ; while they talk of privileges , questions of authority come to the front . These are the questions , questions that touch the domain of ethics and religion , that have shaken the very order of social life . Those who have supposed themselves to have gotten rid of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves thrust back into the domain of morality and religion . The political science which is today exerting the most commanding influence , cuts off secularism by the roots and takes us back into the realm of a divine authority , and finds there the ground of human authority . Material science , too , can not evade the realm of religion . This is seen in the very effort to avoid it . The problems which men try to work out of sight disclose themselves in the very effort . Science walks leisurely about the universe and . seeks to understand it in its processes . And , long before it has // completed its circuit and brought back its report , religion has been beneath the surface and brought back its report with respect to its source and goal . Science must confront the same problem with which religion has dealt and evades it only by consenting or resolving to be unreligious , that is by allowing itself to be mutilated . lit is only by a suppression or an affectation of indifference to the testimony of religion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While science is at its investigation philosophy interposes itself . Not only the question of fact and law but of source and object presses for solution , and it is only by ignoring or affecting to ignore the claims of philosophy and going into the affectation of mental paralysis that science can avoid dealing with these momentous questions . The very effort to avoid them demonstrates that they should find place in rational science . Science will only then become most truly rational and will realize its largest and best work in the education of men when it takes into court the witness of religious philosophy . It is still further to be considered that religion furnishes the best ideal of education . Not only the material but the pattern . A man in his becoming is as his ideal . Education is the work of training men after some standard . The worth of the education is the worth of the standard . The ideal of manhood is the ideal of education . Independently of religion education has never succeeded in fashioning for itself the best standards . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grave question of the reconstruction of manhood . Of course historic religion has not always furnished the best ideals of manhood . Its ideals have often been caricatures . But religion has led the way . Somehow the pattern man has been lost to the race , men may differ in their explana. tion of the fact , but they agree in the fact . Men saw no per . fect sample of their kind . They even lost a worthy idea of manhood . The evil that perverts character perverts also the very idea of character . History will testify . Secular history has never been able either to present a perfect man or the per . fect conception of a man . But religion has made some approximation . At least it has not despaired . What do we find ? A race conscious of a lost ideal . The Eden , the Golden Age , // the ideal hero are in the past . It turns back with longing eyes* as to something lost . The intellect without the aid of religion has never been able to grapple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed the lead of the intellect alon&amp; they have despaired . They behold deterioration , decay , death about them and behind them . They see themselves the spoil of eviL The good are dead . The Greek cynic with his lan . tern hunting for a man is the human intellect , divorced from religion , hunting despairingly for the perfect manhood . FoW lowing the lead of the intellect men have not profoundly be lieved in their own greatness and possible perfection . They look backward rather than forward . Poetry sighs and phi . losophy sneers , but religion hopes . The race has in fact be . lieved in its own deterioration . All mythologies give evidence . Neither poetry , nor philosophy , nor science divorced from re* ligion has been able to develop strong faith in the higher possi. bilities of man . Mr. Bryant 's suggestion that there is as good evidence of the ape 's deterioration from manhood as of man 's emergence from apehood is worth considering . In the darkest hours it has not been the intellect , but the heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is the cry of man 's heart God-touched that has uttered its longing for a nobler character and a nobler and completer life . The pessimism of modern agnosticism is a necessity . The optimism of the modern materialistic science is the product of something nobler than itself . Look at the early home of learning and the early home of religion . the ideal is not with the land of culture , but with the land of religion . The eye of the Greek is towards the past . The eye of the Hebrew is always toward the future . The man of learning is a realist . The man of religion is an idealist . The perfect man and the conception of the perfect man come not from Greece but from Palestine . It is not the product of secular life and training , but of religion . Hebraism indeed has not given us a complete ideal character , only its approximation . The ideal was greatly perverted in the per . versions of the Hebrew religion . But we have here the begin . nings . Be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conception in the Hebrew mind . It nevertheless emerged as a growth through the Hebrew 's religious consciousness , and // the gift of the Christ idea is the gift of religion . And what ilebraism began Christianity completes . Christianity has given the world the pattern man whose completeness is the proper goal of all human development . He is not a creation of the intellect . He is not a product of secularism . Nor yet is he the product of a historic race-culture , but God-sent to meet and fill the ideal that was already struggling into view from the religions consciousness of ilebraism and longed for blindly as the desire of all nations . ft is Christianity that has given us the idealism of our modern schemes of education . It has given the world a new conception of man . ft has given new hope for the future of the race . ft has developed the thought of God-sonship and the kingdom of God , and enlarged the scope of education to meet these grand ideals . Modern education builds on foundations which religion has laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that religion furnishes the noblest inspiration for the work of education . This inspiration we may call the inspiration of faith . As religion furnishes the ideal , so faith is the ideal . The best modern learning is a product which has behind it the record of a lofty faith in an ideal of manhood which is the gift of Christianity . We are hardly conscious how greatly our work of education is influenced by a Christian faith in man . We are hardly con*cious how greatly indebted is our broad ideal of education to the person of Christ and to the power he exerts in the human soul . If we should lose this faith in a high Christian ideal of manhood from our training we should soon see how it and how mankind would deteriorate . What saves education from a narrow utilitarianism , or a gross materialism , or secularism , is precisely faith in the ideal man . We can easily dwarf manhood and leave large tracts of its soil uncultivated by yielding to the clamor for a so-called practical education . There is nothing so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiarity is in its object . It is a rational self-committal to some ideal reality . If there be any such thing as an ideal reality , there is rational ground for confident self-committal to it . It is only thus that we get practical connection with it ; it is // the only way in which we attain to it . There must be an ideal back of all present , imperfect , outward reality , and a man must believe in it . iReligion discloses itself as an act of faith because the soul commits itself to an invisible person who embodies its highest ideal of perfection . It is not claimed that every act of faith ii* an ideal is a religious act . But it is claimed that the faith which we have in the higher nature of man is largely the gift of religion . It is also claimed that it is necessary for a man to have faith in an ideal good in order to be a true man . All historic characters have been true characters in proportion as they have had faith in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilgrims , true to the voices that uttered themselves within the soul , seeking a better country ; reformers loyal to the truth , an ideal truth struggling after realization in the muddle of ignorance and strife of faction , seeking a purer state ; martyrs true to conscience , resisting unto blood , striving against wrong , seeking the honor of God ; educators sacrificing themselves that future generations may be blessed . All these have had an ideal of better things , have believed in it , have been true to it , and in so far as the ideal was worthy and the faith in it strong , they developed in themselves and helped develop in others noble characters . A faith that touches some ideal and holds the soul to it has always been the inspiration of noblest , truest character and achievement . This faith-element that grasps an ideal , as distinguished from a phenomenal , external , and partial reality , is necessary in all education . In all religious education , for example , faith in a religious ideal as distinguished from the formal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loses the ideal presence and power behind its forms , it deteriorates , and the worshiper himself is degraded . The reason why paganism is incapable of the best religious culture , is that men cease to walk by faith and are content to walk by sight . The senses master faith . The visible displaces the invisible . The soul loses connection with an ideal beyond itself towards which it should strive . It is a lively faith , in what stands to us as representative of an ideal best and holiest , that saves men from a heartless and heathen . ish formalism in worship . But look at some of the departments of secular education . Faith in the simplicity , the reality and // dignity of manhood is a power in all social culture . When behavior becomes hollow and heartless and artificial , it loses all virtue and character deteriorates . The forms of society ought to represent an ideal reality . They ought to be as really the symbols of character as the forms of religion . Manners are morals in so far as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lalse et*uics that identifies morals with manners . It is true which identifies manners with morals . Behavior is a language . It ought to disclose the real man . When men lose faith in the under reality of all social forms , society is corrupted and char. acter deteriorates . Faith is a power in all industrial and pro . fessional education . All education is industrial in the larger sense , and all industry in any line is properly educational . Every student is a workman , and every workman should be so far forth a student as to seek the training of his own and others ' manhood . Every man who has work to do should start with a worthy ideal and believe in it and hold to it . It is this which saves not only the work , but the workman . The want of an adequate ideal is a fatal objection to the doctrine of sphere ' education . No man values himself as he ought whose only idea of his education is that it must fit him for the practical duties of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man . Such notions ignore the higher claims of manhood . They lower men 's conceptions of life . It . may become an open question indeed whether " life is worth living " if its full significance is measured by one 's relation to the machinery of the universe . A man with immortality within him can not safely crowd his whole being and life into the rut of his daily toil . Life loses freshness and range if it lacks a worthy ideal . The man who carries a worthy ideal into a particular line of work , in the long run , is most effective in that work and at the same time he saves his larger manhood . It is the ideal which marks the difference not only between the worthy and the unworthy , the true and false workman , but in fact , between the true and false man . The man who has n* worthy standard and no faith in any , never can be an honorable journalist or man of letters in any sort . He is a sensational penny-a-liner , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is defective ideal that perverts the // 33 man who might be an artist into an artisan , the lawyer into the ' pettifogger , the orator into the declaimer , the doctor into the charlatan , the preacher into the ranter , the merchant into the tricky huckster , the mechanic into a drudging machine . All education for practical life ought to tend toward art . Every vocation ought to become a department in the art of worthy living . The high aim of all art is to develop true manhood and true life . The art of right living is the end of all art . A man 's business is his calling from God . It is in intent the training school of his manhood . There is a religion in every legitimate calling that should save it from drudgery and dishonor . The man who puts a religious faith into the work to which nature and providence call him works with an inspiration that will make it an art before celestial eyes . To do one 's best , according to a worthy standard , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slattern hand is a degradation of manhood . There is a beauty in the truth which is acceptable to God . We shall have at once better educated men and less knavery when men carry the inspiration of religion into their callings . The so-called secular professions will be exalted and become sources of better training and larger use to the world , when men have more faith in the divine idea of life . When work is consecrated as the outgrowth of a more religious education , we shall have fewer Americans who like Carlyle 's modern Englishman , are in league with the " great Lord of shoddy , adulteration and malfeasance " to help them do their work with the maximum of slimness , swiftness , profit and mendacity . " In conclusion it should be considered that religion furnishes right principles of education . There is a somewhat general agreement as to the demand of education . What the world wants is men , full , complete , thoroughly trained men . No matter what the terminology , whether religious , scientific , or popular . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is identical with the object of existence . One 's theory of existence ought to be his theory of education . A philosophical statement of the aim of education should be nearly identical with a theological statement of the aim of existence . Aristotle would not differ from Paul . Matthew Arnold would // not differ from the Westminster divines . It comes to about this ,  --  what we have in band here is to develop and train a. complete manhood , such manhood as God meant and the capacities of our own being demand . Bat men differ widely as to what constitutes a whole man . The standards of manhood are strangely variant . Just here the secular and religious world are likely to part company . Each , moreover , is at variance with itself . But we all agree as to the want , whatever the elements , methods , motives or principles of the work . We are after men . IDissatisfaction with educational processes generally means dissatisfaction with educational results . It comes from the conviction that somehow they do not accomplish the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and little w*onder . The caricatures of manhood which a perverted religion , . in its control of secular education , has produced are worthy of no man s respect . It is only because human nature does not spoil easily that Ultramontane Christianity has not fatally crippled and dwarfed the manhood of the world . On the other hand religion claims , and with justice , that a purely secular education has not done and can not and will not do the work . It is an immense question . What are the agencies that shall reconstruct and train the manhood of the world ? Secularism in our time has shown an immense pedagogic activity . It has made vast claims . It is in hand just here to criticise its claims and methods . Secularism lacks the requisite first principles . Religion , whatever be its defects in historic fact , nevertheless furnishes regulative principles , which are essential to the broadest education . This is a wide field . There is space but for a few points . And first let it be considered that religion emphasizes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It claims to furnish not only the regulative impulses , but the de* terminative aims . Character and conduct are more than " three fourths of life . " They are the end of all knowledge and the realization of all training . There are two dominant aims and two dominant schemes of education . The one is secular , the other religious . The one gives the intellect dominance . The other the heart and conscience . The one trains with reference to this world . The other with reference to the kingdom of God . The one is Hellenic , the other Hebraic . Historic Hebraism was incompetent for the successful training // of the race . But the Hebraic principle was right . The schem* that gives the moral and religious nature dominance is the only philosophical scheme and will prove itself competent to meet the wants of the world . Neither knowledge nor intellectual training can be an end . There is something higher and better . But nothing beyond character , conceived in its largest sense as the end of existence , can be rationally assumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being and harmony with the mind of God . Religion also emphasizes the spiritual conditions of the apprehension and appropriation of truth . Education encounters the weightiest problems of human existence . They are problems which the intellect can not solve , although trained unto the utmost . Some sorts of knowledge refuse to enter the gate . ways of the intellect . The most momentous questions of existence touch the moral and religious nature of man . How we feel and how we behave are of some account in the solu. tion of them . The truth is for the true . The man who is in sympathy with it and docile before it shall hear its voice . The profoundest questions of life are solved practically not speculatively . One may know in one sort what in another " passeth knowledge . " Knowledge in the deepest sense is not simply the response of the mind , but of the whole moral and religions manhood to the truth .

It has found the heart of the universe while science has been looking up the bones and muscles . Religion , moreover , recognizes the existence of evil in man . There is , therefore , something to be undone as well as done . Tmmatur. ity is not the only barrier to be overcome . Men do not grow int completeness . Education in its comprehensive aspects must meet the fact of sin . Secular education would meet it by ignoring it , but still it remains to counter-work its best . // Jan. , The Reltqious factor in Education . *fforts .

An education that makes the individual supreme and ignores the kingdom of God is fatally perverted . It is the unselfish principle that secures to the world at large the advantage of education and gives assurance that its results shall be a blessing and not an evil to the world . It not only gives us a conception of humanity , and faith in it , but love and devotion for it . It makes the kingdom of God in a humanity redeemed and trained into completeness the end of the individual effort , and keeps before men the fact that the individual never attains to completeness in isolation from humanity . The end of history is the education of a race . Unselfishness is necessary to any best personal training . A selfish scheme of education would be fatal to true manhood . How we feel and bear ourselves towards our fellows and towards a higher power is of more consequence to our own manhood than to anything else in the universe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are getting . We are not isolated personalities . The background of our heing binds us to the universe of being . God is training a race here on earth . Our training is inseparably linked to that of the race . Christianity with its philanthropy has wrought more mightily than any other agency towards the education of the race . It furnishes the mightiest of all incentives to the individual soul in its striving for the goal of its existence , but its highest good is humanity , " come in the unity of faith and of the knowledge of the son of God , unto a perfect man , unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ , " a " building fitly framed together grown into an holy temple in the Lord . " It is good philosophy as well as religion that one must save life by losing it . We need in the secularism and individualism of the time more of the old Gentile Gospel of a redeemed humanity . We need more of the spirit of the great apostle who laid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross , and labored everywhere to lift men back into the dignity of their being and into fellowship with God . Education does not know itself till it understands the prayer of Christ , " Thy kingdom come , thy will be done . "
