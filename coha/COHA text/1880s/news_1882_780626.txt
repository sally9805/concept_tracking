txt The principal witness in the Malley case to-day was Dr. Phiny A. Jewett , who was called by the defense to cover the entire range of the medical and scientific evidence put in by the State . His testimony went to show that the post-mortem indications were not inconsistent with the theory that Jennie Cramer met with her death by drowning . Dr. Jewett said : " I have practiced medicine for the past 42 years  --  mostly in New-Haven . I have examined many drowned persons . I can not tell the exact number . Among them I might mention the victims of the disaster at the Norwalk bridge in 1854 . While in Paris in 1851-2 I examined the bodies of many persons taken from the Morgue , and said to have been drowned . I have examined not less than 25 or 30 bodies of drowned persons . I have read most of the standard works on the subject . Q. ? What is the proper treatment of a body taken from the water to determine whether the person has been drowned ? A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the examination made as soon as possible after the body has been taken from the water . This , of course , is the case when there is no chance of resuscitation . The head should be kept in an elevated position and should certainly not be allowed to drop more than a foot below the rest of the body . The examination should be made as near as possible to the place where the body was recovered . Q. ? If the body of a young woman 20 years of age was found in the water at 5:30 in the morning , was taken to the beach , and after lying two or three hours in the hot sun , was carted to a morgue a mile away , was then subjected to an external examination . was then carted to an undertaking establishment four or five miles away , was there washed and packed in ice , and  --  assuming this to be Saturday morning  --  was left until Monday morning , would the fact that an examination made at that time disclosed that there was no water in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been drowned ? A. ? No . Sir . The handling the body had received would tend to the removal of any water that there might have been in the lungs . Q. ? Assuming that there was a reddish fluid found in the pleural cavities , what would be your conclusion as regards drowning ? A. ? 1 should regard it as an indication that there had been water in the lungs . Q. ? Suppose a hundred or more grains of sand were found in the gullet ? A. ? I should inquire how they got there . Tie gullet is a closed tube , except under the stimulus of swallowing . Then the passage opens to admit food , and after it has passed closes again . In view of this fact it seems to me that the act of swallowing must have been necessary to the introduction of sand into the gullet . It might be said that it washed there , but that I consider hardly possible . It might wash into the trachea but not into the gullet . If the body was turned on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sand might be stirred together and the pressure of the water might force the sand down the gullet , but that is very improbable . The medical authorities bear me out in this . Q. ? Is there any rule as to whether the eyes of drowned persons are open or shut ? A. ? Most commonly they are partially open . The mouth is usually closed , but there is no positive rule . Q. ? These are the prominent symptoms of drowning ? A  --  Yes ; you can account for the absence of some of them but not for all . For instance , the goose-skin appearance of the flesh is not always present in drowning , and may be present from other causes ; it is sometimes present In the living . The absence of water from the stomach may be accounted for by the theory that the victim made an effort to swallow , not sufficient to carry Water to the stomach . Q. ? Is there any other fact that throws light on the matter of this person 's death miller the conditions stated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death that I do n't think much reliance can be placed on the appearances . In drowning cases the right cavity of the heart is generally filled with blood ; the left cavity is only partly filled . The strongest evidence of drowning in this case is , to my mind , the presence of the reddish fluid in the cavities of the chest . In a healthy body there would have been no pleurisy , and unless the person was drowned I can not conceive how the fluid should have got , there unless it was placed there artificially . Q. ? Suppose a woman should throw herself headlong into the water and slimed perish from concuscusston with the sand , what would be your expectations as to water in the lungs and stomach A. ? If the concussion was of sufficient force death would be aln'ost instantaneous . There might , however , be a more or leas complete effort at swallowing . Q. ? If the plunge was headformost for a distance of 14 feet , and the depth of the water only 6 inches , what would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cause death . ' should not expect to find water in the lungs or stomach , except possibly in limited cases . Q. ? Have you had any experience of post-mortems in case of arsenical poisoning ? A. ? I have . I assisted in the autopsy in the Mary Stannard case and others . Q. ? How is the victim affected ? A. ? In various ways ; one of the first sensations is burning in the stomach . Inflammation soon ensues in the coats of the stomach and gradually extends , ranging in time with the distribution of the poison to the alimentary canal and the intestines . As the inflammation proceeds the burning pain increases . The throat becomes dry and the patient ales from exhaustion . Sometimes a sudden impression is made upon the nerve centres and the patient dies from shock . As a general rule , I should expect vomiting until the stomach is emptied . Q. ? If the patient died by collapse would you expect to find anything in the stomach ? A.  --  Yes , Sir . If they died by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases , however , are very rare . Q. ? If a healthy girl of 20 took 3 1-10 grains of arsenic in liquid form and died from it . and the body was brought to you for examination , what would you expect to find ? A. ? The usual indications of arsenical poisoning . All authorities agree that it makes but little difference in what form arsenic is taken or how it gets into the system , as regards the effects produced . If the poison is in liquid form it is more speedily absorbed . It would also have less immediate effect upon the coats of tile stomach than if brought into contact with them in solid form . The symptoms  --  inflammation of the stomach for one  --  are found when arsenio is taken in through the skin by absorption . Q. ? Are you familar with Washburn 's wash used by undertakers upon dead bodies ? Mr. Doolittle  --  There is no evidence that any such preparation was used . Mr. Jones  --  Let us go slow . This fluid , so strong-ly impregnated with arsenic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will show dry particles of arsenic , is used by undertakers . We are prepared to show that the undertaker who handled Jennie Cramer 's remains , a few days before bought five gallons of this mixture , which contained four ounces of arsenic to the gallon . If Jennie Cramer 's body was treated with this mixture it will clear up this whole mystery . The court admitting the question , the witness said that he knew that Washburn 's solution contained arsenic . Q. ? If this solution was used in a place where dead bodies were handled , would there not be danger that a body to which it was not directly applied might take up some of the particles from contact with surfaces impregnated with the arsenic ? A. ? There would unless great care  --  special care  --  was used . Mr. Jones said it was not claimed that the arsenic mixture was applied . The body might have taken up the poison from contact with surfaces where the wash had been employed . Dr. Jewett differed from the medical witnesses on the indications of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not conclusive evidence that violence had been used . Q. ? Mary Stannard had considerable arsenic in her stomach , did n't she ? A. ? Yes , Sir ; eight or nine grains . Q. ? There were no indications of vomiting in her case , were there ? A. ? No . Sir ; it was too heavy to get up . Elia Foissy. a young dress-maker , testified that Blanche Douglass called at the house where she was working on Monday , Aug. 1 , and on Wednesday , Thursday , Friday . and Saturday of the same week to see about a dress the witness was making for her . On Thursday , while she was trying on the dress , a young gentleman called for her . She went to the door to see him and hurried her departure , presumably to go away with him . John J. Du Bois , a lawyer , of this city , testified that he went in bathing frequently at Sevin Rock last Summer , and always noticed that when he floated he was carried eastward from Kelsey 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Out of curiosity he threw peanut shells and sticks off the wharf and found the result the same . Dirs . Lottie E. Brown , a prepossessing blonde , was introduced as a witness to disprove that Blanche Douglass was brought hereto aid in seducing Jennie Cramer . Her testimony was but slightly to the purpose .
