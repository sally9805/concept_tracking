txt The new Anglo-Indian project which has just emanated from the British Foreign Office , if truly reported , is formidably significant in more than one way . In the northern angle of the great Himalaya Mountain wall , at a considerable height above the sea , lies a beautiful and fertile valley 120 miles long , in the midst . of which , on a broad and rapid river , stands the native capital , Serinagur , amid . those " fields of emerald green " that a groat English poet has made familiar to all . This is the famous valley of Cashmere or Kashmir , hitherto ' known to the world chiefly from the celebrated shawls that bear its name , but now , ( if rumor speak truly , ) to be suddenly dragged from its secluded repose , changed from a Hindu principality to a British colony , and peopled with 3,000 , - 000 English immigrants . This is as startling a reversal of England 's previous policy respecting Cashmere as can well be imagined . Far from entertraining the suggestions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again by Anglo-Indian Generals , ( who instinctively cast longing eyes at this splendid natural " standing camp , " where 200,000 men of all arms might enjoy the bracing atmosphere of Northern Europe beneath an Indian sun , ) the British Government has persistently set its face against any idea of acquiring a permanent footing in Cashmere . It has even gone so far as to limit the number of yearly English visitors to the Cashmerian Maharajah 's territory , to forbid any crossing of the border by English subjects without a Government pass , and to prohibit the bringing back into India of native oiKashmiris " without the permission of the Maharajah himself . And now , it would seem , all these guarantees are to be cancelled at one blow , and Cashmere is to become what Scinde became in 1843 or nude and Rohilcund in 1857 . But even morn startling is the reason assigned for this singular change of policy , viz. , the necessity of guarding against the advance of Russia . To guard against an advance of Russia over the Northwestern Himalaya , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are open to her , matches the caution of that prudent old gentleman who took a pair of crutches with him on a foreign tour , in case he should happen to break his leg . But the fact that such a plan should be gravely considered shows plainly what a deep impression Russia 's encroachments in Northern Afghanistan have at length begun to produce . And there can be little doubt that in the event of any serious advance of Russia toward the Indus , a military occupation of Cashmere would indirectly give to England an enormous advantage . With a branch line from the splendid railway system of the Punjaub to the Serinagur Valley , in which a quarter of a million soldiers might be permanently encamped - without overcrowding , England might in three or four days mass upon any point of the western border of India a force which the Russian invader , with the Afghan deserts in his rear and only a single lino of supply from the Caspian to Herat , would be absolutely powerless to resist .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
