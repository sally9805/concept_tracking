I. JEAN BAPTISTE CAMILLE COROT was born in Paris in the year 1796 . His father , a native of Rouen , had been a hair-dresser , but , marrying a milliner , transferred his talents to her service , and in their little shop on the Rue du Bac gradually amassed a snug bit of a fortune . An artist in his way was this elder Corot , and not deprived of such fame as the Muse of Fashion can bestow - advertised in a popular comedy which held the stage of the Fran9ais for years . " I have just come from Corot 's , " cries one of the actors , " but I could not see him . He had retired to his cabinet to compose a bonnet J* la Sicilienne . " Meanwhile Camille was at school in Rouen , where he remained seven years and gained the whole of his education . From school he went to a cloth-merchant 's shop in the Rue de Richelieu , and here eight years were passed . Then his love for art broke through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent with an old friend of his father 's in long walks beside the borders of the Seine ; and later the unwilling " dry-goods clerk " found solace in summer days at Ville d'Avray , where his people had a little country home . A love for nature was thus gradually fostered in a soul which by birth was peculiarly receptive ; and we read of long night-watches at his bedroom window filled with vague poetic musings , visions of nymphs , and aspirations towards some more congenial tool than the yardstick . Indeed , the brush was soon the yardstick 's rival . An easel was set up in the humble bedroom ; a sketch-book was always in hand out-of-doors ; and lithographic stones and sheets of scribbled paper strewed the merchant 's counter , underneath which they retired with Corot during the pause between one customer and the next . A casual acquaintance with the young painter Michallon brought about the crisis long deferred by Camille 's sweet and docile temper . The tale is the old one of loud parental opposition , but is not followed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there was nothing else to do , Corot Je " re made a rather sharp bargain with his son , but stuck to it ever after in good faith , if for thirty years with no slightest mitigation of its sharpness .

But if you insist upon painting , you will have no capital to dispose of as long as I live . I will make you a pension of fifteen hundred francs . Do n't count upon ever having more , but see whether you can pull yourself through with that . " And Camille , " much moved , " fell upon the neck of the artist in Sicilian caps : " A thousand thanks ! It is all I FOREST OF FONTAINFBLEAU . ( OWNED BY MRS. 5. 0 .

Encouragement first came from brush and set himself down before the first Aligny , who , surprising him at work on a thing he saw - a view of the Cit6 from a spot study of the Coliseum , declared that it had near the Pont Royal . " The girls from my qualities of the first value - exactness , skillful father 's shop , " he said in later life , " used to run treatment , and an air of style .

XXXVJII. - 34 . VIEW OF THE COLISEUM , EOME. ( owNEo BY EEWIN OAVIS. ) // Netherlands . In 1874 the widowed sister with whom he had lived for many years died , and his own health broke down . And on the 23d of February , 1875 , his spirit passed away . This is notmuch to tell of a life which lasted seventy-nine years ; but it is all there is to be said about Corot 's , except as it was bound up with his art . He never married , for , he said , he had a wife already - a little fairy called Imagination , who came at his call and vanished when he did not need her . He lived chiefly at Ville d'Avray , with always a Jied-tferre and studio in Paris , and mixed in no society but that of his brother artists . II . IN 1833 Corot got a minor medal for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention of his name that can be traced in print is where Alfred de Musset , writing of the Salon of 1836 in the " Revue des Deux Mondes , " speaks of " Corot , whose Roman Campagna has its admirers . " The next year Gustave Planche praised a " St. Jerome , " which now hangs ( the gift of Corot ) in the little church at Ville d'Avray . In 1846 he was decorated for a scene in the forest of Fontainebleau . In 1855 he received a first class medal , and in 1867 , oddly enough , one of the second class , but accompanied by the higher decoration of the Legion of Honor ; and year by year artists and critics were louder in his praise . But the public was long in learning the fact that he even existed , and his father was quite as long in believing that his art was really art . When the first decoration came , " Tell me , " he said to one of Corot 's comrades , " has Camille actually any talent ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best of us all " ; nevertheless he doubled his pension . Fifty years old when he thus achieved an income of six hundred dollars , Corot was sixty before any one bought his pictures , save now and then a brother artist . When the first customer departed with his purchase , " Alas ! " he cried in humorous despair , " my collection has been so long complete , and now it is broken ! " And when others followed he could hardly believe them serious , or be induced to set prices on his work . " It is worth such and such a sum ; but no one will give that , and I will not sell it for less . I can give my things away if I see fit , but I can not degrade my art by selling them below their value . " When he actually dared to price one at ten thousand francs , and heard that it had been sold , he was sure he had dropped a zero in marking the figures , and wrote to the Salon secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his works was held at the H6tel Drouot in i858 he ac cused his friends of kindly cheating because it brought him $2846 ; yet there were thirtyeight pictures , and among them five of great importance . Fortunately , Corot lived long enough to see the prices he thought no one would pay increased twenty-fold at public sales . A picture he had sold for 700 francs went many years later in the auction-room for 12,000 , and Corot " swam in happiness , " for , he felt , " it is not I that have changed , but the constancy of my principles that has triumphed . " Never , indeed , did artist pursue his own path with a steadier disregard of public praise ; and rarely has an artist so persistently neglected lived to enjoy his fame so long . It is a record to set against Millet 's for the reviving of faith in the justice of Heaven . Yet even had Corot died at seventy-nine without seeing a ray of the coming aureole , we can fancy no despairing exit . Material cares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the merry heart that goes all the day with less discomfort than a somber spirit finds in the first mile or two . The fact of living and the act of painting were almost enough for him , and the appreciation of a few brother artists filled his cup . We read of seasons of brief discouragement , and there were tears in his eyes sometimes when he came home from a Salon where his pictures were obscurely placed and he had overheard a scoffing phrase . But a look at his easel soon brought comfort , and the darling children of his hand were there in a " complete collection " to assure him that he had not lived in vain . " It must be confessed , " he once exclaimed , " that if painting is a folly it is a sweet one - one that should excite envy , not forgiveness . Study my looks and my health and I defy any one to find a trace of those cares , ambitions , and remorseful thoughts which ravage the features of so many unfortunate folk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and contentment and even health to him who knows how to regulate his life ? " But just here was Corot 's talisman , shared , alas , with how few ! He knew how to regulate his life , and knew that it meant to live for his painting and to paint for himself . In his young days he was the livelies/t among the lively . Tall of stature and herculean in build , possessed of perfect health , high spirits , and a gentle temper , student balls and studio suppers were his delight , and he was the delight of their frequenters . Yet wherever he was he never failed to disappear forawhile at 9 o'clock , when Ai belle dame , as he called his mother , awaited him for a hand at cards . In his old age he was " Papa Corot " to the whole artist world of Paris - no one more respected , more beloved and cherished ; no one so ready with // z H 0 0 H // a helping hand full of money , a helping tongue full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his interest in the world outside his art was never very great . He often bought books from the stalls along the quays , but merely for the sake of their l'de I must write , the French word means so much more - to kill people and destroy the face of nature and the works of man . " Compare the savage hate of war with art , which at the bottom means simply love ! " Yet with the instinct of a patriot he came back to Paris qwq // ( loved , let me emphasize the characteristic word ) - this was the last day he was seen in public , and even then he was nervous , weak , and broken . Dropsy was the final stage of his disease , and he foresaw the fatal end . " I am almost resigned , " he said to his pupil Fran*ais , watching by his bed , " but it is not easy , and I have been a long time getting to the point . Yet I have no reason to complain of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for seventyeight years , and have been able to do nothing but paint for fifty . My family were honest folk . I have had good friends , and think I never did harm to any one . My lot in life has been excellent . Far from reproaching fate , I can only be grateful . I must go - I know it ; but do n't want to believe it . In spite of myself there is a little bit of hope left in me . " The next day he asked for a priest , saying his father had done so , and he wished to die like his father . But his last thought was for his art . His feeble fingers believed they held a brush , and he exclaimed , " See how beautiful it is ! I have never seen such beautiful landscapes . " And then he died . At his funeral the great church was more than full , and the crowd spread through the streets outside . Faure sang his requiem to an air Corot had himself selected - the slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open grave M. de Chennevi*res , Director of the Beaux Arts , spoke about him in touching words : " All the youth of Paris loved him , for he loved youth , and his talent was youth eternally new . . . And in his immortal works he praised God in his skies and birds and trees . " As the last phrase was spoken , we are told , a linnet perched on a branch near by and burst into a gush of song ; and when in i88o a monument to the beloved great painter who talked so often of " mes feul/les ci mes pefits olseaux " was set up by his brethren on the border of the little lake at Ville d'Avray , the sculptor carved on it the branch and the singing bird . Iii . EVERY one knows that Corot was a landscape painter with an especial love for the neighborhoods of Ville d'Avray and for effects of springtime foliage and early morning or evening light . But it is a great mistake to think of him as confined to such effects , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all hours of the day and now and then moonlight too , and all seasons of the year save those when snow lies on the ground . Figures enliven nearly all his landscapes . Sometimes they are peasants laboring in wood or field ; more often classic nymphs or dancers in surroundings that reveal his memories of southern scenes ; and occasionally the characters of some antique fable . Twice , for instance , Corot painted Orpheus and once Silenus , Diana at the bath , Homer with a group of shepherds , Democritus , Daphne and Chloe , Biblis , and Virgil serving as a guide to Dante . Sacred history likewise attracted him . Nothing he produced is more remarkable than the " St. Sebastian " now in Baltimore ; and he often drew upon the life of Christ and the stories of the Old Testament . He also painted flowers , and still-life subjects and interiors ; many street and distant city views ; animals ; large draped figures and studies of the nude , and no less than forty portraits . Mural decoration he es* sayed whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so often as he wished . In his later years he etched some delightfully characteristic plates . And whoever glanced through his sketch-book or his letters saw that nothing which had met his eye had appealed to his hand in vain . But the grossest misconception with regard to Corot is not the one which ignores his width of range . It is a much more serious mistake to believe that because he " idealized " nature he did not represent her faithfully , because he suppressed details he did not see or could not render them , because his maturer work looks " very free " he had not studied conscientiously . Nothing so afflicts a real student of Corot as to hear him called an exponent of superficiality or " dash . " If ever a man worked hard at his art it was Corot . The number of his preparatory studies was immense , and they were made in his latest as well as his earliest years . " Conscience " was his watch-word , the nickname his scholars gave him , the one recipe he gave them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first thing to produce , he said , were " studies in submission " ; later came the time for studies in picture-making . He did not approve of academies and schools , and deemed it enough to study the old masters with the eye , without much attempt at actual copying . He thought the great school of nature might suffice to form soul and sight and hand ; but this school one should never desert and could not frequent too diligently . It is true , as a friend once said , that what Corot wanted to paint was " not so much nature as his love for her . " But to love her meant to peruse her with patient care , to know her well and fully ; and to paint his love meant not to alter her charm , but to bring into clear relief those elements therein which most appealed to him . Individuality in art no man prized more highly . But he defined it as " the individual expression of a truth " ; and said // qwq // had worked together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controlling value ? No : the real lesson taught by Corot 's pictures and Corot 's life is that breadth in painting ( if it is not meaningless and empty ) must repose on accurate knowledge ; that freedom ( if it is not mere idle license ) must have its basis in fidelity to facts ; that feeling must be guided by reason and self-restraint . Corot 's knowledge of natural facts - within the cycle of such scenes as he preferred to paint - was greater probably than that of any painter who has everlived , except Th6odore Rousseau ; and the loving patience of his efforts to express it has never been surpassed . These are the reasons why he could permit himself to be the most free and personal and poetic of all landscape painters . iv . " TRUTH , " said Corot , " is the first thing in art and the second and the third . " But the whole truth can not be told at once . A selection from the mass of nature 's truths is what the artist shows - a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make them clearly felt . You can not paint summer and winter on a single canvas . No two successive hours of a summer 's day are just alike , and you can not paint them both . Nor , as certainly , can you paint everything you see at the chosen moment . Crowd in too much and you spoil the picture , weaken the impression , conceal your meaning , falsify everything in the attempt to be too true . This was Corot 's creed . What now were the truths that he interpreted at the necessary sacrifice of others which were less important in his eyes ? They are implied , I think , in the words I have already written . Corot prized effects rather than what the non-artistic world calls solid facts . But effects are as truly facts as are the individual features and details which make them . Indeed , they are the most essential as well as interesting of all facts . It is effects that we see first when we are in nature 's presence , that impress us most , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modeling , local colors , minor details - these shift , appear , and disappear , or alter vastly as light and shadow change ; and most of them we never really see at all until we take time to analyze . Look at the same scene on a sunny morning or by cloudy sunset light . It is not the same scene . The features are the same , but their effect has changed , and this means a new landscape , a novel picture . The mistake of too many modern painters , especially in England , is that they paint from analysis , not from sight . They paint the things they know are there , not the things they perceive just as they perceive them . This Corot never did . He studied VOL . XXXVIII. - 35. analytically and learned all he could about solid facts ; but he painted synthetically - omitting many things that he knew about , and even many that he saw at the moment , in order to portray more clearly the general result . And this general result he found in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dominant tone ; in the broad relationships of one mass of color with all others ; in the aspect of the sky , the character of the atmosphere , and the play of light ; and in the palpitating incessant movement of sky and air and leaf . Look at one of Corot 's foregrounds and you will see whether it is soft or hard , xvet with dew or dry in the sun : you will see its color , its mobility . Look at his trees , and you will see their mass , their diversities in denseness , their pliability and vital freshness . Look at his sky , and you will see its shimmering , pulsating quality : it has the softness of a blue which means vast depths of distance , or of a gray which means layer upon layer of imponderable mist , and the whiteness of clouds which shine as bright as pearls but would dissipate at a touch . And everywhere , over all , behind all , in all , you will see the enveloping air and the light which infiltrates this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which make all things what they are , which create the landscape by creating its color , its expression , its effect ; the air and the light which are the movement , the spirit , the very essence of nature . No man had ever perfectly painted the atmosphere till Corot did it , or the diffused , pervading quality of light ; and for this reason no one had painted such delicate , infinite distances , such deep , luminous , palpitating skies . See now how Corot managed to paint like this - to interpret the life , mood , and meaning of the scene he drew . It was just through that process of omission and suppression which the superficial misread as proof that he did not really " render " nature at all . Even the smallest , simplest natural fact can not be " rendered " in the sense of being literally reproduced ; and to attempt the literal imitation of large features is merely to sacrifice the whole in favor of what must remain but a partial rendering of a part . A leaf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once ; we are soon forced to generalize , condense , suppress . And to try to paint too many leaves is to lose the tree ; for the tree is not a congregation of countless individual leaves distinctly seen - it is a mass of leaves which are shot through and through with light and air , and always more or less merged together and moving . It is an entity , and a live one ; and which is the more important - that we should see the living thing , or the items that compose it ? What we ask the painter is , not just how his tree was // constructed , but just how it looked as a feature in the beauty and aliveness of the scene . What we want is its general effect and the way it harmonized with the effect of its surroundings . Does it matter , then , if he omits many things , or even if he alters some things , to get this right result ? Such altering is not falsifying . It is merely emphasis - a stress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all facts can not possibly be given ) the accented fact shall at least be plain . The generalized structure of Corot 's trees , their blurred contours and flying , feathery spray - these are not untruths . They are merely compromises with the stern necessities of paint - devices he employed , not because he was unable to draw trees with precision , but because , had he done this , his foliage would have been too solid and inert for truth . A twig is never long in one position . It can not be painted in two positions at once . But a twig that is blurred to the eye because it is passing from one position to another - this can be painted , and this Corot preferred to paint rather than ramifications with exactness or leaf-outlines with a narrow care . So his trees are alive , and , as he loved to say , the light can reach their inmost leaves and the little birds can fly among their branches . It is the same thing with color . The color schemes to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we find with some of his contemporaries and many of his successors . Browns and grays and pale greens predominate on his canvas with rarely an acuter accent , a louder note . But he fitted his themes to his brush , so that we feel no lack ; or , in other words , he chose his color schemes in accordance with the character of the natural effects that he loved best . And within the scale he chose his coloring is perfect . His tone ( the harmony , or , as used to be said , the " keeping " of his result ) is admirable beyond praise . But it is gained at no sacrifice of truth in local color . There are cheap processes for securing tone which are indeed falsifications of nature - ways of carrying over into one object the color of another , throwing things out of their right relationships , harmonizing with some universal gauze of brown or gray . But Corot 's was not a process like any of these . His power to harmonize and unify his colors sprung from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penetrating eye than ever before had been brought to bear , and never forgot their mutual relationships . Look at one of his pictures where the general effect , perhaps , is of soft delicious lA conspicuous example of what is meant by the falsification of values may be seen in photographs taken by any of the usual processes . Chemical action deals differently with different colors , so that a light yellow , for instance , comes out darker than a dark blue . The greens . Everything in it is not greenish . The sky is pure blue and the clouds are purest white . The water is rightly related to the sky , and where things were gray in nature , or brown , or even black , they are so on canvas . Harmony does not mean monotony . Tone does not mean untruth . And this Corot could accomplish because he studied " values " as no painter before him had studied them . This word - new in our language but indispensable - has been a little hard of comprehension to those who know nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means , as simply as I can say it , the difference between given colors as severally compared with the highest note in the scale ( white ) and the lowest ( black ) ; the difference between them as containing , so to speak , more light or more dark . This does not mean the same thing as the relative degrees of illumination and shadow which may fall upon them . The one quality may be involved in or dependent upon the other , but the two are distinct to the painter 's eye . It is not easy even to perceive differences in value . Given two shades of the same tint , as of a blue-green or a yellow-green , it is easy enough to say which is the darker ; but it is more difficult when a yellow-green is compared with a blue-green , and still more when we set a brown beside a green or a blue beside a yellow . Yet the painter must not only learn to see values in nature but to transpose them correctly on canvas-for color can never be exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must always be transposition , adaptation , compromise . Corot mastered the difficulty as no one else had done ; and this mastery has made him the guide and teacher of all the landscape painters who have since been born.1 V. " THERE are four things for a painter , " Corot was wont to say . " These are : form , which he gets through drawing ; color , which results from truth to values ; sentiment , which is born of the received impression ; and finally the execution , the rendering of the whole . As to myselg I think I have sentiment ; that is , a little poetry in the soul which leads me to see , or to complete what I see , in a certain way . But I have not always color , and I possess only imperfect elements of the power to draw . In execution I also fail sometimes - which is the reason why I labor harder than ever , little though some people may imagine it . " trouble has been obviated in some of the newer methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is of vast importance in all translations into black and white . In nothing has the success of American wood-engravers been more remarkable than in this . // In accepting these words about himself we must make allowance for that spirit of aspiration which always leads a true artist to remember his ideal as better than the best possible rendering . It is natural that Corot should have thought he often failed to get his values right , although the world gradually saw that he had at least come nearer right than any one before him ; and of course he knew that he had not even attempted many schemes and scales of color which he perceived in the actual world . As regards his power to draw he spoke with stricter verity . A lifetime of study in the woods and fields had enabled him to draw landscapes fully and exactly when he chose , and some of his portrait-heads are wonderfully true . But in our modern world schools alone can give scientific knowledge of the figure ; and for the lack of this Corot 's figures are weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delightful in color and sentiment . It is the same with his execution . Born at a time when few painters painted really well , and trained almost wholly by his own efforts , he is not one of the supreme masters of the brush - one of those whose every line and touch delights the connoisseur in handling . But he painted well enough to express with charm as well as clearness the impressions he received ; and as these were the impressions of a very great and individual artist , the verdict is still a high one . Had his growth been assisted by stronger outside influences he would doubtless have reached technical skill more quickly , and perhaps have conquered it more completely ; but something of the personality of his manner might have perished . So we are content with his technical shortcomings , and after all they are far from serious . Although a few men have painted landscapes still more beautifully , Corot 's surely satisfy the eye while delighting and moving the soul . If but a single phrase of Corot 's had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentiment in art is a poetic power to see things or to complete them in some personal way . Here the whole import of idealism in art lies crystallized in a word . Not to depart from nature , but to complete her , is the true idealization ; not to conceive an ideal foreign to her own , but to perceive her own with so much sympathy that it can be more perfectly revealed than , on this imperfect earth , she herself is often able to reveal it ; not to be untrue to fact , but to choose and arrange particular facts so that the type , the ideal , towards which they tend shall be most clearly shown . The whole world prizes such work as this when itis the poet 's or even the figure-painter 's . Why is it so often disallowed when the landscape painter brings it ? A drama of Shak spere 's never happened , yet we feel it is truer than any literally reported scene of the policecourt , or " realistic " stage-play or novel . The character of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of his daily deeds ; why , then , is not the aspect of a landscape a higher fact than any of its details ? More significant than any individual character , again , is the essence of human nature ; why , then , does not the essence of some kind or type of natural beauty mean more and purer truth than the aspect of any one actual spot ? Must not an artist see broadly , synthetically , if he is to show us general aspects ? And must he not see imaginatively , poetically ,  --  must he not " complete " what he sees ,  --  if he is to search out and render the ideal therein suggested ? All his interpretations must be based on facts which he has observed in this place or that ; but to make a good picture and a true one he need not confine himself to facts which he has chanced to see together . Very likely Corot never painted a scene without omitting some features and adding others ; and in more than one of his works there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But there is never disharmony in the result , for his knowledge was too great and his imagination too artistic - which means too logical and too sympathetic . He made no mere patchwork pictures . He created landscapes of his own out of the elements with which , in nature 's presence , he had stored his sketch-books and his memory . He might alter a scene - he did not alter nature . He but completed the beautiful message she had been suggesting here and half revealing there . It is easy to prove that Corot 's painted poetry was true - much truer than the realist 's painted prose . We have only to consult our own experience with him as an interpreter of nature . Here and there , at home or abroad , we may recognize some scene which some realist has faithfully portrayed ; but Corot 's scenes are everywhere - by the little lakes and brooks of France , in the forest glens of Italy , in the misty glades of England , and along the river borders of our own far western world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but certain broad beauties and moods of nature ; and though we may rarely be able to put a finger on dociimentary proof of his veracity , we carry it about with us in a new sensitiveness of eye , a new receptiveness of mood . Everywhere , I say , we see from time to time some beautiful living Corot ; but should we see it so quickly or would it seam so beautiful had he not taught us how to value it ? The commonplace painter shows us things that we had seen and felt in the same way ourselves . The true artist selects more delicate yet more general facts , explains // them with poetic stress , shows us things which vi . probably we had not remarked before , and qwq // accented , explained , " completed " by a great artist 's soul and sight and touch . The " Orpheus " was painted in i86i , and in i866 the splendid " Danse des Amours , " which is also in New York , owned by Mr. Charles A. Dana - a surpassingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We need not ask whether this wood is of France or Italy , whether this little temple and these gracious , buoyant figures were painted from fact or fancy . It is the true ideal world - the world of actual nature , but seen in one of its most beautiful aspects , peopled by joyous figures , and with all its fair suggestions amplified and fulfilled . The " Dante and Virgil " in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts is much less complete and magnificent than these , and it shows too clearly Corot 's shortcomings as a draughtsman : the tigers crouching at the poet 's feet were sketched in by Barye , but his outlines were lost in the painting . Nevertheless , the work is admirable as a whole and most interesting in sentiment - more strongly dramatic than any other Corot I have seen . Seldom has Dante been shown so nearly as he must have looked when , as the Florentine children said , he went down into hell . The " Lake Nemi , " the " Landscape with Cattle , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all in the Morgan collection . The " Nemi " seems to be a picture which , we are told , was painted at Ville d'Avray , but afterwards recast as a memory of the nymphhaunted southland . Its sky is a marvel . The " Wood-gatherers " is one of Corot 's very latest works , shown at the last Salon held before his death . The tone is brown and rather dark and the handling very summary ; but it has great strength and dignity , and impressive sentiment . In default of an " Orpheus , " for example , it is a good Corot for the American public to possess . The placid , sunny little river landscape , with cattle , is a good type of many of Corot 's smaller works . Its sky and its distance are its chief beauties , and no distance , no sky , could be lovelier . The " View of the Coliseum " is a much earlier work . It is deeper and stronger in tone , more solid in handling , more dignified in composition - an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poetic " Orpheus " as proof that Corot 's range in art was not a narrow one . Thus , it appears , there are Corots in America of the very highest quality ; and , indeed , this list of them might be greatly lengthened . Mr. Jay Gould in New York owns a " Danse des . Nymphes " only less admirable than the " Danse des Amours . " In the collection of Mr. Quincy Shaw at Brookline , Massachusetts , are several perfect examples , representing different epochs from almost the very earliest . And in a hundred other American galleries hang Corots of more or less distinction . With the best , of course , there are many not so good , and others , alas , which are Corot 's only in name . A superficial eye is easily deceived by imitations of Corot 's slighter works , and such have been foisted on the public , abroad as well as here , in considerable numbers . But a really fine Corot has qualities beyond the reach of any plagiaristqualities of truth on the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no risk of seeing a fictitious " St. Sebastian " or a " Danse des Amours " which shall deceive a true lover of Corot. vii . To understand Corot 's influence on art and artists we must recall the times when his work began . The formalizing , pseudo-classic tendencies of the school of David had just lost their sovereignty . The " romantic " reaction was in its lusty youth under the leadership of G*ricault and Delacroix . The fetters of academic tradition were loosened ; freedom in thought and practice was proclaimed for every painter ; the modern spirit of inquiry and inventiveness , the modern gospel of individuality , were daily winning new disciples . Oddly enough , as it now seems to us , the first fresh impulse in the field of landscape came from across the Channel : certain pictures by Constable and Bonington , exhibited in Paris , gave the first hint that landscape , too , might be painted in free and varied fashions , and made the medium for expressing simple local beauties and personal ideas . But the fact is easilyexplained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a memory of Claude and Poussin , while in England the old Dutch masters - so much more simple , naive , yet modern in their feeling - had never been lost to sight . Now the hint from England led Frenchmen back to the art of Holland , and its fructifying influence soon showed in France as it has never yet shown in England . Almost instantly a new school was born , a new development begana school and a development which we must call the noblest and completest that modern painting counts . Georges Michel was one of the very first to feel the new impulse . But he seems a survivor of the old Dutch school rather than a leader in the school of France  --  a weaker brother of Ruysdael , not his modernized descendant ; a forerunner , not a fellow of Rousseau , Corot , Troyon , Millet , and Dupr6 . Paul Huet was another innovator , but he is better known to us by the influence he had in his time than by his actual work . Rousseau was the first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost on a line with Rousseau stands Corot . It is difficult to say just in how far Corot was formed by this influence or by that . Bonington 's spirit seems very near akin to his - Mr. Henry Adams in Washington owns a little Bonington which might almost pass for a comparatively early Corot . But there can be no question as of teacher and scholar in the case . Corot can have had no more than a mere glimpse of Bonington 's work , and his own was at once immeasurably wider , deeper , and more subtile . For Rousseau he had an immense admiration ; but their natures were wholly unlike , and the longer they lived the further apart grew the lines on which they labored . We can say no more of Corot than that the hint of naturalism he got from England , the draught of classicism he imbibed from his first teachers and from the air of Italy , and the Dutch lesson of simplicity and sobriety , germinated and grew together in his soul while eye and hand were training themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any weighing of the intrinsic merits of Corot and his great contemporaries . Odious in most connections , a process of definite comparison is nowhere so detestable as when applied to mighty artists . It is a sin against the first law of computation we were taught at schoolit is an effort to reckon with unrelated quantities . It is as though we took an apple from a pile of peaches and declared the number of peaches less , or compared an apple with a fig to explain its rank among apples , or gauged the breadth of one stream by the depth of another . We may like best the peach or the fig or the apple and confidently declare our liking . But when it comes to comparisons , they should be of figs with figs , of Corots with Corots . To be an artist means to be individual ; and individuality can be tested only by its own standard . A Corot is none the worse whatever Rousseau or Troyon may have painted ; and it would be none the better had its creator been the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standpoint the case is different . If we may not rightly ask of two great contemporaries which was the greater , we may very rightly ask which was the more typical of his time , the more influential upon the world of art . From this point of view Corot seems to me the most significant figure in his generation . Personal , individual , as were all his brethren ; boldly , beautifully , as they all preached the gospel of freedom and freshness in art , none except Millet was quite so personal , none quite so fresh as Corot ; and to an individuality as strong as 1'Iillet 's he added other qualities all his own . No art of the time is so complex as Corot 's , and its complexity gives it peculiar value to those who look deeper than the surface of paint . No one departed further from that mock classicism which means academic formality , bloodless self-suppression ; yet no one then alive or now alive has done so much to prove the persistent value of true classicism . David tried for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the great apostle of modernness and personality , caught its spirit while casting utterly away its form . A Greek of the time of Pericles might easily prefer his paintings to any others we could show him : yet how thoroughly French they are ; and yet , again , how close they lie to the heart of the American of to-day . There is still another point in Corot 's supremacy . The profound and accurate study of values - the knowledge how to keep tone perfect and yet keep color complete and true - is the greatest technical achievement of modern times . Here Corot led all his rivals , and therefore he has become the leader and teacher of all younger painters . In many ways they have carried his lesson further than he went himself . To paint things truthfully in the open air means to-day tasks of a variety and difficulty which Corot never essayed , results of a vividness and splendor he never achieved . But the whole development rests on his own . He was the first great " impressionist , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes we - and perhaps they themselves - forget the fact ; for there is one great point of difference between him and most of his sons in art . He was a poet on canvas , and most of them are speakers of prose . It is their fashion to rave about " realism , " to despise idealismto exalt the mere facts they chance to see above the greater fact which Corot divined and gave . But , do what they will , the best among them are more idealistic than they think ; and , say what they will , the world will never agree to rank the reporter above the poet . For the great body of lovers and students of art Corot 's supreme merit is that he was the most poetic soul among those who have ever painted landscapes ; and his chief value as a teacher is that he showed so well what poetry in painting means . Too many have thought it meant the effort to do with color the same thing that a writer does with words , and have lost the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Corot the picture is the first considerationbeautiful forms , beautiful tones , beautiful expression with the brush . The poetry is an infusion merely , an intangible essence breathed from the soul of the maker . Perhaps the time will come when Corot 's teaching as regards this point will be more generally heeded than it is to-day . But , of course , conscious effort can not determine the fact . Any painter can // learn much from Corot in the way of technical secrets ; no one can learn from him how to idealize nature except a man who , like himself , chances to be born with a poet 's heart ; and we can do no more than hope that all new poets who may be born to paint shall be souls of Corot 's sort . But we must indeed hope this ; for what the world needs just now are not mournful temperaments , reading into nature the sorrow of the human race , but apostles of the joy and peace which those who seek can always find in her , valiant yet tender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . VIII . THE more we study Corot 's art the more we love the man who stands behind it ; and I have dwelt at some length on the record of his life because it completes the revelation of a strong and serious will , of perseverance , modesty , and self-reliance , of noble desires , unfailing courage , sincerity , and loving-kindness . It is a little the fashion nowadays to think of artists as excusing themselves , on the strength of being artists , from the duties and virtues we demand of commoner clay . It is too much our way to think of them as eccentric , egotistic , nervously excitable or morbidly sensitive , at odds with a prosaic world and often at odds with themselves- pushed one way by the artistic impulse , pulled another by mere human loves and obligations . We think too often of them thus to pardon or condemn them according as we value art or care little for it as a factor in the progress and aspiration of the world . Corot 's story is of priceless value as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more because it is not an exceptional story . Men like Corot , in all the essentials of what even a pharisaical world would call good conduct , have never been rare among artists and are not rare to-day ; nor men as courageous and persevering in disappointment , as simple , modest , and laborious in success . As was Corot , so , in a more or less marked degree , were almost all the great painters and sculptors of his great time . Not all of them could be so cheery and happy , but most of them were as single-minded in their devotion to art , as generous and sincere in their dealings with their fellows . Let me make a good ending now with a few more words from Corot 's lips : " Do we know how to render the sky , a tree , or water ? No ; we can only try to give its appearance , try to translate it by an artifice which we must always seek to perfect . For this reason , although I do not know my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go further . Sometimes some one says : You know your business and do n't need to study more . ' But none of that , I say ; we always need to learn . . . . Try to conquer the qualities you do not possess , but above all obey your own instinct , your own way of seeing . This is what I call conscience and sincerity . Do not trouble yourself about anything else , and you will have a good chance of being happy and of doing well . " AL C. van Rensselaer.
