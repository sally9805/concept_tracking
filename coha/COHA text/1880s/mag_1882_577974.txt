CHARLES DARWIN . To-DAY , while all that was mortal of Charles Darwin is borne to its last resting-place in Westminster Ahbey , by the side of Sir Isaac Newton , it seems a fitting occasion to utter a few words of tribute to the memory of the beautiful and glorious life that has just passed away from us . Though Mr. Darwin had more than completed his threescore and ten years , and though his life had been rich in achievement and crowned with success such as is but seldom vouchsafed to man , yet the news of his death has none the less impressed us with a sense of sudden and premature bereavement . For on the one hand the time would never have come when those of us who had learned the inestimable worth of such a teacher and friend could have felt ready to part with him ; and on the other hand Mr. Darwin was one whom the gods , for love of him , had endowed with perpetual youth , so that his death could never seem otherwise than premature . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youth - say from the fifteenth to the twenty-second year - is , with most men , the only availal ? le period for acquiring the intellectual habits and amassing the stores of knowledge that are to form their equipment for the work of a life-time ; but in the case of men of the highest order this period is simply a period of seven years , neither more nor less valuable than any other seven years . There is , now and then , a mind - perhaps one in four or five millions - which in early youth thinks the thoughts of mature manhood , and which in old age retains the flexibility , the receptiveness , the keen appetite for new impressions , that are characteristic of the fresh season of youth . Such a mind as this was Mr. Darwin 's . To the last he was eager for new facts and suggestions , to the last he held his judgments in readiness for revision ; and to this unfailing freshness of spirit was joined a sagacity which , naturally great , had been refined and strengthened by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come to be almost superhuman . When we remember how Alexander von Humboldt began at the age of seventyfive to write his Iosmos , and how he lived to turn off in his ninetieth year the fifth bulky volume of that prodigiously learned book , - when we remember this , and consider the great scientific value of the monographs which Mr. Darwin has lately been publishing almost every year , we must feel that it is in a measure right to speak of his death as premature . After all , however , no one can fail to recognize in the career of Mr. Darwin the interest that belongs to a complete and well-rounded tale . When the extent of his work is properly estimated , it is not too much to say that among all the great leaders of human thought that have ever lived there are not half a dozen who have achieved so much as he . In an age that has been richer than any preceding age in great scientific names , his name is indisputably the foremost . He has already found his place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Descartes , and Newton . And among thinkers of the first order of originality , he has been peculiarly fortunate in having lived to see all the fresh and powerful minds of a new generation adopting his fundamental conceptions , and pursuing their inquiries along the path which he was the first to break . When Mr. Darwin was born , in 1809 , the name which he inherited was already a famous name . Dr. Erasmus Darwin , the friend of Priestley and Watt , and author of the Botanic Garden , was // servedly ranked among the most ingenions and original thinkers of the eighteenth century in England . His brother , Robert Waring Darwin , was the author of a work on botany which for many years enjoyed high repute . Of the sons of Erasmus , one , Sir Francis Darwin , was noted as a keen observer of animals ; another , Charles , who died at the age of twenty-one from a dissection wound , had already written a medical essay of such importance as to give his name a place in biographical dictionaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinction as a physician , married a daughter of the celebrated Josiah Wedgwood , and became the father of the immortal discoverer who has just been taken away ' from us . While citing these remarkable instances of inherited ability , it may be of interest to mention also that among the cousins of Mr. Darwin who have become more or less distinguished in our own time are Mr. Hensleigh Wedgwood , the philologist , the late Sir Henry Holland , and Mr. Francis Galton , whose excellent treatise on hereditary Genius is known to every one . iNor can it be irrelevant to add that one of Mr. Darwin 's sons has already , through his study of the tides , achieved some remarkable results , which seem likely to give him a high place among the astronomers of the present day . There is one thing which a man of original scientific or philosophical genius in a rightly ordered world should never he called upon to do . He should never be called upon to " earn a living ; " for that is a wretched waste of energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffer serious detriment , and runs the risk of being frittered away into hopeless ruin , Like his great predecessor and ally , Sir Charles Lyell , Mr. Darwin was so favored by fortune as to be free from this odious necessity . He was able to devote his whole life with a single mind to the pursuit of scientific truth , and to ministering in the most exalted way to the welfare of his fellow-creatures . After taking his Master 's degree at Cambridge in 1831 , at the age of twenty-two , an opportunity was offered Mr. Darwin for studying natural history on a grand scale . The Beagle , a ten-gun brig under the command of Captain Fitz Roy , was about to start on a long voyage , " to complete the survey of Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego , . . . to survey the shores of Chili , Peru , and of some islands in the Pacific , and to carry a chain of chronometrical measurements round the world . " As Captain Fitz Roy had expressed a wish to have a naturalist accompany the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lords of the Admiralty readily accepted , - a fact which in itself is sufficient evidence of the reputation for scientific attainments which Mr. Darwin had already gained at that youthful age . This memorable voyage , which lasted five years , was very fruitful in results . The general history of the voyage , with an account of such observations in natural history as seemed likely to interest the ordinary reader , is to be found in the Journal of Researches published by Mr. Darwin some three years after his return to England . This book immediately acquired a great popularity , which it has retained to this day , having gone through at least thirteen editions ; and it is certainly one of the most fascinating books of travel that was ever written . " The author , " said the Quarterly Review , in December , 1839 , " is a firstrate landscape painter with the pen , and the dreariest solitudes are made to teem with interest . " An abridgment of this charming journal , lately published with illustrations , under the title What Mr. Darwin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a favorite book for boys and girls . The scientific results of Mr. Darwin 's voyage in the Beagle were so volumi // nous that it required several years and the assistance of many able hands to record them all . Owen , Hooker , Waterhouse , Berkeley , Bell , and other eminent naturalists took part in the publication of these results , which formed a very important contribution to the zoiilogy and botany , and to the pal*ontology , of the countries visited in the course of the voyage . To this great series of volumes , which appeared between 1840 and 1846 , Mr. Darwin contributed three from his own hand , - the work on Volcanic Islands , the Geological Observations on South America , and the famous essay on Coral Reefs . In this latter work Mr. Darwin proved that through gradual submergence fringing-reefs are developed into barrier-reefs , and these again into atolls or lagoon-islands ; and thus he not only for the first time rendered comprehensible the work of coral-building , but threw a new and wonderful light upon the movements of elevation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus bringing the work of the corals into its direct relationship with volcanic phenomena , Mr. Darwin succeeded in presenting " a grand and harmonious picture of the movements which the crust of the earth has undergone within a late period ; " and the result was undoubtedly one of the most brilliant contributions to geology that has been made since the first publication of the great work of Sir Charles Lyell . In 1851-53 Mr. Darwin published a Monograph of the Cirripedia , in two volumes octavo , and accompanied this about the same time , with monographs of the various fossil genera of cirripeds ( or barnacle family ) in Great Britain . In recognition of his solid and brilliant achievements , Mr. Darwin in 1853 received the royal medal from the Royal Society , and in 1859 the Wollaston medal from the Geological Society . By this time his name had come to be known in all parts of the *mvilized world , and he was already Charles Darwn*. 837 ranked among the foremost living naturalists , so that when , in the year 1859 , the Origin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention by reason of the eminence of its author . I well remember how , in the first few weeks after the book was published , every one at all instructed in the biological sciences was eager to ascertain the views of so distinguished a naturalist with regard to a question which for several years had agitated the scientific world . Like the great works which had preceded it , the Origin of Species must be regarded as one of the results of the ever memorable voyage of the Beagle . In the course of this voyage Mr. Darwin visited the Galapagos Islands , and was struck by the peculiar relations which the floras and faunas of this archipelago sustained to one another , and to the flora and fauna of the nearest mainland of Ecuador , distant some five hundred miles . These islands are purely volcanic in formation , and have never at any time been joined to the South American continent . They possess no batrachians and no mammals , save a mouse , which was no doubt introduced by some ship . The only insects are coleoptera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon floating logs or branches ; and along with these are two or three species of land shells . There are also two snakes , one land tortoise , and four kinds of lizard ; and in striking contrast with all this general extreme paucity of animal forms , there are at least fiftyfive species of birds . Now these insects , mollusks , reptiles , and birds are like the insects , mollusks , reptiles , and birds of the westfirn coast of South America , and not like the corresponding animals in other parts of the world . But this is not all ; for the Galapagos animals , while very like the animals of Ecuador , Peru , and Chili , are not quite like them . While the families are identical , the // differences are always at least specific , sometimes generic , in value . Precisely the same sort of relationship is sustained by the Galapagos flora toward the flora of the mainland . And , to crown all , the differences between forms that are generic when the archipelago as a whole is compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ islands of the archipelago are compared with one another . Such a group of facts as these leads irresistibly to the conclusion that the specific forms of plants and animals have been originated , not by " special creations , " but by " descent with modifications . " If species have been separately created , there is of course no reason why the population of such an archipelago should be strictly limited to such organisms as can fly or get floated across the water ; nor is there any reason why these organisms should resemble those of the nearest mainland rather than those of any other tropical mainland , such as Africa or India . One might indeed object that organisms have been created in such wise as most completely to harmonize with the physical conditions by which they are surrounded , and that it is to be presumed that the physical conditions of the Galapagos Islands are more like those of Ecuador and Peru than they are like those of any other countries ; so that in this way the general similarity between the floras and faunas may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for it rests upon an assumption which has been proved to be untrue . It is not always true that the organisms in any given part of the world are such as harmonize best with the physical conditions by which they are . surrounded . It is approximately true only where the competition among organisms is practically unlimited ; in protected areas it is not at all true . In Australia and iNew Zealand , for example , the plants and animals which have been introduced by Europeans are exterminating and supplanting the native plants and animals quite as rapidly as the Englishman is supplanting the native human population of these countries . And to state this fact is only to say , in other words , that the plants and animals of Europe are better adapted to the physical conditions which prevail in Australia and New Zealand than the plants and animals which are indigenous there . A comprehensive survey of the distribution of life all over the globe confirms this conclusion , and shows that by no assumption of a special act of creation can the peculiar features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only way in which to account for these features is to suppose that the archipelago has been peopled by migrations from the nearest mainland . This explains why the creatures there are most like the creatures of Ecuador and Peru . and it also explains why the only indigenous animals to be found there are such as could have flown or been blown thither , or such as could have been ferried thither on floating vegetation . But if all this be true - and to-day no competent naturalist doubts it - a conclusion of vast importance immediately follows . If the Galapagos plants and animals are descended from ancestors that migrated thither from the continent , they have been modified during ages of residence in the islands , until they have come to differ specifically , and in many cases generically , from their collateral relations on the mainland . And this amounts to saying that species are not fixed , but mutable , - that every distinct form of plant and animal was not originally created with its present attributes , but that some forms have arisen from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the study of the inhabitants of a single well-defined area , Mr. Darwin was led into a series of most grand and startling considerations relating to the past history of life upon // our globe . The conclusions thus succinctly stated were amply confirmed by a survey of the distribution of organisms all over the earth , and thus was inaugurated the study of zo6logical and botanical geography , - a study which in half a century has reached such magnificent proportions in the great works of Hooker and Wallace , and which owes its wonderful progress mainly to the sagacious impulse communicated at the outset by Mr. Darwin . It has now become well established that in very few cases , if any , have animals and plants originated exactly in the places where we now find them , but that they are almost always the offspring of immigrants ; and the study of the ancient migrations of the progenitors of living plants and animals has begun to throw a flood of light upon the history of the changes that have taken place in the physical geography of the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descent with modifications " having been thus forcibly suggested to Mr. Darwin by the facts of geographical distribution , it was still further strengthened by a study of the geological succession of extinct organisms and their relations to living organisms in the same areas . Such broad facts as the successive appearance of various sloth-like and armadillo-like animals in South America , or of various marsupials and monotremes in Australia , forcibly suggest the descent of the later forms from the earlier ones that lived in the same countries . Of like import is the general fact that in the course of geological succession any given organism is sure to be intermediate in character between those that have preceded and those that have followed it . But still more powerfully suggestive even than this is the fact that , in proportion as we go back in geologic time , we find the characteristics of plants and animals to be less and less distinctly specialized : so that , for example , in the Eocene pe Charles Darwzn. 839 nod , instead of horses and tapirs such as now exist we find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse ; and instead of leopards and wolves and bears we find carnivorous animals , not specialized as of feline or canine or ursine family , but with some points of resemblance to all three , and with some points like opossums and wombats into the bargain . In conformity with this general principle , the arrangement of organisms according to their succession in geologic time would be like the branches and branchlets of a tree , which is the typical form of arrangement where the link that connects the facts arranged is the link of parentage . But just here the facts of geological succession are reinforced , with truly overwhelming conclusiveness , by the great facts of classification in the animal and vegetable kingdoms . This branching tree-like arrangement , which alone correctly represents the relationships of organisms in their geological succession , is at the same time the only possible arrangement by which the likenesses and affinities among existing organisms can be represented with anything like an approach to correctness . The facts of pala3ontology exactly dovetail in with those of taxonomy , and serve to elucidate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classify all animals in a linear series , but Cuvier proved once for all that no such arrangement is possible . The only feasible arrangement is that of groups within groups , diverging like the branches and twigs of what we aptly term a " family-tree ; " and this fact not only strongly suggests the theory of " descent with modifications , " but is indeed utterly incompatible with any other theory . Further powerful evidence in favor of the same view is furnished by countless familiar facts of morphology and embryology . On the theory of " de // scent with modifications , " it is intelligible that all the classes and orders of the vertebrate sub - kingdom , for example , should be constructed on exactly the same fundamental plan , - that the arms of men , the fore-legs of quadrupeds , the paddles of cetacea , the wings of birds , and the pectoral fins of fishes should be structurally identical with one another . It is intelligible that a horse 's hoof should be , as it is , made up of toes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embryo should begin , as it does , to develop as if it were going to become a fish , circulating its blood through gills and a two-chambered heart , and then , changing its course , should behave as if it were going to become a reptile or bird , and only after long delay should assume the distinctive characteristics of mammality . It is intelligible that many snakes should possess beneath their skin the rudiments of limbs ; that sundry insects , which never fly , should have wings firmly fastened down to their sides ; and that the embryos of many birds , while developing in the egg , should grow temporary teeth within their little beaks . But it is only on the theory of " descent with modifications " that such facts , which are in no wise exceptional , but common throughout the entire animal kingdom , have any meaning whatever . Many of these facts had been noticed by eminent naturalists before Mr. Darwin , and their incompatibility with any theory of special creations had also been observed ; but it was Mr. Darwin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the cumulative resuit was that the phenomena of the organic world are unintelligible from beginning to end save on the theory of " descent with modifications . " Had Mr. Darwin done nothing but this , it would have given him a peculiar right to associate his name with the development theory , it would have established that theory on a basis of " convincing proba bility , " and it would have entitled him toahigh place in the history of scientific thought in the nineteenth century . But Mr. Darwin did not stop here . Convinced by such considerations as those just presented that the specific characters of plants and animals are not constant , but variable , he sought for some grand all-pervading cause of variation in organisms , and his search was crowned with success . This was the achievement which in his hands raised the development theory from the rank of a brilliant philosophical speculation into the rank of an irrefragable scientific discovery . This was the achievement which gave to mankind a new implement of research and a new insight into the workings of Nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Darwin 's name beside those of Newton and Descartes . The method by which Mr. Darwin succeeded in discovering the cause of variation in organisms was the thoroughly scientific method of advancing tentatively from the known to the unknown . Are there any instances in which the forms of plants and animals have actually been seen to vary , and , if there are , what seems to have been the principal cause of variation in these instances ? The answer is not far to seek . The instances are very numerous indeed in which variations - and very marked ones , too - have been wrought i the characteristics of plants and animals through the agency of man . The phenomena of variation presented by animals and plants under domestication are so numerous and so complex that it would require many volumes to describe them . Dogs , horses , pigs , cattle , sheep , rabbits , pigeons , poultry , silkmoths , cereal and culinary plants , fruits and flowers innumerable , have been reared and bred by man for many long ages , - some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused to vary , in one direc // 1882 . Charles Darwin . tion or another , to suit his natural or artificial needs , or even the mere whim of his fancy . The variations , moreover , which have thus been produced have been neither slight nor unimportant , and have been by no means confined to superficial characteristics . Compare the thorough-bred race-horse with the gigantic London dray-horse on the one hand , and the Shetland pony on the other ; or , among pigeons , contrast the pouter with the fan-tail , the barb , the short-faced tumbler , or the jacobin , all of which are historically known to have descended from one and the same ancestral form . The differences extend throughout the whole bony framework as well as throughout the muscular and nervous systems , and exceed in amount the differences by which naturalists often adjudge species to be distinct . Through what agency has man produced such results as these ? He has produced them simply by taking advantage of a slight tendency to variation which exists perpetually in all plants and animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nowhere do we ever find any two individuals exactly alike . Taking advantage of these individual variations , the breeder simply selects the individuals which best suit his purpose , and breeds them apart by themselves . The qualities for which they are selected are propagated and enhanced through inheritance and renewed selection in each succeeding generation , until by the slow accumulation of small differences a new race is formed . And thus we have peaches and almonds from a common source , grapes to eat and grapes to make wine of , pointer-dogs and mastiffs , and so on throughout the list of cultivated plants and domesticated animals . These facts ahout variation under domestication are for the most part well known , and the alleged cause of variation , in selection by man , is not an occult cause , but is a phenomenon perfectly familiar to every one . Starting from this point , Mr. Darwin made a very elaborate study of all that farmers , horticulturists , and breeders could impart concerning- " artificial selection ; " and more especially with regard to pigeons his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Origin of Species was published , I recollect reading one silly review , in which we were gravely informed that here was a new theory of development , - not by a naturalist , but by a mere pigeon-fancier , and probably worthy of very little consideration ! Such being the wonders which man has wrought within a comparatively short time though " artificial selection " in the breeding of animals and plants , the question next arises whether any selective process like this has been going on through countless ages without the intervention of man . Can it be that there is a " natural selections ' of individual variations , whereby new species are produced in just the same way that breeders produce new races of pigeons ? There is such a " natural selection " forever going on as one of the inseparable concomitants of organic life ; and it was just in the detection of this great truth that the very kernel of Mr. Darwin 's stupendous discovery consisted . It was here that the poetic or creative act of genius came into play , just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the moon was likened to the fall of the apple , and the tangential force of the moon to the tangential force of a stone whirled at the end of a string . The case is simple enough , when creative genius has once explained it . So great is the destruction of organic life that out of hundreds of seeds , or spawn , or ova but one or two ever live to come to maturity and reproduce themselves in offspring . Such is the result of the universal and unrelenting competition between organisms for the means of subsistence . Any creature that lives to reproduce its kind is selected from out of a thousand that // June1 perish prematurely , and its selection is evidence of its better adaptation to the conditions amid which it is placed . And so stern and so ubiquitous is the competition that there is no individual variation , however slight or apparently trivial , that is not liable to be seized upon and enhanced if it tend in any way to promote the survival of the species . Thus it is natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species , and keeps it in harmony with its environment , by cutting off all individual variations that oscillate too far on either side of a prescribed mean . The stability of a species depends , therefore , upon the stability of the environment ; and the only condition under which a species could remain unchanged would be that it should remain forever exposed to the action of changeless groups of circumstances . But this has never been the case with any species , and never will be . The habitable surface of the earth has been perpetually changing for a hundred million years , and the relations between the countless groups of organisms that have covered its surface have been perpetually changing in endless degrees of complexity ; and in such a world , under the working of natural selection , there can be no such thing as " fixity of species . Having arrived at these grand conclusions , it became comparatively easy for Mr. Darwin to go on and trace the workings of natural selection in many special instances . In these inquiries , upon which he brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more vast and multifarious than has ever been possessed by any other man , he occupied nearly a quarter of a century before it seemed to him that the time had come for making his discovery known to the world . Tn 1844 , he wrote out a brief sketch of the conclusions which , as he modestly says , " then seemed to me probable ; " and this sketch he showed to his friend Hooker , perhaps also to Lyell . But fifteen years more , rich in observation and reflection , passed away , and still the world had heard nothing about the origin of species by means of natural selection . How much longer this silence might have lasted , had not an unforeseen circumstance come in to break it , one can not say . But no doubt it would have lasted some time longer , for Mr. Darwin did not wish to publish his conclusions until he had given due attention to every fact and every argunnent which might in any way bear upon them ; and it is quite evident that when he wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful maturity which his argument had attaine ( l , or the overwhelming cogency with which he was then actually presenting it to the world . It was very characteristic of Mr. Darwin - into the fibre of whose mind there entered not the smallest shred of egotism or of the pride of knowledge to make so many allowances for the inevitable incompleteness of his work , when judged by that standard of ideal perfection which he alone among men was able to apply to ut , as to have rendered himself incapable for the time being of appreciating its real magnitude . In writing the Origin of Species , he regarded the book as merely a preliminary outline of his theory , which would serve to prevent his being forestalled by any one else in the announcement of it , and he made frequent allusions to the larger and more elaborate treatise in which he intended presently to follow up the exposition and to reinforce the argument . When I first met Mr. Darwin in London , in 1873 , he told me that he was surprised at the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickness with which it carried conviction to the minds of all the men on whose opinions he set the most value . The success of his theory was , indeed , wonderfully rapid and complete . To understand him was to agree with him , and before ten years // more had passed by , so many able men had become expounders and illustrators of the theory of natural selection that - as he told me - it seemed no longer so necessary as it had once seemed for him to write the larger and more elaborate treatise . The learned work on the Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication , which appeared in 1868 in two octavo volumes , formed the first installment of this long-projected treatise . The second part was to have treated of the variation of animal 's and plants through natural selection ; and a third part would have dealt at length with the phenomena of morphology , of classification , and of distribution in space and time . But these second and third parts were never published . I alluded , just now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1859 to break his long silence , and to write and publish the Origin of Species . This circumstance served , no less than the extraordinary success of his book , to show how ripe the minds of men had become for entertaining such views as those which Mr. Darwin propounded . In 1858 Mr. Wallace , who was then engaged in studying the natural history of the Malay Archipelago , sent to Mr. Darwin ( as to the man most likely to understand him ) a paper , in which he sketched the outlines of a theory identical with that upon which Mr. Darwin had so long been at work . The same sequence of observed facts and inferences that had led Mr. Darwin to the discovery of natural selection and its consequences had led Mr. Wallace to the very threshold of the same discovery ; but in Mr. Wallace 's mi.nd the theory had by no means been wrought out to the same degree of completeness to which it had been wrought in the mind of Mr. Darwin . In the preface to his charming book on Natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , acknowledges that , whatever value his speculations may have had , they have been utterly surpassed in richness and cogency of proof by those of Mr. Darwin . This is no doubt true , and Mr. Wallace has done such good work in further illustration of the theory that he can well afford to rest content with the second place in the first announcement of it . The coincidence , however , between Mr. Wallace 's conclusions and those of Mr. Darwin was very remarkable . But , after all , coincidences of this sort have not been uncommon in the history of scientific inquiry . Nor is it at all surprising that they should occur now and then , when we remember that a great and pregnant discovery must always be concerned with some question which many of the foremost minds in the world are busy in thinking about . It was so with the discovery of the differential calculus , and again with the discovery of the planet Neptune . It was so with the interpretation of the Egyptian hieroglyphics , and with the establishment of the undulatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerable extent , with the introduction of the new chemistry , with the discovery of the mechanical equivalent of heat , and the whole doctrine of the correlation of forces . It was so with the invention of the electric telegraph and with the discovery of spectrum analysis . And it is not at all strange that it should have been so with the doctrine of the origin of species through natural selection . The belief that all species have originated through derivation from other species , and not through special creation , had been held by part of the scientific world ever since the time of Mr. Darwin 's grandfather , who was one of its earliest and most eminent advocates . Even those naturalists who did not hold this belief can hardly be said to have held any antagonistic belief , inasmuch as the so-called " doctrine of special creations " is not a positive doctrine at // all , but a mere confession of ignorance , and was so regarded by scientific naturalists , such as Owen , for example , before 1859 . The truth is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no opinion whatever current respecting the subject that deserved to be called a scientific hypothesis . That the more complex forms of life must have come into existence through some process of development from simpler forms was no doubt the only sensible and rational view to take of the subject ; but in a vague and general opinion of this sort there is nothing that is properly scientific . A scientific hypothesis must connect the phenomena with which it deals by alleging a " true cause ; " and before 1859 no one had suggested a " true cause " for the origination of new spqcies , although the problem was one over which every philosophical naturalist had puzzled since the beginning of the century . This explains why Mr. Darwin 's success was so rapid and complete , and it also explains why he came so near being anticipated . His long delay , however , in bringin5 , forward his theory had one good result . The work was so thoroughly done that , although Darwinism has now for twenty-three years been one of the chief subjects of popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one as yet seems to have discovered any argument against the theory of natural selection which Mr. Darwin had not himself already foreseen and considered in the first edition of the Origin of Species . After an interval of twelve yenrs Mr. Darwin followed up the first announcement of his general theory with his treatise on the Descent of Man , a book which deals with a subject in one respect even more difficult than the origin of species . In his earlier book Mr. Darwin , with masterly skill , brought together huge masses of facts , and showed their bearings upon a few general propositions relating to the whole organic world . In the Descent of Man the problem was different . Propositions of great generality , such as had been established in the Origin of Species , served here as fundamental principles ; but they had to be supplemented by a consideration of the enormously complex and heterogeneous circumstances which attended the origination of a particular genus . It is enough to say that in the treatment of this arduous problem Mr. Darwin showed no less acuteness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In connection with this problem of the origin of the human race , Mr. Darwin announced the results of his extensive researches into the subject of sexual selection in the animal kingdom . Some time before this , in his treatise on the Fertilization of Orchids , published in 1862 , he had called attention to the interdependence between the insect world and the world of flowers . Further research in this direction has made it clear that the beautiful colors and sweet odors of flowers are due to selection on the part of insects . The bright colors and delicious perfumes attract insects , who come to sip the nectar , and carry away on their backs the pollen with which to fertilize the next plant they visit . Thus the fairest and sweetest flowers are continually selected to perpetuate their race , and thus have insects and flowering plants been developed in close correlation with one another . It was Mr. Darwin 's good fortune to live long enough to see his theory not only adopted by all competent naturalists , hut demonstrated by crucial evidence in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the paheontology of the horse have established beyond question the descent of the genus equus from a five-toed mammal not larger than a pig , and somewhat resembling a tapir . All the " missing links " in this case have been found ; // and thus the primitive barbaric hypothesis of " special creations " may be said to have disappeared foreVer from the field of natural history . It has taken its place by the side of the Ptolemaic astronomy and the dreams of the alchemists . Mr. Darwin 's latest books belong to a period in which , having lived to witness the complete success of his great work , he has employed his time in recording the results of his researches on many subsidiary points , of no little interest and importance . The treatises on the Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals , on the Movements and Habits of Climbing Plants , on Insectivorous Plants , on Cross and Self Fertilization , on the Different Forms of Flowers , and on the Formation of Vegetable Mould thronab the Action of Worms should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who cares to learn what scientific method is . They may be counted , too , among the most entertaining books of science that have ever been written ; and the points that have been established in them , taken in connection with Mr. Darwin 's previous works , make up an aggregate of scientific achievement such as has rarely been equaled . It is fitting that in the great Abbey , where rest the ashes of England 's noblest heroes , the place of the discoverer of natural selection should be near that of Sir Isaac Newton . Since the publication of the immortal Principia , no scientific book has so widened the mental horizon of mankind as the Origin of Species . Mr. Darwin , like Newton , was a very young man when his great discovery suggested itself to him . Like Newton , he waited many years before publishing it to the world . Like Newton , he lived to see it become part and parcel of the mental equipment of all men of science . The theological objection urged against the Newtonian theory by Leibnitz , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediate action of the Deity , was also urged against the Darwinian theory by Agassiz ; and the same objection will doubtless continue to be urged against scientific explanations of natural phenomena so long as there are men who fail to comprehend the profoundly theistic and religious truth that the action of natural causes is in itself the immediate action of the Deity . It is interesting , however , to see that , as theologians are no longer frightened by the doctrine of gravitation , so they are already outgrowing their dread of the doctrine of natural selection . On the Sunday following Mr. Darwin 's death , Canon Liddon , at St. Paul 's Cathedral , and Canons Barry and Prothero , at Westminster Abbey , agreed in referring to the Darwinian theory as " not necessarily hostile to the fundamental truths of religion . " The effect of Mr. Darwin 's work has been , however , to remodel the theological conceptions of the origin and destiny of man which were current in former times . In this respect it has wrought a revolution as great as that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much the same kind . Again has man been rudely unseated from his imaginary throne in the centre of the universe , but only that he may learn to see in the universe and in human life a richer and deeper meaning than he had before suspected . Truly , he who unfolds to us the way in which God works through the world of phenomena may well be called the best of religious teachers . In the study of the organic world , no less than in the study of the starry heavens , is it true that " day unto day uttereth speech , and night unto night showeth knowledge . " John Fiske. // ALPHONSE DAIJDET . T*n French have about many matters a way of feeling that is not ours , and M. Ernest Daudet 's little volume ' illustrates some of these differences . He is the brother of the brilliant author of the Lettres de mon Moulin , the Rois en Exil , and Numa Roumestan , and it has seemed to him natural to celebrate his kinship with so charming a writer in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in which biography and eulogy , admiration and tenderness , are gracefully blended . In England or in America , an artist 's brother would , we think , hold himself less designated than another to discourse to the public about the great man of the family . The artist would be sure to dislike it , and the brother would have an awkward , and possibly morbid , fear of making two honest men ridiculous . But the French have never worshiped at the shrine of reticence , and it is fortunate that there should be a race of people who acquit themselves gracefully of delicate undertakings , and who have on all occasions the courage of their emotion . The French do such things because they can ; we abstain because we have not that art . M. Ernest Daudet admires his brother as much as he loves him , and as he presumably knows him better than any one else , he may have regarded himself as the ideal biographer . His delightful volume is , to speak grossly , just a trifle too much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter with Alphonse Dandet ( for whom he claims complete irresponsibility ) , we see no obstacle to his settling it with the public and with his own conscience . Our principal regret is the regret expressed by the subject of the work in a letter from which , in the 1 Mon Frere et Moi : Souve irs d'Enfance et de Jeunesse . Par ERNEST DAUDET . Paris : Plon. 1882. preface , the author quotes a passage . M. Alphonse Daudet , who was in Switzerland at the time the chapters of which the present volume is composed were put forth in a periodical , protested against " being treated as people treat only the dead . I am living , and very living , " he wrote , " and you make me enter rather too soon into history . I know people who will say that I have got my brother to advertise me . " Alphonse Daudet is living , and very living ; that is his great attraction . But after all , his too zealous biographer has not killed him . We hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please us in the growing taste of the age for revelations about the private life of the persons in whose works it is good enough to be interested . In our opinion , the life and the works are two very different matters , and an intimate knowledge of the one is not at all necessary for a genial enjoyment of the other . A writer who gives us his works is not obliged to throw his life after them , as is very apt to be assumed by persons who fail to perceive that one of the most interesting pursuits in the world is to read between the lines of the best literature . Alphonse Daudet is but forty-two years of age , and we hope to read a more definitive life of him thirty years hence . By that time we shall know whether we really need it . Once grant M. Ernest Daudet his premises , he tells his story with taste as well as with tenderness . The story is perhaps not intrinsically remarkable , but there is something so ingratiating in the personality of the hero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of affectionate interest . His youth was the youth of nineteen out of twenty French artists and men of letters , and he served the usual apprenticeship to poverty and // Alphonse Daudet. disappointment . Born in a small provincial city , of parents more or less acquainted with chill penury , he picks up a certain amount of heterogeneous knowledge at the communal college or the lyc*e ; becomes conscious of talents or of ambition ; struggles more or less , in a narrow interior , with a family circle which fails to appreciate these gifts ; and finally , with empty pockets and immense curiosities , comes up to Paris to seek a fortune . Nineteen out of twenty of these slender beginners never get any further ; they never succeed in breaking open their little envelope of obscurity . Daudet was the twentieth , who takes all the prizes . He deserved them , if suffering is a title ; for his childhood , in spite of a few happy accidents , - the brightness and sweetness both of his birthplace and of his temperament , - had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that wonderful Provence which he has so frequently and so vividly , though perhaps not so accurately , described ; he came into the world in the picturesque old city of Nimes , the city of Roman remains , of fragrant gardens , of beautiful views , of sun and dust , of Southern dullness and Southern animation . Much of his childhood , however , thanks to his father 's reverses and embarrassments ( his family had been engaged in the weaving of silk ) , was spent at Lyons , among gray , damp , sordid , sickening impressions , - a period described with touching effect in NI . Daudet 's first long story , the exquisite memoirs of Le Petit Chose . M. Ernest Daudet relates the annals of his family , which appears to have numbered several vigorous and even distinguished members , and makes *o secret of the fact that in his own childhood its once considerable honors had been much curtailed . This period , for the two brothers , contained many dismal passages , and Alphonse , while still a mere boy ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earn a wretched livelihood as ill-paid usher in a small provincial college . We do not mean , however , to retrace the chapters of his life ; we take him as we find him to-day , in the full enjoyment of his powers and his rewards , and we attempt , in a few rapid strokes , to sketch his literary physiognomy . If we were asked to describe it in two words , we should say that he is beyond comparison the most charming storyteller of the day . He has power as well as charm , but his happy grace is what strikes us most . No one is so light and keen , so picturesque ; no one pleases so by his manner , his movement , his native gayety , his constant desire to please . We confess to an extreme fondness for M. Alphonse Daudet ; he is very near to our heart . The brigbt light , the warm color , the spontaneity and loquacity , of his native Provence have entered into his style , and made him a talker as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they have always something of the flexibility and familiarity of conversation . rrhe conversation , we mean , of an artist and a Frenchman ; the conversation of a circle in which the faculty of vivid and discriminating speech exists as it has existed nowhere else . This charming temper , touched here and there with the sentiment of deeper things , is the sign of his earlier productions . As time has gone on , he has enlarged his manner , - enlarged with his field of observation . The Parisian has been added to the Provenqal , fortunately without crowding him out . It is not NI . Daudet 's longest things that we like best , though we profess a great fondness for Les Rois en Exil . The Lettres de mon Moulin , the Contes du Lundi , Le Petit Chose , the exquisitely amusing history of Tartarin de Tarascon , the charming series of letters entitled Robert Helmont , - these contain , to our sense , the cream of the author 's delicate and indescribable talent . Daudet sketches in perfection he does the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the French call it - with a faduty all his own . No one has such an eye for a subject ; such a perception of " bits , " as the painters in water-colors say . It is indeed as if he worked in water-colors , from a rich and liquid palette ; his style is not so much a literary form as a plastic form . He is a wonderful observer of all external things , - of appearances , objects , surface , circumstances ; but what makes his peculiarity is that the ray of fancy , the tremor of feeling , always lights up the picture . This perception of material objects is not uncommon to-day , and it has never been rare among the French , in whom quickness of vision , combined with a talent for specifying and analyzing what they see , is a national characteristic . The new fashion of realism has indeed taught us all that in any description of life the description of places and things is half the battle . But to describe them we must see them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infinitely more than others . Alphonse Daudet is one of those who see most . Among the French , moreover , the gift is cultivated , and the first canon of the " young school " of to-day is that to write a novel you must take notes on the spot . Balzac took notes , Gustave Flaubert took notes , Emile Zola takes notes . We are sure that Alphonse T ) audet takes them , too , though in his constitution there is a happy faculty for which all the notes in the world are an insufficient substitute , namely , the faculty of feeling as well as seeing . He feels what he sees , and the feeling expresses itself in quick , light irony , in jocosity , iu poetry . M. Daudet never sees plain prose . He discovers everywhere the shimmer and murmur of the poetic . He has described in a great many places the Provenqal turn of mind , the temperament of the man of the South ; his last novel in particular - Numa Ronmestan - being an elaborate picture of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unlimited respect . He feels it so strongly , perha.ps , because lie feels it in himself ; it is not to be denied that his own artistic nature contains several of the qualities on which he has expended his most charming satire . The weak points of the man of the South , in M. Daudet 's view , are the desire to please at any cost , and , as a natural result of this , a brilliant indifference to the truth . There is a good deal of all this , in its less damaging aspects , in the author of Numa Roumestan . We have spoken of his desire to please , which is surely not an unpardonable fault in an artist , though M. Zola holds it to be so . M. Daudet likes to entertain , to beguile , to gratify , to mystify , to purchase immediate applause . For ourselves , we give the applause without the slightest reluctance . May it be a fault in a writer of fiction to be very fond of fiction ? In this case it seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zola , to quote him again , holds that the love of fiction is the most evil passion of the human heart ; and yet he has most inconsistently found many civil things to say of his confrere Daudet , whom he would represent as one of the standard - bearers of naturalism . M. Daudet is fond of fiction as Dickens was fond of it , - he is fond of the picturesque . His taste is for oddities and exceptions , for touching de'noi*ments , for situations slightly factitious , for characters surprisingly genial . There is nothing uncompromising , nothing of a depressing integrity , in his love of the real . Left to himself , he takes only those parts of it that happen to commend themselves to his fancy , which , as we have already said , is , in his intellectual e*onomy , the mistress of the house . But he has not always been left to himself . He has lived in Paris , he has become a disciple of Balzac , he has frequented Flanbert , he has known Zola , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as responsibilities . There are , indeed , - // those terrible responsibilities which M. Zola carries with such a ponderous tread . He himself recalls Alphonse Daudet to a sense of them in a passage which we may quote from his lately published volume , entitled Une Campagne . He is more troubled , we suspect , than he ventures to say by Daudet 's taint of the factitious , and he speaks with a good deal of point of the very different aspect which the Provence of Numa Roumestan wears from the Provence of his own young memories , - he being also a son of that soil . " Alphonse Daudet seems to me to see the country of Provence in one of the gilded falsehoods of his hero . I do n't speak of the inhabitants , whom he treats with even too much cruelty ; I speak of the look of the land , of that perpetual dream of sunshine , which he manages to fill with all the romance of the troubadours . He softens down the very mistral , which he calls the wholesome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furthest edge of the horizon . ' My own Provence , that of which the heated harshness still blows into my face , is a much rougher affair , and the mistral cracks my lips , burns my skin , fills the valley with a devastation so terrible that the blue sky grows pale . I remember the extinguished look of the sun in the pure , bleached air , through that roaring breath which sometimes ruins the country-side in a day . The Provence of Alphonse Daudet is therefore , for my sensations , too good-natured ; I should like it stronger and more scorched , with that perfume of which the violence turns to bitterness under the hard and cloudless blue . " It was inevitable , we suppose , that our author should sooner or later become a Parisian ; should attempt to master the great city , in the manner of successful Frenchmen . This capitalization of his talent , as we may call it , has been extremely fruitful , has produced a multitude of admirable chapters ; but , on the other hand , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect . The sketches and stories we mentioned at the beginning of this article all have the stamp of perfection . There is nothing to add to them , nothing to take from them , nothing to correct in them . In his later and larger works there have been great inequalities , though the successful portions , we admit , have become more and more brilliant . It is an odd thing that though it is as a peculiarly imaginative writer that we reckon him , he is not at his best when he gives his imagination the reins . At such moments he is very apt to become false and unnatural ; his charming fancy is an excellent companion , but an uncertain guide . His great successes ( in his longer works ) have been portraits of known individuals . Fromont Jeune et Risler Ain6 , the first in date of these later things , and perhaps the most popular , is by no means the one we prefer ; with all its keenness of touch , it has perhaps even more than its share of the disparities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the setting of the scene , the art of presentation , the three or four subordinate characters , furnish the strong points of the book . The portrait of the depraved and dangerous heroine ( there is a virtuous female figure to balance her ) is wanting to our sense in solidity , and the main interest of the novel suffers from thinness . Sidonie Ch*be strikes us as a study at once elaborate and shallow ; and indeed the elaboration of the frivolous and perfidious wife , in French fiction , has grown to be inevitably and indefinably stale . The best fi , ure in the book is the old humbugging tragedian Delobelle , - a type of which we have had glimpses elsewhere . In Delobelle and in his daughter D6sir*e , English readers find an echo , at once gratifying and tormenting , of our own inimitable Dickens . Dickens is dying , they say ; Dickens is dead ( though we do n't believe it ) , and nothing is more generally admitted than that Dickens 's absent // qualities were as striking as those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immeasurable , and when we are reminded of him by another writer , the comparison suggested is not likely to be to the advantage of the latter . We speak , of course , from the point of view of a generation impregnated with Dickens 's humor , and our remark has no application to French readers , who have no idea , when they smile or sigh over the fortunes of the famille Joyeuse ( in Le Nabab ) , or drop a tear upon the childish miseries of Jack , that they are tasting of an ingenious dilution of the violent humor of Nickleby and Copperfield . We do not mean in the least that Alphonse Daudet is a conscious copyist of Dickens ; he has denied the charge , we believe , in definite terms . But the English writer is certainly one of his sympathies , and we suspect that if he had never opened ( even in a translation ) one of those volumes which constitute the great cockney epic , one of the effective notes of his scale would be absent . In Jack the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , we think , made the story more natural . That falsetto note , in pathos , which was the fatal danger of the author of Dombey and Son , is sounded with a good deal of frequency in Jack , and the portrayal of innocent suffering , through the intensification of the innocence , is also overdone . Neither do we care very much for the famille Joyeuse , in Le INabab , finding in them , as we do , too sensible a reflection of that rather voluntary glow of satisfaction with which Dickens invites us to contemplate such people as the Brothers Cheeryble . Le Nabab , is on the whole , however , a brilliant production , and contains some of the author 's strongest pages . It is a gallery of portraits , like all of his later stories , - portraits of contemporary Parisian figures , in which the intelligent reader is always able to detect a more or less distinguished model . The hero himself is a study of the " man of the South , " but in his more robust and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great industrial and commercial parvenu . The picture takes a tragical turn , for the great fortune of M. Daudet 's ex-dock-porter crumbles away through a series of events as remarkable as those which have helped to build it up . It is the analysis of a coarse , powerful , vulgar , jovial , florid , energetic temperament , which has known the two extremes of human experience ; and it is no secret that the author has reproduced the history - or at least the physiognomy - of the remarkable M. Bravais , whose rapid rise and fall were one of the innumerable queer incidents of the later years of the Empire . This period is embodied even more effectively in the figure of the Duc de Mora , - a thin modification of the once impressive title of the Duc de Morny , who is presented in M. Daudet 's pages in company with several members of his circle . This is the historical novel applied to the passing hour . The author has expended his best pains on the portrait of the Duc de Mora , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for want of the multiplication of fine touches . It has great color and relief , - the mark of that brush-like quality of pen which is a specialty of M. Daudet . Is Felicia Ruys intended for Mademoiselle Sarah Bernhardt ? The answer to the question hardly matters , for the personage belongs to the rank of the author 's halfsuccesses . We mention her , because , like the other characters , she is an example of the manner which Alphonse Daudet may be said to have invented . This manner , the reproduction of actualities under a transparent veil , the appropriation of a type embodied in a living specimen , with the peculiarities much accentuated , is an inspiration which , when it is most fruitful , Alponse Dandet induces rather to condone than to welcome . Cultivated by a writer of his tact // and talent , it would probably produce a plentiful crop of vulgarities . M. Daudet is never vulgar , but he is sometimes rather false . Many of his readers doubtless hold that his best guarantee against falsity is this very practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special case . They remark , justly enough , that in Le Nabab , in the Rois en Exil , the best things are the things for which he has had chapter and verse in the world around him . When he has attempted to generalize , as in the more technically romantic episodes , he has gone astray , and become fantastic . We incline to agree to this , though it may seem to contradict what we have said about his great charm being his element of fancy . We should explain that we have not used fancy here in the sense of invention ; we have used it to denote the faculty which projects the unexpected , irresponsible , illuminating day upon material supplied out of hand . If there were nothing else to distinguish Alphonse Daudet from Emile Zola , his delicate , constant sense of beauty would suffice . Zola of course consoles himself , though he does not always console others , with his superior sense of reality . Daudet is a passionate observer , - an observer not perhaps of the deepest things of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the expressive , the actual . This faculty , enriched by the most abundant exercise and united with the feeling of the poet who sees all the finer relations of things and never relinquishes the attempt to charm , is what we look for in the happiest novelist of our day . Ah , the things he sees , - the various , fleeting , lurking , delicate , nameless human things ! We have spoken of his remarkable vision of accessories and details ; but it is difficult to give an idea of the artistic " go " with which it is exercised . This beautiful vivacity finds its most complete expression in Les Rois en Exil , a book that could have been produced only in one of these later years of grace . Such a book is intensely modern , and the author is in every way an essentially modern genius . With the light , warm , frank Proven9al element of him , he is , in his completeness , a product of the great French city . He has the nervous tension , the intellectual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sophisticated judgment , which the friction , the contagion , the emulation , the whole spectacle , at once exciting and depressing , of our civilization at its highest , produces in susceptible natures . There are tears in his laughter , and there is a strain of laughter in his tears ; and in both there is a note of music . What could be more modern than his style , from which every shred of classicism has been stripped , and which moves in a glitter of images , of discoveries , of verbal gymnastics , animated always by the same passion for the concrete ? With his merits and shortcomings combined , Alphonse Daudet is the charming writer we began by declaring him , because he is so intensely living . He is a thoroughly special genius , and in our own sympathies he touches a very susceptible spot . He is not so serious , not to say so solemn , as Emile Zola , and we suspect that in his heart he finds the doctrine of naturalism a good deal of a bore . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the great Turgenielf . But with his happy vision , his abundant expression , his talent for episodes and figures that detach themselves , his sense of intimate pleasures and pains , his good-humor , his gay- * ety , his grace , and that modern quality of intensity that he throws into everything , he is really a great little novelist .
