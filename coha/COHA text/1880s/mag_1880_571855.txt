A CANTERBURY PILGRIMAGE . MOST of my readers probably know that the head of the Church of England is the Archbishop of Canterbury ; but I have been led to believe that many intelligent and generally well-informed people , even in England , do not know why he is so . By the head of the church , I mean the sacerdotal head , the Primate , as he is called . The nominal and secular head is at present her most gracious royal and imperial majesty Victoria , who holds this position as the successor , although not the descendant , of that long-suffering and tenderconscienced monarch , Henry , the eighth of that name , who was so sorely tried by the sex through which came death and all our woe , - an assertion for which I hasten to say that Moses and Milton are alone responsihle . And as the afflictions of that exemplary monarch in the matter of wives form an important part of the history of the Reformation , about which it is becoming to all people who would seem well educated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rhyme , not generally known I believe , which will help to keep the facts in mind , and be at any time convenient for reference - to those who can remember it : - " King Henry the Eighth to six spouses was wed-ded : One died , one survived , two divorced , two beheaded . " This is not thoroughly original , it . being manifestly framed on the model of " Thirty days hath September , " etc. ; but like that most frequently repeated of all English stanzas , to which I confess that I am obliged to recur for much-needed assistance at least twelve times in every year , it may save many worthy people from being put , by ignorance , to open shame . The reasons why the Archbishop of Canterbury is the priestly head of the Church of England are the very reasons why I was particular to visit the little city from which his see takes its title . Canterbury is the cradle of English Christianity ; and not only of English Christianity , but of the Christianity of the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more for morality and for freedom than any other known to history , and more for literature and for philosophy , although not for the fine arts , than any other since the decadence of ancient Greece . It may be worth our while to glance at the events which gave this place a position so elevated and so extraordinary . Almost all names of places in England have the admirable quality of a meaning . They were given for a good reason ; and that reason , if not apparent in their modern clipped and curtailed form , may be extracted by a little patience . Very little patience is needed in the case of Canterbury , which is merely a condensed form of the " Anglo-Saxon " Cantuarabyrig ; that is , the burg , or stronghold ( " Eine feste burg ist unser Gott " ) , of the men of Kent . Kent is the part of Britain which first became English . Its position would naturally make it so , it being that part of the island which is nearest to the continent of Europe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and such history as we have of their migration from the country now known as Schleswig-Holstein tells us that in Kent ilengist and Horsa made their landing . But the Angles and the Saxons did not bring Christianity into Britain . They were heathen ; and soon extinguishing a little flame of Christianity , of Roman lighting , that they found there , they worshiped for centuries the gods whose names are upon our lips almost hourly , because they are embodied and embalmed in the Engush // names of the days of the week , which were respectively consecrated to their service . The interesting story about the English captives , whose fair faces , blue eyes , and long golden hair caused the monk Gregory to say of them , " Not Angles , but angels " ( non Angli , sed angeli ) , - to which story I referred in the first of this series of articles , as early evidence of the beauty of the English race , ' - has a direct connection with the christianizing of England , and therefore also with our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that so charmed and interested him were heathen , earnestly desired to convert them to Christianity , and set out on a mission himself for that purpose ; but he was stopped on his way to England , and he turned back to Rome , to become afterwards known as Pope Gregory the Great . But the Pope did not forget the benevolent scheme of the monk , and he sent as his apostle a priest named Augustine , who was afterwards known as St. Augustine ; albeit he was not a very saintly personage . Augustine , if he should make converts , and succeed in establishing a Christian church in England , was to be the first English bishop and archbishop . But Gregory also intended that there should be another archbishop in England , one at York ( he knew about as much of Kent and York , and of their relative positions , we may be sure , as most English bishops nowadays seem to know of New York and Chicago , and probably supposed them to be a few miles asunder ) ; and this double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more hereafter . His intention in regard to York was the consequence of the fact that the young Englishmen by whom he was so captivated came from Deira , in the then great province or kingdom of Northum bria , which included what is now Yorkshire . It was in A. n. *97 that Augustine set out upon the mission that was to have such important results , not only in England , but on the continent of Europe and in North America . He landed with his ecclesiastical suite on the Isle of Thanet , then as now the extreme eastern point of Kent , hut then , as not now , really an island ; being made so by an estuary formed by the sea and the river Stour , upon which the land has so encroached during the succeeding centuries that it has almost disappeared . The Italian priest and his followers disembarked , as Hengist and the Danes had disembarked before them , at a place called Ebbe 's Fleet , a little southwest of Margate . The word fleet is Old English for a creek or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is preserved in the name of Fleet Street in London ; that street having been so called because it passed by Fleet ditch , a little water-course which in old times had the place now held by the Thames , as the chief receptacle of the city 's sewage . Nor has the name Ebbe 's Fleet disappeared in thirteen hundred years , notwithstanding that the water which gave it its name was long ago displaced by the land . Just where Hengist and the Danes and Augustine landed , on a strip of high ground rising out of the marsh , and plainly once a little promontory , is a farm-house , known as Ebbe 's Fleet.2 Such records of the past , in its names , is one of the charms of England . All students of early English history know that Ethelbert , the king of England at that time , had a Christian wife named Bertha , the daughter of the king ( so called ) of Paris . There was then no king of France , nor for centuries afterward . Ethelbert allowed Bertha to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little chapel which stood just outside the town of Canterbury , and which had been used as a place of worship by British Christians . Whether she persuaded her husband to receive Augustine favorably is not known ; but he did so receive the missionary , and , after a conference with him in the open air at Thanet , gave him an old heathen temple near Canterbury for temporary use , and at last permitted him and his followers to worship with the queen at her chapel , which was even then called St. Martin 's . Erelong Ethelbert yielded to the power of precept and example , and received baptism ; and before the year was over , on Christmas Day , 597 , ten thousand Englishmen were baptized , two by two , in the Swale , the couples reciprocally immersing one another , at the word of command from St. Augustine . How many forefathers of those who now call themselves " Americans " thus dipped each other into Christianity it may not be within the power of statistics and the law of chances to discover . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canterbury as a dwelling , and an old pagan temple hard by for a church , building himself a new residence a few miles off , at iReculver . Christianity was thus planted in England , and Augustine , the first bishop , established his see in Canterbury , where it has remained from the year 601 to this day . Thus it is that the Archbishop of Canterbury , as the lineal successor of St. Augustine , is chief priest of the Church of England . Not only did English Christianity take its rise in Canterbury , but , as we have seen , hard by in that part of Kent was the very beginning of the English nation in the first landing there of the Saxons . Moreover , its great cathedral was the scene of a political murder which was of graver consequence to England than any other , even of a royal victim , recorded in 1 The Black Prince was not , what many suppose him to have been , a dark man . Edward of Woodstock had a fair skin , blue eyes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Archbishop of Canterbury , who was slain by partisans of Henry IT . for his resistance to the king 's encroachments ( in the interests of law and of justice ) upon the privileges of the clergy . Within the walls of this noble church lie the remains of the Black Prince , whose name and whose glory are known to all school-bred people of English race , even to those who are ignorant of his history and of his real character . ' To Canterbury went that train of pilgrims whose figures were wrought into an immortal life by the first great English poet in one of the greatest of English poems . To Canterbury came Oliver Cromwell , England 's last real king and last tyrant , and bore away from the Black Prince 's tomb the sword which had pointed the way to victory at Poictiers . There is no place in England , excepting London and Westminster , which is so enriched by memories and by memorials of the past . And yet I found intelligent , well-educated men in London and elsewhere , not thrce hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cathedral . I can understand this , for I was myself in England six weeks before I made my Canterbury pilgrimage ; and if I had been born in England to live there , I too might have postponed the journey indefinitely . I went to the Rose inn , because I had heard that it was clean , comfortable , unpretending , and old-fashioned . It deserved all those praises . No place open to the public could be less like the American notion of a hotel . On the principal street , which is narrow , and which was meant to be straight , but which happily neither street nor road in England is but for a very short distance , the snug hostelry stands , distinguished in no way from the other old but not antique houses of the neighborhood except by a lantern over the door and the name of the inn . brown hair . He was called the Black Prince from the color of the armor he usually wore . // I went in , and found sitting by an inner window of a room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other into the kitchen , a pleasant-faced woman of years between youth and middle age , who asked if I would like a room . On my answering Yes , she said , " Please walk up-stairs , sir , and the chambermaid will show you one . " I did so , and the maid met me at the first landing , and took me to a snug , clean , comfortable room , where my trunk was soon brought , and where she quickly returned with warm water ; and that was all . Oh , the ease and comfort and privacy of these English inns ! - where you are not called upon to write your name and your address in a big book for any curious idler to read , and any reporter to copy and publish , and bring upon you calls when you would be private ; where you do not perform all the offices of life , except sleeping and dressing , in the eyes of all your fellow lodgers , and of half the loungers of the neighborhood ; where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuation of the street , except the paving-stones and the carts and h&amp;rses . They would be improved by " coffee-rooms " a little more bright and cheery , for the coffee-room of an English inn on a dark , damp day is not a place of enlivening and inspiriting influence ; and by a little parlor or modest receiving room ( as unlike as possible that concentration of glare and vulgarity known to us as a hotel parlor ) , in which lodgers who have not a sitting-room could receive those whom they do not wish to ask into their bedrooms . But these are comparative trifles . A man in health who could not be contented at the Rose must have in himself the causes of his discontent . The city of Canterbury ( city in virtue of its bishop 's see ) is a small town , irregular in every way , and old-fashioned without being very antique . It lacks the effect produced , for instance , in Coventry and in Chester by houses of the sixteenth and the seventeenth century . Dwellinghouses which are , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred and flfty* years old are comparatively rare . But nearly the whole town seems to be composed of houses of about that age ; and mingled with these are the few which are older , and an unusual number of old churches and other buildings more or less ecclesiastical . These old towns in England had a never-failing charm for me ; not because of their antiquity , of which I am no blind worshiper , nor because of their beauty , for of that they commonly have very little , but because of their naturalness . They have manifestly grown , and were not made to order . Even the streets most nearly straight were plainly once paths , which are never straight . One house was built in a certain place and in a certain way , because its builder chose to build it there and in that way ; another was built in another place , in another way , because at another time another man so chose to build it ; another was built between these in another way , because its builder perhaps could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it were put up in sections by contract . There is no air of pretense , and the place seems like an aggregation of homes . The resulting difference between these towns and one in the United States is like the difference between a crowd of men , each one of whom has his individuality of feature and of expression , and an array of puppets or lay figures all cast in one mold . Over all in Canterbury rise the three towers of the great cathedral church , which dominates the city and the surrounding country . Seen from a distance , this great building seems larger than it does near by . It dwarfs the whole city , like a great growth in stone rising from amid a little bed of rubble . It is an architectural expression of the ecclesiastical supremacy which it embodies . As soon as I could do so I went to the cathedral , approaching it through a short , narrow street called Mercery Lane , which // has its name from the little shops which have lined its sides for centuries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath its lofty roof all alone . At once it took me captive ; it swallowed me up in its immensity . The effect of grandeur is much increased by the elevation of the choir to a great height above the ' floor of the nave , from which there is an ascent by a lofty and broad flight of steps . As I walked slowly up the nave and mounted this majestic stairway , the tones of the great organ and the voices of the choristers chanting the morning service fell upon my ears , seeming to come from the dusky void above my head . I found that I could not enter the choir ; the grated gates were closed . I stood and listened . The singers were invisible who were taking part in the worship from which I was shut out . Was it only by the gate ? Should I have worshiped if I had been within ? Could I have worshiped even in that sacred place as I should have done if I had come there when I was a child ? Moved by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me without , I forgot for the moment why I was there . The music rose and fell ; it swelled and soared ; and died away among the lofty arches . Breaking forth anew , it became a cry for mercy and for salvation , a passionate entreaty ' to be received into the joys of heaven . As I leaned against the iron barrier between me and the holy place within , the tones of the unseen singers pierced my heart and seemed to cleave it in sunder . But my soul did not answer to them . I knew that I was moved only by a sensuous thrill , by the vast and solemn gloom , and by the charm of sweet association . I felt that there was more between me and those sacred rites than the iron which stayed my steps . Alas ! those bars only figured to me the hard and stern realities which stood between me and those rites which I had been taught were pledges and a foretaste of the heavenly life . I might stand and look across the threshold of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an intellectual and sensuous pleasure , almost as an exhibition , I was shut out forever . At every note my heart grew sadder , and the music became to me only the requiem of a buried faith . Turning away with a sense of self-inflicted banishment , I descended the steps and wandered through the nave , musing , and oppressed even more by my thoughts and by thick-coming memories than by its grandeur , or by the sense of loneliness that came upon me in its vast silence , until the service was ended . The gates were opened . A few commonplace people came out : maiden ladies with umbrellas ; matrons with chattering children , already familiar with that which was so strange and impressive to me ; a nondescript man or two , one of whom was pale and damp and peevish . They had performed one duty , and now they went forth to others . I watched them as they passed through the door- way into the world , and then turned back to make the tour of the great church . The choir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other ecclesiastical edifice that I ever saw . It comhines in a rare degree those two great elements of architectural effect , extent and elevation . It alone is very much larger than our largest churches . Its length is one hundred and eighty feet . From the steps of the altar you look down the nave through a vista of arched stone , which stretches before you for more than five hundred feet . The grandeur of the elevation of the choir above the nave is repeated and enhanced within the choir itself by the elevation of the altar , which rises before you with a majesty which is almost oppressive . From the first entrance into this noble religious building the eye is led upward , and again upward , in long reaches of solemn beauty . The light comes to you only from above , softened and enriched by the marvelous hues of the stained // glass windows of the clere-story . With the light Caen stone of the walls and piers and arches is mingled another of a dark , rich color , which , warmly tempering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an effect of color all the more admirable because it is not excessive and does not seem to be elaborate . As I stood upon the steps of the altar , I observed that a few knots of people here and there in the choir began to approach each other ; and presently a verger in his gown , whom they were following , stepped up to me and asked if I wished to see the cathedral . The other visitors joined themselves to us , and we set off upon our round . I shall not describe what I saw , or tell what I was told . To do so would occupy at least all the space that I could ask for my whole article ; and then I should have told no more than maybe found in a good guide-book . Nor do I hold such descriptions in high estimation . They are useful to those who are just about to see the objects described ; and to those who have seen them they serve as aids to recollection . To all other persons they have really little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour I had stood by the tomb of the Black Prince , and had seen hanging over it the surcoat , the helmet , and the gauntlets that he wore at Poictiers ; I had seen Archbishop Chichely 's strange twostoried tomb , on one slab of which he is represented in health , clothed in his archiepiscopal robes and wearing his mitre , while on the other he is , by his own directions , represented in his dying state , attenuated to a skeleton ; I had looked with a sentiment of retrospective wonder and pity at the stone staircase to h Becket 's shrine , worn in hollows by the knees of the pilgrims who were obliged to ascend it painfully , in the humble attitude of prayer ; I had followed the course of the murderers of this arrogant and tyrannical priest to the place where they struck him down , and had stood over the spot where they scattered his brains upon the pavement ; and I had peered through the dim light upon the sombre beauty of that crypt , distinguished from all others even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the most extraordinary and yet most characteristic transactions of past ages . For here , in 1174 , two years after h Becket 's slaying , Henry II. , in whose interest , although not by whose command , the deed was done , did a second penance in expiation of that crime and sacrilege . After having lived upon bread and water for some days , and after walking barefooted to the cathedral , where he knelt in the transept of the murder ( called the martyrdom ) , he was led into the crypt where l* Becket 's tomb then was . Upon this he bowed his head , and , his lower garments having been removed , the king of England , a Plantagenet , received five strokes from the rod of each bishop and abbot who was present , and three from each of the eighty monks ! After this he stood the whole night barefooted upon the bare ground , resting only against one of the rude stone pillars of the crypt ; and thus he passed the whole night , fasting . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not die out for six hundred years ; and it shows us the arrogant , ungainly figure of Samuel Johnson standing in the streets of Litchfield , bareheaded and exposed to the weather , for hours , in " expiation " of an act of disrespect to his father . Perhaps even yet , among enlightened people who are freed from the sacerdotal tyranny to which Henry IL succumbed , there may be some who believe that a wrong that they have done may be atoned for by a suffering on their part which can do no good to the person they have wronged . To them I would recommend a meditation in the crypt of Canterbury cathedral . I was pleased with my verger , and I found that he was not displeased with me . He was a middle-aged man , with a fine , // intelligent face and a very pleasant manner , and he talked well as he led us from one spot of interest to another . If he had introduced himself to me as the dean , I should have accepted him as such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And yet this man expected a shilling . Had it not been for my previous experience , I should as soon have thought of offering him broken victuals . ' He evidently was pleased with the great interest in the cathedral which I could not conceal ( and why should I have concealed it ? ) , and plainly rejoiced in the questions which I alone asked ; for the rest of the group was composed of the average British Philistine ; and when I asked him to tell me where I could find three little arches , two of which were pointed and one round Norman , he led me to the spot with alacrity and a face lighted up with something like gratified vanity . Well might he be proud of his cathedral . But when , on passing a stately , elevated seat , half pulpit , half pew , he said , " The archbishop 's throne when he attends service , " the word throne grated on my ears , and I thought of Him who had not where to lay his head . After my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went alone through the precincts of the cathedral , wandering at my will , inquiring my way , and asking information as I needed it ; and always receiving the kindest attention , often from persons more or less ecclesiastical , to whom I should not have ventured to offer a shilling . In these extensive precincts , beautiful buildings in perfect preservation are mingled with , ruins which have been ruins for centuries , - pillars and arches which form aisles that now are roofless and lead no whither ; grand gateways , the only remnants of buildings to which they were We should not , however , judge him and such as he by our standard iu this matter . These gratuities are looked upon in the light of honoraria or fees , and are reckoned as a part of the regular income of the places to which they pertain . A verger receives his shilling just as Mr. Barnum once the mere entrance , and which are now put to humble uses ; libraries now in use , and the houses of the dean and chapter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the forms of which I was familiar , and the sight of which had been one of the expected pleasures of my visit , the Norman staircase leading up to the building known as the King 's School . I thought that I knew it too well to find anything surprising in it , notwithstanding my admiration ; and yet , seeing it unexpectedly as I turned a corner , I felt a little shock of delight . And why ? Why does that small structure give the eye such joy ? It is but a porch of three round arches resting upon heavy pillars , and a succession of some five or six small arches supported by graduated pillars ; the detail shows little fancy , and the workmanship little finish ; but the whole is such a beautiful imagination that among lovers of architecture it is as well known as a perfect poem is in the world of literature , or as a masterpiece of musical composition , like Beethoven 's Moonlight Sonata or the Andante of Mozart 's quartette in C , is to lovers of music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a description which should be quite correct might , like a similar description of a musical composition , apply equally well to a work the design and the informing ideas of which were utterly without beauty . That which constitutes the real charm in any work of fine art can never be described by words , although its effect may be expressed . My next visit was to St. Martin 's church , the mother church of England , the oldest ecclesiastical building in that land , the memories of which go back thirteen hundred years , and which bears in its walls memorials of a time yet receives twenty-five cents for seeing one of his shows , and with no more feeling of obligation or dependence . And as to the possible independence of a man in such a position , I had an example of that in my Windsor Castle warder . // earlier . St. Martin 's I found perched on a little hill on the outskirts of the town . The hill has been cut down around the old church , which is left standing upon a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are ancient yew-trees ; and its tower is so covered with ivy as to be almost wholly concealed . The stem of this gigantic parasite is like the trunk of a large tree . I found the same great growth at other places . We have no notion of the size to which this " vine " attains in England . The chancel end of this little church is evidently much older than the tower end ; and here it was plainly that Bertha worshiped . Not necessarily within even this older part of the building , but where that portion of it stands , and not improbably between the foundation walls . The British chapel is gone ; but in its place and on its site was built the little Early English church which now forms the chancel of St. Martin 's . Its walls are composed in part of the material of the walls of its predecessor ; red Roman tiles being built into it freely with the rubble and shale and mortar . After I had looked at the outside of this venerable memorial of English Christianity alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was directed to one of a row of small houses not far off . Thither I went , and found a kindly woman with two or three children around her , who each accepted a penny with round-eyed joy . The eldest was sent off after the goodman , while I sat talking with the goodwife in the little parlor . She was such a comfortable , cheery , simple creature , so far from pretending to be anything but what she really was , that I liked her , and homely as she was in feature I did not think her husband was long in coming with the key . The interior of the church contains little to gratify the eye . It has none of the charms of St. Andrew 's , near Windsor , or even of the characteristic evidences of antiqi.uity which I found at the old church at Harbledown , which I visited also on this day . In appearance it is the least interesting of these three churches , which are the oldest in England , and of which it is the senior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rude stone coffin and a Latin inscription , to produce the impression that Bertha 's body was entombed there ; but it lies in the great cathedral . A rude font is shown as that in which Ethelbert was baptized . It is certainly of very great antiquity ; but I observed that the upper part of it was certainly Norman work , although the lower seemed to me to be Saxon , an opinion in which I afterwards found that I had but coincided with others much better able to form an opinion on such a point ; and indeed I could have expecI*ed nothing else . Even the lower part , however , I am inclined to think is of a period much later than Ethelbert 's reign . Moreover , I suspect that he , instead of being haptized in full dress and from a font , as the friends of Voltaire 's Ingenu expected that their young convert would be , received the rite in the waters of the Stour in that perfectly natural and unadorned condition in which the Huron ( who had read only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a similar rivulet , while his priesttaught friends and sponsors fretted for him at the church in their best bibs and tuckers . The modern pilgrim to Canterbury , if he is at all interested in ancient ecclesiastical architecture and in the early history of England , should not neglect to visit Harbledown . It is but two miles away , and the view of the cathedral from the road on the return is alone well worth the little journey . The old village , apparently no larger than it was twelve hundred years ago , lies in a hollow , and is now seen by the traveler and now hidden from him , as the road rises and falls with the undulation of the country . Chaucer 's pilgrims passed through it ; and this effect of its posi // 532 A Canterbury Pilgrimage . tion is the origin of the whimsical perversion of its name by which the poet refers to it . " Wot ye not wher there stont a litel town , Which that i-.cleped is Bob-up-an-down , Under the Ble in Canterbury way ? " 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1. ) 1-Jere Lanfranc founded a lazar house or hospital , and the hospital is still there , although it has been twice rebuilt ; but the old church or chapel , where service is performed once a week , stands nearly as it was originally built , somewhat dilapidated by time , but little injured by restoration . As I neared the village I asked one or two persons that I met for the old church there ( I preferred to go about thus , inquiring my way and talking with the people ) , and I was directed to a church upon a little hill , which was indeed an ancient and an interesting building ; but after a brief examination of it I was dissatisfied both with its appearance and its position , and I learned afterwards that , venerable as it was , it lacked six hundred years of the age of that which I was seeking ! The ground about here is very irregular , and at one place the road is split into two parts , one of which , used only by wayfarers on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a steep descent to the part used by carriages . As I walked along the lower road , a carpenter , with his tools over his shoulder , called down to me , and asked me to please to tell him where Mr. Paughorn lived . With malice prepense I made him repeat his request ; for Ii always enjoyed these inquiries put to me in places where I found myself for the first time , - places three thousand miles from that 1 The origin of this perversion has not been pointed out , I believe , by any of the editors of Chaucer . Indeed , one of the latest and most eminent of them gravely remarks , " I can not find a town of that name in any map ; but it must have lain between Boughton , the place last mentioned , and Canterbnry . " The only place between Boughton and Canterbury is Harbiedown , the name of which is easily , naturally , almost inevitably corrupted into Hobble-down , a form of it which I heard where I and my kindred had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began , these inquiries , before I had been on English soil two days . In Chester , the day after my arrival , I was driven , by a heavy shower , under an old pent-house where I was soon joined by a man who was evidently a gentleman , and one who I conjectured from the cut of his jib was a " horsey " squire . We chatted as the rain poured down ; and when the clouds began to break a groom came down the street on a fine spirited horse , which he checked and irritated by his impatient handling . My temporary companion , who had received with favor a remark that I made upon the horse 's clean fetlocks and the fine fall of his haunches , who fretted almost as much as the poor beast did under his rider 's irritating hand , presently broke out to me , " Now , sir , if that was my horse , I should dismount that fellow , and discharge him on the spot ; would n't you ? " I assented . By this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go on his way , said , " And now , would you he kind enough to tell me the way to " - I forget where . I answered , " I would with pleasure , sir , but I m an entire stranger in the country . I arrived from America but yesterday . " 1-Je turned upon me a look of puzzlement and wonder , hesitated a moment , and then bade me good-morning . It was an early beginning of a series of similar experiences . But I am far away from Harbledown . I found the hospital and the old church sooner than I fear my carpenter found Mr. Pangborn . An old man was at work in a sort of garden in front of the hospital . I asked him where I should there , and which is itself suggestive of a jocose perversion . But besides this , Hob is one of the nicknames of Robert , the other being Bob . With these suggestions it would have been strange if the little town which seemed to rise and fall had not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago .

He looked me full in the face , but without any expression of intelligence , and bawled out , " I ca n't hear a word you say ! I m as deaf as a stone . But I know what you want . Just knock at that door , " and he pointed to one of two or three in the hospital . I remark here that I found many more deaf people in England than I ever met in America . I have remarked before upon the greater number of rheumatic and otherwise disabled old people that I saw there . I was soon in the old church . It is about as large upon the ground as a good-sized country school-house , but very interesting . rphe pillars and arches on one side are Norman ; on the other Early English . The roof is open timbered , like that of St. Andrew 's , but much ruder and heavier . Some pillars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ornaments which brought to mind those in Saxon missals . On the wall on one side are the shadowy remains of an ancient painting , in which the ghostly figures , life-sized , of a king and a bishop may be discerned . No place that I saw in England took me quite so far back into the past . Here , indeed , I seemed to have got before the Conqueror , and among my forefathers whom he found in England when he and the rabble of fierce robbers whom he had sharked up landed there and fought and took possession . How did I know but that upon the floor where I was standing some man or woman whose blood was flowing in my veins had knelt a thousand years ago ? It was more than possible . In the hospital are some relics ; but in those I felt little interest , and I was soon on my way back to Canterbury , where I passed the rest of the day in wandering from one old building or quaint nook to another . I did not undertake to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional guides and eschewed guidebooks . As I was walking about the town at night , I came upon a strange sight . I stood upon an elevated street , and looked down upon one lower ; which , indeed , was rather a small open place than a street . There I saw an assemblage of large wagons , most of them covered ; and there were some booth-like stands , built or in building . Here and there were lights , and figures were moving about in the darkness with lanterns . As I leaned against a railing and looked down upon this theatrical little spectacle , I turned to a man who had taken a place beside me , and asked him what this was . He told me that it was the beginning of the preparations for a fair , which was to take place in a day or two . The fair used to be an important event , but its interest had diminished , and only the lowest orders of people took any part in it . By his speech and his manner , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face , the night was so dark ; and , besides , he kept looking straight before him ) , I discovered that he was a respectable artisan , or person in that condition of life , and we soon fell into talk together . I found him intelligent and even thoughtful . The hoarse voices of men and the shriller tones of women speaking in strange accents came up to us from the lights and the wagons . I asked him who these people were , and where they came from . He did not know . They were n't Canterbury folk ; they came from the country around , no one knew whence ; some of them from far enough away . " It s sad to think , sir , that there must be such people in a country like ours ; that they must live , and that they will , one way or another . " The tone of his voice was more monotonous than that of most Englishmen ; it was the monotone of sadness . He seemed willing to talk , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , and his voice and manner suited the gloaming , gray-hued darkness . He was well enough to do himself , he said , and was always comfortable , and // had a pound or two laid by for a rainy day ; but he plainly brooded over the condition of those who were not comfortable , and who had no pound or two , and could n't get even shillings . " What is to become of them , sir ? " he said . " There are so many of them ; and there are more every year . " He always said " them , " as if he were not thinkin . , of himself or his own . " It s something that gentlemen like you , sir , know nothing about , except what you see in the newspapers ; but I m nearer to it , and I see it for myself . They call em dangerous classes ; but they re dangerous because they re poor ; and if there were n't people , many of them , so much richer than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I asked him if he . thought there was any danger to the government . " Oh , no , sir ; how could that be in England ? The government s well enough . It s a good government ; and an Englishman s a free man , and always has the law on his side . And there must be rich people and poor people ; and lords , too , for the matter of that . I do n't mind there being lords . And I know that what a man gets honestly he 's a right to keep , little or much . But what s to become of the people that get nothing , - not enough to eat ? And there s so many of them , - so many . " I asked him if he thought the matter would be helped by taking the land from the great landholders and giving it to the people . " Lord bless you , sir , no ; leastways only for a little while . Some people will get poor ; and if a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 sell his land ; he must ; and the men that have land and money too will buy more land . You ca n't stop that . " Alas ! I thought , as he uttered this truism ; this poor , sad-hearted fellow sees the inevitable law , - to him that hath shall be given , and from him that hath not shall be taken away that which he h th ; and remembering that those who had least money always , as a class , had the most children , I could say noth ing to encourage him . I suggested emigration ; but he replied , " Yes , sir , that 's all very well , although it 's a hard thing for a man to go away from the place he was born in . But to emigrate a man must have some money ; and I m thinking about the people that have n't enough to last from day to day ; and England 's full of them , and is getting fuller and fuller every year . " He had never heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s little book was not yet pnblished ; but he was plainly in sympathy with them all . Our talk became more desultory , and it was growing late . I bade him good-night . We had touched the gravest question of the day for England , the crucial question of the time , and we parted without having seen each other 's faces . We were one to the other only a voice speaking out of the darkness . The next day I went again to the cathedral . The gloomy sky of the night had harbingered a heavy mass of clouds which were now descending in a copious but fine and gentle rain . The cathedral was deserted . Even the verger was not there . He was represenfed by his daughter , a pretty , slender girl . He had evidently remembered my interest when he went home ; for she stepped up to me , and asked with a little emphasis , " Would you like to see the cathedral agaiis , sir ? " I said Yes , of course ; and she went with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All at once the wish arose to be there without even her attendance ( there was not another person in sight ) , and I asked her , with no expectation of consent , if she could not let me go in by myself . She looked at me a moment with sweet , steady blue eyes , and said , " I think I may let you go , sir . " She shut the gate behind me . As I turned away I heard the key creak and the bolt shot . Then a great silence fell upon me ; I walked slowly on until I stood before the high altar ; and there I was , alone in that dim magnificence. // I made little use of my liberty . I was not there to mouse among antiquities , or to study architecture . Details seemed petty to me enveloped in that vastness , and whelmed in the flood of those associations . I did go to the Black Prince 's tomb , and , although I am no relic-monger , as I stood by it I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even that glove would have done something toward bridging the gap of five centuries , and placing me by Edward 's side at Poictiers . I wish that I had asked that blue-eyed girl if I might do so . I verily believe the good creature would have helped me to a ladder . But I soon wandered back to the great altar , and sat down upon the steps . The day was dark , and notwithstanding the pale color of the walls the vast space was fl*led with the dusk of twilight . I did not people this grand gloom with figures ; and indeed I doubt if that is ever done by any one ; but I did think , as on the day before I could not have thought , of all the much good and the little ill to me and mine of which that noble church was a sign and a witness . Here Chaucer 's pilgrims came ; but what was their pilgrimage to mine ! They made a three or four days ' journey to do , for their own profit , reverence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had come three thousand miles to stand upon the spot wbere my people were born to civilization and baptized into Christianity . But for what happened here and hard by I should have been , not a savage , indeed , nor a heathen , because the world has taken all men on in the course of thirteen hundred years , but something other than I am ; and I fear not something better . For me there might have been no Alfred , no Chaucer , no Wicliffe , no Sidney , no Bacon , no Shakespeare , no Milton , no English Bible , no Bunyan , no habeas corpus , no bill of rights , no English law ; and what a man is , who does more than eat and sleep and wear apparel out , depends hardly more upon the nature that he has inherited from his forefathers than upon what they did for him . A man is a result , - result of forces which were tending toward him centuries before he appeared ; a result over which his own will and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus sitting alone in Christ Church at Canterbury , I felt that I was near what was for me , except as a mere animal , the beginning of all things , - certainly the beginning of all things good . But I was to leave the town that afternoon , and calling my pretty portress I walked with her for a little while under the gray arches , and then said good-by . At the Rose , when I told my friend who sat by the window that I was going directly , and by such a train , she said , " Oh , I m sorry ; our bus does n't go to that train . " I then asked her to get me a fly . " Oh , no , sir , " she said , " no need of that . I 'll send to the - naming another inn and get them to send their bus here for you . Cost you only sixpence , sir . " Did any one of my readers ever have his sixpences or even his dollars looked after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheery good-by from this good housekeeper , I got into the rival bus , and was soon at the station . Not until I had bought my ticket , did I discover that I had left my hat at the Rose . I had put on my traveling hat in my room , and in my haste had forgotten my chimney-pot . It was the identical preposition which had excited the professional jealousy of the Surrey hatter . I could not do without it . Looking at my watch , I found that I had twelve minutes before the arrival of my train . I hailed the fly with the best-looking horse , and told the driver , " Double fare to get me to the Rose and back again , for the next train . " We dashed through old Coventry at a pace that would have astonished Chaucer 's Prioress , and did somewhat alarm some good Kentish women . At the inn my hurried entrance caused great surprise ; but I had hardly said what              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
