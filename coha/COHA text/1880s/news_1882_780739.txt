txt It has been ascertained that the net income of the Post Office Department for the fiscal year which ended on June 30 , 1882 , was about $1,500,000 ? that is , not only did the receipts meet all expenditures , but they exceeded the expenditures by $1,500,000 . It was announced some time ago in THE TIMES that the surplus would reach at least $1,000,000 . It is now certain that $500 , - 000 may be added to this estimate . The official statement will probably not be completed until Oct. 15 . The department , therefore , not only paid its way in the year just ended , but earned $1,500,000 in addition . From 1790 , the earliest date at which the exact financial condition of the Post Office Department is accessible , down to 1838 , an excess of expenditures over receipts was rarely known , and the deficiency , if any occurred , was trifling . With the introduction of railway mail service , in 1838 , a tendency toward a permanent excess of expenditure was first manifested . This tendency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid business basis . A reduction of receipts was caused in 1845 by the reduction of the rates of letter postage , but with the exception of 1848 , when the expenditures exceeded the receipts by $165,772 , the balance at the close of each fiscal year until 1852 was in favor of the department . The reduction of letter and other rates in 1851 , and a departure from the theory which had governed the department , resulting partly from emigration and the discovery of gold in California , made an annual deficiency thereafter the rule rather than the exception . The deficiency increased until in 1860 it amounted to more than $10,500,000 . The war increased the postal revenues and reduced the department 's expenditures in the Southern States ; the deficiencies decreased . In 1863 the expenditures exceeded the receipts by $2,800,000 . In 18 ( 14 the deficit was only $ ' 110,000 , and in 1805 there was a surplus of earnings over expenses amounting to $860,000 . After the war , deficiencies became the rule . In 1867 the deficit was nearly $4,000,000 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total receipts , was the same . From that time , however , the revenues greatly increased , and in 1880 the deficit was only 10 per cent . of the revenues . Not only was the surplus of receipts over expenditures in the last fiscal year $1,5i3O,000 , but the department did not expend about $2,000,000 of the amount appropriated for star service . The amount appropriated was $7,900,000 . Brady estimated that he must have $8,200,000 , but Congress gave him $7,900,000 , It now appears that under honest management the expenditure was about $5,900,000 , or $2,300,000 less than Brady 's estimate . The surplus of $1,500,000 is almost exactly the sum saved per annum by Postmaster-General James by cutting down , or entirely cutting off , Brady 's expedite 1 , useless , and fraudulent star service . It is safe to say that the department could not have been self-supporting in the year 1852 if he had not done this . Ho did it , and did it fearlessly , in the face of many obstacles , and one of the results is a self-supporting Post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the year .
