txt The colored people in this State are considerably stirred up by the statement made in the evidence given by Congressman John S. Wise before the Sherman committee investigating the Danville riots . Mr. Wise is reported as having said that when colored members of the Virginia Legislature came to his house to consult him they always went to his kitchen . This has been accepted by some of the colored people as a reflection upon the legislative Representatives of their race . Mr. Wise owes his election to Congress principally to the support of the colored voters , who gave him more than three-fifths ot all the votes cast for him . In the Virginia House of Delegates to-day 5 colored Coalition members of that body rose to personal privilege in connection with the reference made to colored members by Mr. Wise . Delegate Harris , of Dinwiddie , one of the most intelligent colored men in the State , said : " As a member of the General Assembly of Virginia , I will say that when I go to see a gentleman on business I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of business where any other gentleman would be received , and not be asked to go in his kitchen . IC Mr. Wise meant what he said it had no reference to me , I or I do not know where he lives  --  I could not find his house except by direction , and I am not one of that number that saw him in his kitchen . " . Mr. Bland , of Surr2. - , speaking on the same subject , was very pointed and seemed to wish the House to hear every word he uttered . Said he : " I have never sought Mr. Wise in his kitchen . Two years ago if I wanted to see Mr. Wise I could have seen Min upon this floor , where he was frequently . " The Speaker evidently referred to the last session ot the Legislature , when Mr. Wise was often in the hall 01 the house in consultation with members about matters of party ' policy . Scott , Dodson , and Griffin , three more colored members , also disclaimed any acquaintanceship with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that when they go I o see Mr. Wii-J3 they will not go to his kitchen . The remarks of the colored members were reeeived , by the Democratic members with evident signs of pleasure . At times they were greeted with loud laughter from that side . Four negro members made no remarks .
