txt The prosecution of five Professors in the Andover Theological Seminary for breach of trust will be resumed before the Board of Visitors next week , when the plaintiffs will present their charges in an amended form , and tihe proceedings will be directed against the defendants separately instead of jointly . Discussion of the subject in the religious press promises to become acrimonious . One of the accusers , the Rev. Dr. DEXTER , of the Congregationalist , resents an assertion that " the odious theological methods of the fifteenth century are being revived " for the purpose of " crushing " the offending Professors , and publishes a card which contains the following : " I beg to say that the only suit against those gentlemen to which I am a party , and the only one which I know anything about , is a friendly one , to determine whether or not they are guilty of perhaps the most stupendous breach of trust of a century not unmarked by such crimes . " If a suit whose object is to oust from their chairs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground that they have been guilty of " perhaps the most stupendous breach of trust of a century " be a " friendly " one , what would an unfriendly suit be ? The counts in the complaint filed by Dr. DEXTER and his associates are affirmations . The accusers undoubtedly believe that they are true , and undoubtedly believe that the defendants are guilty . The proceedings are not taken in order that it may be shown whether or not the teachings of the Professors are warranted by the Scriptures , but the charge , as we understand it , is that the Professors have been dishonest in that they have deliberately broken their pledges and are drawing salaries which were provided upon carefully specified conditions , which they accepted and have since willfully violated . ' Nevertheless , at least one of the prosecutors regards this as a " friendly " suit . The Christian Union , which was on the liberal side in the contest about the qualifications of missionaries , asserts that the accusers in this case have framed their complaint upon the principle that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opponent 's opinions , to give to his lan . guage that construction which will make it most odious to others , and to construct opinions for him by making deductions from his opinions and then imputing those deductions to him in spite of his denials . It adds : " This is not Christian controversy . It is a method which has long since been abandoned by scientists in scientific discussion , by statesmen in political campaigns , by the leaders of the Bar in legal controversies . It should be left by theologians to the unscrupulous political campaigners and the lower class of criminal lawyers . It does not belong to the Church of CHRIST . " We are not aware that the accused Professors are making a premature defense , although the students of the last class have been moved to declare publicly that the charges preferred by the complainants are false . But some of those who sympathize with the accused have made explanations in their defense . One of these explanations published in a journal that is Said to represent the opinions of persons who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is perfectly safe to say that there is not a man living in the world who believes all the articles of this creed in the exact sense in which they were intended by the founders . There may be some persons who would say that they believed it all in this exact sense for the sake of the income from the funds . but no one accuses the Professors of being that sort of men , nor do the Professors make any pretense that they so believe it . They accept it for substance of doctrine . ' This may strike some persons as not being ' a very dignified or manly way , but it is certainly not dishonest , for they do not pretend to believe anything which they do not believe . " Surely it is to be hoped that the Professors have a better defense than this . The Christian , Union , friendly to the accused , says that the decision will " depend upon the question whether-the judges are strict or liberal constructionists . We do not see , " continues that paper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old ' ndover can be reconciled with a strict construction of the creed , and the one is quite as incongruous with that creed as the other . " While the accusers are amending their complaint they may wish that the Rev. JOHN P. GULLIVER , who bolds at Andover the chair of Relations of Christianity to the Secular Sciences , had been made a defendant with the five editors of the Andover Review . At a meeting of Congregational ministers , held two or three weeks ago , Prof. GULLIVER read a paper in which he declared that it was his duty and the duty of those who were present " first of all to protest against the horrible theology which deliberately asserts that GOD is ? creating men by thousands of millions and sending them into endless perdition for not doing what they are , for every reason , incapable to do . If our sympathies , " he added , " are with either of the parties to this uncanny controversy , they shouldbe with those who , at any expense of inconsistency , are at-. tempting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than with those who are willing to save their theology at the expense of their piety .
