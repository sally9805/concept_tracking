THE DEFEAT OF THE PEACE PARTY AT THE POLLS . THE reverses sustained by the Union arms during the summer and autumn of 1862 had their direct effect in the field of politics . Every unsuccessful movement , and especially every defeat of the National forces , increased the strength and the audacity of the opposition to the Government and the war . There were , it is true , hundreds of thousands of Democratic soldiers in the ranks fighting to uphold the Union ; and as a result of this - because men s sentiments are far more influenced by their actions than their actions are inspired by their sentiments - they were generally induced to take the Republican view of public affairs , and by degrees to unite themselves with the Republican party . But they seemed to exert no influence whatever upon their friends and reI When Mr. Lincoln first heard of Vallandigham 's return he wrote a joint letter to Governor Brough and General Heintzelman , who had succeeded Burnside in command of the department , directing them to " consult together freely ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palpable injury or imminent danger to the military proceeding from him , them , or any of them , arrest all implicated ; otherwise do not arrest without further order . Meanwhile report the signs to me from time to time . ' But , after writing the letter , he concluded not to send it . Unpublished MS. , June 20 , 1864 . He was , in fact , a little nonpiused by Vallandigham 's return . He had seriously thought of annulling the sentence of exile , but had been too much occupied with other matters to do it . After he had returned , the President said : " The only question to decide was whether he could afford to disregard the contempt of authority and breach of discipline displayed in Vallandigham*s VOL . XXXVIII. - 19. lations at home . The Democratic party remained as solid in its organization , as powerful in its resistance to the Government , as ever . The great liberating measure of the President , the proclamation of September , had its influence also in exasperating and consolidating the opposition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but glorifies the age in which he lived , contributed to the defeat of his party in some of the most important States of the Union . In the autumn of 1862 the Democrats carried New York , electing Horatio Seymour governor over that patriotic and accomplished gentleman , General James S. XVadsworth ; the adjoining State of New Jersey was also carried by them . There were heavy losses of congressmen in the great States of Pennsylvania , Ohio , and Indiana ; and even in the President 's own State of Illinois the opposition inflicted upon him a peculiarly painful defeat , electing nine of his opponents and only four of his friends . The Union sentiment was still sufficiently powerful throughout the North to elect an easy working majority in the House of Representatives , and the Republican predominance in the Senate was , of course , untouched ; so that so far as legislation was concerned there was no danger that the Government would be embarrassed by an opposition majority . But the losses it met with in the elections were none the less serious and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not long be carried on by the will of the Government , and if the ratio of losses indicated by the elections of 1862 had continued another year the permanency of the Republic would have been gravely compromised . But the intelligence of the American people gradually acknowledged the wisdom and accepted the leadership of the President , and moved forward to the advanced platform upon which Mr. Lincoln had placed himself . The right of suffrage given by the State legislatures to the soldiers in the field reenforced the voting strength of the Republicans action ; otherwise , it could not but result in benefit to the Union cause to have so violent and indiscreet a man go to Chicago as a firebrand to his own party . " Fernando Wood had told him that he could do nothing more politic than to bring Vallandigham back . " In that case , " be said , " he could promise him two Democratic candidates for the Presidency this year . These war Democrats , " said Mr. Wood , " are scoundrelly hypocrites ; they want to oppose you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are but two sides in this fight - yours and mine ; war and peace . You will succeed while the war lasts , I expect , but we shall succeed when the war is over . I intend to keep my record clear for the future . " 2 McPherson , " History of the Rebellion , " p. 176. 3 The Illinois Democrats were greatly troubled by Vallandigham 's apparition . W. R. Morrison said to J. H. , June i8 , " How much did you fellows give Fernandy Wood for importing him ? " J. H. , Diary. // at home , and the ballot and the bullet worked harmoniously together . Nevertheless , in the autumn of 1862 Mr. Lincoln was exposed to the bitterest assaults and criticisms from every faction in the country . His conservative supporters reproached him with having yielded to the wishes of the radicals ; the radicals denounced him for being hampered , if not corrupted , by the influence of the conservatives . On one side he was assailed by a clamor for peace , on the other by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war . He stood unmoved by these attacks , converging upon him from every quarter , and rarely took the trouble to defend himself against them . Coming from every side , the pressure neutralized itself , like that of the atmosphere . To one friend who assailed him with peculiar candor , he made a reply which may answer as a sufficient defense to all the radical attacks which were so rife at the time . I have just received and read your letter of the 20th . The purport of it is that we lost the late elections , and the Administration is failing because the war is unsuccessful , and that I must not flatter myself that I am not justly to blame for it . I certainly know that if the war fails , the Administration fails , and that I will be blamed for it , whether I deserve it or not . And I ought to be blamed , if I could do better . You think I could do better ; therefore you blame me already . I think I could not do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I understand you now to be willing to accept the help of men who are not Republicans , provided they have " heart in it . " - Agreed . I want no others . But who is to be the judge of hearts , or of " heart in it " ? If I must discard my own judgment , and take yours , I must also take that of others ; and by the time I should reject all I should be advised to reject , I should have none left , Republicans or others - not even yourself . For be assured , my dear sir , there are men who have " heart in it " that think you are performing your part as poorly as you think I am performing mine . I certainly have been dissatisfied with the slowness of Buell and McClellan ; but before I relieved them I had great fears I should not find successors to them who would do better ; and I am sorry to add , that I have seen little since to relieve those fears . I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I fear we shall at last find out the difficulty is in our case rather than in particular generals . I wish to disparage no one-certainly not those who sympathize with me ; but I must say I need success more than I need sympathy , and that I have not seen the so much greater evidence of getting success from my sympathizers than from those who are denounced as the contrary . It does seem to me that in the field the two classes have been very much alike in what they have done and what they have failed to do . In sealing their faith with their blood , Baker , and Lyon , and Bohlen , and Richardson , Republicans , did all that men could do ; but did they any more than Kearney , Stevens , and Reno , and Mansfield , none of whom were Republicans , and some at least of whom have been bitterly and repeatedly denounced to me as secession sympathizers ? I will not perform the ungrateful task of comparing cases of failure . In answer to your question , Has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently proved as a fact , that from the commencement of the war the enemy was continually supplied with information by some of the confidential subordinates of as important an officer as AdjutantGeneral Thomas ? I must say " No , " as far as my knowledge extends . And I add that if you can give any tangible evidence upon the subject , I will thank you to come to this city and do so.1 The movements for peace which were made at this period on both sides of the line were feeble and without result . Mr. Foote of Tennessee introduced a resolution in the Confederate House of Representatives to the effect " that the signal success with which Divine Providence has so continually blessed our arms for several months past would fully justify the Confederate Government in dispatching a commissioner or commissioners to the Government at Washington City , empowered to propose the terms of a just and honorable peace . " Mr. Holt of Georgia offered as a substitute a resolution setting forth that the people of the Confederate States have been always anxious for peace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall manifest alike anxiety it should be the duty of the President of the Confederate States to appoint commissioners to treat upon the subject . " But both resolution and substitute were laid on the table by a large majority . In the Senate of the United States Mr. Garrett Davis offered a resolution 2 recommending to the States to choose delegates to a convention to be held at Louisville , Kentucky , to take into consideration the condition of the United States and the proper means for a restoration of the Union ; this was laid upon the table . Mr. Vallandigham also offered resolutions for peace in the House of Representatives ; but neither in the North nor in the South was there at that time a party sufficiently powerful to bring any measures for peace to the point of legislation , though on both sides there was a strong current of agitation for the termination of the war , which , being regarded and treated as treasonable , was easily held in check . From time to time there were unauthorized attempts of individuals , inspired by restlessness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amateur negotiations for peace . One of the most active and persistent of the peace politicians of the North was Fernando Wood of New York . He held a unique position in his party . While strongly sympathizing with the secessionists , and openly affiliating with them in public , he 1 Lincoln to Schurz , Nov. 24 , 1862 . MS. // 39 nevertheless tried to keep up a sort of furtive confidential relation with the leading members of the Government . He frequently visited the White House , the State Department , and the Treasury Department , but emulated the discretion of Nicodemus as to the hour of his visits . No rebuffs daunted him ; he apparently cared nothing for the evident distrust with which his overtures were received . He kept them up as long as the war lasted , probably in the hope that the time might come for him to play a conspicuous and important part in the final negotiations for peace . He used every occasion to ingratiate himself with the President . He wrote , congratulating him on the change in the War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President 's " ability to govern , and also his executive power and will . " 1 Later in the same year he wrote complaining that the radical abolitionists of New York represented him as hostile to the Administration and as in sympathy with the States in rebellion against the Government . He denied these charges , and begged the President to " rely upon his support in his efforts to maintain the integrity of the Union . " 1 In September , after making a speech ftmriously denouncing the Government for its arbitrary arrests , he wrote a confidential note to the President , making the usual explanation that he had been incorrectly reported : " All I said applied to those arrests that had been made through error or misrepresentation , and exclusively as to the truly loyal . " In November , after a similar tirade , he wrote to Mr. Seward , with a striking lack of originality , making the same plea of an incorrect report . " I did not , " he said , " utter the treasonable sentiments reported . " Having in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the confidence of the President , he wrote him a letter on the 8th of December , 1862 , pretending that he had " reliable and truthful authority " to say that the Southern States would send representatives to the next Congress provided that a full and general amnesty should permit them to do so , no guaranty or terms being asked for other than the amnesty referred to . As an humble but loyal citizen he said , deeply impressed with the great necessity of restoring the Union of these States , I ask your immediate attention to this subject . The magnitude of the interests at stake warrant some executive action predicated upon this information , if it be only to ascertain if it be grounded upon even probable foundation . If it shall prove groundless no harm shall have been done provided the inquiry be made , as it can be , without compromising the Government or injury to the cause in which it is now engaged . If , however , it shall prove well founded , there is no estimate too high to place upon its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Rebellion , " p. 296 . The immediate object of his letter became evident in the following paragraph : Now , therefore , Mr. President , I suggest that gentlemen whose former political and social relations with the leaders of the Southern revolt sic may be allowed to hold unofficial correspondence with them on this subject  --  the correspondence to be submitted to you . It may be thus ascertained what , if any , credence may be given to these statements , and also whether a peaceful solution of the present struggle may not be attainable.2 The President answered on the i 2th of December . Referring to the first paragraph above quoted , he said : I strongly suspect your information will prove to be groundless ; nevertheless , I thank you for communicating it to me . Understanding the phrase in the paragraph above quoted , " the Southern States would send representatives to the next Congress , " to be substantially the same as that the people of the Southern States would cease resistance , and would re-inaugurate , submit to , and maintain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Constitution of the United States , I say that in such case the war would cease on the part of the United States , and that if , within a reasonable time , " a full and general amnesty " were necessary to such end , it would not be withheld . I do not think it would be proper now for me to communicate this formally or informally to the people of the Southern States . My belief is that they already know it ; and when they choose , if ever , they can communicate with me unequivocally . Nor do I think it proper now to suspend military operations to try any experiment of negotiation . I should nevertheless receive with great pleasure the exact information you now have , and also such other as you may in any way obtain . Such information might be more valuable before the st of January than afterwards . These last words refer , of course , to the impending proclamation of emancipation . Between the date of Mr. Lincoln 's letter and Mr. Wood 's reply came the frightful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the President 's reply had filled him with profound regret . It declines he said what I had conceived to be an innocent effort to ascertain the foundation for information in my possession of a desire in the South to return to the Union . It thus appears to be an indication on your part sic to continue a policy which , in my judgment , is not only unwise , but , in the opinion of many , is in conflict with the constitutional authority vested in the Federal Government . He protested earnestly against this policy , and felt encouraged to renew the suggestions of his letter of the 8th . I feel he said that military operations so bloody and exhausting as ours must sooner or later be suspended . The day of suspension must come . The // only question is whether it shall be before the whole American people , North and South , shall be involved in general ruin , or whether it shall be whilst there is remaining sufficient of the recuperative element of life by which to restore our once happy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President made no reply . Other volunteers from time to time tendered their services in the same field . Mr. Duff Green , a Virginia politician , wrote to the President from Richmond as early as the 20th of January , asking permission to visit Washington . He said that if he could see Mr. Lincoln and converse with him on the subject he could do much to pave the way for an early termination of the war . Receiving no encouragement from Washington , he asked the same permission from Richmond , but this request came to nothing . In the summer of 1863 , however , an effort for peace negotiations was made , which came with such high sanction and involved personages of such individual and political importance that it requires particular mention . About the middle of June , Mr. Alexander H. Stephens , Vice-President of the Southern Confederacy , became convinced that the time was auspicious for initiating negotiations for peace . He thought he saw reasons for great encouragement in the attitude of the North ; the great gains of the Democratic party in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ticknor Curtis attacking the measures of the Administration , a public meeting in favor of peace held without disturbance in the city of New York in which violent speeches were made by Mr. Fernando Wood and others , and the nomination for governor of Ohio of Vallandigham are all mentioned by him1 as facts going to show that the people of the North were wearying of the war . On this insufficient evidence he wrote to Mr. Davis proposing that he should go to Washington , ostensibly to negotiate some questions involving the exchange of prisoners , but saying that he " was not without hopes that indirectly he could now turn attention to a general adjustment , upon such basis as might ultimately be acceptable to both parties , and stop the further effusion of blood in a contest so irrational , unchristian , and so inconsistent with all recognized American principles . " He assured Mr. Davis that he entertained but one idea of the basis of final adjustment-the recognition of the sovereignty of the States , and the right of each in its sovereign capacity to determine its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was yet ripe for such acknowledgment , but he did believe that the time had come for a proper presentation of the question to the authorities at Washington . " While , therefore , " he says , " a mission might be dispatched on a minor point , the greater one could possibly , with prudence , discretion , and skill , be opened to view and brought in discussion , in a way that would lead eventually to successful results . This would depend upon many circumstances , " he adds complacently , " but no little upon the character and efficiency of the agent . So feeling , I have been prompted to address you these lines . " Upon the receipt of this letter Mr. Davis sent a telegram requesting his Vice-President to go immediately to Richmond . He arrived there on the 22d of June ; but in the ten days which had elapsed since his letter was written he found that changes of the utmost importance had taken place in the military situation . On the one hand the Confederate authorities had despaired of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day might bring them tidings of his surrender , but on the other hand they were anticipating with sanguine enthusiasm the most magnificent results from Lee 's invasion of Pennsylvania . Mr. Stephens , in the work which he wrote at his leisure after the war was ended , represents that in these changed conditions he was inclined to give up his mission , thinking that no good could result from it , as the movement of Lee into Pennsylvania would greatly excite the war spirit and strengthen the war party - a view of the case in which Mr. Davis positively declined to agree . He thought Mr. Lincoln would be more likely to receive a commissioner for peace if General Lee 's army was actually threatening Washington than if it was lying quietly south of the Rappahannock . The Confederate Cabinet being called together , they agreed with Mr. Davis ; they thought the Federal Government might be best approached while under the threat of the guns of Lee , and before they should receive fresh hope and encouragement from the surrender of Pemberton , which was now considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by land on the route taken by Lee 's army , and to communicate with the Washington authorities from his headquarters ; 2 but excessive rains and the badness of the roads caused a change of route , and the invalid Vice-President was therefore saved a most distressing journey , from which he would have come " bootless home and weather-beaten back . " Mr. Mallory , the Secretary of the Confederate Navy , gave him a small steamer , and accompanied by Mr. Robert Ould as his secretary , he steamed away to Fort Monroe . In any case his mission 1 Stephens , " War between the States , " Vol . II. , 2 Stephens , " War between the States , " Vol . II. , p. 558. p. 566. // would probably have been fruitless , but he states only the truth when he claims that he arrived at an unlucky moment . He communicated with Admiral Lee in Hampton Roads on the Fourth of July , just after Lee 's march to the North had ended in disastrous failure at Gettysburg . He sent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a communication in writing from Jefferson Davis , Commanderin-Chief of the Confederate land and naval forces , to Abraham Lincoln , Commander-inChief of the Army and Navy of the United States , " and that he desired to proceed directly to Washington in his own steamer , the Tor5edo . The titles by which Mr. Lincoln and Mr. Davis were designated in this note had been the subject of anxious consultation in Richmond . Stephens 's commission from the Confederate President gave Mr. Lincoln the title above quoted to avoid the necessity of claiming the style of President for Mr. Davis ; but in case Mr. Lincoln should stand upon his dignity and refuse the letter addressed to him as Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy , Mr. Davis had prepared for Mr. Stephens a duplicate letter addressed to Mr. Lincoln as President and signed by Mr. Davis in the same style ; if to this letter objections were made , on the ground that Mr. Davis was not recognized to be President of the Confederacy , Mr. Stephens 's mission was then to be at an end , " as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admissible only on a footing of perfect equality . " But all this care , foresight , and punctilio went for nothing . As soon as Mr. Lincoln received the telegram in which Admiral Lee announced to the Secretary of the Navy the arrival of Mr. Stephens , he immediately wrote on the back of the dispatch a note to be sent by Mr. Welles to Admiral Lee , in which , without paying any attention whatever to the style of Mr. Stephens 's application , he went directly to the heart of the matter . This draft of an order ran : You will not permit Mr. Stephens to proceed to Washington or to pass the blockade . He does not make known the subjects to which the communication in writing from Mr. Davis relates , which he bears and seeks to deliver in person to the President , and upon which he desires to confer . Those subjects can only be military , or not military , or partly both . Whatever may be military will be readily received if offered through the well understood military channel . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered , as in this case , in terms assuming the independence of the socalled Confederate States , and anything will be re . ceived and carefully considered by him when offered by any influential person , or persons , in terms not assuming the independence of the so-called Confederate States.1 This note he afterwards evidently considered as entering too much into detail , and he therefore caused the Secretary of the Navy to send this brief reply to Admiral Lee : The request of A. H. Stephens is inadmissible . The customary agents and channels are adequate for all needful communication and conferences between the United States forces and the insurgents . Mr. Stephens , when he came afterwards to relate the history of this abortive mission , 2 frankly admitted that his ulterior purpose was not so much to act upon Mr. Lincoln and the then ruling authorities at Washington as through them , when the correspondence should be published , upon the great mass of the people in the Northern States , who were becoming , he thought , so sensitively alive to the great danger of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deeply impress the growing constitutional party at the North with a full realization of the true nature and ultimate tendencies of the war " ; to show them " that the surest way to maintain their liberties was to allow us the separate enjoyment of ours . " Though this hope was baffled by the rebuff which Mr. Stephens received at Fort Monroe , which prevented him from laying before his sympathizing friends of the North his view of their endangered liberties and the best means of preserving them , it may be doubted whether the partisans of peace at the North lost anything by this incident . Certainly , throughout the whole summer of 1863 , they fought their losing battle with a courage and a determination equal to that which their sympathizers were displaying in the South . But the very energy and malice with which they carried on the contest roused the loyal people of the North to still greater efforts and increased the dimensions of their ultimate triumph . The election in New Hampshire , the first which took place in the spring of 1863 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painful evidence of the bitter hostility of the Democratic party to the prosecution of the war . Senator Daniel Clark , writing to Mr. Lincoln , 3 said : Scarcely a Democrat supported the Administration . Almost every one who had heretofore avowed himself for the Union and the country turned in for peace and party . Yet we have beaten them . They have retired from the field . The two houses in convention will choose a Republican governor , and Frank Pierce in retirement will not have beaten Abraham Lincoln in office . There were after this , during the summer and early autumn , moments of depression and discouragement in which it seemed that the malignant energy displayed by the opposition 1 Lincoln , autograph MS. 2 Stephens , " War between the States , " Vol . II. , p. 561 . S March 13 . MS. // could not be without disastrous effect , and as the day of election drew near in the " October States " both sides felt justified in renewing their utmost efforts . In Pennsylvania the contest presented features of special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governor of the State , had given not only efficient but enthusiastic support to the war , was opposed by Judge George W. Woodward , who , as one of the Democratic justices of the Supreme Court of the State , had just aimed a blow at the prosecution of the war which would have been fatal if followed up and sustained by other courts . He had declared the enrollment law unconstitutional , and upon the record thus made had been nominated for governor . The friends of Mr. Curtin relied on the war spirit to carry their candidate through , and towards the close of the campaign they claimed , most unjudiciously , that General McClellan , whose popularity was still great among the Democrats of Pennsylvania , was in favor of the election of Curtin , with whom he had always sustained friendly personal relations . Just on the eve of election this matter came to the attention of McClellan . Desiring to keep his political standing with his party intact , he sought an interview with Judge Woodward and published a letter declaring that , " having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that their views agreed , and that he regarded his election as governor of Pennsylvania called for by the interests of the nation . " 2 But even this dilatory rei*nforcement of the peace party was not enough to save their canvass ; the Republicans of the State were as thoroughly alive to the emergency as their opponents , and the vote polled was greater by many thousands than had ever been cast before . Governor Curtin was reUected by a majority of over fifteen thousand , and Chief-Justice Lowrie , who with Woodward had aimed from the bench the most mischievous blow ever dealt at the enrollment bill , was defeated for redection by Daniel Agnew , and the court , thus reconstituted , reversed its previous judgment . In Ohio the contest was marked with equal bitterness and enthusiasm . The Democrats , working against hope , but with undaunted persistency for their banished candidate , Vallandigham , were buried under the portentous 1 To show how the political emergency overcame the most inveterate personal hostilities , we give a characteristic letter which Simon Cameron wrote to Lincoln Septemher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reelected , and that all his friends would support him , but that " if the result were to operate simply on his own private fortunes , there are many good Republicans and pious Christians who would see him in - first . He will cheat us when it is over , and , if he can , sell us to our enemies . But he is now , by one of those accidents which sometimes control great events , the repmajority of one hundred thousand votes . This overwhelming triumph of the Union party in the October States made success certain in the general election of the next month . The tide had turned , and the current now swept steadily onward in one way . The great State of New York , which had been shaken to its center by the frightful crimes and excitement incident to the draft riots , now witnessed a great popular political reaction ; and reversing the majority of ten thousand given to Seymour in 1862 , the Republican State ticket was elected by thirty thousand , and the legislature also passed into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was dearest to the heart of the President was that attained in Maryland . The second passage of rebel armies over her territory seemed at last to have purged the secession sentiment from that State , and four Unionists out of her five districts were elected to Congress , and an emancipation State ticket was carried by twenty thousand majority . Throughout the West the Union sentiment asserted itself with irresistible strength . An attempt marked with singular boldness and energy had been made during the year by the leaders of the peace party to gain control of the great States of the North-west , which for a time seemed to them so promising that the rebel emissaries in Canada , being informed of it , gave encouragement to their principals in Richmond to hope for the formation of a North-western Confederacy in opposition to the National Government . Meetings were continually held , secret societies were everywhere active , and every effort was made in public and in private to form a basis of organized hostility against the Government . The culmination of this important and dangerous movement may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the *7th of June . A great mass meeting , enormous in numbers and wild with enthusiasm , under the presidency of Senator Richardson , listened during all a summer 's day to the most furious and vehement oratory , and at last passed resolutions demanding nothing less than submission to the South . They resolved " that a further offensive prosecution of this war tends to subvert the Constitution and the Government , and entails upon this nation all the disastrous conseresentative of the loyalty of this State , and his defeat might be disastrous to the country . My heart is too much engaged in the struggle for ending the rebellion to allow me to hesitate at even the support of Mr. Curtin. " 2 This letter of McClellan was a severe disappointment to Curtin , who had regarded him as his friend . A friend ( now Sir John Puleston , M. P. ) who was with him when the newspaper containing McClellan 's letter was received said , " El tu , Bride ! ' was not a circumstance to it . " J. H. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they were " in favor of peace upon a basis of restoration of the Union " ; for the accomplishment of which they proposed " a national convention to settle upon terms of peace , which should have in view the restoration of the Union as it was , and the securing by constitutional amendment of such rights of the several States and people thereof as honor and justice demand . " This bold challenge was accepted by the Republicans with equal determination and superior means . The guns of Vicksburg and of Gettysburg might have been regarded as sufficient answer to the resolutions of the Springfield mass meeting , but the Copperheads ' of that State only clamored the louder for peace after these great victories , and the political canvass went on with tenfold vehemence in the tacit truce of arms that followed the battles of July . The Republicans prepared for the beginning of September the greatest mass meeting of the campaign ; and to give especial significance to the occasion , it was to take place at the home of Lincoln , on the very spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in June . It was the ardent wish of the Illinois Republicans that Mr. Lincoln might be with them on this important day . Mr. James C. Conkling , chairman of the committee of arrangements , wrote urging him to come in person . There is a bad element he said in this State , as well as others , and every public demonstration in favor of law and order and constitutional government will have a favorable influence . The importance of our meeting , therefore , at the capital of a State which has sent so many soldiers into the army , and which exercises such a controlling power in the West , can not be overestimated.2 For a moment the President cherished the hope of going to Springfield and once more in his life renewing the sensation , so dear to politicians , of personal contact with great and enthusiastic masses , and of making one more speech to shouting thousands of his fellowcitizens . The temptation , however , only lasted for a moment , and instead of going he wrote a letter which was read amid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment into the small number of American political classics . The meeting was an enormous one in numbers and in hot , tumultuous feeling ; it was addressed by the greatest orators of the Republican party ; speaking went on 1 The " peace Democrats " of the North were variously nicknamed " Butternuts " and " Copperheads . " The former name referred to the domestic dye which gave color to the uniforms of the Confederate soldiers , and the latter was the name of the most venomous snake in the West . In each case the nickname was assumed and borne with bravado by the younger continuously at many stands from morning until twilight . The speeches were marked by the most advanced and unflinching Republican doctrine ; the proclamation of emancipation , the arming of negroes , received universal adhesion , and of course every reference to Mr. Lincoln 's name was received with thunders of applause ; but with all these features of the highest interest and importance , the meeting can only live in the memories of men as the occasion of the letter which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inviting me to attend a mass meeting of unconditional Union men , to be held at the capital of Illinois on the ; d day of September , has been received . It would be very agreeable to me to thus meet my old friends at my own home , but 1 can not just now be absent from here so long as a visit there would require . The meeting is to be of all those who maintain unconditional devotion to the Union , and I am sure my old political friends will thank me for tendering , as I do , the nation 's gratitude to those other noble men whom no partisan malice or partisan hope can make false to the nation 's life . There are those who are dissatisfied with me . To such I would say : You desire peace , and you blame me that we do not have it . But how can we attain it ? There are but three conceivable ways . First , to suppress the rebellion by force of arms . This I am trying to do . Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are agreed . If you are not for it , a second way is to give up the Union . I am against this . Are you for it ? If you are , you should say so plainly . If you are not for force , nor yet for dissolution , there only remains some imaginable compromise . I do not believe any compromise embracing the maintenance of the Union is now possible . All I learn leads to a directly opposite belief . The strength of the rebellion is its military - its army . That army dominates all the country and all the people within its range . Any offer of terms made by any man or men within that range , in opposition to that army , is simply nothing for the present , because such man or men have no power whatever to enforce their side of a compromise if one were made with them . To illustrate : Suppose refugees from the South and peace-men of the North get together in convention and frame and proclaim a compromise embracing a restoration of the Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep Lee 's army out of Pennsylvania ? Meade 's army can keep Lee 's army out of Pennsylvania , and I think can ultimately drive it out of existence . But no paper compromise to which the controllers of Lee 's army are not agreed can at all affect that army . In an effort at such compromise we should waste time which the enemy would improve to our disadvantage , and that would be all . Democrats , who in some instances wore butternuts as breastpins , and in others , with a clever return upon their opponents , cut the copper head of the Goddess of Liberty from the old-fashioned red cent and bore it as their cognizance . 2 Conkling to Lincoln , Aug. 21 . MS. // A compromise , to be effective , must be made either with those who control the rebel army , or with the people first liberated from the domination of that army by the successes of our own army . Now , allow me to assure you that no word or intimation from that rebel army , or from any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace compromise , has ever come to my knowledge or belief . All charges and insinuations to the contrary are deceptive and groundless . And I promise you that if any such proposition shall hereafter come , it shall not be rejected and kept a secret from you . I freely acknowledge myself the servant of the people according to the bond of service ,  --  the United States Constitution ,  --  and that as such I am responsible to them . But , to be plain , you are dissatisfied with me about the negro . Q*iite likely there is a difference of opinion between you and myself upon that subject . I certainly wish all men could be free , while I suppose you do not . Yet I have neither adopted nor proposed any measure which is not consistent with even your view , provided you are for the Union . I suggested compensated emancipation , to which you replied you wished not to be taxed to buy negroes . But I had not asked you to be taxed to buy negroes , except in such way as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusively by other means . You dislike the Emancipation Proclamation , and perhaps would have it retracted . You say it is unconstitutional . I think differently . I think the Constitution invests its commander-in-chief with the law of war in time of war . The most that can be said-if so much-is that slaves are property . Is there , has there ever been , any question that by the law of war , property , both of enemies and friends , may be taken when needed ? And is it not needed whenever taking it helps us or hurts the enemy ? Armies , the world over , destroy enemies ' property when they can not use it , and even destroy their own to keep it from the enemy . Civilized belligerents do all in their power to help themselves or hurt the enemy , except a few things regarded as barbarous or cruel . Among the exceptions are the massacre of vanquished foes and non-combatants , male and female . But the proclamation , as law , either is valid or is not valid . If it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is valid it can not be retracted , any more than the dead can be brought to life . Some of you profess to think its retraction would operate favorably for the Union . Why better after the retraction than before the issue ? There was more than a year and a half of trial to suppress the rebellion before the proclamation issued , the last one hundred days of which passed under an explicit notice that it was coming , unless averted by those in revolt returning to their allegiance . The war has certainly progressed as favorably for us since the issue of the proclamation as before . I know , as fully as one can know the opinion of others , that some of the commanders of our armies in the field , who have given us our most important successes , believe the emancipation policy and the use of the colored troops constitute the heaviest blow yet dealt to the rebellion , and that at least one of these important successes could not have been achieved when it was but for the aid of black soldiers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never had any affinity with what is called Abolitionism " or with " Republican party politics , " but who hold them purely as military opinions . I submit these opinions as being entitled to some weight against the objections often urged that emancipation and arming the blacks are unwise as military measures , and were not adopted as such in good faith . You say you will not fight to free negroes . Some of them seem willing to fight for you- but no matter . Fight you , then , exclusively to save the Union . I issued the proclamation on purpose to aid you in saving the Union . Whenever you shall have conquered all resistance to the Union if I shall urge you to continue fighting , it will be an apt time then for you to declare you will not fight to free negroes . I thought that in your struggle for the Union , to whatever extent the negroes should cease helping the enemy , to that extent it weakened the enemy in his resistance to you . Do you think differently ? I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves just so much less for white soldiers to do in saving the Union . Does it appear otherwise to you ? But negroes , like other people , act upon motives . Why should they do anything for us if we will do nothing for them ? If they stake their lives for us , they must be prompted by the strongest motive , even the promise of freedom . And the promise , being made , must be kept . The signs look better . The Father of Waters again goes unvexed to the sea . Thanks to the great North-west for it . Nor yet wholly to them . Three hundred miles up they met New England , Empire , Keystone , and jersey , hewing their way right and left . The sunny South , too , in more colors than one , also lent a hand . On the spot , their part of the history was jotted down in black and white . The job was a great national one , and let none be banned who bore an honorable part in it . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be proud , even that is not all . It is hard to say that anything has been more bravely and well done than at Antietam , Murfreesboro ' , Gettysburg , and on many fields of lesser note . Nor must Uncle Sam 's web-feet be forgotten . At all the watery margins they have been present . Not only on the deep sea , the broad bay , and the rapid river , but also up the narrow , muddy bayou ; and wherever the ground was a little damp , they have been and made their tracks . Thanks to all . For the great Republic - for the principle it lives by and keeps alive - for man 's vast future - thanks to all . Peace does not appear so distant as it did . I hope it will come soon , and come to stay ; and so come as to be worth the keeping in all future time . It will then have been proved that among free men there can be no successful appeal from the ballot to the bullet , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case and pay the cost . And there will be some black men who can remember that with silent tongue , and clenched teeth , and steadyeye , and well-poised bayonet they have helped mankind on to this great consummation ; while I fear there will be some white ones unable to forget that with malignant heart and deceitful speech they strove to hinder it . Still let us not be over sanguine of a speedy , final triumph . Let us be quite sober . Let us diligently // apply the means , never doubting that a just God , in His own good time , will give us the rightful result.1 Among all the state papers of Mr. Lincoln from his nomination to his death this letter is unique . It may be called his last stump speech , the only one made during his Presidency . We find in it all the qualities that made him in Illinois the incomparable political leader of his party for a generation . There is the same close , unerring logic , the same innate perception of political conduct , the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which abounded in his earlier and more careless oratory , but all wonderfully heightened , strengthened , and chastened by a sense of immense responsibility . In this letter , which the chairman took only ten minutes to read , he said more than all the orators at all the stands . It was , like most of his speeches , addressed principally to his opponents , and in this short space he appealed successively to their reason , to their sympathies , and to their fears . By a succession of unanswerable syllogisms he showed them how untenable was their position . He appealed to their generosity , to their sense of duty , to their patriotism , even to their love of glory , and in the end he held out to them with dignified austerity the prospect of shame and self-reproach which lay before them if they continued their hostility to the sacred cause of humanity and nationality . The style of this letter is as remarkable as its matter each sentence , like a trained athlete , is divested of every superfluous word and syllable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a word too much . Modest as he was , he knew the value of his own work , and when a friend called to ask him if he was going to Springfield he replied , " No , I shall send them a letter instead ; and it will be a rather good letter . " 2 The Springfield convention , taking up the gauntlet thrown down by the disloyal massmeeting of June , resolved " that we will lay Aside all party questions and forget all party prejudices and devote ourselves unreservedly to the 1 Lincoln to James C. Conkling , Aug. 26 , 1863. 2 Nothing he ever uttered had a more instantaneous success . Mr. Sumner immediately wrote to him : " Thanks for your true and noble letter . It is ahistorical document . The case is admirably stated , so that all but the wicked must confess its force . It can not he answered . " Henry Wilson wrote him : " God Almighty bless you for your noble , patriotic , and Christian letter . It will be on the lips and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Among the letters which the President most appreciated was one from the venerable Josiah Quincy , then ninety-one years of age , who wrote : " Old age has its privileges , which I hope this letter will not exceed ; but I can not refrain from expressing to you my gratification and my gratitude for your letter to the Illinois convention - happy , timely , conclusive , and effective . What you say concerning emancipation , your proclamation , and your course of Vor .. XXXVIII. - 20. support of our Government , until the rebellion shall be finally and forever crushed " : they resolved that " whatever else may die , the Union shall live to perpetuate civil liberty ; whatever else may perish , the Government shall survive in all its constitutional integrity ; whatever else may be destroyed , the nation shall be preserved in its territorial unity ; and to this end we pledge anew our lives , our fortunes , and our sacred honor . " a In this spirit the campaign was fought through to its victorious close , and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting in the War Department , had the pleasure of learning from all the clicking wires about him that the cause of nationality and freedom was triumphant from one end of the Union to the other ; that the people had come up fully abreast of him on the question of emancipation , and that the nation was now substantially united in the resolute purpose to prosecute the war to its legitimate conclusion . These victories at the polls made sure the good results of this summer of battles ; the Administration felt itself confirmed anew and strengthened for the work before it . To those members of the Administration who had formerly acted with the Democratic party there was a certain sense of humiliation and disappointment . Mr. Stanton said , " The disheartening thing in the affair was that there seemed to be no patriotic principle left in the Democratic party , the whole organization voting solidly against the country . " 4 Mr. Seward , on the contrary , came back from Auburn , where he had gone home to vote , in the highest spirits . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present and future . He thought " the crowd that follows power had come over to the Republicans ; the Democrats had lost their leaders when Toombs and Davis and Breckinridge forsook them and went South ; the inferior Northern Democrats who succeeded to the leadership had proved their incompetency ; the best and most energetic portion of the rank and file of the party were now voting shoulder to shoulder with the Republicans.5 proceeding in relation to it was due to truth and to your own character , shamefully assailed as it has been . The development is an imperishable monument of wisdom and virtue . " After discussing the question of emancipation , he continued : " I write under the impression that the victory of the United States in this war is inevitable ; compromise is impossible . Peace on any other basis would be the establishment of two nations , each hating the other , both military , both necessarily warlike , their territories interlocked with a tendency of never-ceasing hostility . Can we leave to posterity a more cruel inheritance , or one more hopeless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter in a tone expressive of his reverence for the age and illustrious character of the writer . 3 " History of Sangamon County , " p. 315. 4 J.

The Revolutionary heroes were political oracles till 1812 , and afterwards the soldiers of the late war ' succeeded to their honors . But we are hereafter a nation of soldiers . These people will be trying to forget years hence that they ever opposed this war . I had to carry affidavits to prove I had nothing to do with the Hartford Convention . Now the party that gained eminence by the folly of the Federalists in opposing the war have the chalice commended to their own lips . I told the Democratic leaders , " he said , with his habitual subacid good nature , " how they might have saved themselves and carded the next Presidential election , by being more loyal and earnest in support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows that would not have been hard . " Although in this memorable contest the Republicans presented a united front to the common enemy , within their own organization there were those bitter differences of opinion which always arise among men of strong convictions . The President 's anteroom was thronged with earnest men who desired to warn him in person against the machinations of other men equally earnest , and his mail was encumbered by letters from every part of the country , and every shade of faction , filled with similar denunciations and warnings . The pure and able Senator Dixon of Connecticut wrote : " The heresies of Sumner are doing immense harm in a variety of ways . If his doctrine prevails , this country will be ruined . I do hope you and Mr. Seward will stand firm . " From the other wing of the party came the most passionate denunciations of Seward and those who were associated with him in the popular mind ; and after the election Senator Chandler of Michigan , one of the most powerful of the Republicans who had by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having seen in the newspapers a paragraph that Mr. Thurlow Weed and Governor Morgan had been in consultation with the Presidentin regard to his message , wrote a vehement letter to the President , telling him there was a " patriotic organization in all the free and border States , containing over one million voters , every man of whom is your friend upon the Radical measures of your Administration ; but there is not a Seward , Weed , or Blair man among them . How are these men , " he asked , " to be of service to you in any way ? They are a millstone about your neck . You drop them and they are politically ended forever . Conservatives and traitors are buried together . For God 's sake do not exhume their remains in your message . They will smell I Chandler to Lincoln , Nov. i5 , 1863 . MS. 2 Lincoln to Chandler , Nov. 20 , 1863 . MS. worse than Lazarus after he had been buried three days . " 1 There was no man slower than Mr. Lincoln to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ censure ; but he answered this letter of Mr. Chandler in a tone of unusual dignity and severity . " I have seen , " he said , " Governor Morgan and Thurlow Weed separately , but not together , within the last ten days ; but neither of them mentioned the forthcoming message , or said anything , so far as I can remember , which brought the thought of the message to my mind . I am very glad the elections this autumn have gone favorably and that I have not by native depravity , or under evil influences , done anything bad enough to prevent the good result . I hope to stand firm ' enough to not go backward , and yet not go forward fast enough to wreck the country 's cause . " 2 In the month of October Mr. Hood , the postmaster at Chattanooga , wrote to the President a letter setting forth the particulars of a scheme which Emerson Etheridge , Clerk of the House of Representatives , had entered into to give control of the next House to the opposition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war , and his sincere attachment to the Union in the face of much obloquy and persecution at home had endeared him to the Republicans in Congress and caused him to be given the post of Clerk of the House ; but in the course of two years of war he had become separated from his former political affiliations and now sympathized with the opposition . Mr. Hood , who wrote apparently with great regret as a personal friend of Etheridge , claimed to have become aware of Etheridge 's intention to leave off the rolls of the House the names of all members whose certificates did not bear on their face the statement that they had been elected " according to the laws of the State or of the United States . " He based this action upon the provisions of a law which had been hurriedly passed during the last day of the Thirty-seventh Congress . At the same time it was understood that he had intimated to the Democratic members what his action would be , so as to allow them to provide themselves with certificates in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this news , put himself confidentially in communication with leading Republicans in all the loyal States , requesting them , without publicity , to have prepared duplicate certificates meeting the objection which it was thought that Etheridge wQuld raise to the ordinary ones . This was in most cases attended to , but not in all , so that when the members began to arrive in Washington a few days before the day fixed for the opening of Congress , a general impression of the contemplated action of Etheridge // had transpired and there was some uneasiness in regard to the issue . The President had done what he could to meet the legal requirements of the case ; but , that having been done , he was not inclined to rely exclusively upon moral force . In view of the threatened outrage he sent for some of the leading members of Congress and told them the main thihg was to be sure that all the Union members should be present . " Then , " he said , " if Mr. Etheridge undertakes revolutionary proceedings , let him be carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the House . " 1 This practical solution of the trouble had occurred to others , and the Rev. Owen Lovejoy , disregarding for a moment the etiquette of his sacred calling , announced that he was quite ready himself to take charge of Etheridge , and was confident of his muscular superiority to the Tennesseean . There was not so much uncertainty in regard to the issue as to prevent an animated contest among the Republicans for the caucus nomination for the speakership . The prominent candidates were Mr. Schuyler Colfax of Indiana and Mr. Elihu B. Washbume of Illinois . Mr. Cox of Ohio was the principal candidate for the barren honor of the caucus nomination among the Democrats ; though for some time before the meeting of Congress there was a good deal of not very practical talk in regard to the nomination of General Frank P. Blair of Missouri as a compromise candidate to be supported by the Democrats and by a few of the so-called Conservative Republicans . General Blair , while one of the earliest and ablest Republicans of the border States , one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the cause of freedom and of progress , had , through the vehemence of the factional fight which had so long been raging in Missouri , been gradually forced , partly by the denunciations of his enemies , and partly by his own combative instincts , into an attitude almost of hostility to the Republican party of the nation . Mr. Lincoln saw this with great regret . He had a high personal regard for Blair , and deplored the predicament into which his passionate temper and the assaults of his enemies were gradually crowding him . In the autumn of 1863 the PostmasterGeneral , in conversation with the President , said that his brother Frank would be guided by the President 's wishes as to whether he should continue with his command in the field or take the seat in Congress to which he had been elected from Missouri . The President answered in a letter , dated 2d of November , saying : Some days ago I understood you to say that your brother , General Frank Blair , desired to be guided by my wishes as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the field . My wish , then , is compounded of what I believe will be best for the country and best for him ; and it is that he will come here , put his militarycommission in my hands , take his seat , go into caucus with our friends , abide the nominations , help elect the nominees , and thus aid to organize a House of Representatives which will really support the Government in the war . If the result shall be the election of himself as Speaker , let him serve in that position . If not , let him retake his commission and return to the army . For the country this will heal a dangerous schism ; for him it will relieve from a dangerous position . By a misunderstanding , as I think , he is in danger of being permanently separated from those with whom only he can ever have a real sympathy - the sincere opponents of slavery . It will be a mistake if he shall allow the provocations offered him by insincere time-servers to drive him from the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has abundant talent-quite enough to occupy all his time without devoting any to temper . He is rising in military skill and usefulness . His recent appointment to the command of a corps , by one so competent to judge as General Sherman , proves this . In that line he can serve both the country and himself more profitably than he could as a member of Congress upon the floor . The foregoing is what I would say if Frank Blair were my brother instead of yours.2 In pursuance of this letter Blair came to Washington , though before Congress assembled his candidacy for the speakership had passed out of sight . He took his seat , served for some months , and went back to the army in command of a corps , as the President had promised . This relinquishment of and restoration to a high command in the army occasioned much feeling and a violent attack upon the President on the part of the Radical Republicans , which continued even after he had submitted in a message to Congress the entire correspondence , which reflected nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed on Saturday night , the 5th of December , Washburne withdrawing from the field , and Colfax being nominated by acclamation . All the next day there was great excitement at the hotels frequented by politicians in regard to Etheridge 's proposed course of action , which was now no longer a secret to any one . The comments he everywhere heard upon his conduct had its effect upon his nerves , and he began to talk in a complaining and apologetic tone , saying he was simply obeying the law and there was no reason why Republicans should regard him vindictively . The next day , when the House opened , while he did not flinch from the position he had occupied , he did nothing arbitrary or revolutionary . He left off the roll the names of all those members whose certificates were not , in his opinion , in due form , but readily // entertained a motion to restore them . This met with a hot protest from some of the proslavery members , but a vote was taken showing a majority of twenty for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was elected by the same majority in a total vote of i8i , the Democratic vote being scattered among many members , Mr. Cox receiving more- than any other . As soon as Congress came together Mr. Fernando Wood renewed his furtive overtures with the Government for the appointment of peace commissioners from what he called his wing of the Democratic party , making no secret of his belief that he himself was the most appropriate choice which could be made for such a function . He urged the President to publish some sort of amnesty for the Northern sympathizers with the rebellion which would include Mr. Vallandigham and permit him to return to the country . He promised that in that case there should be two Democratic candidates in the field at the next Presidential election . The President declined his proposition , but he would not take no for an answer . He called again on the morning of the i4th of December and the President refused to see him , merely sending word by a servant that he had nothing further to say to him.1 Later in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a resolution " that the President be requested to appoint three commissioners , who shall be empowered to open negotiations with the authorities at 1 J. G. N .. MS . Memoranda . Richmond to the end that this bloody , destructive , and inhuman war shall cease , and the Union be restored upon terms of equity , fraternity , and equality under the Constitution . " This resolution was laid upon the table by a party vote , and Mr. Green Clay Smith of Kentucky offered resolutions opposing " any armistice , or intervention , or mediation , or proposition for peace from any quarter so long as there shall be found a rebel in arms against the Government ; and we ignore , " the resolutions continued , " all party names , lines , and issues , and recognize but two parties in this war-patnots and traitors . " Second : " That we hold it to be the duty of Congress to pass all necessary bills to supply men and money , and the duty of the people to render every aid in their power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the rebellion and in bringing the leaders thereof to condign punishment . " The third resolution tendered the thanks of Congress to the soldiers in the field . The first resolution was passed by a party vote of ninety-three to sixtyfive ; the second and third were passed unanimously , with the exception of Mr. B. G. Harris of Maryland . Several times during the session this battle of resolutions was renewed , but always with the same result ; the Democratic party constantly favoring negotiations for peace while as constantly declaring their devotion to the Union , and the Republicans repudiating every suggestion of negotiation or compromise so long as the enemies of the Republic bore arms against it .
