txt Stimulated by the presence in this city of United States Marshal Dudley , of Indiana , and other prominent gentlemen of that State , Senator Voorhees has offered a resolution calling for the names of the special and general deputies appointed by Dudley to serve at the last October election in Indiana and for the places where they performed such service . This resolution has been adopted , with an amendment offered by Mr. Edmunds , which calls for information bearing upon the necessity for the employment of these Marshals . If the reply should cover the whole ground indicated by the resolution , the Senate will have before it some very interesting information . It was well known at the time that Marshal Dudley , a man of rare determination and executive ability , appointed many such deputies , notwithstandine the threats by which Democrats and Democratic journals tried to intimidate him . Many of these deputies were appointed in Indianapolis , owing to the presence of a host of Democratic repeaters who had gone there from the East and to information re ' garding their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detectives in the country . Great excitement was aroused by the presence of these repeaters , and the most complete arrangements were made to thwart them . The leaders of the Democracy were at last compelled to give bonds for their party at a public meeting . The result was a remarkably quiet election , in the presence of thousands of strangers . Ex-Gov . Hendricks was reported , on excellent authority , to have said on the following day that a fairer election had never been held in the State . The inquiry will probably reveal the fact , from records and other testimony , that the condition of affairs in Indianapolis and other parts of the State was , three days before the election , most alarming , and that there were excellent reasons then for expecting a bloody riot at the polls .
