txt Edward S. Stokes was bubbling over with rood nature at the Hoffman . House last night when a TnuEs reporter asked him what had been the outcome of Judge Barber 's decision at Cleveland to order the sale of the lines of the Bankers and Merchants ' Telegraph Company situated in Ohio . He replied : " I bou.srlit the lines to-day for $65,300 . The effect will probably be to settle the suit involving the wires of the American Rapid Company . When the Western Union cut the Bankers and Merchants ' wires it probably thought it would control the Western system or the latter . The action of the court in ordering the sale of the lines knocks this little scheme on the head . It is the biggest thing yet for the United Lines , as , in consequence of the order or the court , we shall institute proceedings to cancel the lease of the American Vapid to the Western Union . The latter will probably be very glad to be relieved of the lease , as the sale practically means that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably will not care to pay 560,000 yearly for nothing . The decision of the court was that the claim of the Rapid Company that it had built the lines sold from the proceeds of its bonds was all nonsense , and that the bonds so issued were fraudulent . " The lines sold , " concluded Mr. Stokes . " run from Pittsburg to Columbus and thence to Indianapolis and Cincinnati , in all 752 miles of poles and wires , of which 400 miles are provided with 10 wires . It also embraces connecting lines consisting of 503 miles or poles with 2,012 miles or wires , running to Detroit and Toledo . thence all through Indiana and Michigan , and connecting at Chicago with the underground system . The lines will all be turned over to the United Lines Company and will form one of the most Important sections of our system . "
