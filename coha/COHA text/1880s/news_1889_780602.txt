txt The world 's record for high jumping , 6 feet 9 1/4 inches , which was made at the New-York Horse Show last year by Mr. Gebuard 's Leo and by Filemaker , was beaten by an inch and a half by two horses at the Chicago Horse Show after midnight last night . It was nearly 11 o'clock when seven jumpers came out for the prize offered by Charles Swartz for the beet high-lumping eaten weights . According to the rules of this class if any horse should beat the New-York record the association agreed to add $500 to Mr. Swartz 's prize of $100 . The jumping began at 4 feet 9 inches , and all the horses sailed over with little difficulty until the bars had been put up to 5 feet 8 inches . When 6 feet 2 inches of timber was put up the contest narrowed down to Ontario , a Canadian-bred horse owned by S. S. Howland of Mount Morris , N.Y. , and Roseberry , another Canadian , owned by Morehouse &; Prosper of Toronto . Up went the bar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Roseberry followed suit . The bar was raised to 6 feet 6 inches , and again both horses cleared it . The excitement was now intense as the jump grew near the record , and both norses were in form . Six feet eight inches was announced as the height of the bar , only an inch and a quarter from the record . Ontario led , and made three gallant attempts , but failed . He was given another chance , and cleared it grandly amid wild cheers . Roseberry flew it at his second attempt to perfection . Then the bar went up to 6 feet 10 3/4 Inches , an inch and a half above the record , and the crowd , in its excitement and enthusiasm , rose to its feet en masse . The height was measured with the greatest accuracy , so that there could be no caviling if the jump was made . Ontario came at it for the first time amid breathless silence . The gallant horse rose , but he could not quite get over , and the top bar was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time he cleared It . Then everybody yelled , the jockeys surrounded the horse and his plucky rider , and for a while nothing could be done . Leo and Filmmaker were eclipsed , and there was still another horse to compete . Roseberry came at it like a whirlwind , but hit the top rail hard , breaking it . The second attempt he flew it like a bird . Then pandemonium burst out anew , and old horsemen embraced each other and cheered . Never in the world had such jumping been seen-6 feet 10 3/4 inches cleared by two horses on the same day . Roseberry is a buckskin gehling.with black Volute , four years old , and sixteen hands high . He has very powerful shoulders and quarters . His owners do not know his breeding . He was ridden by Tim Long of Toronto , Ontario . Ontario was ridden by James Frayling of Mount Morris . The jump was declared a draw , each receiving $500 . The horses will jump again on Saturday for a purse . One of the most remarkable things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been jumping for two hours when the record was broken . Long , who rode Roseberry , had also been riding three other jumpers belonging to Morehouse &; Prosper , and had had a very bad fall on Ciatiing while going over the bars at 5 feet 10 inches . The horse olundered and fell , with Long 's foot caught in the stirrup . It was thought at first that he was injured , but he pluckily remounted-and continued .
