x HERE is perhaps , says Pro * fessor Huxley in a recent paper , " no more hopeful sign of progress among us in the last half-century than the steadily increas 0 ing devotion which has been and is directed to measures for promoting physical and moral welfare among the poorer classes . " And just before , he says , as to the necessity for such measures , " Natural science and religious enthusiasm rarely go hand in hand , but in this matter their concord is complete . " I do not purpose to write very gravely on this subject . But here is the scientist 's verdict , that the proposition to " elevate the masses " is good science ; and I quote it to gain , what I particularly covet , the attention of minds that , with or without " religious enthusiasm , " need this kind of assurance . To such especially I purpose simply to tell of a scheme of " elevation , " now working well in its second year , kept for a time purposely within narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of indefinite expansion . It sprang from certain merely colloquial efforts to point out some very common and rather subtle errors which help to explain why , in so vast a field , human sympathy , large selfsacrifice , and gracious condescensions so often reap the slender harvest they do . For example , it was admitted that there is much truth in the stern statement that the masses * we purpose to lift sink to where they are by their own specific gravity ; that they lack the buoyancy to float , the intelligence , virtues , aspirations , which are the upholding powers in human life , and that they are where they are because of what they are and what they inwardly lack . Yet this is only part of the truth , and at best it is not final . People are also , in great part , w/zat they are because of re/zere they are , their inward lack due much to their outward . Moreover , both what one is and where one is depend much on what and where others are with whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as hard , but it is also just as easy , to keep human merit , as to keep water , from finding its level : with this difference , that human character may have , may acquire , VOL . XXXVI. - 70. lose , and regain , elasticity . And so we say , even when one is only equal to the station he fills , that the fact is not final . New influences from without may produce new inner powers and merits , which may not only earn better place for self but may liberate others from conditions unworthy of them , to which his own conditions had undeservedly confined them . Though a sunken ship may be mainly of iron , and might never stir to raise itself , we may go down to it and by driving air in and water out may see it , of its own motion , rise again to noble uses . So with a man . But in the various groups into which the relations or fortunes of life gather us we are not , each one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the various parts of one or another ship . And while it is mostly by good or bad management that ships float or sink , yet in every ship that floats are many parts that of themselves would sink , and in every ship that sinks are many parts that but for fastenings or entanglements would float . The chances of fortune and the force of merit are not enough to secure " the greatest happiness of the greatest number " ; and without that we can not get the highest good of any . Even of wrecked ships we save what we can . To fortune and merit must be added the factor of rescue , whether we call it salvage or salvation . To leave the unfortunate to fight ill fortune with only their handicapped merit is to leave them to an unintelligent and merciless natural selection to which we would think it inhuman to leave shipwrecked voyagers , and stupid to leave our cattle . So , then , our failures to " elevate the masses " are not because any and every intervention is a meddling with selective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has its well-known faults . We know the benevolence that does not " help a man to help himself " is not beneficent . We know that nothing is at its best which puts needless obligations upon the beneficiary . We know that to produce merit is at least as good as to find it ; that to augment it is better than merely to reward it that its best rewards are simple recognition , encouragement , and opportunity ; and that even in giving these , all gratuitousness is dangerous ; and , especially , that there are great risks in all sudden abundance . Benevolence has learned that even in social science there is room and need for sentiment , but that sen // timent must follow and obey reason , not lead and rule it . All these things we know by heart , and yet our failures go on . Some say that charity has still too much sentiment . But in fact it has not yet enough . Some say that it has taken on too much science . But really it has not enough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word science . Yet many regard science as something that complicates simple things , whereas it simplifies complex things . If science deals with complex things , so does every other province of human life ; but our mental indolence loosely treats complexities as though they were simple , and science as the breeder of complexities . Human benevolence still needs a more scientific thoughtfulness to see the complexity of things too often thus far treated as simple , and a greater depth of sentiment to remember it . Our efforts are still crude . II . NOT THE MA55 : THE INDIVIDUAL . WE shall never have any great success in " elevating the mass " until we get beyond treating it merely as a mass . Even political science , impersonal as it is , never secures a safe self-government till it recognizes the individual citizen and his rights . But in the " elevation of the mass " a treatment is required that must go much further from masstreatment than the true functions of the state will allow it to go . General legislation must not know one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between those who break , and those who keep , the law . Individual conditions and relations it recognizes ; but individuals it cann otjustly consider save impersonally and merely as units of the community . It is only when by crime or infirmity one is disqualified as a simple civil unit that government , not by benevolent choice , but for the protection of society at large , enters into personal considerations with him , in order that by disciplinary or sanitary treatment adjusted to his peculiar , personal , inward needs he may as soon as possible be restored to the precious liberty of impersonal citizenship . We can neither ask nor allow civil government to go further . But something must go further . Something must take personal knowledge of those whose inward and outward conditions may be bettered to the advantage of all , and yet who are not in those plights that alone should make them wards of the state . What will do it ? Commerce , trade , all the material industries , have to do with masses as masses , and with individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacities but even the social qualities of the individual must be taken account of in these provinces of life , and so we see the commercial and the social realms overlapping and in no small degree dominating each other , man making the not always noble discovery that commercial ties have their social , and social ties their commercial , values ; with this severe limitation , however , that personal relations , qualities , or wants can not be set up by or for any one as actual commercial claims save for their actual commercial values . So , then , we can not intrust to government nor demand of commerce the exercise of personal benevolence . In commerce we have , and must have , limited only by moral law and the laws of the land , the supreme rule of commercial selection , to which all personal considerations must remain subordinate . A far-sighted commercial selection may see commercial values , qualified by personal considerations , far out to right and left of its trodden path , and the most we can rightly demand of commerce is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both government , and commerce with virtually all her kindred industries , are incalculably beneficent . Without them how should we " elevate the masses " ? Yet they are not enough . We may conceive of government or commerce springing from the most benevolent motives , but even so , government may not rightly go beyond the most obvious common welfare ; and commerce and her kin , the moment they step beyond the circle of gain , loss , and rectitude , cease to be themselves . We turn to society . Will it supply the deficiency ? Let us first be sure what we mean . A nation is a social group . So are three friends at a fireside . But public society ( if I may presume to quote a sentence or two of my own lately printed ) comprises one group of relations , and private society entirely another , and it is simply and only evil to confuse the two . Public society , civil society , comprises all those relations that are impersonal , unselective , and in which all men , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is its antipode . It is personal , selective , assortive ; ignores civil equality , and forms itself entirely upon mutual preferences and affinities . Our civil social status has of right no special value in private society , and our private social status has of right no special value in our civil social relations . We make the distinction here in order to set aside the idea of public society : we mean , now , private society . Government can make among men only a civil selection , commerce only a commercial selection ; but in society we find at last the operations of a personal selection . // THE INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIETY . AT first glance we who are unlearned on the great deep of social science might suppose that a perfectly normal social movement ought to work the results we are seeking . Why not ? Has one not liberty to choose his social companions as he will ? If he will but put away all foolish prides ,  --  pride of place , of purse , of blood , of mind , and that worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may he not bring himself into benevolent and beneficent personal intercourse with whom he will ? No . We presently find that we are overrating our liberty and our power over certain laws that lie in the very nature of private social relations . What makes the social circle ? As the key-note of commerce is gain , so that of society is pleasure . As a normal commerce requires that gains be mutual and approximately equal , society requires that pleasures be the same . Sociality is normally and rightly only a sort of commerce , a social exchange , from which we find we must withdraw as soon as we realize our inability to render a quid*ro quo of social values . Normally it ignores material values , and is totally uncommercial . Yet we discover that though its movements , too , are immensely beneficent , neither can it , with any good effect , let benevolent intentions sharply oppose themselves to the natural operations of social selection . The merely formative state of a large part of society in America accounts for some broad and frequent errors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of private sociality . In one great belt of our country there is the strangest confusion of thought as to where public social relations , over which the individual has no private right of control , and private social relations , over which the public voice has no right of control , touch and bound each other ; while in another belt there is almost equal confusion as to what private society might do for public society if it would . But wherever in the world we see population dense enough for private society to be selective , we find it broken into countless small groups , " circles , " each of which , however they may overlap one another , owes its continuance to the ability of its members to supply mutual entertainment . This ability lacking , no amount of benevolence can hold them , socially , together . Benevolence , self-sacrifice , condescension , become repellant forces in the social circle wherever they can not be paid for in kind . Social selection does not spare even the family circle , but draws its various members apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the century-plant constantly 499* disintegrates and absorbs its old leaves and of their substance sends out new , society divides and absorbs the old family circle and sends out the germs of more numerous new ones . Not in a mean sense only , but in a very noble way private society is a mart . In commerce and the industries the prime necessity laid by each upon himself is that he get for all he gives . In society he requires of himself to give for all he gets . In the commercial exchange the man without commercial resources is intolerable . In the social exchange the man without social resources equal to its demands is not nearly so intolerable to it as it is to him ,  --  not only because its condescensions put debts upon him that he feels he can not pay , but also because the social circle that does not prize his social resources has probably few or none to offer that he wants . What fattens the ox would starve the fox ; Yet the fox has food that would starve the ox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without social resources , only let those resources find their right social market by a rational social selection . Now , if social selection were always rational , we should see it reaching out generously across the lines of life and the accidents of fortune , and selecting , rejecting , and assorting men and women according to their abilities to make fairly even exchange with one another of social pleasures and such intellectual and spiritual enlargements , small or great , as these pleasures may yield . But other forces enter and make confusion . Family ties , parental and fraternal affection and pride , hold out more or less stubbornly for the social equality of all the family 's members , often in the face of gross inequalities . On the other hand , society often crudely assesses the individual socially by the accidents of family relationship , and counts him far above or below his own true value . Commercial , political , and other outside values intrude themselves , and seek and make all degrees of false apprassements above and below the just mark . Then there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than inner merit . And there , too , are the spirit of mere caste , and the often still narrower one of coterie ; and again our selfish fear of making unlucky selections , and the greater ease of keeping the strait and narrow way of social orthodoxy ; these all mar the proper workings of social distribution . Hence we find no plane of private society , however exalted , where we may not encounter the boor , the fool , and the knave , holding or held in their unearned station on false claims : and none , however humble , where we may not meet the wise , the good , the gentle , overHOME CUL HIRE CLUBS . // looked by the social groups into which their merits ought to bring them , and themselves and the world robbed of their best values by accidental conditions that might easily be removed . iv . SOCIAL SELECTION KILLED AND STUFFED . SOCIAL selection being thus wild and erratic , we naturally utter much fine indignatlOn against it and demand repair of the evil wrought . Our benevolent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranks of society have not kept up an intelligent and faithful discrimination , but let their processes of selection be more or less warped by all manner of ignoble motives , why should they hold themselves aloof from and above less fortunate humanity , to its estrangement , embitterment , and degradation ? And then we set about to mend the wrong by methods that too often only add to the confusion . We feel that a moral duty has been neglected and must now be performed . We join hands with others who propose to correct the same evils because , for their part , they see in them a menace to the order and safety of public society ; and with yet others , distinctively " religionists , " who see religion dammed up , lnaking progress and gathering numbers only in the ranks of comfortable respectability , and irreligion , vulgarity , and bad morals widening like a flood and threatening every guard that the God-fearing can throw around their own children . And so we join to " elevate the masses . " With what result ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the sorts of people we attempt to elevate either openly spurn or secretly despise any such attempts made in order to satisfy our sense of duty , or to subserve the public interest , or to promote the cause and fortunes of religion . They will not be used either to wipe our conscience clear , or to abate a public nuisance , or as a filling even for churches and church statistics . We recoil from the effort , bruised and sore . Then when our benevolence and pride have recovered from their wounds , we try another plan : we offer them personal friendship . We see this is what we owe them , and that the real or suspected absence of this is what they resent . Now , friendship implies fellowship ; and we lightly assume , contrary to our best knowledge , that friendship means private social companionship , and offer them personal friendship in this form . And ninety-nine times in a hundred they decline this also . The trouble is , of course , not in the friendship ; it is in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether the form be genuine or specious . If genuine , the form will consist in the one to be helped , as well as the helper , generously putting away all false pride and unworthy suspicions , and each receiving from the other at least one social visit under his or her own roof . Most likely one such exchange will show that neither is able to offer a social companionship that is not an unprofitable weariness to the other . If the effort drags on , how it drags ! If only there were pain to relieve or sorrow to comfort , what new life the forced relation would at once display ! " In sooth , " says the young prince to Hubert , " I would you were a little sick , that I might sit all night and watch with you . " Actual , present distress makes fellowships , while it lasts , that can not be made without it . But in such a case the visit is one of mercy , not of sociality , whereas we are seeking a scheme that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distress or languish when the distress is gone . Sociality can not be other than a burden , with its weight resting most heavily on the one who was to be helped by it , unless it has its own natural , inherent reasons for being . To condescend and manage socially is not so hard ; to be socially condescended to and managed - that is what can not rast . Such deformed social fellowship soon and rightly goes and hangs itself . The most that such effort can ever do is by rare chance to fin*1 some one out of his true social sphere and bring him into it . It can never have any appreciable effect to fit for any sort of true promotion any one who is unfit . In the vast majority of such cases prompt failure puts the friend and the befriended only further apart , and makes the betterment of the lowly seem more nearly impossible than it ever seemed before . But generally the offers of friendship from the fortunate to those less so are less genuine even than this . We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thorough ones , and have among us many who only half want and half do not want the results that for one reason or another they join with us to get . Hence specious offers of social attention such as we could not be guilty of making to those who are already on our own soclal plane ; proposals to gather our beneficiaries together and meet them numerously without having met or tried to meet them individually ; ignoring the fact that there are broad social divergencies among them - ranks and circles , as there should be , and the spirits of class and coterie , as there ought *ot to be ; extending social attentions that might at least be genuine if offered personally and in our own drawing or sitting rooms , but are only flimsy counterfeits when // tendered promiscuously and in some public or semi-public place , some society 's rooms , or church parlors , or other social neutral ground . What wonder , if those to whom we so condescend turn away saying , " You may mean well , but we do n't shake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this sort of lump treatment there is often as little discrimination concerning who shall make these tenders of sociality as concerning who shall receive them . Fortune and station decide , and an indiscrimination that would insure failure to any private enterprise characterizes an effort which really demands the most careful selection of persons for their wisdom , tact , and social experience . Instead , we see the young , the giddy , the old , the stupid , the self-seeking , and the worldly thrown together , and social selections , eliminations , and separations reasserting themselves on the spot ; unless-as is more likely-the intended beneficiaries are wholly absent . Such schemes , so far from " elevating the masses , " only estrange and offend them with no end of unfair conditions , and delude the benevolent with the notion that they are doing their best to effect what they are really doing their best to prevent . Only in the pure democracy and unassorted meagerness of numbers of ; for instance , a New England farm-village , where there is no distinct " mass " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there they are not really so ; for at any time the establishment of manufacturing or large commercial interests may develop class and mass , and both sides be found handicapped with false notions of how true friendship is to make itself effective between them . Or if no such material development take place , then those who go out into the larger world seeking better fortune , and find the conditions of class and mass , carry with them the most mischievous misconceptions of what private society can and ought to do for the masses , by virtue of their commercial , church , and other relations , and how it should be done . Here , then , are certainly two truths : ( x ) That the masses can not be elevated by mere mass treatment , and ( 2 ) that - be it mass treatment or personal treatment - mere sociality would be quite inadequate even if practicable , and quite impracticable even if adequate . v. CLASS TREATMENT , THEN ? ALL mass treatment belongs rightly to legislation and government . The " mass , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights . To presume to accord these by any sort of private condescension is extremely offensive to countless minds that may not be able to define why it is so . Yet naturally one will find himself largely disqualified for any salutary treatment of the lowly if he is known to be opposed to any clear right of the mass . There is a kind of benevolent effort midway between mass treatment and personal treatment . In nations where arbitrary class distinctions are made and sustained by law , even private efforts at the elevation of others may have a limited effectiveness though made in the guise of class treatment . Yet even where society is thus broken up into classes recognized by law and ancient custom , class wants are class rights . Only law can properly supply them . A want which legislation can not lawfully supply is clearly not a class want , and private effort to supply it ought not to take the form of class treatment ; that is , it should not be offered to people in and by and as classes . Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one another in their rights is intolerable to the very ground principles of the nation 's structure . No one who is not helpless or criminal belongs to a class . Every one belongs to the whole people , the whole people to him , and he , first and last , to himself . No American principle is better known or more dearly prized by every American in humble life . Occupations , religious creeds , accidents of birth and fortune , may have their inevitable classifying effect ; but no one relation of life has any power arbitrarily to determine one 's class in any other relation , and any treatment , whether by intention or oversight , of persons whom any accident of life has grouped together , as being all of a sort , is sure to be , and ought to be , resented as at least a blunder . In any private effort , then , to " elevate the masses , " in this country at least , class treatment is out of the question . Very exact persons may say that the support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class wants that can not truly be called class rights . But in fact these benefactions are supported by public tax not because they are charities to classes , but because they are provisions for the common public peace , safety , and welfare . Though the needs they supply are wants of class , they are defensive rights of the whole public , and as such are properly met by public treatment . Even foundlings given into the arms of private charity are so assigned , not for class treatment , but to reduce their class treatment to the extreme practicable minimum and give them the most that can be given of personal consideration . Now , if individual treatment be best for those whom dependency or delin // quency has classified , how much more is it imperative for those who rightly refuse to be impersonally classed at all and need rather to unlearn their own inconsistent , numerous , rude , and unjust classifications of one another . good - to bring him to what I wish him to want . Unless he is in some dire distress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or effort upon him . I must be even more careful to keep the obligation small than to make the vi . benefaction large . My aim must be to pro duce the most comfortable maximum of benefiPRIVATE PERSONAL PROFIT AND PLEASURE . cence from the most comfortable minimum THUS we drop into our true limitations , of benevolence . I must offer no benefit for Private effort for the elevation of the non-dependent and the non-delinquent lowly is right and highly necessary . But it must be for each helped one 's own sake , and not merely for the promotion of some good cause or abatement of some general evil . Not even for the advancement of Christianity ? No ! If the great fraternity of man will seek each other 's best advancement , Christianity will advance itself never so fast . No mass treatment , no class treatment , no cause treatment . It must be individual , personal treatment . It is not the mass , the class , or the cause , it is the individual , that we must elevate . Hence you - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four things about him - his capabilities , his needs , his desires , and his surroundings . There is one thing I must give him - true friendship ; and one thing I must get of him - his confidence ; and two that I must exchange with him - profit and pleasure . Not pleasure alone , for I can not long give him , or he give me , as much mere pleasure as he can get without me . Yet not profit alone ; for most likely uncommercial profit without pleasure is in his eye not worth its effort . Nor yet mere profit and pleasure sepa- vii . rately , side by side , or in alternation ; but profit CULTURE . yielding pleasure . A profit he may not as easily get without me , and a pleasure not sought for its own sake , but dependent on the profit . And the profit not merely given , but exchanged . For to know that the profit is mutual makes the pleasure mutual , heightens it , and so animates and sustains the relation ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side from reaching out farther across social lines than is good for the best results . So , the first step with him whom I would elevate is to seek a speaking acquaintance with him . This must be got ; but in getting it I shall , if I am wise , keep every good social rule that I need not break . Then , not with rash haste , yet promptly , and on the first personal contact , I would set about to discover what he would like to get that I can give , with only gain to him and no apparent loss to me . Even within this limit he may not wish for what I most wish to give him . But I must begin with what he wants - so it be EVEN here we are narrowly hedged in . I have little leisure ; he has less . I am tired ; he is more so . He is probably not a struggling genius , hungering and thirsting for mental food and drink . He has not the confident hope , the strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet , perhaps , the physical stamina , that sustain a man in hard study after eight , nine , ten hours of hard or confining work . It is those who are not equal to this who need help most . Whatever he and I are going to undertake , its burden must be light . It must be of his choosing , in kind and quantity , and yet of a kind that I can help him with , and in quantity so moderate that it might very comfortably to either of us be more . Again , it must not lay any large tax upon hours of relaxation . Yet must neither quantity nor frequency be so scant as to attenuate the sense of profit and the interest in the pursuit . But the tax of regularity and punctuality nothing for which he can in any way pay something . He will like this the better , or if gently and silently , I have to teach him to like this the better , that is one of the greatest benefits I can do him . Unearned benefits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet they need not always be paid for . The child in school must earn every line of his education by study ; some one else , perhaps the state , pays for it , and ultimately he repays the state . So I make nothing gratuitous that can , without discouragement , be made otherwise ; and even what is a mere gratuity from me may be no mere gratuity to him . I give him no gratuitous elevation nor even any gratuitous social promotion ; but only the opportunity , stimulation , and guidance which he is not able , or perhaps does not yet prize enough , to pay for . Now , plainly , under these limitations , the only elements of true elevation and enlargement that I can enable him to get by earning and yet without paying for them are the various sorts of education and culture of hand , head , and heart . // must be levied and paid . We must meet each other on a regularly recurring day - and no other recurrence is so good as the weekly return-with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just as strictly kept , for separating . And , lastly , the pursuit must be such that I , too , shall* visibly gain some pleasure and profit from it ; for reasons already given , and also because thus it will gain more value in his esteem , and because thus , too , may I induce others the more numerously to follow my example . And now are we ready to begin ? We have provided unburdensome , inexpensive , pleasurable , and elevating profit . Thus I am offering tangible friendship , inviting confidence , and putting myself in a way to learn his capabilities , needs , desires , and - stop ! I have not provided for knowing his habitual surroundings . Until I know them I can not really know him . How shall I learn what they are and learn it as soon as possible ? Manifestly , by observing him in them . But I must not dream of secretly spying into them , nor of indirectly inquiring into them , nor yet of openly and formally investigating or reconnoitering them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and far more effective way . It is to hold our weekly meetings in his house . viii . HOME CULTURE . WE must meet in his home . But will not that seem to him like holding him at armslength ? Will it not tax his confidence to see that I do not ask him to my house ? It might . So we had better alternate ; one week at his house , the next at mine , the third at his , and so on . But first at his . His courage might fail him to come first to me ; mine need not fail to go first to him . Suppose that , after the first , he should want all our meetings to be at my house . That would be good , but not best . Besides my need to know his habitual surroundings , there are two other strong reasons why I should meet him under his own roof : first , to keep Ike home in his world ; and , secondly , to bring some little of my world into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third of education and culture . Our home contacts are a full third , and our world contacts another third . Therefore , to get the best results in culture from him whom I purpose to elevate , I must keep these three channels open . To try to lift him only , and not his home , would be for me to pull one way while his home pulls another way . If I succeed in lifting him , and he still holds on to his home as he should , then the lift is a dead lift , and either a great strain or a poor result . And if ; as I lift him , 1 loosen the hold between him and his home , it is a hazardous benefit that estranges him from his family circle . For the hearth-stone is the key-stone of all the world 's best order and happiness . The easiest , best , quickest way to lift almost any one is to lift him , house , and all . Moreover , so many other things  --  the gaslit street , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saloon , the reading-room , so many things , good , bad , and indifferent-tend to rob the lowly home of its brightest ornaments , that it behooves me to work the other way ; Those who must stay at the fireside , the aged and the little ones , have some rights . They may lack the time , the wits , or the wish , to come formally under my care ; and yet they may get large benefit ,  --  stimulations , aspirations ,  - -  though it be only by virtue of the new outside " atm6sphere , " the mere odor of better things , that I unconsciously bring with me when I come thus somewhat within their own home circle : not with mere condescension , but on a definite business with one of its number , mayhap the pride of the flock ; a business , too , which they shall see that I myself rightly enjoy . It is far best , for him and for all , that the culture I bring to my one beneficiary be given and received in the home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more there is for each and every one , especially when it is shared with those we love and who love us . Hence " home culture . " But there is still unprovided the third medium of culture ; to wit , healthful contact with the outlying world . It is true , he whom I seek to help will often meet me in my own home . But this will give him but a slight contact with my world , for several reasons . First , we meet to pursue an appointed task which will take up the whole time of our meeting . And then , even if there were time to bring him socially into the company of my intimates , he is , most likely , riot equipped for that kind of contact , even with me ; and much less with them , he alone and they in the plural . He would shun its repetition , and we should soon be driven apart . Again , himself is not his whole self ; his domestic ties are a large part of him . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his home 's own sake , his home must get this outer contact . My visits bring a little , but not as much as is good . Howmay more be brought ? I see we must avoid mere sociality here also , and anything likely to run into it . I see , too , that , very rightly , the sense of disadvantage is so plainly with my beneficiary and his household that I must all the time do all I can to make him , as nearly as I can , master // of the situation . Under his roof the only larger contact with the world without that he will like will be with that part already nearest to him in taste and culture . I must let him choose the persons . Even then he will not like , nor would it be best , for them to be mere lookers-on . They must join us in our task .

Other good effects will suggest themselves , without mention here . Working thus in group we shall have other provisions to make , but we can make them . Different members of the group may show varying degrees of energy for the pursuit of the matter we take up . In that case , for those to whom a single weekly hour of readmg is not enough we can supply additional collateral reading ( or other sources of information , but generally books ) , on the same subject as that in hand at the group 's sessions .

Under this group arrangement the house of each member will receive our visitation much less often than if we were but two persons ; but when it comes it will be a more stimulating event . And my own usefulness will thus be brought to its best ; for what I can impart to one at a time I may just as well impart to four or six at once . Four or six ; hardly more . More might embarrass some households even to seat them . It would make the visits of the group at the house of each member too infrequent for best effect , and would diminish that mutual personal acquaintanceship and influence which is the thing most needed for the results we seek . Yet the number need never be arbitrary . There may be this reason or that why some member will be really unable to receive the group at his domicile . He may live , for instance , in an inhospitable boarding-house . Yet should he , least of all , be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belong to one household , and one visitation count each time in their case for two . Let us say then that four or six should be about the number of homes represented by the total membership , whatever that number may be . On the other hand , if even so few as four or five members are hard to find , there is no reason why a beginning may not be made with two or three . Yet we must be watchful to add others whenever we can . To put all in two words , we must have and keep the group , and we must keep it small . Hence not mere self-culture , but home-culture ; and not the home culture society or association , but each time , however often repeated , a home culture club . ix . HOME CULTURE cLUBs . NEVERTHELESS we find ample room for larger aggregations also .

Here follows a tabulated summary . Even merely to convene at occasional intervals in a common gathering of all the clubs , not in private sociality , but either as an audience to some elevating public entertainment , or for each club to make its own report , and hear the aggregated report , of work done ; nay , even the mere sight of their own numbers will kindle enthusiasm , inspiration , esprit de corps , public esteem , and new energy and effort . Hence the plural , the home culture clubs , with their secretary - one for all - receiving weekly from every club a postal-card report of its own work done ,  --  as far as mere figures can tell it ,  --  and sending weekly to every club an engrossed record of the whole work of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these postal-cards . Hence , too , the general meetings of all the clubs together , as often as once in every six or eight weeks . And these general meetings may be given another value - they may provoke the formation of new clubs . To this end invitations to be present may be given numerously to those of VOL . XXXVI. - 71. whom it is most desirable to see the clubs made up ; and probably both the best and the readiest way to insure this is to allow every member , leaders and all , the right to give the same appointed number of invitations to persons of his choice not yet in any home culture club . HERE , then , seems to be a complete scheme for the continuous , safe , true befriending of the less fortunate by the moderately more fortunate , applicable to all sorts and conditions of life that do not justify the deprivation or surrender of personal liberty . It appears to be free from the flaws and drawbacks that depreciate so many generous efforts to reach across the gross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human fraternity without risk of mischievous social confusion . It offers no gratuitous promotion of any sort , nor even any enervating opportunity ; but only opportunity of the stimulating sort , opportunity to earn and achieve true elevation . It purposes to elevate the individual not out from // the home circle , but in it , and , as much as may be , by the participation of the home circle itLeif in that elevation . It purposes , under the best safeguards , to bring those who may be severed from family ties into contact with family circles , as nearly as may be of their own best affinity . It does not purpose to put any one in any burdensome degree under another 's condescension , nor does it call upon any one for tasks wholly unprofitable to self . It involves no chance of unwisely sudden changes in any one 's condition . It purposes to be practicable for as few as two or three persons , or for as many thousands ; to be good and profitable as far as it goes , little or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to involve no possible loss in case of possible failure . In any community where books may be borrowed from private hands or public library the expense involved may be made so slight as not to require the question of ways and means to be broached beyond the circle of a very few friends in sympathy with any such work . x . WILL THEY WORK ? Two questions remain to be met : First , Would this scheme , put into practice , be effective ? But the scheme has been tried . It is working . As in the nature of all things , particular clubs will have , are having , their birth , life , and death , and while they live one will differ from another in effectiveness ; but the plan works and the work is growing . The experiment has been cautiously made . Each step has been studied both before and after it was taken , before another has been proposed . Proposals to start clubs in many towns far apart from one another have been held in suspense , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confined to one place , the town of Northampton , Massachusetts . Here there have been started one by one , from time to time during the year 1887 and the winter and spring of i888 , twenty home culture clubs . Eighteen still exist , and the only two that have disbanded have done so by reason of changes beyond control , and not for lack of interest or from any , discovered fault in the scheme . Many thousands of pages of standard literature have been read and heard around the evening lamp , or in " collateral readings , " by those with whom reading had been no habit . Two other clubs have lately been admitted , though meeting in distant towns . The total membership is at present one hundred and forty-four , and the aggregate number of pages read weekly averages about eighteen thousand . But it is recognized that an arithmetical count is but a crude way of indicating the work done , only justified by the absence of any other simple method . Many pages have been not merely read , but studied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represented , with those who move in the plainer walks of life distinctly in the majority , and it is believed that the members are being brought into a helpful contact with others from more or less fortunate and refined planes than their own , and are getting that knowledge of and proper regard for one another and one another 's widely divergent social conditions which every true interest of society must commend . And the second question : What errors or abuses is the scheme in danger of ? One , undoubtedly , is fashion . In view of this the greatest pains have been taken to avoid enlisting any sudden enthusiasm , or appealing , in the fortunate ranks of society , to the sorts of persons likely to be attracted by mere novelty or vogue . However , should the system anywhere , at any time , so rise into the favor of people of leisure as to . become fashionable , and thus tempt light-minded persons of fortune to take it up for their own mere diversion , it will meet the failure it will merit ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and place of such misuse . Another abuse to be guarded against is letting the work degenerate into class treatment . We need not expand the thought again . Class treatment , in this tountry at least , will merely fail to reach the classes reached after . The one great danger is the error of private sociality . It may work in two ways : persons may form clubs of really diverse social elements ,  - -  which will be proper ,  --  but in an indiscreet and impatient goodness of heart undertake to build up a mutual friendship and acquaintanceship by socialities , or let clubs idly drift into them . This would be bad , and only bad , whether for the club itself or as a precedent . For the consequent social confusion would either break up the club or alienate more or less of its members , and leave the remainder a petty social clique getting no good across the ordinary social lines . Or persons may form a club or clubs with members drawn all from one social rank , either in humbler or in higher life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but the foremost object of the whole scheme would thus be overlooked from the very start , and a new force added to confirm , where the design should be to offset , the crude assortments made by uncertain fortune and the caprices of private social selection . To start these clubs anywhere requires no outlay nor any wide cooperation . Wherever any man or woman of the most ordinary attainments can gather two , three , or four others , // in any sort or degree less accomplished , a club may be formed , and if necessary can be complete in itself ; or it may join itself by correspondence to some group of clubs elsewhere , and have the benefit of making weekly reports and getting weekly the aggregated record of the whole group of clubs . Wherever there is such a group of clubs there should be a president and a secretary , and it will probably always be for the best that the secretary receive some small quarterly or semi-yearly compensation in consideration of a business-like attention to his or her duties . An unpaid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against here . The home culture clubs are not recommended for filling churches , emptying charitable institutions , or eradicating any great visible public evil , but as means for proving practically our love and care for our less fortunate brother or sister . If the scheme , when time and diverse regions have fairly tried it , wins our needy fellow-man 's confidence and kindles his higher desires ; if it helps us to correct somewhat the misfortunes of others and to make human fraternity something wider than mere social affinity will , or social assortment ought to , stretch , it will live ; if not , it will drag no one with it into the grave . The home culture clubs are recommended not to zealots only , but to those generous thousands who have seen the poor success of so many efforts to commend the Christianity of the fortunate to the hearts of the unfortunate , and have seen the cause of failure in the neglect to secure personal acquaintance and to carry unprofessional friendly offices into the home , free from the burden of charity on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The plan is submitted to all who believe that to help a lowlier brother to supply any worthy craving of the mind that he may already have is the shortest , surest way to implant those highest cravings of the soul which seek and find repose only in harmony with the Divine will .
