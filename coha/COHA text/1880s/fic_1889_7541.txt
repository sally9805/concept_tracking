Osgood , Frances Sargent Locke , 1811-1850 : READ 'S GENEVIEVE. from Read 's Genevieve ( 1889 ) By the deep soul-light that lies ' Neath the fringes of her eyes  --  By the braided auburn hair , Waving off her forehead fair  --  By the rose-hues rare and meek , Lighting up her lovely cheek  --  By the girlish grace , I 'm sure , From his heart the painter drew her ! Leaning on the armed knight , Listening with a sad delight , All her spirit thrills and grieves With the lay her lover weaves . All sweet influences throng Round the maiden meek and still ; Music melting from the song , Like the ripple of a rill ; Balmy airs that come and go , Of their wild flowers talking low , With the charm whose mystic power Sways the soul at sunset hour ,  --  All into her heart have gone , Stealing round the dreamer there . Love , who until now slept on , ' Mid his roses , free from care , Now his smiles and tears arise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holier power Sways her being from this hour . Yes ! by all her beauty , sure From his heart the painter drew her ! As the minstrel , when he sung To the lyre that love had strung ; All the feeling , truth , and grace , Dawning in that shy , sad face , Told of one in life who stole , With her smile , his soul of soul ; So while Art and Genius high Tints of light and beauty weave , Well we know the painter 's eye Must have seen his Genevieve !
