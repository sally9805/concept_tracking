txt Among the bills introduced in the House to-day was an important one offered by Mr. Adams , of New-York , to establish a uniform system of bankruptcy throughout the United States . The measure is very long , and its 128 sections make a pamphlet of 73 pages . One of the sec-tions which will attract attention is that regarding involuntary bankruptcy , which provides among other acts for which a debtor may be adjudged a bankrupt . that any person who has stopped or suspended and not resumed payment of any of his debts made in the course of his business , may be so adjudged , but a written demand to pay must be made on him by the creditor , not less than 20 days after the debt shall mature . In order to protect persons from being harassed by creditors , a clause is inserted requirhig the creditor to a bond of not less than $500. which amount may be increased by the court upon notice that the penalty of the bond is not adequate or that the sureties are not responsible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provides that in no case shall the amount expended exceed $1,000 in value , anything in the statute of any State to the contrary notwithstanding . The bill also prohibits any creditor from voting for an Assignee who is related to the bankrupt , nor shall the claims of such rela-tives be counted in determining the amount or number necessary to a choice of an Assignee . Still another section provides that no Assignee shall retain in hispossession more than $250 under a penalty of 20 per cent . interest on all sums in excess of that sum . Any person proving a false or fictitious debt , shall forfeit three times the amount so proved for the benefit of the State . Under the section relating to the examination of witnesses it is provided that where a witness refuses to answer any proper question the Register may commit him as for contempt of court . The composition section provides that not less than 30 cents on the dollar shall be paid to a creditor ; otherwise he is not entitled to a composition . Where security is given it must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proving a false or fictitious debt under this section shall be punished by a fine of not more than three times the amount so proved or by imprisonment of not more than two years , or both , thus making it a penal offense . The penal section has a new and very strict clause . It pro-. , vides that any person who , in contemplation of bankruptcy , purchases any goods or chattels which have been purchased on credit and which remain unpaid for shall be punished by imprisonment for not more than three years . The words , " in contemplation of bankruptcy , " are inserted to meet the decision in the well-known case of the United States against Fox . Registers in Bankruptcy are given power to issue orders to show cause why debtors should not be adjudged bankrupts . Mr. Adams anticipates considerable discussion over this bill , especially regarding the first section mentioned above and that which virtually repeals the exemption laws in the States .                   @ @
