ARTICLE 111. - SUGGESTIVENESS IN ART . THOSE people who go out into the roadways of art crying Haro ! Haro ! in the name of realism would certainly gain their cause could numbers alone give them a verdict . For to say that the present tendency of the masses is toward the realistic side of life and art is but to state a trite axiom . We have about us on every hand the evidence of its truth . The age in which we live , dubbed Positive by Comte , has lost none of its positivism with his followers , but on the contrary has added to itself some latter-day exactness . So to-day we hear of innumerable exact sciences established by exact thinkers whose one aim is to get at the truth . This is quite as it should be ; for the proper aim of science is to discover and establish truth . But outside of the exact thinkers are a great many people who , burdening their minds with no great problems of moment , fancy they like truths and realities because these are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason that whatever is true must necessarily be good for one 's mental digestion . Truth being a very convenient pair of scales wherein things may be weighed one is not surprised to find it used for many things outside of the sciences . The arts are put in the balances and we hear great talk of realistic painting , life-like sculpture , and scientific poetry . Doubtless when the exact thinkers have time to turn their minds upon it we shall hear somewhat of an exact music and a positive drama . The inclination is that way . This is not quite as it should be ; for the expressive arts have to do with the realm of the imagination , and their province is to please by stimulating the imagination of the beholder . They are not in any sense simple statements of truths or facts . But it is not strange that people of to-day should demand an art of facts . The age , as already observed , is prosaic , scientific , realistic . The idealist is scouted at as a relic of speculative days ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mr. Howells ; and the old-time poet-well he is considered quite a good joke all around . The populace , always // cursed with a want and possessed of a longing for exact knowledge quite worthy of our first parents , calls out for truth . And they have it-have it in excellent form at that . The modern poet , in perfect conformity with the demand for greatness in little things , does not ascend the brightest heaven of invention , but , on the contrary , like the Pen descends to an earthly love . He pitches his tent in the valley and begins to dissect the wind , the rain , the light , the daisy , the blade of grass at his feet , the minds of the people about him . His researches , remarkable for their subtle analyses and pretty conceits , find vent in verse of polished form and of scientific veracity . The novelist rather leads the poet in minuteness of description . The society talk at an afternoon tea ; the motives inducing a heroine to accept an offered love or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , the flash of diamonds , the sheen of satin ; a description of nature 's face on a June day ; mountain life in Tennessee ; or boulevard life in Paris are all set forth with realistic fidelity and not without skill of handling . But it is the painter after all to whom people look for absolute truthfulness . If an audience becomes weary it can skip along bits of realism in poetry and fiction , but in painting it insists upon it that nothing shall be omitted and everything shall be realized . The great number of people understand painting to be an imitation of nature , and so the reasoning is , naturally enough , the closer the imitation the better the art . What wonder then that the artist paints a sportsman 's outfit on the back of a door and spends days recording the inscription on a gun-lock , the exact creases in a pheasant 's foot , or the seams and texture of a shooting coat . What wonder that he paints rugs , bronzes , china , and Second Empire furniture to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myriad of tiny waves reflective of the sky ; that his people all walk out of their canvases ; that his heads realize wrinkles and eye lashes ; that his trees show each individual leaf . He assures us , as all realists do , that he speaks truth , and so he does ; yet somehow we get little satisfaction out of his art . We wonder how it is all done , but our wonder is that of a child at a juggler 's trick . The mind is perhaps astonished at the count less touches of the brush as the child by the conjurer 's leger de main , but there is no aesthetic pleasure to be derived from such // art . The poem , the novel , the painting , none of them touches us profoundly . And why is this since they are all so very true , so realistic ? For that very reason ; they are nothing but truth . The element of imagination is wanting in both the object and the subject . There is no suggestion of anything that may stir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mechanical problem of truth submitted to the intellect and appealing in no way to the emotions . In this element of the imagination many observers are lacking , like Joe Willet ; and , as the elder Willet expressed it , they need their faculties " drawed out . " One day in the Medici Chapel at Florence I chanced to overhear a party of tourists lamenting the fact that the great marble of Michael Angelo , the Day upon the tomb of Lorenzo , had never been carried to completion . The figure of Night on the opposite side they thought rather good , especially after one of them had read Michael Angelo 's lines explanatory of it , but the Day had chisel marks in the face , the foot looked as though covered with ice and snow , and there was no titular explanation to it . It was " such a pity . " Is it then a pity that the sculptor never finished it ? I think not . Every additional stroke of the chisel would have detracted from it , every rough edge smoothed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As it remains to us it is the very embodiment of power . Finish might have ruined it , but it is doubtful if it could have improved it . There like a fallen god he lies half embedded in his matrix of stone . The suggestion of mighty power is given ; let the observer 's imagination do the rest . The half finish , the mystery , the uncertainty give the opportunity . One may fancy as many have done , that the figure symbolizes the loss of Florentine freedom and that the grand captive with his massive brow and sunken eyes half rises wearily to view the morning light shining for him in vain . Again one may think him a new Prometheus bound to the rock ; one of the Gigantes ; or perhaps a conquered Titan lying along the hills of Tartarus in the drear twilight brooding in melancholy silence over the loss of Olympus . To whatever one may imagine regarding the figure , the element of reserved strength will lend assistance . Cut the captive from his bed of stone and the strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish the marble , and an existent fact precludes the possibility of wide imagination . For the same reason one finds it hard to regret that some of the finest Greek marbles have come to us in fragments only . The Venus of Melos with her fine head reveals to us an ahuost perfect beauty ; but is the Crouching Venus with her head , arms , and feet gone , and part of her left knee knocked out , less beautiful ? The exquisitely modeled torso , the graceful pose , the rhythm of line , the rendering of the flesh raise the mind to a lofty pitch in conceiving what the head should be . Place a head like that of the Medicean Venus upon it and the statue loses ; imagine , however , a head of that living beauty which sculptor 's chisel never yet cut from stone and the statue gains . This is equally true of that marble which I venture to think one of the very greatest that has come to us out of all the past  --  the Samothracian Victory of the Louvre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her remaining wings of stone , with the motion of rapid flight still about her , she touches , just alights upon the prow of a ship . How the push of that grand figure up against the wind flutters and strains the delicate drapery until the limbs and the torso seem bursting through its folds ! How strong must have been the gale beating against the broad bosom and whistling through the mighty wings that required the throwing forward of the upper part of the body to meet it ! Who was she , what was she , whence came she ? Had she the head of a grey-eyed Athene , calm , majestic , powerful in repose ; did she hold in her hand the laurel wreath for those who had lately conquered ; or was she a War Fury with flying disheveled hair , eyes aflame like a Medusa , and an outstretched arm and finger pointing the way to battle ? One may be pardoned for not regretting the lost head . It might have been insipid , for the Greeks placed the head below the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there would be no room for the imagination . A handsome , even a superior face would have dragged down the whole marble . Nothing but a head of superlative majesty could crown that faultless figure , and , great as were the Greek artists , it would have required a great god of art such as we have never known to realize so high an ideal . Given the figure alone and it kindles in // the beholder 's mind so bright a flame that imagination nobly sees the missing features . For that same imagination can carve and paint in perfection such things as no hand however cunning has ever been able to reveal in substance . Here is no quarrel with truth nor for that matter with realism except as the latter tends to absolute imitation . True art seldom thrusts forward falsities for purposes of effect ; rather does it consider the measure of truth to be used . The colossal Day of Michael Angelo generalizes a large truth ; it does not realize small ones . The Samothracian Victory in its present condition tells a half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagination supply details if it will ; enough for art that it suggests them . And the power of selection as to what shall be told and what shall be left untold characterizes the great artists in all the arts . Your poet of realism is a Doctor Johnson sort of a person who hits with his cane every horse post in the street to let you know that it is there ; the true poet strikes occasionally but with emphasis . The great master of art , how well he knew the imagination 's vulnerable point . The lovers , Lorenzo and Jessica , are out in the evening air ; with what consummate skill Shakspeare describes the stillness of the night , the peaceful sky , the shining stars , the whole scene with that one suggestive line : " How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank . " The landscape appears before one as by magic ; the mind is roused by the image and responds to it . Your realist would have put us to sleep with dreary descriptions of grass and groves and gutter guide-posts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , is a genre painting of the hounds of Theseus to equal a Snyders or a Velasquez : " My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind So flewed , so sanded ; and their heads are hung With ears that sweep away the morning dew ; Crook-knee 'd and dew-lapp 'd like Thessalian bulls . " Coleridge , too , knew how to accomplish much by slight means , as witness this Turneresque marine ( lacking Turner 's detail ) from the Ancient Mariner 's description of the skeleton ship : // " The western wave was all aflame . The day was well nigh done . Almost upon the western wave Rested the broad , bright sun ; When that strange shape drove suddenly Betwixt us and the sun . And straight the sun was flecked with bars ( Heaven 's mother send us grace ! ) As if through a dungeon grate he peered With broad and burning face . " And here is Byron 's ghost portrait of Nimroud as he appears to Sardanapalus seated at the banquet board of Assyria 's collected monarchs : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was still yet lighted ; his long locks curled down On his vast bust , whence a huge quiver rose With shaft heads feathered from the eagle 's wing That peeped up bristling through his serpent hair . " Devoid of details , utterly lacking in minute finish , yet how quickly the mind grasps the different pictures ! The salient features are sketched in bold outlines , the predominant colors laid on with a broad brush ; the image is in each case forcibly presented , enough is known . Add minutia and the pictures lose , first , by sacrificing the strength of the more prominent features to the less ones* second , by placing in the object ( the pictures ) that which should properly remain with the subject ( the observer 's mind ) . It is not enough that art should be simply a statement of facts ; it is not enough that the observer should receive it coldly as such . The first must stimulate ; the second must be stimulated . And the imagination of man is easily aroused if properly addressed . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it sticks and stones , refuse and rubbish , detail and minutiae , and it remains passive , but drop into it a spark of genius and immediately it bursts into a flame of activity . Few had a more happy faculty of calling up a face or a scene before one 's mind by a single touch of art than that novelist who has now become a St. Sebastian target for the arrows of the realists-Charles Dickens . It is true he generally seizes // upon a peculiarity which he negatively exaggerates by allowing it to stand alone . That he carries this too far in some cases and thus becomes extravagant may be admitted without in any way shattering the principle of art upon which he works . In Little Dorrit for instance , he wishes to intimate that Monsieur Rigand is a sly Mephistophellan rascal , but he does not go into the man 's back history to do it ; nor does he dissect IRigaud 's psychological nature or genealogical record to show the causes impelling him toward evil . He simply takes him seated on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When Monsieur Rigaud laughed a change took place in his face that was more remarkable than prepossessing . His moustache went up under his nose , and his nose came down over his moustache , in a very sinister and cruel manner . " iDoes that not place the foxy , crafty Rigaud instantly before us ? In Our iJfutual Friend the few lines descriptive of Rogue Riderhood as he stands in the doorway of the lawyer 's office to give evidence against Gaffer , rubbing with uneasy hand a wet fur cap against the grain , tell the man and his character better than a chapter of words . In word pictures the artist successfnily catches the mind 's eye by few but vivid flashes . It is not an easy task , for instance , to imagine the waters of the Nile turned to blood under the outstretched rod of Aaron . We are slow to grasp the scene and not even the account in Exodu8 brings it fully before us . But when Th6ophile Gautier , in Le i ? oman de la Jifomie , tells us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " pink foam " upon the shore , the imagination starts with a sudden bound . If I may be allowed the mixed metaphor that " pink foam " is the spark in the powder magazine . And again the true artist always induces his audience to meet him more than half way . Like the children who followed the Pied Piper , they see visions , but the Piper inspires the visions by " three notes " from a simple cane . Mr. Besant in his Art oj Fiction tells us that when that great master of fiction , Charles Reade , " in his incomparable tale of The Cloicter and The hearth , sends Gerard and Dennis the Burgundian on that journey through France , it is with the fewest possible words that he suggests the sights and persons met with on the way ; yet so great is the art of the writer , that , // almost without being told , we see the road , a mere rough track , winding beside the river and along the valleys ; we see the silent forests where lurk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the merchants , peasants , beggars , soldiers who go riding by ; the writer does not pause in his story to tell us all this , but we feel it-by the mere action of the piece and the dialogue we are compelled to see the scenery ; the life of the fifteenth century passes before us with hardly a word to picture it . " I know not why writers , sculptors , and painters should take such pains to omit and to suggest when it is so much easier to fill in and to elaborate unless there be some deep method in it all . Their doing so is not simply trickery as we have been often told ; nor is it a shrewd playing with , a baiting of one 's imaginative appetite . Rather is it a conscious knowledge of the limitations of artistic power and a recognition that the people for whom art is created have a part to play in its proper understanding . Art-biography if it were truly written would be one long wail over the unattainable . For never an artist lived whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plays sad havoc with the conception . The mind roams free ; it dwells in a*rial palaces , wraps itself round with golden cloud embroideries , catches strains from the poetry of the gods , listens to the music of the spheres . The hand is shackled by a limit of possibilities ; however skilled there is a point beyond which it may not go . The eye sees and the hand reaches up to grasp the soaring beauty , but every restraining touch upon the butterfly wings " brushes their brightest hues away . " How peurile the poet 's thought when he has it pinned down to earth in verse ! How insipid compared with his conception is the face showing upon the painter 's canvas ! What else but an recognition of the impossible in art ever led Velasquez in his picture of the Crucifixion to half hide the face of Christ under his long , flowing hair ? Was not his doing so a further recognition of the possible in the beholder 's imagination ? In these two concessions Velasquez proved himself a great artist . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ . Doubtless then as now people found fault with the type and to paint the godlike was impossible . So he painted not the divine // but the purely human , not the living but the dead from which the godlike had flown . It was a shrewd Yelasquez that chose the human nature of Christ instead of the divine ; it was a wise Velasquez that half covered from view that human face , leaving just enough of it for suggestion ; it was a great Velasquez that relegated to each person 's imagination the transforming of that human face into one of divinity . It seems a paradoxical statement to say that an artist often gains by what he leaves out , but a moment 's reflection will bring the general truth home to us even within our own experience outside of the arts . The instances of it are numerous among the painters , though the bold application of it so far as the omitting of half a face as in Velasquez ' Crucifixion is seldom met with . A modern painter , J. F. Millet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sower . The whole picture is rather indefinite in treatment-what a realist would call " blottesque " I presume . The foreground is in the dusky shadow of a hill ; above the hill is the high light of the evening sky and against this sky appears a roughly treated ox-team . In the foreground with his swinging motion strides the Sower . He is the most finished of any object in the picture , and yet he is only suggestion . Foot , leg , hand , and arm are consciously blurred though well-enough modeled and endowed with great action ; the clothes appear coarse though their texture is not actually told ; and if one looks up into the face hoping to peer into the eyes and read a character therein he will be disappointed . The peasant 's hat is pulled down low on the head , the forehead and eyes are cast in deep shadow , and the whole face is but a hint , an intimation . But how well it is given ! How quick we are to grasp Millet 's meaning ! The sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweat and dust of a long day are upon his face and forehead but he heeds them not ; he is weary and worn but the long stride never falters , the swinging hand still scatters the grain . What a hard , cheerless , almost hopeless life is that of the tiller of the fields , and what a hero he is to breast it so nobly ! He flinches not under the severity of fate but with sad serious eyes fronts the inevitable . And who heeds while he struggles for the grudged existence ? The children hunger , the wife weeps , the man // sighs , but the great world rolls on unmoved . There is a wealth of poetry to be gotten from the subject , yet it is not all in the picture ; we come to know the meaning of toil and sorrow and yet Millet tells us but a part of it . The poetry is somewhat in our own minds ; Millet 's task was to touch it into life by the suggestive means of form and color . He never thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peasant ; he did not eliminate the mystery by detail , nor crush out the viewer 's imagination by realistic facts ; he told a subtle half truth and left the other half to be supplied by the spectator . How puerile and unsatisfactory is exact art in comparison with suggestive art is shown in the products of those young Parisian imitators of Millet who are to-day painting the sabotshod peasantry of France . Almost any one of the imitators is a better technician than Millet and it is not by virtue of more skillful fingers that Millet is superior . Their line and color and texture and light are oftentimes beyond criticism , and they paint the peasantry in the open fields quite as honestly as did their master ; but somehow their pictures do not give us as much pleasure . We settle the matter in our own minds by saying " They have not Millet 's genius ; " but that , I opine , is only another way of saying " They have not Millet 's poWer of suggestion . " They paint well but they paint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth of which we admit and then pass on having no food for further thought or stimulant for the imagination . A different style of treatment from the modern Parisians , a style similar to that of Millet , marked the products of the Fontaineblean-Barbizon landscapists-those discoverers whom the world of art so persistently misunderstood and whom the world of exact thinkers does not now believe in . To the realist a landscape by Corot is an enigma . He declares that " it is not true , " by which he doubtless means that it is not exactly true , or the whole truth . He can not understand why Corot does not make an inventory with a paint brush of all the leaves on a given tree , of all the blades of grass on a given foreground , of all the rocks on a given hillside . The realist is after truth , but Corot is after beauty and so he sweeps away the leaves , and grass , and petty minuthe with a large brush and // calls us , by the absence of distracting details at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of light . And this is so essentially Shakspearian in conception and execution that I may be allowed to quote again that line from the Jllerckctnt of Venice : " How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank . " The dramatist it will be observed fixes attention on the moonlight , that chief feature of night , and without another word the whole landscape rises before us . This is precisely what Corot does . He makes us see the light alone , leaving the trees , the grass , and all that to our imagination . Corot was Shakspearian enough to seize upon the all-predominant feature of landscape , light , and for that reason if for no other he was the greatest landscape painter of his age . His masterpieces , like the Orpheus and the Danse des Amours , are considered masterpieces almost solely because of their emphasis of light , and when , as in some of his works , he sinks down to the emphasizing of air or foliage as the leading features his art loses proportionately . Rousseau was in many respects a better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in aim nor so lofty in conception . The solidity of the earth , the volume of foliage , the color effects of the clouds were his themes , but treated in a broad manner never detailed , except in his earlier and poorer works , and always full of suggestion . Diaz in reflected light and the color of the foliage , Daubigny in grey tone and atmosphere , IDecamp in warmth of color and light , Dupr6 in stormy skies , are all so many instances at hand showing a similarity of treatment if a difference of theme . Each one suggests the sub-features by intensifying the main features ; none of them fritters away strength in an attempt to rival the work of a photographer 's camera , or pays much attention to supernumeraries when more important actors are upon the stage . It requires your modern realist to give the mole hill as high a value as the mountain ; to weary us with a burden of geographical and botanical statistics ; to stuff us like roast turkeys with bread and butter lawns , sage and carawayseed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom I have named used the forms of nature in a more effective manner . They all understood the meaning of // " dramatic effect , " they all knew how to sacrifice the less to the greater , and they all knew what to leave out as well as what to put in . The art of omission is quite as great as that of commission . For the pnblic may not object to what it knows nothing about , but it very often objects to what it does know about . We come now to appreciate the negative value of " breadth of treatment " which lies not in what is brushed in , but in what is brnshed ont ; not in what is accomplished alone , but in what is left unaccomplished . Broad treatment is generally synonymous with snggestive treatment . It annihilates details , concentrates force on general truths , and speaks few but winged words . But it has a positive value which it is proper we should appreciate likewise . Painters have what has been called their " different periods " of production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the early period when exactness and finish characterize the work and make it hard and unsatisfactory ; there is the middle period in which the brush begins to move freer and details do not receive so much attention ; and there is the late period in which breadth of handling becomes noticeable , detail vanishes , and the strong features alone remain . The work in the last period of a painter 's career is generally considered his best , unless it degenerates though haste of the brush or weakness of the mind as , for instance , in Jules Dupr6 and Turner . The French landscapists , whose art we now value so highly , passed through these periods ; Rembrandt , Rubens , Van Dyke , Hals , Terborch , Brouwer ( I give the names at random for the statement is generally true of them all ) , passed through them ; and even if we go back to the Italians we shall find , in a less marked degree , that the art of Michael Angelo , Raphael , Andrea del Sarto , Titian , Tintoretto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of view and a comparative breadth of handling . This change of style as the painter advances is not due to carelessness or inability , except occasionally , for the hand and the eye have become more skilled , are surer and truer , are at their best , and this perfected technique is in itself a source of pleasure . Yet more than to skilled execution is the change due to mental experience which // teaches men as they advance in years to take broader and loftier views of nature and of life . The trained mind of fifty grasps subjects in the round , in the block , where the untrained mind of twenty frets itself sick over the petty details of a part . It is to make people see subjects in their broader meanings that artists paint them broadly . If one craves detail let his imagina*ion supply it ; put it in the canvas and the eye will never look beyond it . In the Vienna portraits by Balthaser Denner we lose ourselves in wonder over the facial delineation , the wrinkles , the moles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look for the character of the sitter , and if we did we should not find it . In the Gevartins portrait by Van Dyke in the National Gallery at London , or in the portraits of Rembrandt by himself where he is represented as an old man , we wonder at the marvellous character which is depicted ; we never think to look for facial delineation . Which is the more important in portraiture the character of the man or the wrinkles in his face ? There is great truth of detail in Mr. Henry P. Smith 's mid-ocean pictures  --  the truth of hammered-silver waves and reflected light ; but the artist overlooks in detail that chief feature which Courbet in his great picture of the Wave in the Luxembourg seized upon so triumphantly , the mighty strength of the ocean . The one picture is the greatness of the infinitely little ; the other is a little of the infinitely great . Even in genre and still-life pictures there is a difference between a broad and a narrow view of subjects . ilnysum may paint flowers with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Desgoffe may imitate crystals and bronzes , and Ahna Tadama may realize the stains in a piece of marble ; but after all when men like Vollon and Fortuny see these objects in the round and paint them in the bulk they have shown their most salient features and thereby suggested to us their details . In literature there is such a thing as insulting the intelligence of one 's readers by offering it too much small knowledge ; there is no good reason why the application should not be made to art . Thoughtful students of hooks one generally finds to be men who have a preference for the suggestive writers . The thoughts that simply increase our store of abstract knowledge // are of small consequence compared with the thoughts that make us think . A page from Emerson 's E9Ray8 will weigh down in value a dozen pages from the Encyclopedia Britannica . Doubtless it will be admitted that this is as true of the poem , the drama , and the novel as of the essay . Is it not equally true of the plastic and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work for no other reason than that it has the freshness of suggestion . The painter , it may be conceded , has a quicker eye , a keener imagination than the amateur , so that where the sketch finds him at home it may find the amateur far at sea ; but surely the latter has some eye , some imagination , though they be not highly skilled , which the painter may address suggestively and not unsuccessfully . That art which leaves us where it found us fulfills no serious mission on earth . A picture may not be able to exalt us to great heights of splendor , it may not music-like rouse an Alexander as with " a rattling peal of thunder " ; but unless some thought in it strikes into fire new thoughts in ns , unless it touches some responsive chord in our nature , unless it somehow stimulates us with new life and pleasure the painter 's graceful tracery of form , his brilliant flush of color have been expended in vain .
