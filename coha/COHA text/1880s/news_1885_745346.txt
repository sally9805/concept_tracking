txt Andrew Carnegie , the Pittsburg millionaire . was reading over some private dispatches about the failure when a TIMES reporter found him at the Windsor last night . " Well , yes , " he said , " I was surprised at the firm 's failure . I am informed that it was precipitated by a demand for an $80,000 call loan from a New-York house . know that within a year or so the firm has been compelled to borrow considerable money , and that its exmilent credit enabled it to secure about all that it needed in the East . It is not a great while since the Oliver Brothers bought out two of the partners  --  Messrs . Lewis and Phillips  --  and since then they have been spending money in enlarging and improving their works . They have been preparing to maimfacuture large ; uantities of steel wire . I think , though , they have been a little over-confident . " " Do you think that the liabilities will be as large as reported , $5,0U0.000 ? " " I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do reach that figure . There Is no doubt , though , about the firm 's obtainintr all the indulgence and assistance it can reasonably require , because ' Harry ' Oliver is one of the shrewdest and ablest men in the business , and one of the most respected citizens of Pittsburg . He is popular and has hosts of friends who will help him . Ho has done more to up the place than any other one citizen . I feel assured that the firm will be able to go on all right , and within a short time too . " " Will the failure affect other houses in Pittsburg much ? " " I do not believe that it will . Not much of the firm 's legitimate business paper was held among the Pittsburg manufacturers . Its home indebtedness can not he very large . and I am as , sured that it is distributed among banks and a few business men abundantly able to take care of it . " " How about the general effect on the : iron trade ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that the failure will seriously affect it . " " Do you mind saying whether or not your firm is a creditor ? " " Very little , very little , " answered Mr. Carnegie reluctantly . I Really , " ho continued , seriously , " I am sorry that we came out as well as we did . It 's hard on the other fellows . Though our business is a little different from Oliver Brothers ' , we have at times had large dealings with them . But , all told , they did not Dwe us more than $5,000 at the time of the failure . You may say from me , " added Mr. Carnegie in conclusion , " that I believe ' Harry ' Oliver will be able to get all the assistance he requires , and that his mills will soon be running wain all right .
