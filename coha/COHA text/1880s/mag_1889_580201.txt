THE FRENCH ALLIANCE AND THE CONWAY CABAL . THE history of the Revolutionary War may be divided into four well-marked periods . The first period begins in 1761 with the resistance of James Otis to the general search-warrants , and it may be regarded as ending in June , 1774 , when the acts for changing the government of Massachusetts were intended to take effect . This period of constitutional discussion culminated in the defiance of Great Britain by the people of Boston when they threw the tea into the harbor ; and the acts of April , 1774 , by which Parliament replied to the challenge , were virtually a declaration of war against the American colonies , though yet another year elapsed before the first bloodshed at Lexington . The second period opens with June , 1774 , when Massachusetts began to nullify the acts of Parliament , and it closes with the Declaration of Jndependeiice . During this period warfare was carried on only for the purpose of obtaining a redress of grievances , and without any design of bringing about a political separation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain . The theatre of war was mainly confined to New England and Canada ; and while the Americans failed in the attempt to conquer Canada , their defensive warfare was crowned with success . The fighting of this period began with the victory of Lexington ; it ended with the victory of Fort Moultrie . New England , except the island of Newport , was finally freed from the presence of the British , and no further attack was made upon the Southern States for more than two years . The essential feature of the third period , comprising the years 1776 and 1777 , was the struggle for the State of New York and the great natural strategic line of the Mohawk and Hudson rivers . Independence having been declared , the United States and Great Britain were now fighting each other single-handed , like two separate and foreign powers . It was the object of Great Britain to conquer the United States , and accordingly she struck at the commercial and military centre of the confederation . If she could have thoroughly conquered the State of New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have broken the confederation in two , and might perhaps have proceeded to overcome its different parts in detail . Hence in this period of the war everything centres about New York , such an outlying expedition as that of Howe against Philadelphia having no decisive military value except in its bearings upon the issue of the great central conflict . The strategy of the Americans was mainly defensive , though with regard to certain operations they assumed the offensive with brilliant success . The period began with the disasters of Long Island and Fort Washington ; it ended with the triumph of Saratoga . As the net result of the two years ' work , the British had taken and held the cities of New York and Philadelphia and the town of Newport . The fortress of Ticonderoga , which they had likewise taken , they abandoned after the overthrow of Burgoyne ; and in like manner they retired from the highlands of the Hudson , which the Americans now proceeded to occupy with a stronger force than before . Iii short , while the British had lost an army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were actually encamped . Their attempt to break through the centre of the American position had ended in total defeat , and it had now become clear to discerning minds that there was very small chance of their // ever being able to conquer the United States . The fourth period , upon which we are now entering , begins with the immediate consequences of the victory of Saratoga , and extends to the treaty of 1783 , whereby Great Britain acknowledged the independence of the United States . The military history of this period ends with the surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown , in October , 1781 , just four years after the surrender of Burgoyne . Except as regards the ultimate triumph of the American arms , the history of these four years presents striking contrasts to the history of the two years we have just passed in review . The struggle is no longer confined to the arms of Great Britain and the United States , but it extends in some measure over the whole civilized world , though it is only France , with its army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation with the final result in America . Moreover , instead of a well-aimed and concentrated blow at the centre of the American position , the last period of the war consisted partly of a straggling and disorderly series of movements , designed simply to harass the Americans and wear out their patience , and partly of an attempt to conquer the Southern States and detach them from the Union . There is , accordingly , less dramatic unity in this last stage of the war than in the period which ended at Saratoga , and it is less susceptible of close and consecutive treatment ; but on the other hand , in richness of incidents and in variety of human interest it is in no wise inferior to the earlier periods . The first consequence of Saratoga was the retreat of the British government from every one of the positions for the sake of which it had begun the war . The news of Burgoyne 's surrender reached England just before Parliament adjourned for Christmas , and Lord North immediately gave notice that as soon as the holidays were over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The general feeling in England was one of amazement and consternation . In these days , when we are accustomed to contemplate military phenomena of enormous magnitude , when we have lately carried on a war in which more than two million men were under arms , and more than two million dollars were expended every day , we must not forget how different was the historic background upon which events were projected a century ago . Those were not the days of submarine telegraphs and Cunard steamships , and in trying to carry on warfare across three thousand miles of ocean the problem before George III . was far more arduous than that which the great Frederick had solved , when , acting on interior lines and supported by British gold , he overcame the combined assaults of France and Austria and Russja . The loss which Great Britain had now suffered could not easily be made good . At the same time it was generally believed , both in England and on the continent of Europe , that the loss of the American colonies would entail the ruin of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ohitical economists , " literary men , " like Adam Smith and Josiah Tucker , were far-seeing enough to escape this prodigious fallacy ; even Chatham was misled by it . It was not understood that English America and English Britain were bound together by commercial and social ties so strong that no question of political union or severance could permanently affect them . It was not foreseen that within a century the dealings of Great Britain with the independent United States would far exceed her dealings with the rest of the world . On the contrary , it was believed that if  |p0-litical  independence were conceded to the Americans , the whole stream of transatlantic commerce would be diverted to other parts of Europe , that the // British naval power would forthwith decay , and that England would sink from her imperial position into such a mere insular nation as that over which Henry VIII . had ruled . So greatly did men overrate political conditions ; so far were they from appreciating those economic conditions which are so much more deep-seated and essential . Under these circumstances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the independence of the United States were the Rockingham Whigs , and these were now in a small minority . Lord Rockingham and his friends , with Burke as their leader , had always condemned the harsh and stupid policy of the government toward America , and they were now ready to concede independence because they were convinced that conciliation was no longer practicable . Lord Chatham , on the other band , with his section of the Whig party , while even more emphatically condemning the policy of the government , still clung to the hope of conciliation , and could not bear to think of the disruption of the empire . But with the Tory party , which had all along supported the government , the war was still popular , and no calamity seemed so great as the loss of the American colonies . Most of the country squires believed in crushing out rebellion , no matter where it occurred or for what reason , and this view was almost unanimously taken by the clergy . In the House of Lords none were so bloodthirsty as the bishops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Old Testament which refer to smiting Jehovah 's enemies hip and thigh . The trading classes in the large towns , and the few manufacturers who bad come upon the scene , were so afraid of losing the American market that they were ready to vote men and money without stint . The town of Manchester even raised and equipped two regiments at its own expense . Thus while the great majority of the British nation believed that Amer. ica must be retained at whatever cost , a majority of this majority believed that it must be conquered before it could be conciliated or reasoned with ; and this was the opinion which had thus far found favor with Lord North and controlled the policy of the government . We may imagine , then , the unspeakable amazement of the House of Commons , on the 17th of February , 1778 , when Lord North arose in his place and moved that every one of the points for which Samuel Adams and his friends had zealously contended , from the passage of the Stamp Act to the breaking out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without further parley . By the bill which he now proceeded to read , the famous Tea Act and the act for changing the constitution of Massachusetts were unconditionally repealed . It was furthermore declared that Parliament would renounce forever the right of raising a revenue in America ; and it was provided that commissioners should be sent over to treat with Congress , armed with full powers for negotiating a peace . Pending the negotiations the commissioners might proclaim a truce , and might suspend the operation of any act of Parliament relating to America which had been passed since 1763 . They might also proclaim complete amnesty for all political offenses . So complete a political somersault has seldom been turned by an English minister , and the speech in which Lord North defended himself was worthy of the occasion . Instead of resigning when he saw that his policy had proved a failure , as an English minister would naturally do , he suddenly shifted his ground , and adopted the policy which the opposition had urged in vain against him three years before , and which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not only did he thus shift his ground , but he declared that this policy of conciliation was really // the one which he had favored from the beginning . There was more truth in this than appeared at the moment , for in more than one instance Lord North had , with culpable weakness , carried out the king 's policy in defiance of his own convictions . It was in vain , however , that he sought to clear himself of responsibility for the Tea Act , the oppressive edicts of 1774 , and the recent events in America generally . The House received his bill and his speech in profound silence . Disgust and dejection filled every bosoni , yet no one could very well help voting for the measures . The Tories , already chagrined by the bitter news from Saratoga , were enraged at being thus required to abandon all the ground for which they had been fighting , yet no way seemed open for them but to follow their leader . The Whigs were vexed at seeing the wind taken out of their sails , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had always earnestly supported . All sat for some moments in grim , melancholy silence , till Fox , arising , sarcastically began his speech by congratulating his Whig friends on having gained such a powerful and unexpected ally in the prime minister . Taunts and innuendoes flew back and forth across the House . From the Tory side came sullen cries that the country was betrayed , while from among the Whigs the premier was asked if he supposed himself armed with the spear of Achilles , which could heal the wounds that itself had made . It was very pointedly hinted that the proposed measures would not be likely to produce much effect upon the Americans unless accompanied by Lord North 's resignation , since , coming from him , they would come as from a tainted spring . But in spite of all this ill-feeling the bill was passed , and the same reasons which had operated here carried it also through the House of Lords . On the 11th of March it received the royal signature , and three commissioners were immediately appointed to convey infor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a treaty of peace . The conciliatory policy of Lord North had come at least two years too late . The American leaders were now unwilling to consider the question of reunion with the mother country upon any terms ; and even before the extraordinary scene in Parliament which we have just witnessed , a treaty had been made with France , by which the Aniericans soleniiily agreed , in consideration of armed support to be furnished by that power , never to entertain proposals of peace from Great Britain until their independence should be acknowledged , and never to conclude a treaty of peace except with the concurrence of their new ally . The French government had secretly assisted the Americans as early as the summer of 1776 by occasional loans of money , and by receiving American privateers in French ports . The longer Great Britain and her colonies could be kept weakening each other by warfare , the greater the hope that France might at some time be enabled to step in and regain her lost maritime empire . But it was no part of French policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper moment should come for reaping some decisive material advantage . At the beginning of the year 1778 that moment seemed to have arrived . The capture of Burgoyne and the masterly strategy which Washington had shown , in spite of his ill-success on the field , had furnished convincing proof that the American alliance was wouth having . At the same time , the announcement that Lord North was about to bring in conciliatory measures indicated that the British government was weakening in its purpose . Should such measures succeed in conciliating the Americans and in bringing about a firm reunion with the mother country , the schemes of France would be irretrievably ruined . Now , therefore , was the golden opportunity , and France was not slow to seize it . // On the 6th of February the treaty with the United States was signed at Paris . By a special article it was stipulated that Spain might enter into the alliance at her earliest convenience . Just now , too , Frederick the Great publicly opened the port of Dantzic to American cruisers and prohibited Hessian soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wrote to Franklin at Paris that he should probably soon follow the king of France in recognizing the independence of the United States . Rumors of all these things kept coming to England while the conciliatory measures were passing through Parliament , and on the 13th of March , two days after those measures had become law , the action of France was formally communicated to the British government , and war was instantly declared . The situation of England seemed desperate . With one army lost in America , with the recruiting ground in Germany barred against her , with a debt piling up at the rate of a million dollars a week , and with a very inadequate force of troops at home in case of sudden invasion , she was now called upon to contend with the whole maritime power of France , to which that of Spain was certain soon to be added . And to crown all , the government had just written its own condemnation by confessing before the world that its policy toward America , which had been the cause of all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this terrible moment the eyes of all England were turned upon one great man , old now and wasted by disease , but the fire of whose genius still burned bright and clear . The government must be changed , and in the Earl of Chatham the country had still a leader whose very name was synonymous with victory . Not thus had matters gone in the glorious days of Quiberon and Minden and Quebec , when his skillful hand was at the helm , and every heart in England and America beat high with the consciousness of worthy ends achieved by well - directed valor . To whom but Chatham should appeal be made to repair the drooping fortunes of the empire ? It was in his hands alone that a conciliatory policy could have any chance of success . From the first he had been the consistent advocate of the constitutional rights of the Americans ; and throughout America he was the object of veneration no less hearty and enthusiastic than that which was accorded to Washington himself . Overtures that would be laughed at as coming from North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the other hand , should the day for conciliation have irrevocably passed by , the magic of his name was of itself sufficient to create a panic in France , while in England it would kindle that popular enthusiasm which is of itself the best guarantee of success . In Germany , too , the remembrance of the priceless services he had rendered could not but dispel the hostile feeling with which Frederick had regarded England since the accession of George III . Moved by such thoughts as these , statesmen of all parties , beginning with Lord North himself , implored the king to form a new ministry under Chatham . Lord Mansfield , his bitterest enemy , declared that without Chatham at the helm the ship of state must founder , and his words were echoed by Bute and the young George Grenville . At the opposite extreme of politics , the Duke of Richmond , who had long since made up his mind that the colonies must be allowed to go , declared , nevertheless , that if it were to be Chatham who should see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would aid him in every possible way . The press teemed with expressions of the popular faith in Chatham , and every one impatiently wondered that the king should lose a day in calling to the head of affairs the only man who could save the country . // But all this unanimity of public opinion went for nothing with the selfish and obdurate king . All the old reasons for keeping Chatham out of office had now vanished , so far as the American question was concerned ; for by consenting to North 's conciliatory measures the king had virtually come over to Chatham 's position , and as regarded the separation of the colonies from the mother country , Chatham was no less loath than the king to admit the necessity of such a step . Indeed , the policy upon which the king had now been obliged to enter absolutely demanded Chatham as its exponent instead of North . Everybody saw this , and no doubt the king saw it himself , but it had no weight with him in the presence of personal considerations . He hated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rancorous spirit can feel toward one that is generous and noble ; an ( 1 he well knew besides that , with that statesman at the head of affairs , his own share in the government wouki be reduced to nullity . To see the government administered in accordance with the policy of a responsible minister , and in disregard of his own irresponsible whims , was a humiliation to which he was not yet ready to submit . For eight years now , by coaxing and bullying the frivolous North , he had contrived to keep the reins in his own hands ; and having so long tasted the sweets of power , he was resolved in future to have none but milksops for his ministers . In face of these personal considerations the welfare of the nation was of little account to him . ' He flew into a rage . No power in heaven or earth , he said , should ever make him stoop to treat with " Lord Chatham and his crew ; " he refused to be " shackled by those desperate men " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . " Rather than yield to the wishes of his 1 " This episode appears to me the most criminal in the whole reign of George III. , and in my own judgment it is as criminal as people at this solemn crisis , he would submit to lose his crown . Better thus , he added , than to wear it in bondage and disgrace . In spite of the royal wrath , however , the popular demand for a change of government was too strong to be resisted . But for Lord Chatham 's sudden death , a few weeks later , he would doubtless have been called upon to fill the position which North was so anxious to relinquish . The king would have had to swallow his resentment , as he was afterwards obliged to do in 1782 . Had Chatham now become prime minister , it was his design to follow up the repeal of all obnoxious legislation concerning America by withdrawing every British soldier from our soil , and attacking France with might and main , as in the Seven Years ' War , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ferdinand of Brunswick was again to lead the armies of Great Britain . In America such a policy could hardly have failed to strengthen not only the loyalists and waverers , but also the patriots of conciliatory mould , such as Dickinson and Robert Morris . Nor was the moment an inopportune one . Many Americans , who were earnest in withstanding the legislative encroachments of Parliament , had formerly been alienated from the popular cause by what they deemed the needlessly radical step of the Declaration of Independence . Many others were now alienated by the French alliance . In New England , the chief stronghold of the revolutionary party , many people were disgusted at an alliance with the Catholic and despotic power which in ( lays gone by had so often let loose the Indian hell-hounds upon their frontier . The treaty with France was indeed a marriage of convenience rather than of affection . The American leaders , even while arranging any of those acts which led Charles I. to the scaffold . " ( Lecky , History of England in the Eighteenth Century , vol. iv @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of feeling that might ensue in the country at large ; and their dread was the legitimate hope of Chatham . To return to the state of things which had existed previous to 1765 would no doubt be impossible . Independence of some sort must be conceded , and in this Lord Rockingham and the Duke of Richmond were unquestionably right . But Chatham was in no wise foolish in hoping that some sort of federal bond might be established which should maintain Americans and British in perpetual alliance , and , while granting full legislative autonomy to the colonies singly or combined , should prevent the people of either country from ever forgetting that the Americans were English . There was at least a chance that this noble policy might succeed , and until the trial should have been made he would not willingly consent to a step that seemed certain to wreck the empire his genius had won for England . But death now stepped in to simplify the situation in the old ruthless way . The Duke of Richmond , anxious to bring matters to an issue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move that the royal fleets and armies should be instantly withdrawn from America , and peace be made on whatever terms Congress might see fit to accept . Such at least was the practical purport of the motion . For such an unconditional surrender Chatham was not yet ready , and on the appointed day he got up from his sickbed and came into the House of Lords to argue against the motion . Wrapped in flannel bandages and leaning upon crutches , his dark eyes in their brilliancy enhancing the pallor of his careworn face , as he entered the House , supported on the one side by his son-in-law , Lord Mahon , and on the other by that younger son who was so soon to add fresh glory to the name of William Pitt , the peers all started to their feet , and remained standing until he had taken his place . In broken sentences , with strange flashes of the eloquence which had once held captive ear and heart , he protested against the hasty adoption of a measure which simply prostrated the dignity of England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Duke of Richmond 's answer , reverently and delicately worded , urged that while the magic of Chatham 's name could work anything short of miracles , yet only a miracle could now relieve them from the dire necessity of abandoning America . Time earl rose to reply , but his overwrought frame gave way , and lie sank in a swoon upon the floor . All business was at once adjourned . The peers , with eager sympathy , came crowding up to offer assistance , and the unconscious statesman was carried in the arms of his friends to a house near by , whence in a few days lie was removed to his home at Hayes . There , after lingering between life and death for several weeks , on the 11th of May , and in the seventieth year of his age , Lord Chatham breathed his last . The man thus struck down , like a soldier at his post , was one whom Americans no less than Englishmen have delighted to honor . The personal fascination which he exerted in his lifetime is something we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern history expands till it covers the globe , we find ourselves better able than his contemporaries to comprehend the part which lie played at one of the most critical moments of the career of mankind . For simple magnitude , the preponderance of the English race in the world has come now to l ) e the most striking fact in human history ; and when we consider all that is implied in this growing preponderance of an industrial civilization over other civilizations of relatively archiaic and militant type , we find reason to believe that among historic events it is the most teeming with mighty consequences to be witnessed by a distant future . With no other historic personage // are the beginnings of this supremacy of the English race so closely associated as with the elder William Pitt . It was he who planned the victories which gave England the dominion of the sea , and which , rescuing India from the anarchy of centuries , prepared it to become the seat of a new civilization , at once the apt pupil and the suggestive teacher of modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French from America , cleared the way for the peaceful overflow of our industrial civilization through the valley of the Mississippi ; saving us from the political dangers which chronic warfare might otherwise have entailed , and insuring us the ultimate control of the fairest part of this continent . To his valiant and skillful lieutenants by sea and land , to such great men as Hawke , and Clive , and Wolfe , belongs the credit of executing the details ; it was the genius of Pitt that conceived and superintended the prodigious scheme as a connected whole . Alone among the iFYnglishmen of his time , Pitt looked with prophetic gaze into the mysterious future of colonial hi*tory , and saw the meaning of the creation of a new and greater Europe in the outlying regions of the earth ; and through his triumphs it was decided that this new and greater Europe should become for the most part a new and greater England , - a world of self-government , and of freedom of thought and speech . While his political vision thus embraced the uttermost parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped to bring about resuits the importance of which we are now beginning to appreciate . From the wreck of all Germany in that horrible war of religion which filled one third of the seventeenth century , a new Protestant power had slowly cmerged and grown apace , till in Pitt 's time - for various reasons , dynastic , personal , and political - it had drawn down upon itself the vengeance of all the reactionary countries of Europe . Had the coalition succeeded , the only consideraole Protestant power on the continent would have been destroyed , and the anarchy which had followed the Thirty Years ' War would have been renewed . The stupid George II. , who could see in Prussia nothing but a rival of Hanover , was already preparing to join the alliance against Frederick , when Pitt overruled him , and threw the weight of England into the other side of the scale . The same act which thus averted the destruction of Prussia secured to England a most efficient ally in her struggle with France . Of this wise policy we now see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the strongest power on the continent of Europe , which is daily establishing fresh bonds of sympathy with the people of the United States , and whose political interests are daily growing more and more visibly identical with those of Great Britain . As in days to come the solidarity of the Teutonic race in its three great nationalities - America , England , and Germany - becomes more and more clearly manifest , the more will the student of history be impressed with the wonderful fact that the founding of modern Germany , the maritime supremacy of England , and the winning of the Mississippi Valley for English-speaking America were but the different phases of one historic event , coherent parts of the one vast conception which marks its author as the grandest of modern statesmen . As the lapse of time carries us far enough from the eighteenth century to study it in its true proportions , the figure of Chatham in the annals of the Teutonic race will appear no less great and commanding than the figure of Charlemagne a thousand years before . But Chatham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our revolutionary struggle , not only as standing in the forefront of that vast future in which we hope to play so important a part , but also as the first Brit // ish statesman whose political thinking was of a truly American type . Pitt was above all things the man of the people , and it has been well said that his title of the " Great Commoner " marks in itself a political revolution . When the king and the Old Whig lords sought to withstand him in the cabinet ; , he could say with truth , " It is the people who have sent me here . " He was first to discover the fact that the development of trade and manufactures , due chiefly to the colonial expansion of England , had brought into existence an important class of society , for which neither the Tory nor the Old Whig schemes of government had made provision . He was the first to see the absurdity of such towns as Leeds and Manchester going without representation , and he began in 1745 the agitation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the celebrated case of Wilkes , while openly expressing his detestation of the man , he successfully defended the rights of constituencies against the tyranny of the House of Commons . Against the fierce opposition of Lord Mansfield , he maintained inviolate the liberty of every Englishman to publish his opinions . He overthrew the abuse of arbitrary imprisonment by general warrants . He ended the chronic troubles of Scotland by taking the Highlander into his confidence and raising regiments from them for the regular army . In this intense devotion to liberty and to the rights of man , Pitt was actuated as much by his earnest , sympathetic nature as by the clearness and breadth of his intelligence . In his austere purity of character , as in his intensity of conviction , he was an enigma to the skeptical and frivolous age in which he lived . Cromwell or Milton would have understood him much better than did Horace Walpole , to whom his haughty mien and soaring language seemed like theatrical affectation . But this grandiose bearing was nothing but the natural expression of that elevation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fired by the glow of passion beneath , made his eloquence the most impressive that has ever been heard in England . He was haughty and soaring in outward demeanor only as his mind habitually dwelt with strong emotion upon great thoughts and noble deeds . He was the incarnation of all that is lofty and aspiring in human nature , and his sublime figure , raised above the grave in the . northern transept of Westminster Abbey , with its eager outstretched arm , still seems to be urging on his countrymen in the path of duty and of glory . By the death of Chatham the obstacles which had beset the king were suddenly removed . On the morning after the pathetic scene in the House of Lords , he wrote with ill-concealed glee to North . " May not the political exit of Lord Chatham incline you to continue at the head of my affairs ? " North was very unwilling to remain , but it was difficult to find any one who could form a government in his place . Among the New Whigs , now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but lie was a man who , in spite of great talents , never succeeded in winning the confidence either of the politicians or of the people . He was a warm friend to the American cause , but no one supposed him equal to the difficult task which Chatham would have undertaken , of pacifying the American people . The Old Whigs , under Lord Rockingham , had committed themselves to the full independence of the United States , and for this the people of England were not yet prepared . Under the circumstances , there seemed to be nothing for Lord North to do but remain in office . The king was delighted , and his party appeared to have gained strength from the indignation aroused by the alliance of the Americans with France . It was strengthened still more by the positive refusal of Congress to treat with the commissioners sent over by Lord // North . The commissioners arrived in America in June , and remained until October , without effecting anything . Congress refused to entertain any propositions whatever from Great Britain until the independence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lord North 's conciliatory bills were published by order of Congress , and scattered broadcast over the country . They were everywhere greeted with derision ; at one town in Rhode Island they were publicly burned under a gallows which had been erected for the occasion . After fruitlessly trying all the devices of flattery and intrigue , the commissioners lost their temper ; and just before sailing for England they issued a farewell manifesto , in which they threatened the American people with exemplary punishment for their contumacy . The conduct of the war , they said , was now to be changed ; these obstinate rebels were to be made to suffer the extremes of distress , and no mercy was to be shown them . Congress instantly published this extraordinary document , and it was received with somewhat more derision than the conciliatory bills had been . Under the circumstances of that day , the threat could have but one meaning . It meant arson along the coasts at the hands of the British fleet , and murder on the frontiers at the hands of Jndian auxiliaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and one of them veheinently declared that if all hell could be let loose against these rebels , he should approve of the measure . " The proclaniation , " said he , " certainly does mean a war of desolation : it can mean nothing else . " Lord Rockingham denounced the policy of the manifesto , and few were found in Parliament willing to support it openly . This barbarous policy , however , was neither more nor less than that which Lord George Germaine had deliberately made lip his mind to pursue for the remainder of the war . Giving up the prob lem of conquering the Americans by systematic warfare , he thought it worth while to do as much damage and inflict as much suffering as possible , in the hope that by and by the spirit of the people might be broken and their patience worn out . No policy could be more repugnant to the amiable soul of Lord North , but his false position obliged him passively to sanction much that he did not like . Besides this plan for tiring out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expedition against Virginia and the Carolinas , in order to detach these States from the rest of the confederacy . Should it be found necessary , after all , to acknowledge the independence of the United States , it seemed worth while at least to cut down their territory as much as possible , and save to the British Crown these rich countries of rice , and indigo , and tobacco . Such was the plan now proposed by Germaine and adopted by the ministry of which he was a member . The scheme for tiring out the Americans could not seem altogether hopeless . Though froni a military point of view the honors of the war thus far remained with them , yet the losses and suffering had been very great . The disturbance of trade was felt even more severely in America than in England , and it was further exacerbated by the evils of a depreciated currency . The country had entered into the war heavily handicapped by the voluntary stoppage of importation which had prevailed for several years . The war had cut off New England from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the coasting trade had been nearly annihilated by British cruisers . The problem of managing the expenses of a great war was something quite new to the Americans , and the consequent waste and extravagance were complicated and enhanced by the curse of paper money . Congress , as a mere advisory body , could only recommend to the // various States the measures of taxation which were deemed necessary for the support of the army . It had no authority to raise taxes in any State , nor had it any power to constrain the government of a State to raise taxes . The States were accordingly all delinquent , and there was no resource left for Congress but to issue its promissory notes . Coimgress already owed more than forty million dollars , and during the first half of the year 1778 the issues of paper money amounted to twenty-three millions . The depreciation had already become alarming , and the most zealous law-making was of course powerless to 5t01 ) it . Until toward the close of the Revolutionary War , indeed , the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Declaration of Independence a committee had been appointed by Congress to prepare articles of confederation , to be submitted to the States for their approval . These articles were ready by the summer of 1778 , but it was not until the spring of 1781 that all the States had signed them . While the thirteen distinct sovereignties in the United States were visible in clear outline , the central government was something very shadowy and ill-defined . Under these circumstances , the military efficiency of the people was reduced to a minimum . Time country never put forth more than a small fraction of its available strength . Everything suffered from the want of organization . In spite of the pop .. ular ardor , which never seems to have been deficient when opportunities came for testing it , there was almost as much difficulty in keeping up the numbers of the army by enlistment as in providing equipment , sustenance , and pay for the soldiers when once enlisted . The army of 80,000 men , which Congress had devised in the preceding year , had never existed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed , been barren of results , but it had fallen far short of the end proposed . During the campaigns of 1777 the ariiiy of Washington had never exceeded 11,000 men ; while of the 20,000 or more who witnessed the surrender of Burgoyne , at least half were local militia , assembled merely to meet the exigencies of time moment . The whole country , indeed , cherished such a horror of armies that it was unjust even to the necessary instrument by which its independence was to be won ; and it synipathized with Congress in the niggardly policy which , by discouraging pensions , endangered the future of brave and skillful officers who were devoting the best years of their lives to the public service . Washington 's earnest efforts to secure for retired officers time promise of half pay for life succeeded only in obtainiiig it for the term of seven years . The excessive dread of a standing army made it difficult to procure long enlistments , and the frequent changes in the militia , besides being ruinous to discipline , entailed a sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much to the burdens of the people . Besides these evils , for which no one in particular was to blame , since they resulted so directly from the general state of the country , the army suffered under other drawbacks , which were immediately traceable to the incapacity of Congress . Just as afterwards , in the War of Secession , the soldiers had often to pay the penalty for the sins of the politicians . A single specimen of the ill-timed meddling of Congress may serve as an example . At one of the most critical moments of the year 1777 , Congress made a complete change in the commissariat , which had hitherto been efficiently managed by a single officer , Colonel Joseph Trumbull . Two commissary - generals were now appointed , one of whom was to superintend the purchase and the other the issue of supplies ; and the subordinate officers of the department were to be accountable , not // to their superiors , but directly to Congress . This was done in spite of the earnest opposition of Washington , and the immediate result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been retained as commissary-general for purchases , being unable to do his work properly without controlling his subordinate officers , soon resigned his place . The department was filled up with men selected without reference to fitness , and straightway fell into hopeless confusion , whereby the movements of the armies were grievously crippled for the rest of the season . On the 22d of December Washington was actually prevented from executing a most promising movement against General Howe , because two brigades had become mutinous for want of food . For three days they had gone without bread , and for two days without meat . The quartermaster 's department was in no better condition . The dreadful sufferings of Washington 's army at Valley Forge have called forth the pity and the admiration of historians ; but the point of the story is lost unless we realize that this misery resulted from gross mismanagement rather than from the poverty of the country . As the poor soldiers marched on the 17th of December to their winter quarters , their route could be traced on the snow by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same moment , says Gordon , " hogsheads of shoes , stockings , and clothing were lying at different places on the roads and in the woods , perishing for want of teams , or of money to pay the teamsters . " On the 23d Washington informed Congress that he had in camp 2898 men " unfit for duty , because they are barefoot and otherwise naked . " For want of blankets many were fain " to sit up all night by fires , instead of taking conifortable rest in a natural and common way . " Cold and hunger daily added many to the sicklist ; and in the crowded hospitals , which were for the most part mere log-huts or frail wigwams woven of twisted boughs , men sometimes died for want of straw to put between themimselves and the frozen ground on which they lay . In the deficiency of oxen and draft - horses , gallant men volunteered to serve as beasts of burden , and , yoking themselves to wagons , dragged into camp such meagre supplies as they could obtain for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there were times when , in case of an attack by the enemy , scarcely two thousand men could have been got under arms . When one thinks of these terrible consequences wrought by a negligent quartermaster and a deranged commissariat , one is strongly reminded of the remark once made by the eccentric Charles Lee , when with caustic alliteration he described Congress as " a stable of stupid cattle that stumbled at every step . " The mischief did not end , however , with the demoralization of the departments which were charged with supplying the army . In the appointment and promotion of general officers , Congress often acted upon principles which , if consistently carried out , would have deservedly ruined the efficiency of any army that ever existed . For absurdly irrelevant political reasons , brave and well-tried officers were passed by , and juniors , comparatively little known , were promoted over their heads . TIme case of Benedict Arnold was the most conspicuous and flagrant example of this . After his good name had been destroyed by his treason , it became customary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment as one more proof of his innate wickedness . But Arnold was not the only officer who was sensitive about his rank . In June , 1777 , it was rumored about Washington 's camp that a Frenchman named Ducoudray was about to be appointed to the chief command of the artillery , with the rank of major - general . Congress was continually beset with applications from va // grant foreign officers in quest of adventure ; and such appointments as this were sometimes made , no doubt , in that provincial spirit which it has taken Americans so long to outgrow , and which sees all things European in rosecolor . As soon as the report concerning Ducoudray reached the camp , Generals Greene , Sullivan , and Knox each wrote a letter to Congress , proffering their resignations in case the report were true ; and the three letters were dated on the same day . Congress was very angry at this , and the three generals were abused without stint . The affair , however , was more serious than Congress had supposed , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language of John Adams with reference to matters of this sort was more pungent than wise , and it gave clear expression to the principles upon which Congress too often acted . This " delicate point of honor " he stigmatized as *one of the most putrid corruptions of absolute monarchy . " He would be glad to see Congress elect all the general officers annually ; and if some great men should be obliged to go home in consequence of this , lie did not believe the country would be ruined ! The jealousy with which the several States insisted upon " a share of the general officers " in proportion to their respective quotas of troops , he characterized as a just and sound policy . It was upon this princihile , he confessed , that many promotions had been made ; and if the generals were so unreasonable as not to like it , they must " abide the consequences of their discontent . " Such expressions of feeling , in which John Adams found many sympathizers , bear curious testimony to the intense distrust with which our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendencies supposed to be inberent in a military organization . This policy , which seemed so " sound " to John Adams , was simply an attempt to apply to the regimen of the army a set of principles fit only for the organization of political assemblies ; and if it had been consistently adopted , it is probable that Lord George Germaine 's scheme of tiring the Americans out would have succeeded beyond his most sanguine expectations . But the most dangerous ground upon which Congress ventured during the whole course of the war was connected with the dark intrigues of those officers who wished to have Washington removed from the chief command that Gates might be put in his place . We have seen how successful Gates had been in supplantimig Scbuyler on the eve of victory . Without having been under fire or directing any important operation , Gates had carried off the laurels of the Northerii campaign . From many persons , no doubt , he got credit even for what had happened before he joined the army , on the 19th of August . His appointment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stark or the discomfiture of St. Leger ; and it was easy for people to put dates together uncritically , and say that before the 2d of August Burgoyne had continued to advance into the country , and nothing could check him until after Gates had been appointed to command . The very air rang with the praises of Gates , and his weak head was not unnaturally turned with so much applause . In his dispatches announcing the surrender of Burgoyne , lie not only forgot to mention the names of Arnold and Morgan , who had won for lAin the decisive victory , but he even seemed to forget that lie was serving under a commander-inchief , for he sent his dispatches directly to Congress , leaving Washington to learn of the event through hearsay . rrhirtee , * days after the surrender , Washington wrote to Gates , congratulating him upon his success . " At the same time , " said the letter , " I can not but regret that a matter of such magnitude , and so interesting to our general operations , // should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ channels of letters not bearing that authenticity which the iml ) ortance of it required , and which it would have received by a line over your signature stating the simple fact . " But , worse than this , Gates kept his victorious army idle at Saratoga after the whole line of the Hudson was cleared of the enemy , and would not send reinforcements to Washington . Congress so far upheld him in this as to order that Washington should not detach more than 2500 men from the Northern army without consulting Gates and Governor Clinton . It was only with difficulty that Washington , by sending Colonel Hamilton with a special message , succeeded in getting back Morgan with his riflemen . When reinforcements finally did arrive , it was too late . Had they come more promptly , Howe would probably have been unable to take the forts on the Delaware , without control of which he could not have stayed in Philadelphia . But the blame for the loss of the forts was by many people thrown upon Washington , whose recent defeats at Brandywine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North . The moment seemed propitious for Gates to try his peculiar strategy once more , and displace Washington as he had already displaced Schuyler . Assistants were not wanting for this dirty work . Among the foreigii adventurers then with the army was one Thomas Conway , an Irishman , who had been for a long time in the French service , and , coming over to America , had taken part in the Pennsylvania campaign . Washington had opposed Conway 's claim for undue promotion , and the latter at once threw himself with such energy into the faction then forming against the commanderrn-chief that it soon came to be known as the " Conway Cabal . " The other principal members of the cabal were Thomas Muffin , the quartermaster - general , and James Lovell , a delegate from Massachusetts , who had been Schuyler 's bitterest enemy in Congress . it was at one time reported that Samuel Adams was in sympathy with the cabal , and the charge has been repeated by many historians , but it seems to have originated in a malicious story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hancock . At the beginning of the war , Hancock , whose overweening vanity often marred his usefulness , had hoped to be made commander-in-chief , and he never f orgave Samuel Adams for preferring Washington for that position . In the autumn of 1777 , Hancock resigned his position as president of Congress , and was succeeded by Henry Laurens , of South Carolina . On the day when Hancock took leave of Congress , a motion was made to present him with the thanks of that body in acknowledgment of his admirable discharge of his duty ; but the New England delegates , who had not been altogether satisfied with him , defeated the motion on general grounds , and established the principle that it was injudicious to pass such complimentary votes in the case of any president . This action threw Hancock into a rage , which was chiefly directed against Samuel Adams as the most prominent member of the delegation ; and after his return to Boston it soon became evident that he had resolved to break with his old friend and patron . Artful stories , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to persons who were in close relation with Hancock . After the fall of the cabal , no more deadly stab could be dealt to the reputation of any man than to insinuate that he had given it aid or sympathy ; and there is good ground for believing that such reports concerning Adams were industriously circulated by unscrupulous partisans of the angry Hancock . The story was revived at a later date by the friends of Hamilton , on the occasion of the schism between Hamilton and John Adams , but // it has not been well sustained . The most plausible falsehoods , however , are those which are based upon misconstrued facts ; and it is certain that Samuel Adams had not only favored the appointment of Gates in the North , but he had sometimes spoken with impatience of the so-called Fabian policy of Washington . In this he was like many other ardent patriots whose military knowledge was far from commensurate with their zeal . His cousin , John Adams , was even more outspoken . He declared himself " sick of Fabian systems . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a short and violent war ; " and he complained of the reverent affection which the people felt for Washington as an " idolatry " dangerous to American liberty . It was by working upon such impatient moods as these , in which high-minded men like the Adamses sometimes indulged , that the unscrupulous cabal hoped to attain its ends . The first-fruits of the cabal in Congress were seen in the reorganization of the Board of War in November , 1777 . Muffin was chosen a member of the board , and Gates was made its president , with permission to serve in the field should occasion require it . Gates was thus , in a certain sense , placed over Washington 's head ; and soon afterward Conway was made inspector-general of the army , with the rank of major-general . In view of Washington 's wellknown opinions , the appointments of Muffin and Conway might be regarded as an open declaration of hostility on the part of Congress . Some weeks before , in regard to the rumors that Conway was to be promoted , Washington had written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any further service , if such insuperable difficulties are thrown in my way . " Such language might easily be understood as a conditional threat of resignation , and Conway 's appointment was probably urged by the conspirators with the express intention of forcing Washington to resign . Should this affront prove ineffectual , they hoped , by dint of anonymous letters and foul innuendoes , to make the conimander 's place too hot for him . It was asserted that Washington 's army had all through the year outnumbered Howe 's more than three to one . The distress of the soldiers was laid at his door ; the sole result , if not the sole object , of his many marches , according to James Lovell , was to wear out their shoes and stockings . An anonymous letter to Patrick Henry , then governor of Virginia , dated from York , where Congress was sitting , observed : " We have wisdom , virtue , and strength enough to save us , if they could be called into action . The Northern army has shown us what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . The spirit of the Southern army is no way inferior to the spirit of the Northern . A Gates , a Lee , or a Conway would in a few weeks render them an irresistible body of men . Some of the contents of this letter ought to be made public , in order to awaken , enlighten , and alarm our country . " Henry sent this letter to Washington , who instantly recognized the well-known handwriting of Dr. Benjamin Rush . Another anonymous letter , sent to President Laurens , was still more emphatic : " It is a very great reproach to America to say there is only one general in it . The great success to the northward was owing to a change of commanders ; and the Southern army would have been alike successful if a similar change had taken place . The people of America have been guilty of idolatry by making a man their God , and the God of heaven and earth will convince them by woful experience that he is only a man ; for no good can be expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from camp . " This mischievous letter was addressed to Congress , but , instead of laying it before that body , the high-minded Laurens sent // it directly to Washington . But the commander - in - chief was forewarned , and neither treacherous missives like these , nor the direct affronts of Congress , were allowed to disturb his equanimity . Just before leaving Saratoga Gates received from Conway a letter containing an allusion to Washington so terse and pointed as to be easily remeinbered and quoted , and Gates showed this letter to his young confidant and aid-de-camp , Wilkinson . A few days afterward , when Wilkinson had reached York with the dispatches relating to Burgoyne 's surrender , lie fell in with a member of Lord Stirling 's staff , and under the genial stimulus of Monongahela whiskey repeated the malicious sentence . Thus it came to Stirling 's ears , and he straightway communicated it to Washington by letter , saying that lie should always deem it his duty to expose such wicked duplicity . Thus armed , Washmngton simply sent to Conway the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I received last night contained the following paragraph : In a letter from General Conway to General Gates , he says , Heaven has determined to save your country , or a weak General and bad counsellors would have ruined it . ' I am , sir , your humble servant , George Washington . " Conway knew not what sort of answer to make to this startling note . When Muffin heard of it , he wrote at once to Gates , telling him that an extract from one of Conway 's letters had fallen into Washington 's hands , and advising him to take better care of his papers in future . All the plotters were seriously alarmed ; for their scheme was one which would not bear the light for a moment , and Washington 's curt letter left them quite in the dark as to the extent of his knowledge . " There is scarcely a man living , " protested Gates , " who takes greater care of his papers than I do . I never fail to lock them up , and keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : there must be no delay in ascertaining how much Washington kiiew amid where lie got his knowledge . After four anxions days it occurred to Gates that it must have been Washington 's aid-decamp , Hamilton , who had stealthily gained access to his papers during his short visit to the Northern camp . Filled with this idea , Gates chuckled as he thought he saw a way of diverting attention from the subject matter of the letters to the mode in which Washington had got possession of their contents . He sat down and wrote to the commander-in-chief , saying he had learned that some of Conway 's confidential letters to himself had come into his excellency 's hands : such letters must have been copied by stealth , and he hoped his excellency would assist him in unearthing the wretch who prowled about and did such wicked things , for obviously it was unsafe to have such creatures in the camp ; they might disclose precious secrets to the enemy . And so important did the matter seem that he sent a duplicate of the present letter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopted for detecting the culprit without a moment 's delay . The purpose of this elaborate artifice was to create in Congress , which as yet knew nothing of the matter , an impression unfavorable to Washington , by making it appear that he encouraged his aidsde-camp in prying into the portfolios of other generals . For , thought Gates , it is as clear as day that Hamilton was the man ; nobody else could have done it . But Gates 's silly glee was short-lived . Washington discerned at a glance the treacherous purpose of the letter , and foiled it by the simple expedient of telling the plain truth . " Your letter , " he replied , " came to my hand a few days ago , and , to my great surprise , informed me that a copy of it had been sent to Congress , for what reason I find myself unable to account ; but as some end was doubtless intended to be answered by it , // I am laid under the disagreeable necessity of returning my answer through the same channel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfavorable suspicion of my having practiced some indirect means to come at the contents of the confidential letters between you and General Conway . " After this ominous prelude , Washington went on to relate how Wilkinson had babbled over his cups , and a certain sentence from one of Conway 's letters had thereupon been transmitted to him by Lord Stirling . He had communicated this discovery to Conway , to let that officer know that his intriguing disposition was observed and watched . He had mentioned it to no one else but Lafayette , for he thought it indiscreet to let scandals arise in the army , and thereby " afford a gleam of hope to the enemy . " He had not known that Conway was in correspondence with Gates , and had even supposed that Wilkinson 's information was given with Gates 's sanction , and with friendly interest to forearm him against a secret enemy . " But in this , " he disdainfully adds , " as in other matters of late , I have found myself mistaken . " So the schemer had overreached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pried , but it was Gates 's own aid who had blabbed . Bu.t for Gates 's cowardly letter Washington would not even have suspected him ; and , to crown all , he had only himself to thank for rashly blazoning before Congress a matter so little to his credit , and which Washington , in his generous discretion , would forever have kept secret . Amid this discomfiture , however , a single ray of hope could be discerned . It appeared that Washington had known nothing beyond the one sentence which had come to him as quoted in conversation by Wilkinson . A downright falsehood might now clear up the whole affair , and make Wilkinson the scapegoat for all the others . Gates accordingly wrote again to Washington , denying his intimacy with Conway , declaring that lie had never received but a single letter from him , and solemnly protesting that this letter contained no such paragraph as that of which Washington had been informed . The information received through Wilkinson he denounced as a villainous slander . But these lies were too transparent to deceive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implicitly admitted the existence of several letters between himself and Conway , and his manifest perturbation of spirit had shown that these letters contained remarks that he would not for the world have had Washington see . A cold and contemptuous reply from Washington made all this clear , and put Gates in a very uncomfortable position , from which there was no retreat . When the matter came to the ears of Wilkinson , who had just been appointed secretary of the Board of War , and was on his way to Congress , his youthful blood boiled at once . He wrote bombastic letters to everybody , and challenged Gates to deadly combat . A meeting was arranged for sunrise , behind the Episcopal church at York , with pistols . At the appointed hour , when all had arrived on the ground , the old general requested , through his second , an interview with his young antagonist , walked up a back street with him , burst into tears , called him his dear boy , and denied that he had ever made any injurious remarks about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , only to blaze forth presently with fresh violence , when he made inquiries of Washington , and was allowed to read the very letter in which his general had slandered him . He instantly wrote a letter to Congress , accusing Gates of treachery and falsehood , and resigned his position on the Board of War . These successive revelations strengthened Washington in proportion as they // showed the malice and duplicity of his enemies . About this time a pamphlet was published in London , and republished in New York , containing letters which purported to have been written by Washington to members of his family , and to have been found in the possession of a mulatto servant taken prisoner at Fort Lee . The letters , if genuine , would have proved their author to be a traitor to the American cause ; but they were so bunglingly concocted that every one knew them to be a forgery , and their only effect was to strengthen Washington still more , while throwing further discredit upon the cabal , with which many persons were inclined to connect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incensed at the plotters , and the press began to ridicule them , while the reputation of Gates suffered greatly in Congress as the indications of his real character were brought to light . All that was needed to complete the discomfiture of the cabal was a military fiasco , and this was soon forthcoming . In order to detach Lafayette from Washington a winter expedition against Canada was devised by the Board of War . Lafayette , a mere boy , scarcely twenty years old , was invited to take the command , with Conway for his chief lieutenant . It was said that the French population of Canada would be sure to welcome the high - born Frenchman as their deliverer from the British yoke ; and it was further thought that the veteran Irish schemer might persuade his young commander to join the cabal , and bring to it such support as might be gained from the French alliance , then about to be completed . Congress was persuaded to authorize the expedition , and Washington was not consulted in the matter . But Lafayette knew his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the command until he had obtained Washington 's consent , and then he made it an indispensable condition that Baron de Kalb , who outranked Conway , should accompany the expedition . These preliminaries having been arranged , the young general went to York for his instructions . There he found Gates , surrounded by schemers and sycophants , seated at a very different kind of dinner from that to which Lafayette had lately been used at Valley Forge . Hilarious with wine , the company welcomed the new guest with acclamations . He was duly flattered and toasted , and a glorious campaign was predicted . Gates assured him that on reaching Albany he would find 3000 regulars ready to march , while powerful assistance was to be expected from the valiant Stark with his redoubtable Green Mountain Boys . The marquis listened with placid composure till his papers were brought him , and he felt it to be time to go . Then rising as if for a speech , while all eyes were turned upon him and breathless silence filled the room , he reminded the company that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the occasion , they had forgotten to drink , and he begged leave to propose the health of the commander - in - chief of the armies of the United States . The deep silence became still deeper . None dared refuse the toast , " but some merely raised their glasses to their lips , $vhile others cautiously put them down untasted . " With the politest of bows and a scarcely perceptible shrug of the shoulders , the new commander of the Northern army left the room , and mounted his horse to start for his headquarters at Albany . When he got there , he found neither troops , supplies , nor equipments in readiness . Of the army to which Burgoyne had surrendered , the militia had long since gone home , while most of the regulars had been withdrawn to Valley Forge or the highlands of the Hudson . Instead of the 3000 regulars which Gates had promised , barely 1200 could // be found , and these were in no wise clothed or equipped for a winter march through the wilderness . Between carousing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time left to attend to its duties . Not an inch of the country but was known to Schuyler , Lincoln , and Arnold , and they assured Lafayette that an invasion of Canada , under the circumstances , would be worthy of Dqn Quixote . In view of the French alliance , moreover , the conquest of Canada had even ceased to seem desirable to the Americans ; for when peace should be concluded the French might insist upon retaining it , in compensation for their services . The men of New England greatly preferred Great Britain to France as a neighbor , and accordingly Stark , with his formidable Green Mountain Boys , felt no interest whatever in the enterprise , and not a dozen volunteers could be got together for love or money . The fiasco was so complete , and the scheme itself so emphatically condemned by public opinion , that Congress awoke from its infatuation . Lafayette and Kalb were glad to return to Valley Forge . Conway , who stayed behind , became indignant with Congress over some fancied slight , and sent a conditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was accepted unconditionally . In vain he urged that he had not meant exactly what he said , having lost the nice use of English during his long stay in France . His entreaties and objurgations fell upon deaf ears . In Congress the day of the cabal was over . Muffin and Gates were removed from the Board of War . The latter was sent to take charge of the forts on the Hudson , and cautioned against forgetting that he was to report to the commander - in - chief . The cabal and its deeds having become the subject of common gossip , such friends as it had mustered now began stoutly to deny their connection with it . Conway himself was dangerously wounded a few months afterward in a duel with General Cadwallader , and , believing himself to be on his deathbed , he wrote a very humble letter to Washington , expressing his sincere grief for having ever done or said anything with intent to injure so great and good a man . His wound proved not to be mortal , but on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned to France , and American history knew him no more . Had Lord George Germaine been privy to the secrets of the Conway Cabal , his hope of wearing out the American cause would have been sensibly strengthened . There was really more danger in such intrigues than in an exhausted treasury , a half-starved army , and defeat on the field . The people felt it to be so , and the events of the winter left a stain upon the reputation of the Continental Congress from which it never fully recovered . Congress had already lost the high personal consideration to which it was entitled at the outset . Such men as Franklin , Washington , Jefferson , Henry , Jay , and Rutledge were now serving in other capacities . The legislatures of the several States afforded a more promising career for able men than the Continental Congress , which had neither courts nor magistrates , nor any recognized position of sovereignty . The meetings of Congress were often attended by no more than ten or twelve members . Curious symptoms were visible which seemed to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than it had been two years before . Instead of the phrase " people of the United States , " one begins , in 1778 , to hear of " inhabitants of these Confederated States . " In the absence of any central sovereignty which could serve as the symbol of union , it began to be feared that the new nation might after all be conquered through its lack of political cohesion . Such fears came to cloud the rejoicings over the victory of Saratoga , as , at the end of // 1777 , the Continental Congress began visibly to lose its place in public esteem , and sink , step by step , into the utter degradation and impotence which was to overwhoJm it before another ten years should have expired . As the defeat of the Conway Cabal marked the beginning of the decline of Congress , it marked at the same time the rise of Washington to a higher place in the hearts of the people than he had ever held before . As the silly intrigues against him recoiled upon their authors , men began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sagacity and unselfish p*iotism than upon anything that Congress could db that the country rested its hopes of success in the great enterprise which it had undertaken . As the nullity of Congress made it ever more apparent that the country as a whole was without a government , Washington stood forth more and more conspicuously as the living symbol of the union of the States . In him and his work were centred the common hopes and the common interests of all the American people . There was no need of clothing him with extraordinary powers . During the last years of the war he came , through sheer weight of personal character , to wield an influence like that which Perikles had wielded over the Athenians . He was all-powerful because he was " first in the hearts of his countrymen . " Few men , since history began , had ever occupied so lofty a position ; none ever made a more disinterested use of power . His arduous labors taught him to appreciate , better than any one else , the weakness entailed upon the country by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war was over , and the political problem came into the foreground , instead of using this knowledge to make himself personally indispensable to the country , he bent all the weight of his character and experience toward securing the adoption of such a federal constitution as should make anything like a dictatorship forever unnecessary and impossible .
