txt Every fire in a theatre points a moral that ought to be practically applied in every city . The anxiety to save money on the part of the owners of theatres remains a much more powerful motive than the anxiety to save . life on the part of the authorities , even where a special department exists for the official inspection of buildings . It does seem hard that an owner should lie required to put up a fireproof theatre , or even to provide ample fireproof staircases when these appliances cost so much money and when the chance that they will over be called into use seems so remote . Nevertheless , it is only by insistOg upon these safeguards that theatres can be made safe places of resort . It was for a long time the fashion to say , when a destructive fire broke out in au English or an American theatre . that tblese things were much better managed on the Continent of Europe . That is true . The standard of construction for theatres is much higher , and it is much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the London press on the burning of the Exeter theatre , that there is now no law at all governing the construction of places of amusement in Great Britain , outside of London , and that each builder is left to take such precautions as ho deems necessary . Naturally he deems necessary only those that can be provided with a minimum of trouble and expense . If any one conversant with the subject were asked to name the two cities of which the building laws were strictest , most highly specialized with reference to different classes of structures , and most thoroughly enforced , he would without doubt name Paris and Vienna . Yet the burning of the Ring Theatre in the latter city , and the more recent burning of the Opera Comique in the former are among the most memorable of theatre fired . The fact that such disasters could occur in the cities in which the precautions taken against them were greater than in any other cities has had a bad effect upon theatre building everywhere . The projector of a new theatre , who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argues that such precautions are of no avail . The view of theatrical managers and of owners of theatres is that playgoers are killed , not by fire , but by " panic . " Nearly ' every fire in a theatre seems to confirm this view . Certainly , it is confirmed by the disaster at Exeter . From the meagre account of it transmitted by the cable , it seems at least possible that the staircase upon which most of the victims were  --  ost would have passed them all in safety if they had descended it as carefully and deliberately as when leaving the place in the ordinary way after the performance , instead of coining down in a frightened and maddened crowd , knocking down those in front of them'and trampling on their bodies until the bodies formed a barricade . In fact , the staircase does not seem to have been consumed at all . It is evidently impracticable to build a stairway from the uppermost gallery of a theatre to the ground in one straight and easy flight . Even if it were practicable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down it from trampling each other to death . This actually occurred in the accident on the Brooklyn Bridge soon after it was opened , though there was no fire to excuse the panic into which the Crowd fell . Nevertheless , it will not do at all to assume that precautions are useless because a panic-stricken crowd does not make use of them . One use of these precautions is to prevent panic , and if they are taken , this will be the result . There is one theatre in New-York which is known to every visitor to be fireproof , and that is the Metropolitan Opera House . Even if the stage were piled with combustibles on fire , the audience would be aware that the building was incombustible , and would make their way out of it quietly and safely . Some of our theatres are no safer than the burned building at Exeter . A number of signs indicating exits are of little use in qaieting people who suddenly become aware that they are caught in a burning trap . What will quiet them and enable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knowledge that nothing very serious can happen to them if they stay where they are . If every theatre in New-York were fireproof the danger from panics Would be reduced in the same proportion as the actual danger from fire . There is no reason why anything less than the maximum of precaution should be exacted from owners of theatres . The difference in rental on account of the additional cost of making ' a theatre safe would not discourage the lessees of theatres , seeing that it would scarcely count against their winnings if they made a hit , and would not plunge them sensibly deeper into the abyss of insolvency if they achieved a failure . ' The playgoer is entitled to demand that for the enormous price he pays for seats he shall receive some guarantee that his life is not in imminent danger . A complete guarantee he has iii one Now-York theatre only , a partial ' guarantee in a few others , while to sit out a play in most of our theatres ' is simply being packed into a tinder box peculiarly exposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is an absolutely fireproof theatre , and there is no excuse for the erection in Now-York hereafter of a theatre that does not fulfill this condition .
