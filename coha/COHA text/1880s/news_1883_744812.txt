txt The news that the two latest colonies of Jews established in Palestine are at the point of starvation will probably have no effect upon the enthusiasts who think that all Jews should be sent to Palestine . Repeated efforts have been made to colonize that country with Jews , but the uniform failure of these has taught their projectors nothing . They are apparently as impervious to facts as are the managers of the colonization society which annually exports negroes from the United States for consumption by the African coast fever , and they will doubtless remain impervious to the end of time . The scheme of colonizing Liberia was undertaken partly on the avowed ground that colored people were a curse to this country , and not on the pretext that there was any scarcity of negroes in Africa . The Jewish colonization schemes are , on the other hand , undertaken in the interest of the Jews . There is , of course , a desire on the part of the colonizing enthusiasts to hasten the fulfillment of the prophecy that the Jews shall once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffer the pangs of exile and long to return to Palestine . To satisfy this longing , to assist deserving Hebrew prophets , and to benefit the Jews financially are praiseworthy acts , and the colonizing schemers who hope to accomplish all this by the simple process of exporting Jews to Palestine ore undoubtedly well-meaning and kind-hearted men . As a matter of fact , the average Jew has not the slightest desire to go to Palestine . There is no opening in ' that benighted land for business men . There are , of course , in every country Jews , as there are Christians , Who are suffering from extreme poverty and who are willing to go anywhere at the expense of philanthropists , but such Jews make very poor colonists . The Jew never voluntarily becomes a farmer , and farming is the only possible occupation of the Jewish colonist . It is not strange that the colonies of Jews sent to Palestine find farming distasteful and unprofitable and presently begin to starve . The strange part of the matter is that even when ten successive colonies have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the eleventh colony . There is no class of people which needs assistance in emigrating less than the Jews need it . The Jew who wants to emigrate will find the , means , provided he is of the stuff of which successful emigrants are made . , There is no class of population which a civilized nation can afford to lose less than it can afford to lose its Jews , for whatever the Jew-baiters of Germany may say , the Jews are universally industrious , persevering , and clever , and to endeavor to get them out of the country , either by force , after the Spanish pattern , or by hiring them to go to Palestine , is a grave mistake . Palestine does not want the Jews ; the Jews do not want Palestine ; and the nation to whose wealth and vigor Jews contribute does want them . The colonization of Palestine by hired Jews is the wildest and most defenseless scheme that foolish enthusiasm ever devised . It is even more preposterous than the colonization of Liberia by American negroes  --  and further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
