THE first thing to be said about the observance of the Sabbath is that , among Christians , there is no Sabbath to be observed . When people talk about the Sabbath , they are , for the time being , Jews . Only in England and America , among the descendants of the Puritans , and only in religious phraseology , is Sunday called the Sabbath . Somehow , in this country , it is supposed to be a little more religious to say " the Sabbath " when Sunday is meant . A man , in speaking to his neighbor in the street , says , " Sunday , " but in speaking to his minister he says , " the Sabbath . " I should like to send these Sabbatarians to Italy , where the name of Saturday is " Ii Sabbato " and that of Sunday " Ii Domenico . " If , in that country , they advertised their meetings for " the Sabbath , " as they do here , they would find that every one who came would come on Saturday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When a certain portion of the Christian Church constructed the theory that the fourth commandment was of perpetual obligation , only that the observance of the Sabbath had been transferred from the seventh to the first day of the week , their object was to give a sacred obligation to the performance of certain ceremonial duties , and to make of Sunday-worship a kind of sacrament . This has been taught and accepted among the descendants of the Puritans down to the present time . Men have abstained from their common labors , and have attended public worship , because they regarded this as a religious duty , done not for their own benefit but in obedience to a divine command . And no doubt this theory of Sunday observance was well adapted to cause a universal and strict obedience to what God was believed to command or to forbid on this day . When we speak of God 's day , God 's house , and God 's Word , we give an authority to Sabbath-keeping , Church-going , and Bible-reading , which // they would not otherwise possess . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we go to church for our own sake and not to please the Almighty , and that we have a right to do anything on Sunday which rests and refreshes body and soul , and no doubt there will be a great falling away from what is called " the religious observance of the Sabbath . " This may be a bad thing , or it may not ; but , whether the results of telling the truth seem to be good or bad , the truth ought to be told . Yet , when the Lord 's day is placed on its true foundation , it will probably be better kept than it is now . The people of New England have been trained up in the belief that Sunday was the Sabbath , and that God has commanded it to be kept holy for ever . At first , and for a long time , the result of this teaching was , that every one abstained from work and amusement , and every one who was able went to church or meeting . But this is not the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church-going show that only a small part of the community , at least in large towns , attend public worship , and that to many it is a day of idleness or of pure amusement . The old belief in the Sunday as the equivalent of the Sabbath is gone , and can not be restored . Would it not be better to put it on another and better foundation ; to elevate it from a Jewish to a Christian institution ; to show that it only becomes God 's day by being man 's day ? If this is true , it will be sure to be also useful ; for the truth is a tree which always brings forth good fruits . Scholars are now generally agreed that the Sabbath obligation was not transferred by Christ or his apostles to the first day ; that there is not in the Christian Scriptures a single command to keep the Sabbath in any form or on any day ; and that nearly all that is there said about the Sabbath is to deny its obligation . Jesus himself openly and repeatedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moses . When reproved for it , he did not defend himself on the ground that he was not breaking the Mosaic Sabbath , but rather because he had a right to work on thai day as the Son of man , the representative of humanity . He did not say , " The Son of God is Lord of the Sabbath , " but " The Son of man is master of the Sabbath , since it was made for the good of man . " It is also noticeable that he took away the very foundation of the Jewish Sabbath as a positive religious ordinance , by denying that God ever rests . " My Father works hitherto down to this time , always , and I work . " Jesus plainly taught that the mode of observing // even the Jewish Sabbath was to be determined by human uses ; that whatever was really good for man might be done on that day . It is not necessary to quote the passages in which Paul expressly denies the binding obligation of the Jewish Sabbath . The latest authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says that St. Paul 's words ( Coloss. ii , 16 , 17 ) are " a*bsolutely decisive , " as well as those addressed to the Galatians ( Gal . iv , 10 ) , that " the obligation to observe the Sabbath according to the Jewish law was never , in any sense , binding on Christians . " The writer of this article ( Rev. Alfred Barry , D. D. , Principal of King 's College , London , and Canon of Worcester ) also says : " The notion of a formal substitution , by apostolic authority , of the Lord 's day for the Jewish Sabbath , and the transference to it , perhaps in a spiritualized form , of the Sabbatical obligation established by the promulgation of the fourth commandment , has no basis whatever , either in Holy Scripture or in Christian antiquity . " He adds that " the idea afterward embodied in the title of the Christian Sabbath , ' and carried out in ordinances of Judaic rigor , was , so far as we can see , entirely unknown in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belief was constant that all that was divine in the law was fulfilled in the gospel . But no one supposed that the Sabbath of the law was fulfilled by another outward Sabbath of a seventh-day 's rest . The outward rest of the Jewish Sabbath was fulfilled in the gospel by an inward rest of the soul , resting from anxious effort in a confident faith . This is the only Christian Sabbath mentioned in the New Testament . The only place where Sabbath-keeping is spoken of except to be condemned , is in the Epistle to the Hebrews ( iv , 9 ) where it is said that " there remains a Sabbath-keeping to the people of God . " But the context shows that this Sabbath-keeping is the spiritual rest of the soul , which belongs not to one day but to all days . The idea of the Christian Sabbath is not the celebration of any particular day , but a rest from spiritual anxiety and struggle . This idea prevails in the writings of all the early Church fathers . Athanasius says , " We keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sabbaths in heaven . " Epiphanius says the Jews have their " little Sabbath , " but we our " great Sabbath , " which is " rest from our sins . " St. Jerome affirms that " all days are the same to a Christian . " St. Augustine plainly declares that there is no obligation on a Christian to keep any Sabbath . In Christianity , he says , " the observation of that kind of Sabbath which consists in the rest of a single day // is no longer a duty for the faithful . " In speaking of the commandments he says that , while all the rest are to be obeyed literally , the fourth is to be obeyed only as a figure . And though a tendency to Sabbatize soon began to come in , it was resisted by the most eminent teachers , and is said not to have been complete till the time of Charlemagne . It was not till the twelfth century that we find the phrase " Christian Sabbath " applied to the Lord 's day . Dr. Barry , concluding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the connection of its observance with the fourth commandment rests on no Scriptural and no high ecclesiastical authority . " The same result is reached by Dr. Hessey , in his Bampton Lectures before the University of Oxford , in 1860 . The reformers were nearly unanimous on this point . Dr. ilessey says that " Sabbatarianism of every phase was expressly repudiated by the chief reformers in almost every country ( even by Calvin , the friend of Knox , and by Knox himself , who is supposed , though incorrectly , to have introduced it into Scotland ) , and it does not appear in the fully authorized documents of the Church of England . " Luther 's well-known passage in the " Table-Talk " is very strong : " If anywhere the day is made holy for the mere day 's sake , if anywhere any one sets up its observance on a Jewish foundation , then I order you to work on it , to ride on it , to dance on it , to feast on it , to do anything that shall remove this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " prepared by Melanchthon for the whole Protestant communion , says , " Those who judge that in the place of the Sabbath the Lord 's day was instituted , as a day to be necessarily observed , are greatly mistaken . " But if the force of evidence thus compels us to renounce placing the observance of a day of rest on the ground of a positive divine command , by what principle can this observance be maintained ? There evidently remains , for the Protestant , nothing but the argument of its utility , or necessity for the good of man . If we can not any longer consider it as God 's day , we must defend and maintain it as man 's day . Is this foundation strong enough to support it ? Is the use of the first day as a time of rest , of worship , and moral recreation , likely to continue , the authority of a religious law being wholly taken away ? I believe that this basis will be sufficient , and that the Lord 's day will always continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mode of its observance . // There was no other ground for it at first . Sunday was observed in the beginning , as we have seen , with no reference to the Sabbath or the fourth commandment . It sprang up because it was needed , it spread because it was found useful and good . It was not protected by positive legal enactments till the time of Constantine . During the first three centuries of Christianity the habit of resting from usual labors and meeting for worship grew , until it became universal , not because of any divine command , not as an apostolic institution , but because it was in accord with Christianity and with human nature . Civilized man needs just such a period of relaxation and refreshment ; and , as long as he needs it , he will certainly continue to have it . And this need does not diminish , but increases , with the progress of civilization . The most advanced nations of the world need this rest the most , because they work the hardest . Competition becomes more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though , by means of machinery , more is produced , yet the wants of society increase yet more rapidly . What was once a luxury soon becomes a necessity . Living in the midst of this vital tension we are not aware of it , but it necessitates every year longer vacations , more numerous holidays , and it makes one day of rest in seven wholly indispensable . If it could ever have been abandoned , it certainly can not be relinquished now . With the increase of education , the Sunday rest becomes yet more necessary . When the mind has been once aroused to activity , it can not do without some food ; and so the Sunday becomes more and more a day for popular education . Those who go to church demand some mental excitement and instruction from the sermon and the other services . The opening of city libraries , art museums , public gardens , zotslogical gardens , and concerts , is furnishing constantly new sources of education , as well as refreshment , for the laboring classes . The hard-working man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , least of all , dispense with these opportunities . The rich man can have them every day , the poor man only on the day of rest . Such recreations as these are themselves an education . What a refreshment to worn-out bodies and minds are the great parks in and near our cities , where hundreds of thousands of people enjoy , on summer Sunday afternoons and evenings , the sight of grass , flowers , statues , sky , and sea ! More of this is wanted , and not less . Who can see the immense throngs of people at Manhattan // Beach , Coney Island , of a hot Sunday-sitting , walking , bathing , listening to music , and dining at tables set on piazzas in the open air-without rejoicing at their having such an opportunity ? The writer last summer walked all one Sunday among these crowds , without seeing a drunken man or hearing a violent word . Scenes of drunkenness , debanchery , and riot occur , not usually in the open air and in the midst of multitudes , but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But we do not want a Continental Sunday , " it is said . I remember that many years ago I passed a Sunday in Zurich , a Protestant city , and attended church early in the morning , in the cathedral of Zwingli , which was filled with a large congregation . In the afternoon I walked to the Uetliberg , and saw thousands of the people going and coming , along the many beautiful promenades which surround the city . Men , women , and children walked together , or sat at tables under the vines , drinking their beer or coffee . But all was peaceful , quiet enjoyment . And I thought , " If this is what is called a Continental Sunday , how much better it is than the gin-shops of London , or the Sunday riots and murders in New York ! " Dr. Guthrie , an eminent Scotch Presbyterian , * says : " We counted on one occasion , in Paris , thirty-three theatres and places of amusement open on the Sabbath-day . Coming home , in one hour we saw in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools , and piety , more drunkenness than we saw in five long months in guilty Paris . " I also quote from Mr. Garrett 's tract what an English writer , Rev. John Woolley , says of a Sunday in Munich : " The city of Munich is , as all the world knows and none better than its citizens , unrivaled in its beer . But on Sundays , though the beer-alleys are in the open air , the quiet , as compared with an English holiday , is most striking . The cause is easily given . During the day all the churches are crowded to suffocation ; in the evening , from about six to dark , two bands of music play in the pretty English Park , ' which is crowded by promenaders of every degree , from the royal family to the humblest handicraftsman . There are tables and booths around , where coffee and ices may be procured at a low price ; and many Munich families take , in this way , their evening meaL Nothing can exceed the picturesque beauty of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sadly contrasted the cheerful , contented faces around us with the haggard , care-worn look of the same classes of our countrymen-often wished that we , too , were taught to worship God with the natural homage of thankful enjoyment . . - . For the upper classes , we are sure that the selfdenial , if such it is , of spending some part of this holy day in friendly intercourse with their poorer neighbors will be amply repaid by its influence on themselves and those they seek to benefit . " Parks and public gardens , and watering-places like Coney Island , near New York , and Revere Beach , near Boston , are excellent for the people in the summer . But how shall they pass the winter days and evenings ? They can not be at church all day . Why should there not then be , connected with the churches , public halls , open to all who behave decently , where the working-people can go - men , and women , and children ? There might be music , pictures , reading-rooms with newspapers , coffee-rooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in each of our great cities should open such a building-both for Sunday and week-day evenings-would not their usefulness be immeasurably increased ? For the individual , who wishes a rule by which to guide his own action , this is sufficient ; whatever rests and refreshes us is right , what weakens and dissipates our powers is wrong . But it is not so easy to decide what should be the universal custom , and still less to say what ought to be allowed or prohibited by law . Many persons ask , and with apparent reason : " What right has the law to interfere at all ? There is no established religion in this country ; Church and state are here wholly separate . Why , then , should the state perpetuate the Jewish Sabbath , and forbid men from working , if they like , on Sunday ? Why undertake to decide what amusements may be allowed , and what not ? Why close theatres , for example ? Theatres are permitted on Sunday evening in those countries which have a state religion ; why forbid them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to do with religion ? " The answer to this is , that the state has a right to do , and ought to do , what is believed by the large majority to be for the best good of the community . Every one is taxed to support public schools , because the great majority think them necessary to maintain republican institutions . Yet many persons may find it hard to be taxed for the schools . They have no children ; or , they send them to private schools or to church schools-why should they have // to pay for the public schools too ? The answer is : In a republic where the majority rule , you must accept what they think necessary for the public good , unless where the Constitution protects you against any excessive exercise of such a power . The fact that Sunday laws are maintained in all the States of the Union shows that the great majority of the people believe that Sunday should be a day of rest . Without such laws it could not be so preserved . Great corporations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary to care either for the souls or bodies of their workmen . The laboring man needs the rest of Sunday more than any one else . Others can rest , if they please , on other days ; he can only have a holiday once a week , under the protection of law . Without such law , the greed of money-making would cover the whole year with unbroken , unremitted labor . The Sunday laws are much the same in all the States , and all forbid both labor and amusement on the Lord 's day . In Massachusetts the existing law ( last adopted in 1860 ) forbids opening shops or workshops , doing any work , except of necessity or mercy , being present at any public diversion , taking part in any sport or game , except a concert of sacred music , traveling , unless for necessity or mercy , serving civil process , disturbing public worship , shooting birds , or catching fish . These laws are continually and openly violated , are scarcely known to the people , and very much perplex the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus Chief-Justice Gray , of Massachusetts , in declaring what technical meaning must be put on the word " travel 's in the statute , gave as his opinion that " a person walking with a friend on Sunday evening less than half a mile , with no apparent purpose of going to or stopping at any place but his own home , much less of passing out of the city , and no object of business or pleasure except open air and gentle exercise , is not guilty of traveling or liable to punishment under this act . " It would seem that the law should be modified , when a wise and liberal judge is forced to construe it thus strictly . The great majority of the people of the United States also believe that the public worship of God , public reading of the Scriptures , public instruction in religion and morality , are important aids , at least , in maintaining the welfare of the community . If the churches were closed , the morality of the New Testament no longer taught every week from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were no more reminded of God , duty , and // immortality , a vast influence for virtuous conduct would be taken away . It is on this ground that the state has a right to make laws to protect and encourage the religious worship of all denominations and all religions . Any religion which continually reminds men that they have immortal souls , and that they are responsible to God for their conduct , is an advantage to the community . The sound of a church-bell , the music of an old psalm-tune , awaken associations and memories which make all men better . " As I was walking in my garden at Malmaison , " said the first Napoleon , " I heard the distant sound of the church-bell at Rucil , and I stopped , moved involuntarily by old associations . If I , a man like me , am so affected , how much force must such influences have on the mass of man-kind ! " If the Church , instead of following blindly its old forms on Sunday , shall consider seriously how to modify , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its Master , it will be once more " Lord of the Sabbath . " The day has now half escaped from its hands ; let it hasten to recover its hold . When the community finds that the churches are meaning to furnish the greatest possible amount of education , good influence , and innocent happiness on this day , they will gladly again accept its leadership . Instead of the religious influence of Sunday being diminished , it will be largely increased by such a change . If the Church takes charge of the whole daydevoting the morning to worship and religious teaching , the afternoon to works of charity and instructive lectures , and the evening to social meetings and innocent recreation-then the whole day will be sanctified and become altogether the Lord 's day . Every such attempt to provide innocent recreation for the community on Sunday will be opposed , and honestly opposed , on the ground that it will interfere with church-going . The reply is , first , that there are multitudes who have abandoned church-going-multitudes who never now put their foot into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church , shall not the Church come to them , offering them innocent recreation in the place of intemperance and its evil consequences ? Is it not better for them to read , talk , listen to music , or to a lecture in a pleasantly lighted hall , than drink themselves crazy in a bar-room ? The temptations of sin are at every corner-it is not necessary to buy or hire a seat in order to be welcomed into a lighted and cheerful saloon , where drink will seem to drive away care . But , secondly , we can not fail to see that the churches must // adopt new methods in order to fill the empty seats . The time has passed when every one went to church as a matter of duty , in obedience to a positive divine command . Henceforth they must go because they find themselves happier for going , because they enjoy their church opportunities . They can not any longer be driven to church by obedience to positive divine law ; they must be attracted by love for the Church itself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and new methods be found for interesting all classes in its public service . Already , people go to church where they think they get the most good : some , because they enjoy a popular preacher ; some , because they enjoy fine music , noble architecture , solemn ceremonies , and ritual ; some , because it is the only society they have , the only place where they have a part in any social life . The churches of the poor take the place to them of clubs , parties , receptions , and other social entertainments . Besides all this , there is a profound craving in man for worship , for a religious influence . This will never be outgrown . We may confidently rely upon it as sufficient to draw people to church , provided the churches are hospitable , attractive , cheerful , social , and sincerely devout . Let us plant ourselves firmly and confidently on the principle that Sabbath , Lord 's day , church , and religion are made for manand all are to be so used , so changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The only rule for keeping Sunday is so to use it as to get the most good out of it . The one test , if we think only of ourselves , of the right and wrong use of the day is , Does it refresh us , soul and body , and leave us better fitted for all our duties ? Whatever does this , is right to be done on Sunday . Rest and refreshment are the two objects of the day . That amusement is right which rests and refreshes soul and body ; that amusement is wrong which unfits us for the work of the week . This is the difference between recreation and dissipation . One creates our powers anew , the other dissipates and wastes them . But , while we are seeking what is best for ourselves , we must always bear in mind what is good for others also . No man lives to himself , nor dies to himself . Pure individualism can not exist unless on Robinson Crusoe 's island . No man has a right to withdraw himself from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should give our influence to those Sunday laws , customs , and institutions which will be best for young and old , rich and poor , wise and ignorant . If we really believe // that happy , quiet , restful Sundays are needed by the people , then , whether we ourselves need them or not we should do what we can to secure them for others . If we believe that Sunday can be made of still greater use to the people than it is now by increasing its methods of furnishing innocent healthful recreation , and by opening the doors of churches , libraries , galleries of art , museums of natural history , reading-rooms , halls for familiar lectures on literary and scientific subjects , and for music , let us all help toward this end each in his own way-considering not only what is good for ourselves , but also what is good for others .
