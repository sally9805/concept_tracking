txt The question of regulating inter-State commerce by= national authority is likely to be urged upon the attention of Congress with new force during the present session . It was commended to that body for careful consideration by the President , and there are few subjects with which it has to deal so calculated to awaken interest among the people . Among the bills already introduced is one by Senator C171 , - LOY , of Illinois , which starts with the right idea . Serious mistakes are almost sure to be made if Congress begins with radical measures . of restriction . The problem is one of immense extent and great intricacy , and there are very few persons in Congress who have a thorough understanding of it . The understanding necessary to a prudent treatment of the subject can not be obtained through the kind of debate that is evoked upon measures prepared by single members or in committees , even after the most extended " hearings " that it is practicable to give . Neither would a special commission appointed to investigate and report conclusions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there would remain the need of a supervisory body to have charge of its execution . A commission to be of value must be a permanent one , with all necessary powers for inquiry and examination , and the measures'to be adopted should be the results of its observation and practical experience . There are certain principles which are sufficiently clear to start with . ' The work of State commissions needs to be supplemented by the national authority , which alone can extend supervision to the traffic that passes from one State to another . Some means of inquiry and publicity regarding this kind of traffic is needed in order that its management may be more fully understood and brought before the public . Unjust discriminations of every kind and degree should be subject to official exposure and remedy . A commission , therefore , such as Senator CULLOM proposes , : with power to collect information , hear complaints , and make reports and recommendations to the Government , affords the best means of beginning the work of regulation . Such a commission , if composed of competent men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulation as would be found to be adapted to the requirements of the case . No man or body of men can devise such a system without first having the opportunity to make a thorough study of the inter-State railroad problem in all its phases . No man or body of men is likely to make the necessary study unless put in a position where it will become a duty and a business to do so ; and where the advantage and support of official authority may be had . A carefully chosen commission , which should go to work in the right spirit , would first set itself to the task of gathering full information regarding the railroad system of the country and the methods under which , as a whole and in its parts , it is managed . Alleged abuses would be brought to its attention and duly examined , and the difficulties which stand in the way of their remedy would he fully studied . The publicity which would be given to the afy fairs of the railroads would of itself exercise a restraining influence of no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that thorough knowledge that is necessary as a guide to prudent action . The commission would ascertain , as can be ascertained in no other way , just what , the abuses . and defects of the system are , and how far ' and in what way they can be most effectually remedied . Such a body , when it had ' mastered its problem , would be apt to deal with it in a cautious . and prudent spirit , but the results would be all the more judicious and safe . First give us the commission , with general powers of inquiry and supervision , mating sure that its members are capable and upright men , who will be guided solely by an enlightened view of the interests of the whole people ; and then let them work out the problem and suggest the restrictive and regulative measures which they may find to be necessary to perfect their work . It may as well be suggested that men of the right stamp can not be secured by offering them as a consideration for their services a fraction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The salaries proposed in the Cullom bill are entirely inadequate .
