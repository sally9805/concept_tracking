txt The last act in the controversy over the ordination of William H. Noyes as missionary to Japan took place tonight , wnen the Berkeley-Street Congregational Church held a farewell reception to Mr. Noyes prior to his departure for Japan . The church sends him out as a missionary in spite of the refusal , thrice rendered . of the American Board to indorse this action . Naturally it was expected that the Foreign Missionary Committee of the church , in its letter of directions to Mr. Noyes , would take some notice of this controversy , and indirectly it did so . After the customary instructions relative to destination , finances , correspondence , and other details , the letter says : In judging of a proposed location you will regard chiefly the need and opportunity for work . co-operation . if practicable , with Congregational missionaries , and now for encouragement we would have you cultivate fraternal relations with all missionaries . We expect that you will seek counsel of the Congregational missionaries ; that If they oesire , and if you find it practicable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same freedom of thought and speech as your Congregational brethren in this country , but you will observe all that discretion which the common work of all mission . aries in a heathen country specially requires . You are entitled to your own ways of thinking and to any reasonable explanation or hope by which dark and distressing religious problems may be relieved . But you are not to obtrude or emphasize any special beliefs . You go to Japan to preach the Gospel as held in common by your Congregational brethren there and here . " The significance of these instructions can only be understood when it is reinembered that the Americun Board recommended that if the church should send Mr. Noyes out as a missionary it should be to a field not occupied by other Congregational missionaries .
