txt Mr. BLAINE evidently regards trusts as what a local Democratic leader was wont to describe as a " hypothecated case . " " If there be evils connected with these trusts , " he says , these evils can not be remedied by , Congress . Well , that depends entirely on the way in which Congress goes at the work . If it takes it up in the spirit of Mr. BLAINE himself , it can , of course , do nothing toward restraining or abolishing the trusts , or toward . remedying the gross evils to'which they have given rise , for the very good reason that the will would be wanting . But if there were a will there would be a way , and a very thorough and effective way , to put a strong check on the worst features of the trusts , namely , those that spring from the monopoly-giving provisions of the tariff . This is so plain , that even a confirmed protectionist and Republican partisan like Senator SHERMAN-a man . who has much more of the statesman in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and states it with the emphasis of , simplicity . He declares that some of the trusts " grow out a revenue . laws , as . Sugar Trust , which is one of the most dangerous and wrongful trusts ever organized in this country , " and " can certainly be reached by the operation of our revenue laws . " The same concession is practically made by the leading , or , at least , the most pretentious , protection organ in the country , the New-York Tribune , in its omission to publish a full report of Mr. BLAINE 'S speech . The interest in Mr. BLAINE 'S curious course as to trusts does not arise in the least from his statements , which are plainly opposed to facts , nor from his arguments , which do not agree with even his own statements , but from the anxiety as to his motives , which certainly are almost inscrutable . Mr. BLAINE has come back to " lead . " the Republican Party , and he is doing it . It was announced in advance that he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried ... out the programme . He is the most " in evidence " of all the men in his party , and in comparison with him Mr. HARRISON , the nominee of the Republican Convention , is an obscure and unimportant person , who plays a squeaky second fiddle to the clarion notes of the , real leader . The Republican Party in its national platform has denounced trusts in a not very sincere , but a very emphatic fashion , and the organs of the party have very generally joined in this denunciation . Why does Mr. BLAINE instantly and repeatedly assume the role of apologist for trusts ? Why does he first declare that they are private concerns , then that they are only the creatures of State and not of national action , and . then that " they have no place in a national campaign " Why does he finally throw doubt on the existence of " evils connected with these trusts " ? Surely he knows perfectly well the position of his party . He knows the nature , consequences , purpose , and influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mind . that they are bad for the public and bad . for any party to be responsible for . We say that he must know these things , for every sensible man with any knowledge and . experience in public affairs and . in business does know them and , if his personal interests do not conflict with such a course , will acknowledge them . What personaPintercets can Mr. BLAINE have to induce him to do.what he has done ? Are they pecuniary ? Has he the means of drawing profit from any of these trusts ? Or are they political ? Has he any purpose in. view that can be served by injuring the Chances of Mr. HARRISON 'S election , or by appearing to do so with - the chance of changing later , when he has gained what he is after ? We do not know . We do not pretend to know . But these are questions that are being asked by a good many of Mr. HARRISON 'S friends . They are natural , inevitable questions . In due time an answer will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. HARRISON or Mr. BLAINE remains to be seen . But " if " Mr. BLAINE , with his present relations to the Republican candidate , is seeking to force better terms , be is taking very radical measures , possibly measures that may defeat his own end .
