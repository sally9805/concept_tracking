txt There is an unusual degree of excitement in the Clarksville Grammar School . The base-ball season is at hand , anal the school " nine " is about to elect a new Captain . Hitherto the Clarksville " nine " has been very successful , and it is naturally anxious to maintain its reputation . Its old antagonist  --  the " Greystone nine " ? is full of confidence , ' and the Clarksville boys are fully alive to the necessity of electing the best possible Captain and of neglecting no means of strengthening their " nine . " Naturally , there are several boys who are candidates for the Captaincy , but as yet no one can be said to be sure of an election . Young Dodge , who is one of the most popular boys in school , is very anxious to secure the prize , and as he is what is called " a thoroughly good fellow , " he has a number of devoted adherents . It is urged by his opponents , however , that the Captain of a base-ball nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , during the last match in which he took part , got into a quarrel with the other side , and was in such a state of excitement that , if he had been given another inning at the bat , he would doubtless have thrown his bat at the pitcher and brought about a generalscrimmage , with the result of losing the game . It is justly urged that skill in base-ball , and not readiness to knock fellows over the head , is an important characteristic of a good player ; and this characteristic young Dodge is believed to lack . Moreover , his enemies intimate that he has not ' always played marbles , " on the square " an accusation which it is only fair to MY that he ener getically denies , in which denial he is supported by William , the professional kalsominer  --  a colored man of excellent character  --  who says that " Massa Jim never did nuffin ' wrong , and there 's others that ai n't no better . " The present Captain , young Arthur Allen , has his personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , well-behaved boy and a very fair player . Unfortunately for him , however , he is opposed by some on the ground that he was formerly much more fond of marbles than base-ball , while the inveterate marbleplayers denounce hi 'm , alleging that he now thinks himself too good to play marbles with them . It is conceded that he has made a fairly good Captain , and he naturally claims that if he Agave satisfaction he ought to be re-elected , and that it is rather hard that he should be abused both for having played marbles and for having ceased to play marbles . There are , however , a number of boys who say that they will not vote for him in any circumstances , and this fact renders his election extremely doubtful . Then there is. young Jack . He is not a good base-ball player , and he is at the foot of the grammar class , but he is the best fighter in school , and he claims that he should be elected Captain because , as he says , " everybody knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ licked the whole lot of the Davis Academy boys . " The Clarksville boys , however much they may admire Jack 's prowess , want a base-ball player , and not a rough-and-tumble fighter , and poor Jack has not the ghost of a chance of an election . The best base-ball player in school is unquestionably young Edmund George , but as he does not distribute pea-nuts among the boys and declines to electioneer for his own benefit , he has fewer supporters than the other leading candidates . When the election takes place it is thought that his eminent qualifications will lead . many of the supporters of the other candidates to vote for him , but he does not care a straw for an election and would not lift his finger to secure it . The Saturday afternoon when the boys meet to elect their base-ball Captain will furnish an exciting scene . Bets are freely laid on the various candidates by their respective friends , and they all pretend to feel the utmost confidence . What is very odd , however , is the fact that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other person , is known to have offered to bet the Rev. Mr. Smithers ; the Greek tutor , that he could write on the black-board the name of the next Captain of the " nine , " and when the money was put up he wrote , not the name of any one of the prominent candidates , but that of the youngest member of the nine , a quiet , studious , and wellbehaved boy , commonly known in the school as Little Bob .
