txt The beautiful climate of California does not exempt the journals of the State from the recurrence of the " silly season . " This year it has set in at San Francisco somewhat earlier than usual , and the effects it has already produced justify considerable uneasiness as to what may come about before its close . A pronounced symptom of the arrival of the season is an article in the San Francisco Evening Bulletin , a paper which , by general good sense and intellectual vigor , is usually protected from its debilitating influence . The article is entitled " A. Choice of Evils , " and its purport is that the reform of the civil service , while it will tend to abolish corruption of the voters by offices and the promise of offices , will compel candidates to resort to bribery . " There are reasons for thinking , " says the Bulletin , " that political corruption , instead of dying , will simply change its methods . " The only " reason " given for this opinion , and one which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where the service has been so reformed as to practically take the great body of the offices out of politics , " elections are marked by bribery and corruption to an extent unknown in the United States . Fortunes are spent in securing seats in Parliament . Political agents , amply supplied with funds , use every available art to influence voters . Liquor is free , and where that argument is not sufficient direct purchase for cash takes its place . Mobs are subsidized to terrorize voters . * * * Beyond a doubt the conditions above described would , to a considerable extent , follow the complete application of the civil service system in this country . This belief . is warranted by the similarity of human action under similar conditions . " The chief defect in this argument , stated with such solemn attention to logical form , is that it is based on a completely mistaken conception of the facts , and this in two important regards . In the first place corruption is not so prevalent in England as it was before the service was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with causing corruption , and in the second place there is not nearly as much corruption by bribery direct or indirect in England as there , is in the United States , putting aside entirely the bribery by office giving or the promise of office . So far from fortunes being spent in securing seats in Parliament , the amount of money that can be spent by any candidate is limited lay law , ( in a district having more than 2,000 voters it is limited to $3,560 , with an allowance of $300 for each additional 1,000 voters . ) Instead of " political agents amply supplied with funds , " the law allows only one chief agent , with a specified number of sub-agents , and the chief agent is required to account for every shilling he expends , and to give vouchers therefor , except for small items of personal expenditure , which are limited . Not only is " direct purchase Of votes for cash " prohibited , and its practice punished by unseating the candidate guilty of it , if he be elected , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liable to heavy fine . " Liquor is " not " free , " and every form of " treating , " which is elaborately defined , is punishable , and is made a ground for unseating a candidate . These prohibitions are carried to an extent which we can hardly understand in this country , and the punishment of them is not confined to loss of a seat in the House , on a contest to be decided by a majority in sympathy with the accused party . It depends on the result of a trial before the High Court of Justice or before two Judges acting as an election court , in proceedings in which the Crown Prosecutor takes part , and of which the costs may be assessed either on the persons found guilty or on the borough in which the corrupt practices are permitted . Those to whom the fear of substituting corruption by money for corruption by patronage or the promise of it has seemed a valid objection to the reform of the civil service  --  and there are really a certain number of shallow minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Reform of the civil service will not abolish all corruption , but it will do away with a particularly vicious and contemptible form of it , and it will leave citizens generally much freer to cope with other forms of it , because it will disband the corps of office-holding mercenaries who have heretofore so largely held control of the machinery of party action . Where the voters of a party can hope to share in its management without meeting at the outset a band of " workers , " paid out of the public Treasury to advance the interests of their employers , the chances of the nomination of decent candidates and the election of the better men among them will be very greatly increased , and the efficacy of bribery will be accordingly lessened . Without disrespect to our esteemed contemporary of the Pacific coast , we would suggest that the question it raises as to the consequences of a radical reform is strong evidence of the curious lack of any valid doubt whatever touching the great advantages of reform .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
