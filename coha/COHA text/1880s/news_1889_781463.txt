txt The commercial statistics of France for the last ten years afford material for an interesting study of the effect of protective tariffs on French trade and industry . It was in 1882 that the high tariff was est ablished , although many of the duties were lower at the beginning than they are at present . But while the foreign trade of France  --  the imports and exports taken together  --  was 8,424,000,000f. in 1881 , it had fallen in 1888 to 7,262,000,0001 . These are the figures for the " special trade , " inchiding only French goods exported and foreign goods imported for consumption in France . The statistics of " general trade " include also goods imported in transit to other countries and goods in bond . The decline , as shown under the head of " general trade , " has been from 10,720,000,000f. in 1881 to 9,180,000,0001. in 1887 . These are among the facts set forth by Mr. ROBERT DONALD in a paper on protection in France contributed to the Universal Review . Many of the heavy duties imposed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the demands of the agriculturists . They were designed to raise the price of cattle , sheep , meats , and . other articles of food produced in France , for the benefit of the producers and at the expense of consumers by raising the cost of imported products of the same kind or excluding them , There were also heavy duties on the raw materials of manufacturers . It was declared that the Nation 's imports must be decreased and its exports enlarged . But the official reports show that 1880 and 1881 ? the last two years under the old system  --  were the b est commercial years in the history of France . The combined exports and imports were larger in 1880 than they ever had . been before or . have been since . By the imposition of the high duties the cost of food and of raw material was raised . The price of such food as can not be produced in France iu sufficient quantity for the wants of the people was advanced , to the injury of consumers , and at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for French manufactures was restricted . The effect of this policy was shown in 1884 , for in that year the actdal foreign trade fell to 7,170,000 , - 000f , from 8,255,000,0001. in 1883 . The imports were less by nearly 720,000.0001. , but at the same time the exports , in spite of the artificial stimulus designed to increase home production , were less by 437 , - 000,000f . The high duties had not had the desired effect , and the protectionists , led by the agricultural party , demanded that they should be increased . Existing treaties of commerce relating to many of the duties stood in the way , except so far as live stock and grain were concerned . With respect to these the tariff wall was made higher . The new law became operative in March , 1885 . But the effect was not satisfactory . Mr. DONALD shows that the entire foreign trade under the " general " head . that had fallen from 10,44 ' 7.000.000f. in 1883 to 10,234,000,0001. in. 1884 continued to decline , falling to 9,885,000,000f. in 1885 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country was unable to pay for its increased imports of food . by exporting more manufactured goods , and was therefore increasing its exports of raw material . The exportation of refined sugar was stimulated by bounties , to the enrichment of a refiners ' ring and the impoverishment of the people , for the operation of the bounty law imposed a double tax on the French consumer , while it decreased the price of sugar to consumers in England . In 1887 the duty on wheat was raised again . In 1888 the " special trade " was 7,262.000,000f. , as against 7,271,000,000f. in the preceding year , and the exports of manufactured goods fell off . Says Mr. DONALD : " These figures speak for themselves . Every succeeding year demonstrates more.foreibly the suicidal policy which Prance is pursuing in commercial affairs . Last year tho amount of raw material imported was less than it had been in any year since the ascendency of Protection . The principal commodities which entered in decreased quantities were wool , cot-ton , coal , hides and skins , jute , silk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry which this involved was accentuated , as the production of indigenous material did not take its place , and as the export trade decreased by only five millions . In the import trade of articles for human consumption Protection again defeated the object of its partisans . The increase was precisely in those articles which the new duties were intended to exclude by fostering native production . " The imports of wheat rose 26 per cent. , those of barley 19 per cent. , and those of oats 77 per cent . Under the new duties the farmers ' complaints were louder than ever . The reports of British Consuls show that there is a demand in the agricultural districts for still higher duties because wheat is not grown at a profit and live stock is raised at a loss . One of these Consuls , who is an advocate of protection , declares that the people are.far worse off than when the " moderate protective duties " were put on , and in his report upon the trade of 1888 says that the farmers will not be satisfied unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live stock largely increased . And yet the average annual foreign trade of France under the " special " head . for the period of five years , 1878-82 , just before the duties were imposed , was 4,69S,000 , - 0001. of imports and 3,402,000,0001. of exports , while in the next five years the average fell to 4.294,000.0001. of imports and 3,252.000,000f. of exports . These figures , together with the condition of the very persons in France for the pecuniary benefit of whom the high taxes were imposed , ought to suggest to the thoughtful Frenchman that there is something wrong about this policy . Probably they do suggest this to the thoughtful and intelligent , but not to the comparatively unintelligent , who are a majority and who still believe that a man can lift himself over a fence by pulling on his boot straps .
