I*y Hugh McCulloch . April , 1833 , I left my New England home to make my start in life in the West . Fifty-four years are a long time to look forward to , but a short time to look back upon . Crowded as these years have been , in the United States , with events of surpassing interest and importance , they seem too wonderful to be real . What advances have they recorded in the extent of our cultivated lands , in manufactures , in mining , in facilities of social and commercial intercourse ! What changes have they witnessed in our domestic institutions , in the character and in the political and religious sentiment of the people ! A reference to events that have left a lasting impression upon my mind , and to a few of the persons whom I have known in the course of a long life , and to others whom I did not know personally but who were conspicuous in my early days , may be interesting , and perhaps of some value as the recollections of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our history . I started for the great and ( compared with what it is now ) unsettled West , by railroad from Boston to Providence , thence by steamboat to New York , where I remained a couple of days to see something of what was rapidly becoming the great commercial city of the Union . Here I renewed my acquaintance with William Emerson , brother of Ralph Waldo , who , some years before , had been my teacher in Kennebunk . With him I went to the Battery , then in its old-time beauty , in the neighborhood of which were the fine residences of the aristocracy of the city ; the City Hall , which still remains unchanged , and which in architectural design has not been surpassed by any public building in the country ; St. Paul 's , which had been built in the style of the Wren churches of England , and was regarded by many as not being inferior to the finest of them in symmetry and grace . The long row of dwelling-houses in what was then upper New York , Lafayette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show houses of the city ; I was taken to them that I might see what elegant , commodious , and expensive houses the New Yorkers were building . My visit to New York was very agreeable-made so chiefly by the kindness of Mr. Emerson , who , less distinguished than his brother Ralph Waldo , possessed many of his admirable qualities , with simple manners and ripe scholarship . From New York I went by steamboat to Amboy , by railroad to Bordentown , and from Bordentown to Philadelphia by steamboat . The only thing in this part of my journey that I especially recollect was the beauty of the Delaware . The journey from Philadelphia to Baltimore was made by railroad and steamboat . I spent but a single day in either city , but long enough to see the charming parks in the former , and the monuments-the finest I had ever seen-rn the latter . From Baltimore I went by rail to Frederick , in Maryland , and thence by stage-coach , two days and one night , over the Cumberland ( National ) road to Wheeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the journey down the river was charming . It then deserved the reputation it had , of being one of the most beautiful rivers in the world . There was nothing but a few straggling villages to mar its original beauty . The magnificent forest through which it flowed had been quite untouched by the great destroyer , the woodman 's axe . The banks of the river had not then been stripped of their beauty , as they have been since , by the destruction of the magnificent trees that covered them , and disfigured by the inroads which , in consequence thereof , the waters have made upon them . For miles upon // miles nothing could be seen but the sky and the river and the grand old forest through which it ran . Occasionally we overtook flatboats loaded with coal or lumber , or met a high-pressure sternwheel steamboat , making slow progress against the stream . There was little else than these and the puffing of our own steamer to break the pervading solitude . On my way down the river I read with great interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by Thomas F. Marshall in advocacy of the gradual abolition of slavery in Kentucky . The injurious effects of slavery upon the industrial condition of the State were illustrated by comparison of the rapid growth of Ohio on the one side of the river with the slow growth of Kentucky on the other , and its injustice to the slave , and its depressing influence upon enterprise were presented with great independence and force . I never saw Mr. Marshall but twice : once when he was in the meridian of his intellectual strength  --  the accomplished and magnetic orator ; and again when he had fallen from his high estate to be the slave of intemperance-an object of painful commiseration . A few days after the unsuccessful efforts made in the House in 1837 to pass a resolution of censure against John Quincy Adams for his temerity in presenting a petition from slaves , in which effort Mr. Marshall took a leading part , I happened to be seated with some Southern members of Congress at the dinner-table of one of the Washington hotels , when Mr. Marshall came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done something that day which had irritated these gentlemen ) and as Mr. Marshall was taking his seat at the table one of them exclaimed , " XVell , Marshall , the old devil has been at work again ; you must take him in hand . " " Not I , " replied Mr. Marshall , with a decisive shake of his head ; " I have been gored once by the damned old bull , and have had enough of him . If there is to be any more of this kind of work it must be undertaken by somebody else . The old devil , as you call him , is a match for a score of such fellows as you and I. ' , Many years after I saw Mr. Marshall in Washington he was pointed out to me in the Lake House , in Chicago , sitting upon a bench with the messenger boys , and talking to them incoherently  --  a mental and physical wreck . He had joined temperance societies , and made temperance speeches equal to the best of Gough 's , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His description of the terrible next morning following the night 's debauch was as truthful and touching as it was graphic . For months together he seemed to have conquered his enemy , a thirst for intoxicating drink , but its hold had become too strong to be overcome . He resolved , and re-resolved , and died the victim of alcohol . I have known many victims of intemperance , but none who have fallen from so distinguished a position , whose ruin was so lamentable and complete . Soon after I reached Indiana I heard a good deal about Thomas Corwin , then a prominent Whig member of Congress from Ohio . Of Mr. Corwin it is not too much to say that in wit , in humor , and general knowledge ; in a ready command of language ; in voice , in mobility and expressiveness of features ; in all the requisites for fascinating and effective stump oratory , he was without an equal . Men would travel twenty or thirty miles to listen to the matchless orator , and even his political opponents could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to call forth . His memory was not only a perfect storehouse of historical facts , but also of anecdotes and stories . It was worth a " Sabbath day 's journeys ' to hear " Tom " Corwin ( as he was familiarly called ) tell a story . No matter how frequently heard , it was always made fresh and racy by his variable and inimitable manner of telling it . While the attractiveness of his speeches was in no small degree attributable to his extraordinary control of the muscles of his face , which were always in accord with the sentiments he was expressing and the anecdotes he was relating , and to his charming voice , they were never lacking in eloquence or force . He had always something good to say , and he never failed to be instructive as well as fascinating . His power over popular and promiscuous assemblies was immense . // Plain farmers would not only travel long distances to hear him , but they would stand for hours under a burning sun , or in a pelting rain , seemingly oblivious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absorbed . Nor was his fame as an orator confined to Ohio . By his speeches in Congress he acquired a national reputation . Made upon subjects which have long ceased to be interesting , no one can read them now without feeling that they place him in the front rank of American orators . One of the earliest , and in many respects the pleasantest , of the acquaintances which I formed in Indiana was that of Henry Ward Beecher , who in 1839 , on the invitation of Samuel Merrill , president of the State Bank , and a few other prominent citizens of Indianapolis , left Lawrenceburgh , where he had been preaching for two or three years , to become the first pastor of a NewSchool Presbyterian church at the capital of the State . There were not more then a dozen members when he took charge of it , but it grew rapidly in membership until 1847 , when he accepted a call to Brooklyn . Mr. Beecher was not only the most popular but the most influential preacher that this country has produced . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  to lift orthodox theology out of the ruts in which it had been running from the days of the Puritans . His sermons were very rarely doctrinal . He was in no respect a theologian . He cared little for creeds . Belief with him was a matter of secondary importance ; conduct was everything . He had a decided taste for horticulture , and one of his most intimate acquaintances was a man ( Aldrich , I think his name was ) who had a fine nursery and garden near Indianapolis . " I like him , " said Mr. Beecher to me one day ; " I like him because he loves flowers as I do , and I have a great admiration of him because he is one of the honestest men I have ever met . I have made him a study . He is always what he appears to be , a perfectly upright man . Nothing would induce him to swerve from the truth , and yet he is an infidel , a disbeliever in the Bible and a future life . I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I was very intimate with Mr. Beecher as long as he lived in Indianapolis . He was frequently at my house . I once travelled with him on horseback from Fort Wayne to Indianapolis , when it took full three days to make the trip ; stopped with him at the same taverns , and slept in the same rooms with him . To me he was an open book . If there had been anything wrong about him I should have discovered it . He was incapable of disguise , and I never heard a sentiment from him that the strictest moralist could object to . His vitality was immense ; his jollity at times irrepressible . He was physically very strong . His health was perfect , his buoyancy of spirits unflagging . I recollect how he sang and shouted as we rode through the woods together-how admirably he mimicked preachers who seemed to think that sanctimoniorm countenances and whining tones were the indications of zealous faith . To Mr. Beecher religion was joyousness-Christianity the agency by which men were to be made not only better but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " think that I am not solemn enough in the pulpit , nor staid or reverent enough out of it . I wonder what they would think if I should act just as I feel ! " Mr. Beecher gave proof of his pluck in his encounters with secessionists and sympathizers of the South in Liverpool and London . It was sometimes tested in a different way . The people of Indiana before the war , if not pro-slavery in sentiment , were , with few exceptions , opposed to all anti-slavery movements , and the negroes who came to the State were frequently the subjects of barbarous treatment . One day there was what was called a negro riot in Indianapolis , in which some inoffensive colored people were driven from their homes and treated with savage inhumanity . A leader of the rioters , whose behavior toward these people was especially infamous , was a constable . Mr. Beecher , upon being informed of his conduct , denounced it in his usual emphatic manner . This came to the ears of the constable , who expressed his determination to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back what he has said about me , or I 'll lick him within an inch of his life . " The next day as Mr. Beecher was walking leisurely by the constable 's office , the constable opened the door and asked Mr. Beecher to step in . The office was near the principal hotel of the city , and some young men who had heard of the constable 's threats , and happened to be standing on the sidewalk , gathered around the door to see , as they said , the fun . The constable was a big , brawny fellow , and as Mr. Beecher entered , he advanced to meet him , and said in a rough voice : " I understand , Mr. Beecher , that you said so and so about me , " repeating the offensive language . " Did you say that , sir ? " " I do n't think I said exactly that , but it was about what I meant to say , " replied Mr. Beecher as he looked the constable steadily in the face . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were n't a preacher I 'd lick you like a dog , " said the constThle . " Do n't mind that ; I ask no favor on that score , " responded Mr. Beecher . The constable looked at the stoutly built , sturdy man that stood before him without flinching , and concluded that it was safer to threaten than to strike . Mr. Beecher listened for a moment to the constable 's oaths , then left the office , saying , as he went out , " Good-bye , Mr. Constable ; you will feel better when you cool off . " The bystanders clapped their hands as Mr. Beecher stepped upon the sidewalk , and it was a long time before the constable heard the last of his interview with Mr. Beecher . " What would you have done , " I asked Mr. Beecher , " if the constable had attempted to make good his threats ? " " I shoiil*1 have warded off his blows and laid him upon his back in no time . I knew if I was not stronger that I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was sure that he could not have stood before me for an instant . I should have been sorry to have had a contest with such a fellow , but I could not stand and be whipped , " was Mr. Beecher 's reply . Mr. Beecher wrote a great deal , and usually with great ability ; but it is upon his talents and accomplishments as a preacher that his fame will most securely rest . Few of his sermons were what might be called finished productions , but they abounded in eloquent passages and striking illustrations and original ideas . They were instructive as well as captivating . No man has ever been heard by so many people ; no man of the present century has expressed so many loving thoughts , or touched so many hearts , or influenced so many lives , or done so much to soften theological austerities and liberalize religious sentiment as Henry Ward Beecher . Although I had gone West with the full intention of practising law , and , indeed , met with gratifying success in my early efforts , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was appointed cashier and manager of the Fort Wayne Branch of the State Bank of Indiana . I liked the business of banking so much that I had no disposition to resume the practice of law , and so it happened that when the new Bank of the State of Indiana was organized , in 1857 , I was elected its president . In 1862 I went to Washington to oppose the passage of the bill to establish a National Banking System , which , if it passed , might be greatly prejudicial to the State Banksthe one of which I was president being among the largest of them . In March , 1863 , I was again in Washington . I had left home with my wife , to be absent for a couple of weeks on a pleasure trip* I had been a hard worker without intermission for nearly a quarter of a century , and so we decided that we would make a flying visit to the Eastern cities , letting no one at home know where letters would reach us , in order that we might enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day before we left Washington we went through the Treasury Department . As I had no business to transact , and was not acquainted with Secretary Chase , I did not feel at liberty to call upon him , but as we passed by the door of his room I handed my card to his messenger . The next morning we were on our way to Baltimore , where we spent a day very pleasantly . Thence we went to Philadelphia , New York , and Plattsburgh , where we were married twenty-five years before , and were at home again within the time fixed for our return . Here , to my sur // prise , I found a number of telegrams , some of which had followed me from place to place , requesting me to return to Washington , and a letter from Mr. Chase , offering to me the position of Controller of the Currency , and expressing an earnest wish that I should accept it . I had been forced to admit that there was a necessity for a National Banking System , and I felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I might be able to render in the tremendous struggle in which it was engaged . Being in a strait , I did what all men who have sensible wives ought to do when important questions are to be considered and acted uponI consulted my wife . The conclusion was that I should resign the presidency of the bank and go to Washington to organize the National Currency Bureau , with the understanding , however , that I should remain in Washington no longer than might be necessary to give the new banking system a successful start . As soon as this conclusion was reached , I informed Mr. Chase that I would accept the office which he had so kindly tendered to me . Mr. Chase was one of the most extraordinary men that our country has produced . In 1837 he was pointed out to me in the Cincinnati court-house as the rising young lawyer at the bar , which was even then distinguished by the high character of its lawyers . Had he continued in the practice he would have been the peer of Henry Stansberry in legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas Ewing , the ablest lawyer who has appeared west of the Alleghanies . His mind was clear and logical , comprehensive in its grasp , and certain in its conclusions . He was a fine scholar , a master of the English tongue . He spoke with ease and distinctness . He was not what might be called a fluent , nor , according to the American idea ( which is rapidly changing ) , an eloquent speaker ; but he had few ecprals in analyzing difficult questions and making abstruse subjects intelligible . Inclined to be dogmatic and overbearing , he was , nevertheless , genial in social intercourse , and at times fascinating . In manners he was courtly without assumption ; in opinion tenacious without intolerance . He was strong in his convictions and steadfast in his principles . Hostile to slavery , and a strict constructionist , he was willing to grant to the slave power just what was granted by the Constitution , not an iota more . The movements of the armies , the great battles that were fought with varying successes on both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest was felt in the measures that were adopted to provide the means to meet the enormous and daily increasing demands upon the treasury . It was the successful general who was the recipient of honors , not the man by whose agency the sinews of war ( money ) were supplied , and yet but for the successful administration of the Treasury Department during the war , the Union would have been riven asunder . If I were asked to designate the man whose services next to Mr. Lincoln 's were of the greatest value to the country from March , 1861 , to July , 1864 , I should unhesitatingly name Salmon P. Chase . When Mr. Chase was appointed Secretary , the public credit was lower than that of any other great nation . The Treasury was empty . The annual expenditures had for some years exceeded the revenues . To meet the deficiencies shifts were resorted to which , while they gave present relief to the Treasury , added to its embarrassment . It is not necessary for me to speak of the various loans that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the immense sums that were needed in the prosecution of the most expensive war that the world has ever known . It is enough for me merely to refer to the extraordinary fact that the people were patient under very burdensome taxestaxes to which they were entirely unaccustomed , taxes direct and indirect , taxes upon almost everything that they consumed , taxes which before the war it would have been considered impossible to collect ; and to the still more extraordinary fact that the public credit steadily improved , notwithstanding the rapid increase of the public debt , and was higher when it reached the enormous sum of $2,757,803,686 , as it did in August , 1865 , than it was when the Government did not owe a dollar . // Not alone to Mr. Chase is the honor due of the financial success of the Government in its desperate struggle for the maintenance of its integrity , but a very large share of it certainly belongs to him . It was by his advice that taxes were imposed and loans were authorized . It was by him that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accordance with his general financial policy that the department was administered after his resignation . He was the manager of the finances from March , 1861 , to July , 1864 , and by their successful management during that gloomy and momentous period he established a lasting claim upon the respect and gratitude of his countrymen . Nothing is so captivating and yet so dangerous to our public men as the whisperings of the " siren " exciting aspirations for the presidency , which are never realized and which never die . In a conversation which I had with Mr. Chase in 1863 , he remarked that there was only one olflce which he had heartily desired  --  the office of Chief Justice of the Supreme Court . I dined with him a couple of weeks after the coveted honor had been conferred upon him , and I was pained by discovering that he was far from being satisfied . As a Justice of the Supreme Court , he had no favors to grant , no patronage to wield . High as the position was , it was not the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed like retirement from public life . There was another thing that was undoubtedly weighing upon him , although he did not suggest it . He had not been in the active practice of the law for twenty years , nor had he been able during that period to devote any time to legal studies . As an active politician , the leader of the anti-slavery party in Ohio , as Governor , United States Senator , and Secretary of the Treasury , he had been otherwise fully employed ; so that when he went upon the bench he was unfamiliar with the work which he was called upon to perform . He perceive I therefore that , unless he shrank from a proper share of the duties of the Court ( and that he was not disposed to do ) , he would for a time labor under great disadvantages . He did have to work much harder in the investigation of legal questions and in the preparation of opinions than either of his associates . It was undoubtedly this hard work and the disappointment of his political ambition that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Chase 's ability and character was exhibited by his appointing him to be Chief Justice . He hesitated for some days , while the matter was under consideration , to send his name to the Senate , under the apprehension that he might be somewhat rigorous in his judgment of some of the executive acts , and especially those of the Secretary of War , if suit should be brought involving questions that could only be settled by the Supreme Court . Knowing that my relations with Mr. Chase were intimate , he sent for me one day , and after explaining the nature of his fears , asked me what I thought about them . " Why , Mr. President , " I replied , " you have no reason for fears on that score . Mr. Chase is in the same box with you and Mr. Stanton . He favored and advised , as he has himself informed me , the dispersion by force of the Maryland Legislature , and if anything more illegal than that has been done , I have not heard of it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a story , but he laughed heartily , and the interview was ended . It may be proper for me to remark here that the personal relations between Mr. Lincoln and Mr. Chase were never cordial . They were about as unlike in appearance , in education , in manners , in taste , and in temperament , as two eminent men could be . Mr. Chase had received a classical education , and until he entered the political field and became the leader of the anti-slavery party of Ohio , he had been a student of general literature ; in appearance he was impressive , in manners stately , in taste refined , in temperament cold . Although the larger part of his early life was passed in the West , he was not " westernized . " He cracked no jokes , and he had no aptitude for story telling . He did not and could not appreciate those qualities which brought Mr. Lincoln so close to the hearts of the people . Selfreliant , rapid in conclusions , and prompt // in action , he would not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have waited for South Carolina to strike the first blow : it was therefore fortunate that he was not in Mr. Lincoln 's place . Mr. Lincoln had no educational advantages in his early life . In appearance he was unprepossessing , in manners ungraceful , in taste unrefined , or at least peculiar , but he was warmhearted and geniaL In knowledge of men , in strong common sense , in sound judgment , in sagacity , Mr. Lincoln had no superior . He was unassuming , patient , hopeful , far-seeing . He was also one of the bravest of men . In saying this I do not refer to personal courage - in which he was by no means deficient , but to bravery of a higher and rarer kind , bravery which was steadfast under the criticism of his friends and the assaults of his enemies . His inaction for some weeks after his inauguration greatly disappointed many of his most devoted political adherents , who became fearful that it indicated indecision ; and the feeling became widespread that he lacked nerve-one of the most essential qualities in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is imminent and great interests are at stake . In these respects he was misjudged . He was anxious to prevent a decided rupture of the relations of the Government with the Southern States , and he was determined , if a rupture should occur , that the administration should not be responsible for it . It was his duty to enforce obedience to the Federal authority throughout the Union , but he hoped that this might be accomplished in the Southern States without a resort to arms . He knew how strong the opposition was in the West to what was called coercion , the coercion of sovereign States ; and he foresaw that if a conflict should occur , and the government should be regarded as the aggressor , it would fail to command hearty support in that section , and how important it therefore was , if war was to be the result of attempts to execute the law , that the first blow should not be struck by the Government . His wisdom was vindicated by the manner in which the report of the cannonade upon Fort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as I have remarked , like an electric shock to a seemingly inanimate body , which , however , was full of life . It vitalized the dormant patriotism of the people , it hushed party strife , it united Republicans and Democrats in a common cause  --  the defence of the Union . Thenceforward many who had been the opponents of coercion were its strongest advocates . Some of them attained high distinction in the field . Throughout his administration Mr. Lincoln was wiser than his assailants* wiser than his friends . Beside the attacks of his political enemies , to which he was indifferent , he was constantly charged by those who claimed to be friendly with hesitation , when hesitation was dangerous . They were , for instance , impatient at his tardiness in using his war power to free the slaves , and they censured him without stint . He was troubled by these censures , but his purposes were not shaken by them . Although one of the mildest of men , he was unyielding to efforts which were made to force him to acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untimely . His aim was to keep abreast with the public sentiment , with which no man was better acquainted , and not to go too fast to avoid the charge of going too slow . He issued his celebrated Emancipation Proclamation when he thought the people were prepared for it and when the military condition of the country seemed to justify it . It came at the right time ; it breathed the right spirit , and it was hailed with almost universal satisfaction in almost all the loyal States . I never think of the manner in which Mr. Lincoln fulfilled the most difficult and responsible duties which ever devolved upon mortal man , of the enormous labors which he performed , of his faith in the right , his constancy , his hopefulness , his sagacity , and his patience under unmerited and bitter criticism , without feelings of admiration akin to reverence . When Mr. Chase resigned ( as Secretary of the Treasury ) the eyes of the people turned to Mr. Fessenden as the right man to be his successor . Mr. // Fessenden 's acknowledged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had displayed as chairman of the Finance Committee of the Senate were a sufficient guaranty that under his direction the business of the Treasury Department would be honestly and wisely conducted . He accepted the office with extreme reluctance . His business had been to assist in making laws , not in executing them . He was distrustful of his executive ability . The duties which he was required to perform were distasteful to him from the start , and the longer he remained in office , the more distasteful they became to him . If Mr. Fessenden had been strong in health , if his duties had been congenial , and he had been content to remain at the head of the great department , he would have been equal to his duties , however difficult and onerous they might have been . But his health was not good , and his heart was not in executive but in legislative work . It was as a senator that he had achieved renown . It was in the Senate Chamber that he was at home . There , in extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and force in debate , he had no equal . Mr. Douglas was frequently compared with him , but he was more learned than Mr. Douglas , closer in reasoning , more easily followed , more accurate in statements , and altogether safer as a leader . Mr. Fessenden was one of the very few men of his day that merited the name of statesman . He must have been a hard student in early days ( he was not subsequently ) , or , great as was his aptitude for learning , he would not have possessed that wealth of knowledge which he frequently displayed in the Senate Chamber . He was not an orator , but a debater of the highest order-lucid , cogent , incisive . He did not regard the halls of Congress as fit places for oratorical display , for the delivery of orations , and he listened impatiently , when he listened at all , to Mr. Sumner 's , which had been prepared with care and committed to memory . He was disposed to underrate abilities which differed from his own , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he considered right , he was as inflexible as steeL This trait of character was exhibited in the impeachment trial of President Johnson . While this celebrated trial was going on , he received scores of letters threatening him with personal violence-some of them with death-if he voted for acquittal ; but they did not disturb him in the least . No one knew how he would vote-he did not know himself until the testimony and the arguments on both sides had been heard ; but it was well known that he had no sympathy with those who had determined how they would vote before the trial was commenced-who did not hesitate to pronounce the President guilty without waiting for the evidence . Therefore it was feared that his vote might not be unfavorable to the President , and hence the threats . Mr. Fessenden said to me as much , I am sure , as he said to anyone , which was simply this , that he would listen attentively to the testimony and to the arguments of counsel , and then , and not until then , make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty required of him . His vote and the votes of six others from the Republican side of the Senate , with the Democratic votes , saved the President from being adjudged a criminal , and the Republican party from disruption . For some years before his death ill health prevented Mr. Fessenden from participating in Washington festivities , and on this account he was regarded by many as being of an unsocial disposition . In this he was misjudged . Before his health became impaired , he was eminently social ; to those who were intimate with him he was always one of the most affable and agreeable of men . In appearance he was attractive ; his face was handsome and strikingly intellectual ; in deportment he was natural , in character upright , in all business transactions honorable . He was true to his principles and his friends , never unfaithful to the former or forgetful of the latter . As a resident of Washington during the war and reconstruction periods , and as the occupant of an important official position , I met not only the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of the most distinguished generals . At the Washington Scientific Club , of which I was a member , I became acquainted with General George H. Thomas . He was not a member , but he accepted invitations to its meetings , in which he seemed to be much interested . He frequently participated in the discussions , and always spoke with intelligence and to the point . I saw a good deal of him in the club and out of it , and the better I knew him the more highly I esteemed him . My acquaintance with him became close , and he spoke to me , I think , with as much freedom as he spoke to anyone , about his military services and the criticisms to which he was subjected just before the battle of Nashville . In the last conversation I ever had with him he referred to the annoying telegrams which he received from General Halleck at Washington and from General Grant at City Point . " I was on the ground , " he said , " and hard at work in getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under my command , after General Sherman had commenced his march to the sea , in order that I might strike an effective blow against the superior forces of General Hood . I knew , or thought I knew , when the blow should be struck ; and it was struck just as soon as it could be with reasonable prospects of success . Defeat at that time and at that place would have been a greater calamity than any which had befallen the Federal forces . It would have cleared the way for the triumphant march of Hood 's army through Kentucky , and a successful invasion of Thdiana and minois , in which there were no Federal troops . It was therefore of the last importance that the battle upon which so much depended should not be fought until I was ready for it . To one of General Grant 's despatches , urging me to fight , I was strongly tempted ( grossly improper as it would have been ) to ask why he was not fighting himself . " The gallantry and military capacity of General Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he was engaged ; and never was he charged with being slow , until he hesitated to strike *at Hood before he was prepared to make the battle of Nashville one of the most decisive battles of the war ; but the complaint came from City Point , and hence the credence of its justice . In the history of the great Civil War , yet to be written by an impartial pen , no name will be more conspicuous , not for courage only , but for all the qualities required in a great commander , than that of George H. Thomas . Nor was it as a soldier only that he was renowned . He was no less distinguished by his modesty , his unselfishness , and his keen sense of justice . He was never his own trumpeter , nor with his approbation was anyone the trumpeter of his fame . Newspaper correspondents were never welcome in his camps . His supreme ambition was to do his duty , and he was content that his reputation should rest upon his acts . He declined honors when , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others . Having said so much about General Thomas , I can not help giving the impressions made upon me by a few of the other distinguished generals and commanders with whom I became personally acquainted during the war , or soon after its close . The evening of the day on which reports of General P. H. Sheridan 's splendid victory in the Valley of Virginia were received in Washington I spent with the President at the Soldiers ' Home . It was such a relief to have cheering news from that quarter that Mr. Lincoln threw off his cares and gave free rein to his humor . He had not been so happy , he said , since the capture of Vicksburg . I certainly never saw him during the war when he was so joyous . My desire to meet Sheridan was not gratified until I met him some years after in London , where we spent some pleasant hours together . Since then I have known him quite well , and he has grown steadily in my estimation and respect . To many of his countrymen General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the brave  --  the dashing cavalry commander , whose gallantry had been displayed on many battlefields ; always foremost in the fight and seemingly courting danger // for the love of it . Such he had seemed to me until he was assigned to the command of the Army of the Shenandoah , in August , 1864 . It was there that he found opportunity to display his qualities as a commander . It was the first command of an army that he had been entrusted with , and he had opposed to him one of the most skilful generals of the Confederacy . That the right man had at last been assigned to the command of the Union forces in that fertile valley , from which General Lee was obtaining a large part of his supplies in the defence of Richmond , was speedily proved by his great but dearly bought victory at Opequan Creek . It was the first battle in which he had led an army , and in his elation he indited the despatch , " We have sent the enemy whirling through Winchester . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Hill , which soon followed , in which the Confederate fortifications , well built and on a commanding position , were skilfully flanked and carried by storm , was scarcely less important than that of Opequan in the effect which it had upon both sections of the country . It was , however , in the battle of Cedar Creek that Sheridan obtained his greatest renown . When Sheridan reached the field from Winchester , about 11 o'clock , the largest part of the Union army was in retreat , some of it in utter confusion . To stop the retreat , to reform the broken lines , to compel the fugitives to face the enemy , and to win a great victory , was possible only to a general of great ability , who could inspire his troops with his own gallant spirit . In a few hours the lost ground was recovered , and before night the Confederates , beaten at all points , were flying for their lives . The annals of war reveal nothing grander than the conduct of Sheridan in this , the last great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the idol of the men whom he commanded . Since the war he has displayed executive ability and sound judgment in the pe*ormance of various important duties , and there are none to deny that he fills with credit the highest place in the army . No other general in the army of the Civil War is known by as many peo ple as William Tecumseh Sherman , and none has warmer friends . Of great versatility of character , he has been soldier , teacher , banker , and again soldier . He has travelled much and been a close and accurate observer . His perception is rapid , and his comprehension of the topography of a country through which he merely travels is so extraordinary that he understands its general features better than they are understood by its residents . This faculty gave him great advantage in his Tennessee and Georgia campaign , and in his march from Savaunah to Raleigh . He had been over a considerable part of these sections before , not as a student of their topography , but as a young lieutenant in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the Southern Generals seemed to know . In the conduct of the Atlanta campaign , Sherman exhibited military genius of the highest order , supplemented by courage , hardihood , endurance ; but the crowning victory was yet to be attained . His march to the sea was as grand in design as it was splendid in execution . To Sherman alone belongs the honor of the design ; to him and to his army the honor of the achievement . It was in conception and accomplishment one of the grandest enterprises of which there is a record . I met General Hancock for the first time a few days after the battle of Gettysburg . I had known something of his early history-that two years after he graduated at West Point he had been breveted first lieutenant for his bravery in the war with Mexico ; and I was quite familiar with his military history from the commencement of the civil war . I knew that he had won distingnished honors on the Peninsula , at South Mountain and Antietam , and that his praise was in everybody 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ displayed at Gettysburg . I was therefore desirous to know him personally , and I met him with the most favorable impressions of his merit as a soldier . From that time my acquaintance with him was as intimate as the difference in our pursuits and our places of abode would permit ; and the // better I knew him , the higher did he rise in my estimation . In uprightness , in a keen sense of honor , in kindness of heart , in generosity , in genuine manliness , he had no superior in the army . To jealousy he was a stranger . If he thought , as many of his friends did , that his services were not properly appreciatecl , he never expressed or indicated it . In the field , in the management of the troops under his command , wherever valor came into full exercise , he was , in the language of one who fought with him and under him , " simply magnificent . " Of his qualifications to command an army and conduct a campaign , there must have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would have been tried in that capacity . It is not unlikely that these doubts were created by Secretary Stanton , with whom Hancock was not a favorite . There was apparently no good grounds for them . In all the battles in which he was engaged and that were unfavorable to the Union armies , his position was a subordinate one , and he was in no manner responsible for their results . On the contrary , his conduct in each was such as to justify the opinion that he possessed the qualities for absolute command ; - that if he had succeeded McClellan in command , the battle of Fredericksburg would not have been fought , and no such disasters as those at Chancellorsville and Bull Run would have befallen the Grand Army of the Potomac , or of Virginia , as it was for a short time called . Burnside had rendered good service in North Carolina ; Hooker was distinguished for his bravery , and Pope had won a high reputation in the West ; but neither , outside of the War Department , was considered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their preference to him was a surprise to me , as I think it was to others who were acquainted with their respective histories . It was by Hancock 's advice that Lee was met at Gettysburg , and although General Meade was in command , to him more than to any other man , the nation was indebted for the most important victory of the war . Next to being elected President , the worst thing that can happen to a sucVOL . IV. - 29 cessful military general is to be a can - didate for that high office . A stranger to the freedom of the press and the unfairness of politicians , in reading Republican newspapers and listening to Republican orators , when Hancock was a candidate for the Presidency , would have supposed that he was destitute of both intelligence and patriotism . Nothing could have been wider from the truth . Of his patriotism there could be no question . In general intelligence he was not inferior to any of the welleducated men of the army , except perhaps McClellan and Sherman and Thomas and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tariff as a local question . That the tariff , which had been specially the apple of discord from the foundation of the Government , and which at one time threatened the integrity of the Union , should be spoken of by a candidate for the Presidency as a local question , did seem to be absurd . But was it ? The tariff was then , as it is now , one of the most interesting questions before the country ; but it had always been to a considerable extent a sectional , and consequently a local , question . It was well for Hancock that he was defeated . As President he might have been a failure . His fame now rests upon his military services , and there it rests securely . His record as a soldier is without a blemish . A gallant soldier he was , without fear and without reproach . Upon General McClellan 's caieer I have only space here for some brief reflections . When McClellan was retired , what happened to the Army of the Potomac ? Terrible slaughter under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The hold which McClellan had upon his men , their love for him and the confidence which they had in him , were displayed when he took his leave of them and turned over the command to Burnside , when it was difficult to say which predominated-sorrow or indignation ; sorrow that they were to be separated from their beloved commander , indignation at the injustice with which he had been treated . // The prevalent opinion in regard to McClellan was that it was his habit to overrate the strength of the enemy and underrate his own ; that he was too much of an engineer , too cautious , too prudent , for an efficient commander ; that he was wanting in that self-confidence which , united with a clear head and military knowledge , has been a characteristic of successful generals . His position from the time he took command of the Army of the Potomac up to the close of his military career was such as to make him cautious and prudent , but I have looked in vain in his military history for the evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is certainly not found in his first campaign in West Virginia ; not in the Peninsula , where he had everything to contend with which was calculated to discourage him and his army , with no word of cheer from the headquarters in Washington ; not in his willingness to take again the commaud of the army after it had been shattered and demoralized ; not in the rapidity with which its discipline was restored and its spirit revived , so that it was able to meet and overcome the same foes by which it had been defeated a few days before . The evidence of General McClellan 's deficiencies is found not in a correct history of his military career , but in the press and the despatches of the War Department . He was unfortunate in not comprehending the true cause of the Rebellion , and in his views upon the question of slavery . He was unfortunate in the use of his name by his political friends in connection with the Presidency while he was in the field . He was still more unfortunate in permitting his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attributing to the War Department indifference in regard to the result of the Peninsula campaign , in writing to the President a letter which would have been well enough in a political contest , but which was grossly improper when addressed by a general in the field to his superior . All this and more can be admitted without derogation to his merits as a soldier . He was permanently retired under a cloud within little more than a month from the time when with a recently beaten army he had achieved a very important victory ; - retired under circumstances that seemingly justified the opinion that there were influences at work in Washington which demanded his retirement as a political necessity . To doubt that the cloud that rested upon him when he was ordered to Trenton will be cleared away , that his high military character will be vindicated , would be to doubt the triumph of truth over jealousy and misrepresentation . It is enough to say of General McClellan , in his private and social life , that he was in the truest sense a Christian gentleman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did what I could to prevent his election to the Presidency . What I have said about him has been prompted only by a sense of duty to one who imperilled his life in his country 's service , and who merited lasting honor , instead of the ignominy to which he was subjected and the disrepute which still , to some extent , attaches to his name . That fact is stranger than fiction , is illustrated in the life of General Ulysses S. Grant . Few men were ever subject to so great vicissitudes ; none ever rose so rapidly from obscurity to fame , from a very low estate to the highest . In the spring of 1861 he was utterly unknown outside of a very limited circle . In 1868 he was elected President of the United States by an overwhelming majority over one of the most distinguished men of the day . There have been and there will continue to be great differences of opinion in regard to General Grant 's character and merits as a soldier . While many , and perhaps a majority , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose name will go down in history along with the names of the most renowned soldiers of modem times , others regard him as having been destitute of genius , entitled to no credit except for stubborn courage and unyielding resolution ; as one whose rise was a chapter of accidents and luck . Neither of these opinions is correct . It was not by accident or luck that Donelson was taken , that the Mississippi was opened by the capture of Vicksburg , and that the misfortunes at Chickamauga were offset by // the achievements at Lookout Mountain and Missionary Ridge . It was not by luck that he rose from the captaincy of a company , in 1861 , to the command of all the armies of the United States , in 1864 . Accidents were in his favor , and lucky he certainly was , but if he had not possessed military qualities of a high degree , accidents would not have been favorable to him and good luck would not have been so constantly his attendant . His rise was rapid and with but a single interruption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to have reached the height of his military career , but after his success at YL*ksburg his star was again in the ascendant , and it continued to shine with undiminished if not increasing brightness to the end of the war . On the other hand , it must be admitted that he did not accomplish enough , nor give evidence of possessing all the qualities which were necessary to entitle him to a place by the side of the great captains of the world . If he had capacity for planning campaigns , he lacked the opportunities for exhibiting it . Before the expedition was commenced in which Fort Henry and Fort Donelson were captured and the line of Confederate fortifications was broken , the importance of such an expedition had been freely discussed . The successful movement against Yicksburg was not undertaken until all other plans for reaching the city had failed . The battles on Lookout Mountain and Missionary Ridge were not fought according to any well-digested plan . But while General Grant 's abilities were not in the line of organizing troops or planning campaigns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which he had the direction he displayed indomitable resolution , perfect self-possession , dauntless courage . His conduct at Donelson and before Yicksburg , where he obtained his highest renown , was such as to entitle him to very high rank as a soldier , but in neither of these fields was there , nor could there be , a display of such ability as would sustain the claims of his extreme eulogists . His qualities were such as circumstances required . There was no sentiment in his mode of warfare . He was never seen on a field after a battle had been fought , or in the hospitals , and he never counted the cost of a victory . His business was to fight . To persistently push the enemy at all points and at all sacrifices , was , in his opinion , the surest as well as the speediest way of terminating the war . It was , he thought , his duty to cripple him in every way . Me was opposed therefore , for a time , to the exchange of prisoners , knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of treatment in Northern and Southern prisons he would be receiving men who were not fit for duty in exchange for those that were , and that the government which he served had far less need of men than its enemies . This was considered by many as inhuman , but war is a business in which humanity is not often brought into lively exercise . He understood both the duties and responsibilities of a commander , and while insensible to fear , he never exposed himself unnecessarily to danger . He lacked personal magnetism . His presence among his troops was never hailed with enthusiastic shouts , as was McClellan 's . He never breasted the storm of battle , as did Thomas at Chickamauga . He never personally rallied fleeing troops and led them back to victory , as Sheridan did at Cedar Creek . His soldiers were not strongly attached to him , but they had confidence in his generalship , and they admired him for his coolness and courage . As I have said , he did not accomplish enough , nor exhibit all the qualities which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the great captains of the world . What his rank is to be hereafter among the distinguished generals of his own country , can not be safely predicted . It certainly will be among the highest . His name may not be second to any in the long line of American soldiers ; but that it will be regarded by impartial historians as entitled to the pre-eminence that is now so generally accorded to it , is at least doubtful . He gained nothing in reputation after he became lieutenant general . Sherman expressed the opinion that if General C. F. Smith had lived , Grant might not have been heard of after Donelson . He would not have been wide of the // mark if he had said that but for Donelson and Vicksburg Grant would not have been known in history . But Smith did not live to throw Grant into the background , and Donelson and Vicksburg are fixed facts in the annals of the war . Naturally , some of r*y most interesting recollections are connected with two Presidents with whom I was intimately associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States has been so imperfectly understood as Andrew Johnson . None has been so difficult to understand . He had few personal friends ; in no one did he entirely confide . He had many faults , but he abounded also in admirable qualities . His love of the Union was a passion intensified by the dangers to which it hal been exposed and by his labors in its defence . It was his devotion to the Union which compelled him to oppose the reconstruction acts of Congress , which he thought would greatly retard , if they did not prevent , its perfect restoration . I differed from him upon some subjects , but I never had reason to doubt his patriotism or his personal or official integrity . I was not present when Mr. Johnson took the oath of Vice-President , in the Senate Chamber , but the reports of his speech on that occasion amazed me . It was so different from what had been expected of him-so incoherent , so rambllng , that those who listened to it thought that he was intoxicated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me the next morning , " the speech of Andrew Johnson , but the speech of a drunken man " and such it undoubtedly was . He had been ill for some days before he left home , and on his way to Washington had taken brandy as an astringent . On the day of his inauguration as Vice-President he was really ill , and was so unwise as to resort to a stimulant before he went to the Senate Chamber . Meeting Mr. Lincoln a day or two after , I said to him that the country , in view of the Vice-President 's appearance on the 4th , had a deeper stake than ever in his life . He hesitated for a moment , and then remarked , with unusual seriousness , " I have known Andy Johnson for many years ; he made a bad slip the other day , but you need not be scared ; Andy ai n't a drunkard . " For nearly four years I had daily intercourse with him , frequently at night , and I never saw him under the influence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have been his faults intemperance was not among them . There was a marked difference between his carefully prepared papers and his off-hand speeches . The former were well written and dignified ; the latter were inconsiderate , retaliatory , and in a style which could be tolerated only in the heat of a political campaign . Hence the opinion that they were made when he was under the influence of liquor . Mr. Johnson was a man of unblemished personal integrity . He was an honest man , and his administration was an honest and clean administration . In this respect it will bear comparison with any that have preceded or have followed . In appointments money was not potent . Offices were not merchandise . The President never permitted himself to be placed under personal obligations to anyone . He received no presents . The horses and carriages which were sent to him soon after he became President were promptly returned . When he was so unwise as to suppose that there might be a third party , of which he was to be the head , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some official changes to accomplish this object , but there were fewer changes than are usually made , even when an administration follows one of the same party . There were more officers connected with the Treasury Department than with any other , and it is due to Mr. Johnson that I should say that his desire seemed always to be that it should be fairly and honestly administered , and , except for a very brief period , independently of political considerations . In no instance did he interfere with its management . In his bitter contest with Congress , although most of the employees of the department were politically opposed to him and his reconstruction policy , he never even suggested that changes should be made for that reason . If he did not // declare that public offices were public trusts , his actions proved that he so regarded them . In some matters I doubted the correctness of his judgment , but I never doubted his devotion to what he considered his duty to his country , and the whole country . He was a laborious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Neither by him nor by any member of his Cabinet was recuperation sought at the seaside or in the mountains . His administration had little popular and no distinctive party support , but , judged by its merits , as sooner or later it will be , it casts no discredit upon the national honor . In his administration of the Government Mr. Johnson labored under great disadvantages . He had been a Democrat , but his connection with the Democratic Party was severed when he became the Republican candidate for the Vice-Presidency . He was disowned by the Republicans when he antagonized the reconstruction measures of Congress . For a good part of his term he was President without a party . The Democratic senators in a body stood by him in his impeachment trial , though they did not do so from personal regard , but because the trial was political , and because they approved of his reconstruction policy , which was in harmony with the Democratic doctrine in regard to the constitutional rights of the States ; but they never gave to him or to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by some members of Congress , he was denounced as a traitor , not only to his party , but to the country . His services during the war , in recognition of which he had been nominated for the Vice-Presidency ; the bravery which he had displayed in his contests with the secessionists of Tennessee ; the terrible trials to which his family were subjected by his fidelity to the Union , were all ignored , buried , forgotten . He was accused not only of political offences , but of personal misconduct of which there was not the slightest proof . Unfortunately for himself ( such was his temperament ) , he could not restrain his disposition to repel by intemperate speeches the attacks that were made upon him . He seemed to forget what was due to his station , to be unmindful that he had been lifted out of the political arena in which he had been so long a combatant . Silence in his case would have been wisdom ; defence by retaliatory speeches was a blunder . He ought to Lave felt that his true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that , sustained by them , the assaults of his enemies would be harmless . No matter how unpopular or severely criticised a man occupying a high position may have been while in active life , there is usually a disposition , even on the part of those who were the most hostile to him , to be generous to his memory . This disposition has not been manifested in Mr. Johnson 's case . It is not often that kindly mention is made of him upon the platform or in the press . Among those who have filled high places with ability or rendered distinguished services to their country his name is rarely classed ; and yet when the history of the great events with which he was connected has been faithfully written , there will appear few names entitled to greater honor and respect than that of Andrew Johnson . His faults were patent he was incapable of disguise . He was a combatant by temperament . If he did not court controversy , he enjoyed it . He rarely tried to accomplish his ends by policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge of demagogism . In tact he was utterly deficient , and he ran against snags which he might easily have avoided . Naturally distrustful , he gave his confidence reluctantly-never without reserve ; he had , therefore , few constant friends . These peculiarities and defects in his character were manifest , and they were severe drawbacks upon his usefulness in public life . On the other hand , he never cherished animosity after a contest was over . He never failed in generosity toward a defeated foe . He was brave , honest , truthfuL He never shrank from danger , disregarded an engagement , or was unfaithful to his pledges . His devotion to the Union was a passion . There was no sacrifice that he was not willing to make , no peril that he was not willing to encounter in its defence . It was not // mere emotion that prompted the direction that the flag of his country-the stripes aud stars-should be his winding-sheet , but it was the expression of his devotion to the principles which it represented . He was a kind and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was proud of his daughters , and he had reason to be , for they were devoted to him ; and more sensible , unpretending women never occupied the Executive Mansion . In intellectual force he had few superiors . He had , as has been stated , no educational advantages , but he made such use of opportunities that he never failed to fill with credit the various places which he held in his way up to the highest position in the Government . Of Mr. Johnson 's patriotism there ought not to have been a question , for he had given the highest evidence of it . He believed that the Southern States which attempted to secede were never out of the Union , and that when they had laid down their arms , submitted to the authority of the Government , and given honest pledges of future loyalty , they should at once have been permitted to resume their phces . In this he may have been wrong , but he was backed by whit was understood to be Mr. Lincoln 's opinion , and by a respectable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no indication of a want of patriotism in this , nor was there in any of his utterances or acts . No member of his Cabinet ever heard from him an expression which savored of unfaithfulness to the Constitution . Mr. Dennison , Mr. Harlan , and Mr. Speed resigned their places not because they distrusted him , but because they could not stand by him in his contest with Congress . Their successors and the rest of the members , including Mr. Evarts , who had been one of his counsel in the impeachment trial , and who became his Attorney-General , never had the sllghtest reason to doubt his personal or his polltical integrity , or his unselfish patriotism . I had no desire to enter again into public life , even for a short period , but I was nevertheless gratified when President Arthur came out to my house in the country  --  a short distance from Washington-one afternoon in October ' 1884 , to inform me that Mr. Greshain had resigned the office of Secretary of the Treasury to become a Circuit Judge of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help him close up his administration . I was still more gratified by the favorable manner my appointment was spoken of by the press , as it seemed like an endorsement of my management of the Treasury from 1865 to 1869 . The highest pleasure that I had during the short period that I held the office of Secretary for the second time was in the intimate acquaintance which I formed with President Arthur . I had . known him as Collector of Customs in New York , and as a sagacious politician , but I was not prepared for the ability and tact which he exhibited when he became President of the United States . That high office is a very difficult one to fill by men who have been elected to it ; it is much more difficult for one to fill who succeeds to it by being VicePresident . It was with great diffidence that he entered upon the discharge of his high duties ; but his self-distrust begot carefulness , and he was content to administer the government as he found it . Day by day his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few weeks he was master of it . His position was a trying one , not only for the reasons that have been named , but by the fact that he had been a very active politician in New York , and had used . men for political purposes who expected to be rewarded for them by the patronage which was at his disposal . The claims of all such men were disregarded . They became very pressing , as I had good reason for knowing , toward the close of his administration , but Mr. Arthur paid none of his political debts in New York at the expense of the Federal Treasury or to the detriment of the public service . I did not know which most to admire , his firmness in resisting their importunities or his tact in retaining their good-will , notwithstanding his refusal to comply with their urgent requests . Mr. Arthur during his administration attempted no feats of diplomacy . His recommendations to Congress had been // carefully considered , and they were presented in a manner that compelled the respect of Congress , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout was characterized by a high order of ability and by devotion to the public welfare . If any one of our Presidents merited a second term , he did . Had he been nominated he would doubtless have been elected , as the opposition to him would have been less savage than it was against Mr. Blame . He might have lost some votes that were given to Mr. Blame , but he would have secured a great many that went to Mr. Cleveland . @
