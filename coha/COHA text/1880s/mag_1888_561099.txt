THE individual who is regular in his habits , who eats his meals at stated times , taking care not to partake of too much food at once , will live to a greater age and enjoy better health than the person who leads an irregular and intemperate life . The reason is plain . The system is nourished at the right time and with food sufficient to supply the demands of nature . As the nation is the individual in concrete , it follows that the same rule should apply and that no more than enough should be taken at a time . That which gives life to an individual is the food which enters and strengthens the system . That which sustains life in a nation is its population . If an individual studies the laws of nature and will eat nu*tritious , wholesome food , such as will agree with him , he will find that he can enjoy life far better than the person whose menu is made up of ill-cooked , indigestible viands . This rule will also hold good when applied to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain kinds of food are to the human system . When its tide flows in regularly ; is made up of enlightened , well disposed people ; when too many are not landed at once on our shores , it can not but prove beneficial and healthy . Those who come must do so of their own volition and not because of undue influence on the part of interested parties . The flow of immigration which came prior to 1860 was of a far different character from that which has been tending in this direction since , and the conditions under which immigrants must begin life in the United States have been almost entirely revolutionized within the past decade . The immigrant of the sixties found it comparatively easy to earn a living , and he was not obliged to crowd his neighbor in order to make room for one more . To the immigration which came previous to 1860 we owe our greatness as a nation ; it gave us brain , bone and muscle ; it // made our rivers navigable , and when they could not carry our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it gave us laborers , mechanics and statesmen ; it was healthy and good . Could we say the same of the immigration of the present day there would be no fault to find and none but narrowminded bigots would complain . It is still dangerous to say anythiug concerning the restriction of immigration for fear of being charged with Know-Nothingism . Whatever Know-Nothingism meant in former years , the man who advocates a restriction of immigration to-day is a patriot who loves his country better than the opinion of demagogues , or of those who will not speak the truth because it may temporarily affect their interests . I do not base my objections to unrestricted immigration on race hatred , prejudice or bigotry . In what I have to say I am actuated by a sincere desire to benefit humanity . Nine million seven hundred thousand immigrants have landed since 1860 ; more than the combined populations of New York and Pennsylvania and as much as the total population of Arizona , Arkansas , California , Colorado , Connecticut , IDakota , Delaware , Florida , Idaho , Kansas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Nebraska , Nevada , New Hampshire , New Mexico , Oregon , Rhode Island , Utah , Washington Territory , West Virginia and Wyoming . The population which came previous to 1860 was civilized , that which comes to-day is , in a great proportion , semi-barbarous . Who doubts that statement has only to travel along the line of railroad nearest to him until he meets with a gang of laborers and attempts to converse with them . He has only to go into the mining regions of Pennsylvania , the mills of Ohio , the factories of New England , the lumber camps of Michigan , or Mulberry street , New York , to find a class of beings that are far from being civilized . One or two illustrations will suffice . Eight years ago I visited a mining camp and investigated the condition of the men who were imported , free of duty , to take the places of the American workmen who had demanded higher wages for labor done . Diningroom , smoking-room , sitting-room , kitchen and bedchamber all in one . Five rows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in width and seventy-eight inches long . The first bunk , eighteen inches from the floor , the next supported by rough hemlock posts but two feet above it , and a third two feet above the second one . Each bunk filled with straw and covered with the coarsest kind of // coffee sack material for bed clothing . Two rows of hemlock boards , each one twenty feet in length by three feet in width , constituted the tables . The men came in from the mines while I was there , and before washing face or hand sat down to a meal of salt pork , meal and water . One hundred and five men lived in a building one hundred and sixty feet in length by thirty feet in width . Addressing one of them in the English tongue I received no answer . I waited until it was time to retire , and saw these men lie down without divesting themselves of a single article of clothing ; some of them took off their shoes , but the greater portion of them did not . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from two to two dollars and a half a day . The compensation allowed to them was but seventy-five cents a day and board . A careful estimate showed that five and one-eigbth cents would provide a meal such as I saw spread on that table , thus making the outlay on each man but ninety and three-eighths cents a day . One year ago I visited the same place in company with the same escort , and found but one of the one hundred and five men who were there seven years before . Inquiry developed the fact that the others had at different intervals returned to their homes across the sea . I have witnessed hundreds of scenes like that in several States , and inquiry always elicited the same information regarding the movements of such men . They return to their homes when they have accumulated a few hundred dollars . They receive the lowest possible wages while in this country , and take nearly all of it home with them when going . The greater portion , by b . Two weeks far , of what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of men at work on a railroad . Attached to the waist-band of each man was a leather strap fastened to a large brass check similar to those used by railway companies when checking baggage . Every check bore a number , and the man who carried it , or to whom it was fastened , was known by the number on his check . On the pay-rolls of the company he was known by his number , and if he had the misfortune to lose his check , he at the same time lost his wages unless the foreman would identify him for a consideration . These men spoke a tongue unknown to me , and the same story was told of their habits as was told of the men of eight years ago . Shanties of the roughest boards made up the homes of these poor fellows , and fare of the coarsest and filthiest // kind was given , or supplied them by the contractor . Fancy the future of the American laborer , whose name is forgotten , and whose only means of identification rests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another while he sleeps . Investigation has demonstrated that those who remain in this country , of that class of immigrants , do not learn to speak our language with any degree of accuracy ; they never read of the affairs of our government in the language of the coilutry , and seldom know how to read any other language . The majority of that class of immigrants comes here under contract or after undue influence has been brought to bear on them by agents of American employers . Another class of aliens rush hither fleeing from oppression at home . Others come as our cashiers go to Canada , because of the offenses committed at home ; with this difference , those who go to Canada bring American dollars with them , while those who commit crime in foreign lands bring nothing with them but depraved habits and vengeful hearts , and when those who can do so return to their own lands , they , too , take American dollars with them . Every European country is infested with agents of American and English syndicates who offer tempting inducements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true is beyond question . That these poor foreigners are welcomed by mercenaryhearted Americans , whose selfishness has killed their patriotism , is true . In verification of that assertion let me quote from the secret circular sent out by Henry Clews &amp; Co. last year , an*I published in the papers a year ago . It reads : " The tide of immigration this way , the arrivals yesterday at least ten thousand , which is the largest on record for any one day , should be considered as a favorable feature , especially as the new corners are largely from the continent , and bring funds with them for their immediate support . In the present disturbed condition of labor this large flow of immigration comes at an opportune time . What this country needs more than anything else is the same competition in the labor market as is found in all manufacturing and product markets . Competition alone will out-maneuver in the end all the generals who are leading the Knights of Labor . Competition alone will prove the onlypacifler of labor dissatisfaction and uprising . All American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouraging the European surplus population to flock to our shores to bring about the true remedy for the present labor evils , which is the only cloud now overhanging our present prosperous country . " In the same circular reference is made to the gloomy outlook for all Europe which has made investment in European securities // unprofitable , yet Henry Clews &amp; Co. would transfer that surplus population which has unsettled Europe to American soil for the purpose , not of building up the country , but that it might become the willing instrument in the hands of money getters here . No thought of the country 's welfare inspired that circular . Let us consider what the surplus population of Europe means when transplanted to this country . Dissatisfied with their surroundings at home many come with vengeance iu their hearts . Coming from lands where oppression reigns they regard liberty as license on this side and soon find their way into the police courts . Unacquainted with our laws they do not know how to obey them . Being a surplus on the other side , they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " bring funds with them . " They come as paupers and as paupers they remain ; they come to compete in the struggle for food with the American workman . Place a few intelligent but unscrupulous men of their own race at the head of these men , and continue to turn the screws as they have been turned for the past few years in the field of competition , and the safety of the republic will be seriously threatened . Brought to America to occupy that sphere in life outlined in the circular of Henry Chews &amp; Co. , deceived and cheated by those of their own race who may understand the language and customs of this country , robbed by their employers , their ignorance taken advantage of on every hand , it must not be expected that they will entertain any feelings of love or respect for this country or her institutions . Having been used as the club with which employers struck down the independence of the American laborer , it must not be expected that the latter will cherish a very friendly feeling for either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Europe is placarded with highly colored handbills which set forth the advantages of emigration to America . When on landing in New York , when the illusion is dispelled and every future step is in an opposite direction from that which was expected , we must not hope that such as have been deceived will ever become good and useful citizens . The object in bringing them hither is not that they may become citizens , but slaves . Those who do not come up to the requirements of citizenship can not be called freemen , and their influence on the labor market is so degrading and baneful , that they are every day reducing the condition of the American workman to a parallel with their own . Our // land laws are not based on equity , for under them it is possible for the man of wealth to possess millions of acres . Our railroads enjoy privileges which give their owners a power which the Emperor of Russia does not possess , and that power is being directed toward the complete overthrow of our republican form of government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and water privileges , are being cornered under the sway of the " Trust . " Our legislatures are already of so purchascable a character as to be regarded as the rightful property of the highest bidder . There are men in New York City who claim that they can tell within a thousand dollars of wh t it will cost to buy up sufficient of the Legislature of the State of New York to put through any scheme desired by the railroad or monopoly interests of that State . As a nation we must within the next ten years completely divest the railroads and other corporations of their autocratic power , or they will subject us to the sway of an oligarchy , which will rule , not by divine right or by reason of superior birth , but through the power which wealth confers upon its possessors . Humane , but short sighted , men assert that it is wrong to stem the tide of immigration ; that this is the land of the oppressed , and we should so frame our laws as to deal equitably by all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for such sentiment has bone by , and we must open our eyes to realities and face the danger which confronts us . This is not only the land of the oppressed , but the oppressor as well , and a nation born under such anspices as the American Republic should contain neither . It is conceded that to remedy existing evils , such as I have mentioned , we must enact wise legislation . How can that be done with the source , the fountain head of legislation , withi a the power of wealth and ignorance ? Two illustrations will explain as well as a volume . In a lumber town in Michigan at the last general election over four hundred votes were cast . Citi*ens who have a right to know tell me that there are not more than fifty legal voters in the town , the remainder is made up of that class of immigrants of which I write . The owner of the lumber mills acted as judge of election . Owning the mills which make the towmi , he also owns the people so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man required the services of au unscrupulous , willing tool iii the legislature , and obliged his employees , the majority of whom // were not residents of this country over one year , to go to the polls and vote for the man of his choice . The qualifications of citizenship were disregarded , not by the willful act of the ignorant workman , but by the intelligent unscrupulous employer , whose love of pocket overshadowed love of country . It was " vote as I dictate or you are discharged , " and the poor wretches had no alternative but to obey . That one instance , and its parallel can be duplicated by the hundred , shows what can be done with ignorant men ; and to hope for a reform of existing evils , to expect that our laws can be amended while the tide of raw , undisciplined , willing serfs is swelling in on us by the million , while they are being used as voting instruments which neutralize the best efforts of patriots , is little short of madness . Those who are serfs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transplanted to other soil . How can a law which allows one man to rule a million acres be repealed when we import millions of slaves to vote as that man wills ? Seneca once asked : " How great would be our peril if our slaves began to number us ? " How great will be the peril of the republic if the number of those who do not appreciate it ever reach a majority ? With poverty staring the workman in the face , with competition driving the children out of the school room and into the workshop , with immigration pouring its unlettered hordes upon our coast , it is but fair to presume that ignorance will increase in spite of our best efforts . Where ignorance dominates slavery is the result ; where ignorance exists race hatreds , prejudices and distinctious will create strife and internal warfare . Where ignorance prevails citizenship is a farce , and the ballot in the hands of those who know not how to use it becomes the most powerful aid to the money held by the few . American employers do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American citizens . In Reading , Pa. , there is an iron manufacturing company which employs several hundred men . Four years ago , that firm employed only citizens of the United States ; previous to an election , these men were told by the owner of the mill that he expected that they would vote in accordance with his wishes ; some of them complied , and others disregarded his mandate . To-day , only three men , outside of his clerks and foremen , are American citizens  --  the remainder have been imported ; and while more men are required to do the work , they do not command the wages that their predecessors did , they arc // more docile , and though they may never be able to understand the English tongue , if they become citizens they will know how to vote as the owner of that mill wishes . On Saturday , July 7 , over two thousand Americans sailed from New York to various parts of Europe . They go to spend the summer abroad . It is estimated that the cheapest three months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred dollars . Many of those who sailed on the 7th will spend ten times that amount while abroad ; but it is safe to say that the two thousand tourists will average a thousand dollars each , which will in the aggregate reach the sum of two millions of dollars . On the week ending Saturday , July 7 , the number of immigrants which landed at Castle Garden was 5,161 . I doubt if they brought two millions of dollars with them for " their immediate support , " and if they did , this country made nothing by the exchange . But it is estimated that the total sum which they brought with them did not exceed thirty thousand dollars , which leaves the balance of one million , nine hundred and seventy thousand dollars in favor of Europe . Those who went to Europe did not leave vacancies in the ranks of labor , and they took with them what had been earned for them by the American workman , and in their place we find 5,161 foreigners dumped in upon the American laborer 's shoulders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has left , after paying the expenses of his employer to Europe . So long as this tide of unrestricted immigration is permitted to sweep in they will take no steps to reform conditions at home . We must check it at once , or instead of Americanizing those who come they will Europeanize us . It is suggested that we oblige the foreigner to reside twentyone years in the United States before allowing him to become a citizen . Those who advocate such a course of treatment should remember that we do not require these people simply to work , they should bear a portion of the burdens of citizenship and should be taught what it means . To my mind the better plan would be to oblige every person who contemplates emigrating to this conntry to file a declaration of such ' intention with the American Consul next to his place of residence at least three years before date of emigration . Make it the duty of the representative of the United States Government abroad to ascertain what the character // of the applicant is , what his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Allow only those who come bearing a certificate from the United States consul to land . Oblige the immigrant to declare his intentions to become an American citizen the day he lands , and instruct him that unless he qualifies by learning to read the Declaration of American Independence and the Constitution of the United States , so as to be able to interpret these documents in an intelligible manner , he will forfeit his right to remain longer than five years . There are other considerations aside from the question of citizenship which demand that we take steps at once to cj*teck the influx of immigration . If " self preservation is the first law of nature , " it is high time that we yield obedience to that law . We placed a barrier between the Chinaman and our coast , not because he did not behave himself , not because he was vicious or particularly bad , but because he interfered with the right of the American to earn his living , and for that same reason must we say to the people of all lands that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are such as to inflict hardship on immigrant and citizen ( native and naturalized ) alike . The Irish Land League taught the doctrine of Ireland for the Irish , and sought to prevent the people of Ireland from emigrating . The Knights of Labor , as an organization , is spreading throughout the world , and its principal feature is to teach its members and others that the land in which a man is born owes him something more than oppressive laws and unjust restrictions which prevent him from earning a living . In every country abroad that organization is to place a declaration of principles before the people , selecting some particular feature around which to rally . The members are to be taught to reform existing abuses at home , so that emigration for the purpose of bettering their lot will not be necessary ; they are to be taught that the right to enjoy life in the land of his birth is inherent in man . Once these doctrines begin to spread abroad the people will begin to take more of an interest in home affairs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not necessary to reduce our own people to a condition bordering on serfdom by loading us down with a helpless surplus population which can at best be used only to the advantage of monopoly . During the next few months we will hear a great deal concerning // the protection of American labor from the products of the pauper labor of Europe . Nine out of every ten will know but little about the subject unless he has worked for wages himself . Which of them will have the manhood and courage to demand that we be protected from the pauper and the criminals who have been dumped by the hundred thousand upon the already overburdened backs of the workingmen of this country ? Which man-which party-will have the courage to say : " From this day forward no person shall be allowed to land on American soil who has not filed an application with an American consul to be permitted to emigrate to the United States , at least three years prior to date of sailing . No person who can not read and write shall be admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permitted to land , and all who do come must declare their intentions to become citizens the day they land , and shall study the principles , the constitution and laws of our country before being accepted as citizens . " Which party will take the same interest in the reduction of the surplus population as is taken in reducing the surplus in the treasury of the nation ? Who will say we have imported enough for the present , let us stop until the surplus is exhausted ? I believe it should be done . T. V. POWDERLY.
