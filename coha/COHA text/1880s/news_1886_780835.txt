txt There was a foreign ring about the salvos of applause that rolled through the big underground hall In Cooper Institute last night . Many of the expressions of approval sounded " strangely in American ears , and the wildly enthusiastic bearing of the audience was not that of English speaking races . Yet one of the speakers , a Russian , said his auditors were not foreigners ; that the foreigners in America were those who sat in high places , and they , and not the victims of their malice , must go . According to the same speaker all the men and women in the hall , to the number of at least 3,000 , were boycotters . The declaration was wildly applauded . The meeting , according to John Morrison , Master Workman of District Assembly No. 126 , Knights of Labor , was called by the Central Labor Union to express its indignation at the treatment received by its representatives at the hands of their servants , to adopt measures for the prevention of class legislation , and to call attention to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His allusion to Judge Barrett was the mildest made at the meeting , and was only understood by a minority of the audience . Capt . McCullagh commanded the police who were scattered through the hall . Only 35 were present at the meeting . The same number was held in reserve iu another portion of the ' building . Both Capt . McCullagh and his men had their countenances thoroughly under control and seemed deaf as so many sphynxes to the abuse that was showered upon them . Tailor Robert Blissert was made Chairman of the meeting . He wore a red rose in his buttonhole and looked very well satisfied when the people in the auditorium and the men and women on the stage made strange noises significant of their delight at his presence . His election meant peace , he said , and " defiance to any foul , calumnious act that might be heaped upon his hearers . " He and his auditors were charged with boycotting . Boycotting had been made a crime . Of all the saints Ireland had given us there was none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tilled its lungs and emptied them . The roar might have been heard in Harlem but for intervening obstructions . His auditors had cringed and crawled long enough , he said . They must ston it . They mast also beware of the pitfalls which their enemies would prepare for them . Let there be no war between nationalities . He was delighted at the home rule meeting on Monday to hear a Germano lisp " Faugha-ballagh " and see him wear a shamrock in his buttonhole . He and his hearers had met to discuss Judge Barrett 's conduct in the trial and sentence of five men accused of boycotting . The audience transformed itself into a hissing machine . The audience stepped on itself , for Tailor Blissert said : " Stop that and hiss yourselves ; you made him . " Judge Barrett . he said , was made at a , political manufactory in East Fourteenth-street . Four-fifths of the audience roared with delight . The other fifth hissed with vim . There were many derisive cries of " Oh , no " when Blissert said " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He advised the police who broke up the Knights of Labor meeting on Thursday night to pay the rent of the hall . $50 , if they had a spark of manhood . This sally seemed to have let loose 10,000 snakes . The police paid no more attention to the hissing than if they had been carved out of stone . Some resolutions were read . They eulogized Wilzig. , Haldorf , Dannhouser , Stroh , and Rosenberg , who had been convicted of : boycotting Theiss , as " martyrs in the labor cause . " They spurned the attempt to wrest from labor one of the mightiest weapons in its battle against spoliation . They recognized all who aided in any way the conviction of the boycotters as mortal enemies of organized labor and pronounced it the sacred duty of every workingman to discoxa tisue. all personal and business . relations with them and their business friends . The resolutions were read in English and . German . At the conclusion of the first reading there was only faint applause . The German . Secretary who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to make himself heard . John Swinton was the first speaker . He was introduced as the champion of universal labor . Before he opened his battery the band played " The Marseillaise . " The audience sang it . Swinton paid no attention to the vociferous welcome extended to him . He had heard workingmen yell before , he said . He was tired of the duplicity and the hypocricy of the workingmen . Again and again had they voted for men who clubbed them . He knew them . He supposed it would be the same a hundred years hence . There were cries of " No No : " Who put the men they denounced in power Did the fashion strutters on Fifth-avenueT Not much . It was the men with sinews , who march to the polls every year to refasten the shackles around their necks . The two great clowns of New-York had appeared ou Tuesday upon the platform on which he stood . They played a comedy that would have made Bottom draw in his ears . They were Lawson N. Fuller and Jackson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minstrel show . If Mr. Schultz wanted a collar and elbow fall , let him come on . The boycotters ' conviction was a farce . The act which allowed it was smuggled through the Legislature by David Dudley Field . The Russian code , in comparison with that act , was as pure as crystal . Yet it was the code of the Czar , to whom be eternal damnation . The audience howled its approval . He appealed to the power which created the courts to reverse Judge Barrett 's decision . This power was the people . The people yelled exultingly . One of the fellows on the bench want-ed the nomination for the Mayoralty . He conjured his hearers to vote for uo one who would not promise to fight the men who had done them injustice . The appeal would be heard at Sing Sing . The notion tickled his hearers . He warned Warden Brush not to show malice toward " our five true , noble , broadhearted gentlemen who were crucified on Friday . Anathema , anathema , anathema on him who sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the audience were knocked out in one short round by the terrific demonstration with which the vigorous curse dropped on Judge Barrett by Swinton was received . He bowed his silvered head and retired . " Let us now , " said Mr. Blissert , " see what our sympathy amounts to in cash . We will send the plates around . Are those plates ready ' ? " Those plates were not ready , and men stepped forward and threw silver dollars and halves and quarters on the platform . " It is not often that it do be raining silver , " remarked Tailor Blissert as he began raining up the coins . The plates were soon ready . They were carried to all parts of the hall and the audience was requested in heated terms to fill them to overflowing . Later in the evening Blissert announced that the families of the five boycotters were $130 better off . The speaker who had the least difficulty in touching the sympathies of the audience was S. E. Schewtsch , of the Volks-Zeitung . He spoke with a strong foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Workingmen of St. Petersburg on the Hudson . " Then he kindly paused in order to allow his hearers to have their inning . Then he said he might not be able to address a public meeting in 24 hours , as the Judge who had sentenced the boycotters had said in open court that the editor of the Volks-Zeitung. whoever he might be , should be indicted for publishing the list of jurors in the Theiss case . Though this threat was a great crime against the Constitution of the United States , it was the best thing that could happen for labor at this time . If the courts tampered with freedom of speech or the freedom of the press the people would see what a mockery the Constitution was . Col. Fellows had said that if it were necessary 500,000 boycotters would be arrested . He might as well begin by arresting the audience , for every man and woman in it was a boycotter . A short season was devoted to teetiu " the lung power of the audience . Then Mr. Schewitsch said the true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Attorney , the Judge , and those fellows " were the foreigners . The striped jacket had become the costume of honor ; the swallow-tail was the true prison costume . There were a few foreigners and conspirators in the country . It was useless to look- for them among laboring men . They could be fetuad in the courts , banks , Exchanges , among those miserable scoundrels in the Legislature , and the so-called press of this and every other city . The ruling classes had shamed the country . They had no place on its soil . They must get out . The audience shouted its delight and : r . Schewitsch sat down . Blissert said he wanted to say a good word for the police . The audience laughed derisively . " I am hi earnest , " he said . " They come from your ranks and may some day do their duty by you . " The audience langhed no More-at the police . John MeMacken , of the Painters ' Lnion , made a speech that had little effect . He was followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last speaker , and if the hour had not been late would have rung the changes on the beauties of the boycott until all was blue . The audience had had enough , however , and half of it was on its way home before Ring shad become Warmed to his work . Among other things he told his hearers that they could have ho boycotting they would have something hotter. - King is a Knight of Labor .
