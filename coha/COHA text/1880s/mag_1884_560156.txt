MR . WISE . SEARCH for paradox is a very common employment of the intellect among writers and thinkers . The discovery , real or fancied , of paradox is a most common occasion for ventilating the views of the discoverer . And so it has come to pass of late that several writers , imagining that the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States lately rendered in the Virginia and Louisiana debt cases are paradoxical , have labored at great length to show that a tribunal selected from the school of ultra Federal views , has in some sort reÃ«stablished the very States Rights doctrines for the suppression of which the country had expended so much of blood and treasure . There is no ground for the pretention that these decisions disturb any issue decided by our civil war , or revive any doctrine // of States Rights involved in that struggle . The eases arose and were decided under clauses of the Constitution which have existed from the time that instrument was adopted , or very soon thereafter , about which there never has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which have in no way been changed or affected by the constitutional amendments growing out of the war . When , in some distant period , the student of our history shall come to examine into the changes in our written Constitution resulting from the war , he will doubtless be astonished to see how few those changes are . The ignorant and the thoughtless are wont to look upon the triumph of Federal authority in the struggle of arms as having accomplished a complete overthrow of State sovereignty and established the supremacy of Federal power , so as in effect to make the States of the Union merely police municipalities , subordinate to the overpowering central Government ; and yet no idea could be more utterly absurd , or more at variance with the governmental theories of the most ultra Federalists . The war was not waged for any such purpose , and accomplished no such results , nor has any trained statesman or lawyer ever so maintained . It were idle to discuss what was done contrary to all theories of States Rights during the war . Much was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself , and men with arms in hand will no more observe written charts than they will go into battle with a musket in one hand and a Constitution in the other . But when the war had ended , when the administration of the affairs of government had been remitted to the control of civil authority , Federal and State , it at once became a vital question as to how far the great struggle had enlarged or altered the chart of Federal powers , how far it had curtailed or affected the supremacy of State authority , and in what respect , by changes in either , the rights and remedies of the citizen were altered . The war itself undoubtedly effected many great changes which are not to be found in the Federal Constitution . Some of these are not even expressed in the new State Constitutions adopted under the reconstruction proceedings . For example , slavery was abolished without either Federal or State assent in Constitutions . Again , the doctrine that paramount allegiance was due to the Federal Government , that issue on which the North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not // established by any new clause inserted in the Federal Constitution , but has now become admitted on all hands by the force of the Federal power in war , in the first instance , and by its introduction into the Constitution of every State that resisted it . So we have seen grow up , as a consequence of Federal triumph in arms , theories of construction of Federal power , now unquestioned , which , prior to that struggle , were hotly and bitterly fought ; such , for example , as Federal power over our banking system , Federal power over internal improvements , and many kindred questions . In the days of Andrew Jackson and John Tyler , the exercise of such powers was deemed inadmissible under the Constitution . At present , nobody questions the power of the Government or gainsays its right in the premises ; and yet the written Constitution of the United States is the same now as then upon all the subjects referred to , unaffected in any way by the amendments adopted since the war . Between the year 1794 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitution was adopted , and that amendmentthe twelfth-only related to the method of electing the President , and need not be considered . In 1865 the thirteenth amendment was adopted , quickly followed by the fourteenth and fifteenth . When peace had been restored , when the smoke of battle had floated off , when civil government again fairly asserted its sway , it became at once important , in the light of the war , of the amendments above named , of the complete subjugation of the States and changes in their Constitutions , to know what were the new relations between the Federal and State Governments . It was difficult for the ignorant soldier of the Union to understand how the triumph and supremacy of that Government whose victories he had helped to win were less than absolute ; and the fallen champion of secession , powerless to resist and completely at the mercy of his conqueror , felt that his loss of all he had struggled for could not be less than total , whatever might be his hope . But it was not the ignorant alone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the true solution of the problem vexed the most sagacious statesmen and the most skillful lawyers of America . Of course , the questions growing out of these changes arose speedily for decision , ani the country awaited anxiously the action of the Supreme Court . That great tribunal spoke fully and clearly when it reached the celebrated Slaughter House cases , // in April , 1873 , 16 Wallace , p. 36 . No cases ever decided involved more to the people of America . The opinion rendered clearly and indisputably settled what change in our written Constitution had been effected by all the war amendments , and defined the new duties , powers , and responsibilities of the Federal Government . The intent , character , and scope of each amendment was explained . It was decided that the sole purpose of the thirteenth amendment was to recognize in the Constitution a fact already accomplished , viz. , the abolition of slavery ; that the object and scope of the fourteenth amendment was to further protect the emancipated slaves from hostile State legislation ; and that the object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the argument of the Slaughter House cases , a construclion of these amendments had been urged which , had it been adopted , would have totally altered the relations between Federal and State power theretofore existing . The Supreme Court , pointing to the language of the amendments and referring to the history of their adoption , rejected the construction sought , and disposed of it by saying its effect would be " to fetter and degrade the State Governments by subjecting them to the control of Congress in the exercise of powers , heretofore universally conceded to them , of the most ordinary and fundamental legislation , " and " in fact it radically changes the whole theory of the relations of the States and Federal Government to each other , and of both these Governments to the people . " After the rendition of this opinion , doubt , uncertai*ity , and confusion disappeared ; the Governments , Federal and State , adapted their administration and legislation to the Constitution and its amendments as they were construed and expounded by our highest tribunal , and it was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourteenth , and fifteenth amendments , then , in the Slaughter House cases , rejected , was sought to be revived . So much , then , for the amendments . If the decision in the Slaughter House cases means anything , the amendments have nothing in them which increases Federal jurisdiction against the States on the line of the Louisiana and Virginia cases , and I confess I do not understand the alkisions now and then made to them as containing something out of which Federal jurisdiction to sue States can be contrived . Therefore , I dismiss them // as not involved in the questions touching the Louisiana and Virginia debt cases . In these two cases the effort was made , by proceedings in Federal courts , to compel the States of Louisiana and Virginia to pay their debts in a way different from what they proposed ; or , let us make the issue plainer by admitting , for the sake of argument , that the real effort made was to prevent these States from repudiating . In the discussions of these cases , both in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the morality or immorality of the transactions involved . I submit that if , as I expect to show , the Federal courts had nothing to do with the matter for lack of jurisdiction , all the discussion of morality or immorality , repudiation etc. , was idle . Another favorite argument of the minority , in court and out of court , has been that a palpable impairment of contract had occurred , and it was a shame that it was not corrected . I submit that palpable outrage can not confer jurisdiction , and that wrongs are committed every day upon citizens of the United States under the eyes of her judiciary which they can not redress for lack of jurisdiction ,  --  wrongs more palpable and violent than any deprivation of property , extending sometimes to deprivation of life , and yet , however indignant the judiciary may be , they are powerless to redress them for lack of jurisdiction . And so I say the moral question involved , the hardship involved , the equities involved are all in these cases beyond consideration , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is insuperable before they are reached . Let us see . In 1787 the Federal Constitution was adopted . It contained a clause which was then , and is now , the only ground on which Federal jurisdiction to maintain these suits is or can be invoked , viz : Art . 1 , Sec. 10 . " No State shall . . . pass any . . . law impairing the obligation of contracts . " Standing thus , a State might have been , and actually was , sued . The decision in Chisholin vs . Georgia , 2 Dallas , 419 , was to the effect that under the Constitution a State could be sued . But " under a prevailing sense of danger at that time from Federal power , ** 16 Wallace , p. 82 , the eleventh amendment was adopted almost immediately , and went into effect in less than seven years after the adoption of the Constitution . That amendment reads : " The judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by citizens of another State , or by citizens or subjects of any foreign State . " Surely , nothing could be plainer than this language . " The Judicial Power " is defined by Burrill as the power to hear and determine controversies between litigants , upon proper cases of law and fact presented for adjudication . The language , " Judicial Power , " was used to cover all branches of Federal judicial jurisdiction , for it is used in Article III . to embrace the Supreme Court and all inferior tribunals . The amendment expresses the full scope of that coordinate branch of the Federal Government , and then says it shall not be construed to extend to any suit , etc . Does not this language , standing thus alone and unexplained , show that it was the purpose of the States in adopting the amendment not only to turn this branch of Federal power away from such suits , but to wither it and kill it outright whenever it reached the forbidden ground ? It does not say that the power exists and must not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it may be with the legislative or executive power , the judicial power , in whole or in part , does not extend to any such subject . Now , observe this also . This amendment was adopted after the adoption of Art.1 , Section 10 ; yet it is absolute and unqualified . The language , " No State shall pass any law impairhag the obligation of contracts , " is not coupled with any condition , expressed or implied , that the " Judicial Power " shall be invoked to redress any violation of the law . Nor is the eleventh amendment qualified . It does not say " The Judicial Power , etc. , shall not extend to any suit , etc. , unless in cases where a State has passed a law impairing the obligation of contracts . " On the contrary , the inhibition is broad and absolute , destroying all jurisdiction of the judiciary in suits against the State by the parties named , whether for laws impairing contracts or anything else , and it was enacted after and with full knowledge of the Tenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which in language is plain , and in date subsequent to the contract clause , but we also have the best authority as to the reasons for its adoption . They are homely , but intelligible . Says Chief .. Justice Marshall , in Cohens vs . Virginia , 6 Wheaton , 406 : " It is part of our history that at the adoption of the Constitution all the States were greatly indebted , and the apprehension that these debts might be prosecuted in the Federal courts , formed a very serious objection // to that instrument . Suits were instituted , and the Court maintained its jurisdiction . The alarm was general , and to quiet the apprehensions that were so extensively entertained , this amendment was proposed in Congress and adopted by the State Legislatures . " Thus we know not only when and how , but why this amendment was adopted , and it has seldom happened that the reasons for the adoption of a law have revived after the lapse of a century , in identical form , as in this case ; for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarmed as when it was adopted . It seems to me that with this history of the amendment , this language and these reasons for its adoption before him , a Federal judge who attempts , either directly or indirectly , to implead a State , abandons all consideration of the limits of his jurisdiction , utterly disregards the reason and spirit of the law defining the domain of Federal judicial power , and chases butterflies of sentiment entirely outside his sphere . The mere fact that wrong has been done by one and suffered by another is no ground of Federal jurisdiction ; and if Federal jurisdiction does not exist , the Federal Court is as powerless to redress a great wrong as a small one . The palpable object , reason , and spirit of the eleventh amendment was to deny to the judicial power of the United States any vitality whatever in the domain discussed . The effort , in spite of its plain language and the well-known reasons for its adoption , to still invade that domain by indirect methods is not only beneath the dignity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it into ridicule when it reaches a point where it can neither advance nor recede . When the Supreme Court decided the case of the Memphis and Charleston Railroad vs. the State of Tennessee , at the October term , 1879 , it struck the true key-note of all this controversy . Said Chief-Justice Waite : " The remedy , which is protected by the contract clause of the Constitution , is something more than the privilege of having a claim adjudicated . Mere judicial inquiry into the rights of parties is not enough . There must be the power to enforce the results of such inquiry before there can be said to be a remedy which the Constitution deems part of a contract . Inquiry is one thing ; remedy another Adjudication is of no value as a remedy unless enforcement follows . It is of no practical importance that a right has been established , if the right is no more available afterward than before . " // It is strenuously argued that although the jurisdiction can not be exercised against a State sued as such , it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases are cited . In some of these cases the Federal hawk has certainly swooped very close to the State dove-cote , and dragged its prey from the very door of safety . But that fact does not prove that the decisions were right , and in most of the cases the exercise of jurisdiction was justified under the general power of equity , where title in a specific thing and danger of irreparable damage from its loss is asserted , to pursue it and reclaim it in specie , allowing any other claimant to interplead and assert title to it. * Especially was this doctrine that officers might be sued , although the State could not be sued , asserted in the Louisiana case . It seems to me that this method of acquiring substantial jurisdiction where it is technically and essentially forbidden , is not only an evasion unworthy of the judiciary , but contrary to every rule of practice and precedent of the tribunals themselves . I might enumerate many rules of practice applying to ordinary litigation , every one of which must be ignored , forgotten , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sideways into jurisdiction where none exists , by suing agents when they are known to be mere representatives of a principal who confessedly can not be sued . What would be said of a lawyer who , having a client in controversy with a bank or railroad , brought no suit against either bank or railroad , yet sought mandamus against its employees , from president down to teller or brakesman , to compel them to disobey their princirals and do what he wished ? A chancellor would laugh him out of court . Yet judges and lawyers are to-day found seriously maintaining that this very thing may be done against a State which adds to the ordinary corporate functions the attributes of sovereignty , and is declared exempt from all interference by " the Judicial Power . " What means this guarantee to the States of exemption from the judicial power , if it can thus be avoided and evaded ? * Since this article was written , the Supreme Court has decided the ease of Cunningham vs . The Railroad Co. et as. , in which it has so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little vanity in alluding to it . Here may be found a full citation of the cases which I forbore from referring to , and an admission that " the Federal hawk had swooped too close to the State dove-cote " in the past . I refer the lawyer and student to that decision as the true exposition of Federal law on this subject . // " The State " is not a tangible entity , on which process could be served in any event . Its sovereignty is only manifested through these very public servants who , according to the contention of the opposite side , can be sued . If jurisdiction to sue the State existed , how would she be reached by process ? Manifestly , by service upon her officers , who are the visible and tangible exponents of her invisible and intangible sovereignty . If judgment were rendered , how would it be executed ? Manifestly , by mandates to these same officers ; for the State has no ogres or genii or spirits to work her will . Therefore , if she could be sued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she can not be sued , according to our opponents , and the eleventh amendment of the Federal Constitution is a " something-nothing , " only securing to the State the barren privilege of not being named specifically in the writ . Does any sensible man believe that this was the object of the States in insisting upon this eleventh amendment ? But suppose the Supreme Court had adopted the contention of the appellants in the Louisiana case , for example , and proceeded to order the State officers to do thus and so . To grant the prayer of the bill it was necessary to order the State Auditor and Treasurer to deal with funds in the State treasury , and levy and collect taxes contrary to acts of the Legislature . The State judiciary would not have attempted to exercise such control , for the Constitution of Louisiana forbade the judiciary from invading the Legislative Department ; and these questions of State finance were political questions , dependent on legislative discretion , and out of the pale of judicial functions . Yet , *though the domestic State judiciary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise discretionary political powers higher than those possessed by the coordinate department of the State , provided the State , who was no party and could not be bound by the proceedings , took no step to look out for her own interests . These State officers thus acting would of course be kept before the Court , to report from time to time their actings and doings in levying taxes , paying bonds , etc . Their bondsmen would of course be relieved from all liability on their regular bonds given as State officers . The Court would be compelled to require new bonds . At last , we should have the spectacle of the affau*s of a sovereign State in the hands of receivers of a foreign tribunal , without the State ever having been party to the // cause ; and of taxes levied on her people by a Federal court If there ever was such a spectacle of sovereignty , it has not been recorded ; and if such a state of things is possible , the talk about States having any sovereignty is mere sound , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it becomes more bewildering than the relationship of children , offspring of father and son who marry daughter and mother ; and if we begin to think what the State , who never has been sued and is in no wise bound , may be doing through her Legislature and otherwise , while her officers are being ordered around by the Federal court , we will not only conclude that the effort to exercise these powers is forbidden , but ridiculous , and calculated to put any judge in the mad-house who opens the Pandora-box of such a jurisdiction . A good deal has been said in dissenting opinions and other papers about exercising this jurisdiction , because the State has consented to be sued . It seems to me such language is loose . How can a Federal court acquire jurisdiction by consent in a case like this ? Suppose the State stood begging at the door to be sued , does not the eleventh amendment say , " The judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit , " etc. ? Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such case , how can consent give jurisdiction ? That the consent was given to suits begun in a State court and removed to a Federal court does not help the matter , for the inhibition extends not only to suits " commenced " but to those " prosecuted " in the Federal court . This language was used advisedly ; it was intended to wither and destroy this branch of Federal jurisdiction entirely . Consent could not give jurisdiction in a case " commenced " or in a case " prosecuted " in a Federal court , for the judicial power there to entertain such cases is no power at all . It has no more power to hear such a cause than it has to impeach the Emperor of Brazil for drunkenness , and if it had power to hear it , there is not sufficient power in all the machinery of Federal judiciary to reach the political agencies which must be moved to pay State debts . The Supreme Court of the United States when it refused to grant the relief prayed for in the Louisiana case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed to a failure of jurisdiction in Federal courts which has been known to exist for nearly a century , and declared , what every student knows , that this exemption on the part of the State from suits // in Federal tribunals is one of the undisputed reserved rights of sovereign States . If it is wrong that such a condition of law should exist , it is a wrong very deliberately committed by the States ; for after the right of suit once existed they took it away . Taking it away , as was done by the eleventh amendment , did not make the clause against laws impairing the obligations of contracts a dead letter ; it only took away jurisdiction in such cases where the State was a party defendant , and left the jurisdiction to invalidate such laws in suits between proper parties . I forbear from citing further authorities , but respectfully submit that the careful study of Supreme Court decisions fails to discover the alleged leaning toward States Rights doctrines . This much is true , however ,  --  that a tribunal essentially Federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other body or officer in any of the departments of Government , has from the beginning oftener pointed out the boundary where Federal power ends and State power begins than any other in our Government . But this is because it has oftener studied and expounded the Constitution , which , the more it is studied , discloses more and more , and often surprisingly , that " immense mass " of sovereignty still remaining in the States , alluded to so often by Chief-Justice Marshall . The Supreme Court of the United States , while it has been always bold and quick and clear to recognize and announce , whenever called upon , essential and inherent powers in the Federal Government to maintain its supremacy , whether that power was derived from the express or implied language of the written Constitution , or from higher law , has nevertheless with steady hand insisted that until the Constitution shall be blotted out , our form of government is duplex , with rights and powers in States which can not be ignored or construed away , unless the language of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To have held this truth steadily in view amid all the disturbing surroundings and all the temptations of power to ignore it ; to have held an oftentimes unwilling people up to its recognition ; to have stood through all these years until the people have been brought back to truth and soberness in their understanding of Federal and State relations ,  - -  is a record which must always redound to the honor , power , and glory of that great tribunal , the Supreme Court .
