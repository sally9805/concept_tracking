txt It was generally assumed when Mr. BECK made his violent assault on the Administration 's policy regarding silver coinage that he would not be answered from the Democratic side of the Senate . But he was answered yesterday , and very effectively , by two Democratic Senators , Mr. MCPHERSON , of New-Jersey , and Mr. GRAY , who holds Mr. BAYARD 'S seat , from Delaware . Both Senators were very earnest , and though neither of them undertook a direct defense of the President , both showed that his policy was demanded by the.interests of the whole country . Mr. MCPHERSON explained from the standpoint of the business men why he regarded the continued coinage of silver dollars , " clipped before they were coined , " as dangerous to the honor , to the prosperity , and to the progress of the American people . It is a simple enough thing to those who have had the opportunity to study the operations of daily business in the great centres . If our commerce were wholly internal it would not make any difference whether we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coin in all parts of the country . But since we have important commerce with Europe , we must buy and sell in Europe in the metal money there accepted , and if we undertake to put out both gold and silver at a ratio which does not correspond to the market value , we shall have to send the gold where it can be used and keep the silver at home , where alone we can use it . Heretofore we have kept our silver dollars at par with gold because their issue has been limited in amount , and the Treasury , by receiving them at par with gold for customs duties , has practically redeemed them in gold . But to do this the . Treasury has been compelled to keep them in its vaults , except as there was a legitimate demand for them . The legitimate demand for them is now satisfied , and if we continue to coin them the Treasury will be forced to pay them out whether the debtors wish them or not . In other words , they will cease to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is at present a little less than 80 per cent . of their face value . The first effect of this , as Mr. MoPHERsoN points out , will be contraction , because gold will be withdrawn fromcirculation , will be sent abroad where it can be used at its full value , or will be hoarded . Then the demand for currency will become so great that Congress will be forced to order a greater coinage , not less than the $48,00.0,000 worth of silver annually , which with silver at the present price will give us $60,000,000 a year steady addition to our currency . If silver falls to 70 , we should have nearly $70,000,000 a year addition . If the coinage should be still further increased , there would be a corresponding inflation . Inflation by depreciated coinage would have precisely the same effect as inflation by depreciated paper had . Prices in the debased coin would be advanced , speculation would be stimulated , credit would be extended , constantly greater amounts of capital would be invested in enterprises where it could not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crisis was reached in 1873 . The first serious attempt to realize on the extravagant ventures fostered by speculation would bring the general blind confidence which is the condition of universal speculation to an end . There would be a collapse of credit . Debts would be called in . Debtors would be unable to pay . Enterprises founded on credit would be ruined . Panic would take the place of expectancy . Business would be cut down and to a great degree arrested . Labor would be thrown out of employment , and all the miseries of a long and difficult period of recovery would follow . This is Mr. MCPHERSON 'S reasoning in substance . It is perfectly sound . There is no more doubt as to the course of events that would follow the uninterrupted coinage of silver than there could be as to the consequences of a repeal of the Resumption act and unlimited issues of irredeemable paper . Mr. GRAY 'S position is much the same . Both agree with the President and the Secretary of the Treasury . Both are pronounced and ardent Democrats . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It seems inevitable , " he declares , " that the representatives of the sovereign people are determined to see their present system of finance die a natural death before they will have recourse to another . " That is also undoubtedly the view at present of the silver men , who are very confident of being able to prevent suspension . Meanwhile , some of the zealous advocates of suspension are finding fault with the President because he has declared that he will leave with Congress the responsibility of its own action and will do nothing to influence it . What could he do unless he caused it to be understood that only the advocates of suspension should receive offices from him  --  a policy he has openly denounced , and which , with him , would be treachery of the most open sort to the principles he regards as vital in the performance of his constitutional duties ? The President is right . Congress must be left to decide its own course , and the people must hold its members to account . If the men who know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the influence that rightfully belongs to them they could stop it . If they will not , they must bear those consequences .
