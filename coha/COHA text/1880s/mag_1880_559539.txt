IT is difficult to account for the lull in the interest which civilservice reform had awakened during the last Presidential canvass , by the mere preoccupation of the country with financial and commercial questions . Nothing less than a tremendous drift in the wrong direction , a settled opinion of the masses that our institutions have a virtue that is independent of good government , and can bear and even profit by negligences and errors that are fatal to monarchies , can account for the indifference of the press , the supercilious contempt of our leading politicians of both parties , the silence and apathy of Congress , and the tentative and inconsistent course of the President and the Cabinet , in regard to civil-service reform , which four years ago was introduced as the chief plank in the platforms of both parties . Its best friends have seemingly thought it incompatible with present success in their general political aims and measures . The two great parties have quietly seen the promises made by the Administration either broken or forgotten , or , where carried out , carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a rule has ridiculed the whole subject as impracticable , visionary , and unsuited to American circumstances ; and it may almost be said that the small class of men who undertook to champion the cause have lost heart , or even hope , of its present practicableness . Persuaded that it is the subject of all others that needs public consideration , and on the proper understanding of whose importance the welfare of our national life depends , we seize the occasion of the recent publication of Mr. D. B. Eaton 's valuable and instructive work on " Civil Service in Great Britain , " to draw attention to the new and strong light which the success of reform in the civil service of the mother-country throws upon the methods needing to be applied to the reformation of the disheartening errors and abuses that mark our American administration of government , owing to the mischievous // influence which the party-spoils principle has obtained in our politics . We do not propose to give even an abstract of Mr. Eaton 's book . It would be almost like giving an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shortest possible full statement of the origin and course , the methods and successes , and the complete victory of civil-service reform in Great Britain . It is the only book in the English language in which this wonderful , encouraging , and most instructive history can be read , and it must be almost as valuable to English statesmen and statists as to Americans , for whose benefit it is written . In our calm judgment , no book since " The Federalist " *L**if De Tocqueville is excepted-contains so much that merits and will finally command national attention-not from any charms of style or ingenuities of argument , or even from the attractions of the theme , but from the plainness , the thoroughness , the vast importance of the facts , and the bearing of the history , so carefully and laboriously unveiled , upon our prospects as a people and the success of our institutions . Mr. Eaton has demonstrated in his book that Great Britain , at the close of the last century , was sinking undj*r a load of patronage in Church and state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usurpations , of favoritism , nepotism , maladministration by unselected and unfit office-holders ; that this deadly system of patronage was so imbedded and immeshed with her aristocratic and hierarchical constitution , so tangled up with her royal usages and traditions , so favored by the Church and the nobles , and so upheld by the court , that the prospect of any reform in it was dark and dreadful beyond anything that ever did or ever could exist in American circumstances . He has shown how a succession of courageous and public-spirited statesmen , without the support of the court , and against the wishes of Parliament , has by a steady appeal to the common people of Great Britain , gradually yet really in a marvelously short time , wrested a reform which is nearly all that can be wished in the civil service of Great Britain and India , from the prejudices , the passions , the personal interests , the party pride , the cupidity of place , and pensions , and sinecures , the nepotism of great office-holders and princes , dukes and earls , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both the great parties , by their leaders , are absolutely at one in excluding the spoils of office from the contests of party ; until public competition for office has become all but universal ; and merit , proved and testedfitne&amp;s , and superiority // in fitness , are the only door by which any office-holder , excepting about fifty heads of departments or bureaus , can now enter any civil office in the British Government . The method of reform has been that of a steady opening , a development of the principle , that the offices of a government , conducted in the real interests of the people , are to be regarded as belonging to those only who , wishing them , can prove themselves best fitted to hold them , and perform the duties of them . By degrees the principle of competition has attained its full development . Any citizen , of proper age and up to a certain standard of elementary education , may offer himself for a competitive examination in which his claims , intellectual , moral , and temperamental-his claims on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as of general and special fitness for the class of clerkships or duties to which he aspires-shall be fairly and impartially considered by a board of commissioners , experts in the business , whose decisions are final , and the integrity , competency , and satisfactoriness of whose judgments are , and for many years have continued to be , unquestioned , who enjoy the utmost confidence of the public and of the Government . Persons proving their claims to be best are appointed to existing vacancies . Once appointed , they are removable only for cause-incompetency , a failure to fulfill their promise , being the best of causes ; they are promoted as opportunity offers and desert is shown ; they are offered increase of salary , according to years in the service , and they are retired at an age when the service is better served by new blood than by old experience , and then on sufficient retiring pensions . Rotation in office is discouraged ; it is not recognized as a principle of good administration , as it absurdly is in America , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officeholders , and not with sole reference to the public good . Everybody may aspire to an office in Great Britain who can prove himself best fitted to fill it , and may go and claim it as his right , and have his right , in that case a just one , admitted . His right is not a right to office because he is a citizen or subject , but because , being such , he shows himself better fitted , than any man that wants it , to occupy it . Many objections have been made in America-they were originally made in England  --  to the scholastic character of the competitive examinations . It was shown , over and over again , how ridiculous the requirements were , the questions asked , the sort of knowledge demanded ; and it was boldly asserted that real practical fitness could neither be determined nor attained by any such method . Mr. // Eaton 's work has exhibited the groundlessness of these objections ; shown their abandonment by old and sincere representatives of them , and the absolute triumph of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil service has improved radically . Not only are a better class of men put into office , but they come more and more from the middle class , and even from what the English call the humbler class ; i. e. , they are not supplied from the gentleman class , or the college-graduate class ; they do more work , and they do it better ; they are paid less , and are content with less , because their places are secure ; they are fewer in number , because there are no sinecures or places for mere hangers-on . Moreover , the knowledge that the humblest born may aspire to occupation in the civil service has greatly raised the standard and improved the method of popular education . The people are freshly interested in educational methods , because they now have a new bearing upon their possible pursuits . Besides this , the discovery that justice prevails in their appointments gives them a new sense of respect for the C-overnment , increases patriotism , and makes the servants of the nation watchful of the honor of their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this country to the civil-service reform has been that party government could not go on without the stimulus of party spoils . This objection , if sound , would be a fatal one . Party is the necessary complement of the representative system . That is founded on the principle that the will of the people is to be expressed in the acts of the Government . This notion is a modern one  --  and by no means self-evident . The old theory and practice in England long was , as in most European countries . " Let wealth and birth or breeding make the laws and govern the country . " This is indeed the only thing that could have been possible in the England of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries . It mattered less-if they only got there , as they somehow did - how the ablest and best men got into Parliament , whether by the patronage of the King or the great nobles , by rotten boroughs , or by buying their places . What was wanted was ability and influence and experience , chiefly to raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the administrative power of the King 's advisers and nearest servants . Parliament itself was only their instrument , and very slowly acquired any independence of its own . But the Commons acquired independence and influence long before it became a highly representative body in our sense of the // word . That is to say , it represented popular rights and commercial and trading interests , in a general way , long before it represented the electors ' or the people 's views of their own interests . Parliament had its own views , and did not consider too much , and only as far as was unavoidable , what views the people had of their own wants-judging itself to be more competent to decide these questions than the people themselves . As long as it is necessary or even possible to carry on government thus , it may be deemed not a bad way . For people are only fit for the liberty they feel the want of , and the willingness to make the sacrifices required to maintain it . Usually the self-government first achieved is less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , than the government of the nobles , the ruling class , the monarch , or military ruler , thrown off to make way for it . But it is rightly preferred , because it satisfies wants and aspirations deeper and nobler than comfort , ease , or security . There can be little question that in America we have comtinually sacrificed substantial interests of order , peace , and governmental facility , to the love of liberty . We have plunged headlong into uni* versal suffrage , and are in the midst of dangers growing out of it that have seriously threatened our very existence . We made four million slaves free men and voters , without stopping to ask what the consequences might be in the Southern States or to the Union ; and we have not yet reached the bottom of the political difficulties in which immediate emancipation involved us . True , upon American principles , it was absolutely necessary to take this step . Publie opinion required it . The same may be said of universal suffrage ; very likely female suffrage will come in under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect to escape from all the consequences of our fundamental idea , which is trust in the people . It is not that the people are wise and sure to go right , but they are to be trusted anyhow , " go as you please " being the general policy . It is right liecause the people wish it so . This is the meaning of the motto most in the mouths of our politicians , " Vbx populi vox Dei . " Whether it be true or not , we are determined to act as if it were true , to test it , and perish if it is not . Party government began in England with the selection and election of members of Parliament to represent convictions , and to press policies entertained by the voters who sent them to their seats . By slow degrees Parliament became a body of representatives in the sense of persons instructed by the voice of their constituents to frame // and favor certain wishes , opinions , and aspirations of the people . But as the people were divided among themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selected cardinal issues-peace or war , retrenchment or expansion , protection or free-trade , extension or repression of suffrage-for their rallying-cries , and so formed Conservative and Liberal , Whig and Tory parties . How could a country usually nearly evenly divided between parties escape the consequences of violent and fatal , conflict , except by encouraging a superstitious or religious respect for the right of the majority , even if it were a majority of one ? To this the highest wisdom of England , and America after her , has come . To make a majority of one just as decisive as a majority of a million has been the main victory of self-government thus far . That is what government by party means , that the government shall be a government not merely injluenced by public opinion-all governments must be  --  but a government that carries out public opinion , expressed through legally elected representatives and by a legal majority , in the laws it makes and the policy it pursues . True , any one may notice how far short of ideal perfection a government is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are absolutely of no effect . It is the chief problem of representative and popular government now to devise some method for the representation of minorities . The only protection now is the check which party majorities always feel in the presence of a minority that may profit by their mistakes to unseat them in the next election . This is a substantial check , yet an insufficient one , but until some better one is found it must be relied on . But what would become of " the machine " if the English method of a civil service , which absolutely removes the spoils of office from all part or importance in the canvass , were followed by the United States ? What , then , is " the machine , " whose safety is so seriously threatened by the success of a civil-service reform , like that which has triumphed in Great Britain ? " The machine " is an organization of parties about the spoils of office . Those who have framed and who control it are not themselves necessarily lacking in sound principles and a high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are however , as they boast , men of affairs and of the world , and they judge that party organization to be effective must be able to interest , move , and win the support of those who are neither capable of disinterested patriotism nor intelligently interested in the questions for which parties stand . There is a cer // tam part , perhaps it is a quarter , of the population of a great country like ours whose opinions and whose judgment in regard to what divides parties are nearly worthless , and are worthless because they represent neither thought nor experience . The hope of office-it is little more than a hope , and a barren one for ninety in a hundred out of those deluded by it - is the main dependence of the machine in both the great parties in this country . Without this , the practical politicians tell us , it is in vain for any party in ordinary times to hope for success , be its principles ever so just and true . The managers kliow perfectly well how little influence the spoils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them knew the smallness of the number who really can receive the appointments which a party success throws open . Probably not one in a hundred , of the men whose party zeal is wholly dependent on their expectation of office , ever attains the office he covets and which he has been assured of . But as Sydney Smith defended the great prizes of the bishoprics in England , as exerting an influence upon the meanest curacy , so the offices in the gift of the successful party that attains to the administration of a great State or of the nation , though they bear no proportion to the number of the eager expectants of them , are yet sufficient to keep enough voters *t close and hard work at the ropes of the machine , and to enable party organizers to say with a good deal of authority , " Take away these spoils-take away from the bureaus or great departments , whose heads are elected in a party contest , the power of rewarding with offices the most diligent and effective hands who have oiled and pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away the only sure means of political success . " There can be little question of the genuineness of the conviction on the part of politicians , and there can be no doubt of the terrible force of the machine as thus run . The only question is , whether its force is not fatal to the interest for which parties and governments exist . Based upon the idea that office is a reward for party services , it strikes a deadly blow at the only notion that can safely obtain about office-i. e. , that it exists not for those who hold it , but for the sake of the nation , and is to be filled only by those best qualified to fill it , not by those who , for the sake of it , have done most to elevate the dispensers of office to their powerful places . Consider the debasing influence on heads of departments and bureaus of feeling that they owe their places to voters who have a right to claim the price of their services ! how can they look mainly at the duties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use and value to the nation of their stations ? The administration becomes corrupt from core to circumference in spite of itself , when every grade of office but the lowest is dependent on the favor or patronage of the grade above it ; when all offices are thus bought , not with direct bribes-that might even be less corrupting , because more open  --  but when a poisonous atmosphere of bribery is created by a tacit understanding that party services , from the Cabinet down , are to have the main consideration in all appointments . The better portion of the people , whose interest and participation in politics it is so important to uphold and increase , has lost its respect for the politicians as a class , because of the machine they chiefly depend on . The interest in politics has become largely an interest of a corner-grocery character , or of betting- and card-rooms , or race-courses and beer-gardens . There the engineers of the machines work for their recruits and the boys who will run with the engine . It has dragged our politics in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until it is an offense in the nostrils of those who love their country disinterestedly . And when decent and honest men complain of the result of machine politics , of the low class of office-holders it promotes , and of the kind of threatening legislation it encourages , they are told : " It is all your own fault . Organization is always effective , and always wins . If you are so torpid , fastidious , or foolish that you will not attend the primaries and get control of the machine , ' be sure it will be run by those who have won the right to run it by giving their time and attention to it . " The employers of this argument know the safety of using it , because they know the people they address it to could not be dragged by oxen to " the primaries " after one or two experiences of what they are . So hopeless has this partisan machinery made the sober and disinterested citizens of the country that they have abandoned all expectations of any reform in the methods of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They see that parties in America are now governed from the bottom , and not from the top , and that , while the bottom governs , it will rule or ruin . There is no possible hope of redemption from our political demoralization-in which as a rule our office-holders are the controlling leaven of evil-except by bringing the force of public opinion to bear upon the Government , outside of parties , and seeking to effect reform from above downward . Public opinion is not made up , like an election return , of votes that each counts one // and one oniy . It is the voice that has the purest tone that goes farthest . Votes do not measure the public opinion of this country . If they did , we might well despair : they settle the legislators , but public opinion has them greatly under control , if it only will exercise its authority . We want a new political machine , the organization of the patriotism and sense of the people , who will act together in an endeavor to extort from every Administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has taken place so beneficially in Great Britain . It is idle to expect any support for this reform from the smaller class of professional politicians of this country . It must be carried against them and in spite of them , as it was in England . They are themselves the very evil to be abated . In most of the States legislative seats as well as administrative offices are in the hands of persons whose personal interests and whose tastes and views are in accordance with the spoils of office . Can we expect legislators who have got their places under this system to make laws to change it radically , nay , to abandon and make it impossible ? The Congress of the United States has refused to make any appropriation for carrying out the plan of civil-service reform which President Grant and President Hayes have both recommended . By the simple refusal or silent agreement not to allow so small an appropriation as twenty-five thousand dollars for the support of the commissioners of examination of candidates for office , Congress baffled the doubtless honest wishes of two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know the importance of this reform , from carrying it out even in the partial manner proposed . Can we expect any support from Congress until the press demands it ? And will the press demand it , until those who support the press are themselves not only willing but anxious and clamorous to have it advocated in the newspapers ? This state of public opinion can only be produced by the union of that portion of the American people , who have for many years ignored politics , about a method of political reform , which can alone give back its lost dignity to politics . They must Qbserve and learn and follow the method by which a much more difficult reform of the same nature was achieved in Great Britain . It was effected by a few true statesmen and patriots , who threw themselves upon the higher intelligence and worth of the country , and , by patient adherence to sound principles of open competition for all offices below the few that give effective expression to that change of policy demanded from a new Cabinet , gradually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and against the whole current of usage and partisanship . The reform began in Great Britain in the bosom of men who knew the distinction between party and partisanship-who believed in the necessity and uses of party government , and wished to make it , as they have done , more effective and stringent than it is in America . They knew that , if principles and policies were to be truly advanced , it must be by organizing parties on some other grounds than the spoils principle , since that throws parties into the control of the sordid and the time-serving . They wished to hold the intelligence and worth of England to the responsibility of selfgovernment . In America we have said to our best people , You are too pure , too wise , too good , too disinterested to know anything about practical politics . Nobody who keeps his conscience in white gloves can be of any service in practical politics ; nobody who aims* at improving political methods can be effective in a primary meeting or a caucus , or a convention for nominating great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who shut their eyes to everything but the interest of the party , take every advantage of their technical rights , can walk on the very verge of the law and . keep their footing , and are obedient to the arrangement made for them by a little knot of secret wire-pullers , whose very names are unknown to their fellow citizens , but who , in a caucus or a convention , turn out to be the powers that rule . The vast political or party importance of ignorant and unprincipled nobodies in our American politics is a gigantic threat of ruin ! It is difficult for honest men of moral and rational habits to understand their position and influence , and it drives them to needless despair of our system . We must break this machine or it will break us ; and the place to break it is by directing all the force of the thoughtful people in the land to the support of our executive officers , the men whom we clothed with responsibility and who ought to be made to govern . Alas ! they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not look to them as we ought nor encourage them as we should to carry out all the measures of right government that are in their direct power . For instance , our Constitution has given the President the nomination of a Cabinet which , though requiring to be approved and confirmed by the Senate , is not responsible to it , except by impeachment , after confirmation . It was designed to make the Executive of the nation independent enough to carry on his own great business by the aid of responsible heads of departments on prin // *iples and after methods that partisan feeling could not disturb . But what a miserable weakening of our Executive and Cabinet has been effected by the corrupting influence of the spoils system upon the Senate , by which the appointments in all departments of the Government are , and have long been , regarded as means of sustaining or rewarding partisan services ; and in consequence of which the heads of departments can not carry out any wise choice in the appointment of their necessary officers , except by the leave and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the efficient working of the department either in their knowledge or view ! It is not too much to say that the jealousy of the Senate in regard to party patronage has been the chief source of the enfeeblement of the executive department of the Government , by fomenting a perpetual irritation between the President and his Cabinet and the Senate of the United States , and that this has rendered the Administration irresolute and inconsistent , and brought the office of the President into disrespect . What is all the recent talk about the need of a strong man-meaning an obstinate and self-willed man-in the Presidential office , but the outgrowth of a feeling that a man who will not overreach his prescribed rights and duties can give only a languid effect to what the Constitution meant to make an independent department ? But it is encroachments on executive powers originally bestowed , encroachments to which party usage has given the only authority they have , that have made the Executive timid and dependent . So long as Congress maintains the spoils system , directly or indirectly , the Executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is weak , men who fear disorder more than they love liberty will be distrustful of our institutions , and ready to hang their hopes of the country on some single man 's gifts or pretensions , and not on the good sense and good faith of the people and the authority of the laws justly enforced . The third-term movement is one of timidity , and is based on the disgraceful hypothesis that the safety of our country depends upon the leadership of some particular individual whose nomination and election would bring one of the few great traditions of the nation into contempt . There is no leading man of either great party who would not be safer ( even if his Administration were unwise and impolitic ) in the Presidential chair than the best man elected on the grounds on which any thirdterm man , though the best in the country , must be elected-namely , that our institutions are so weak in themselves that only a sacrifice of a great tradition of the fathers , hitherto treated as an unwritten // part of the Constitution , can save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more costly sacrifices , in which our freedom would be lost . We do not so much need strong-willed Presidents as a strongwilled people , who will not allow the prerogatives of the Presidency to be encroached upon and whittled away by partisan expediency . Not strong men , but strong laws strongly exacted and strongly administered by Presidents who carefully avoid legislative and judicial acts , but as carefully resist trespassers of the other departments of the Government on executive responsibility . The thoughtful people of the country , who have sunk into silence and apathy in the presence of an imperative but shallow political partisanship that has long had its way , must learn that they have a power in sustaining , by sympathy and intelligent and outspoken approval through the press and in the magazines and pulpits , and on all public occasions where the voice of a wise man reaches far , the acts of those high officials , the President and the heads of departments , when they seek to return to the traditions of the Government in its best and earliest days , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their competency , character , and worth , without regard to partisan considerations . It was only by the support which a few statesmen of both parties gave each other , and by the support which the small class of the best patriots among the electors gave them , that , by degrees , a policy was established in England that gained steadily until it utterly displaced the spoils system and converted Parliament and party to its views . When the people come to understand , as it is in the power of a plain-speaking class of civil-service reformers to enable them to see , that they are cheated out of the only privilege the spoils system promises-that is , " rotation in office , " and an opportunity of freely aspiring to Government employ by the spoils system itself , which confines offices to politicians by trade , a small and vicious class , and locks up patronage in the hands of political Levites ; that the vast majority of those who desire office are not only made helpless by their very worth and their inability to stoop to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the supposed right to office is converted into the right of the fuglemen of trading politicians to be rewarded for their services at the cost of efficiency and integrity in the public service-then we may hope the people will turn against the spoils system as one that fattens upon their plainest rights . It ought to be an honorable ambition , as honorable as the service of the army or navy , to enter the civil service of the country . The army and navy would sink where the civil service has sunk , if it // followed its method , and the civil service would rise to the level of the army and navy service if it followed the method of appointments deemed necessary in both . In a country needing a hundred thousand office-holders , the vocation ought to be as honorable on social grounds as it is desirable on account of its salaries . How can it be made so except by making entrance to it depend upon merit , and merit only , and that merit to be determined by open competition ? Let an examining board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all aspirants to office ( below the few that must be in the free choice of the President , not above fifty ) by rules publicly known and approved , and we should soon have those with a native aptitude for governmental business aspiring to and obtaining these places . The whole disgusting meaning of the word politician as it is now used would lose its offensive tang . The promising youth of the country , born to humble fortunes , would make a governmental career an object of serious ambition and of due preparation . It would not matter how far in the interior and from political centers they lived , nor how little party influence they possessed , if only they had the brains and the training that enabled them to prove their fitness for vacancies in the civil service . They would not be injuring their self-respect and tempting the love of power in others by cringing at the feet of partisans and caucusleaders . They would simply have the honest chance of competing , on the grounds of pure merit , for the places that need competent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its old place as this simple but radical and effective change in substituting open competition for party and personal influence , in all the offices of the State and country below the few highest , which confessedly must be made in accordance with party triumphs expressive of the national preference , and in order to carry out great lines of policy , newly demanded by a national majority ? We have entered into only a few of the questions raised by civilservice reform , being chiefly anxious to win attention to the example of Great Britain . We are well aware that , the better England 's example is , the worse a certain portion of the American people will hate it . It is enough to damage the best counsel with some stupid demagogues , to say that it comes from England . But such fools are below argument , and must be left out of account in this discussion . Meanwhile the example of Great Britain is not forced upon us by her own statesmen . It is simply commended by disinterested American students of her system of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can say nothing , that precludes the necessity of reading Mr. Eaton 's work by those who would fully understand the strength and importance of the lesson it gives . No book so valuable to the American people has appeared in our day . We should be glad to see a vigorous society organized , and with a hundred skillful lecturers in the field , whose sole business it should be to make the people of the country acquainted with the facts set forth in Mr. Eaton 's work . If they were known , they would create an inevitable revolution in our whole political sentiment . They will be known and must be considered , but how soon depends on the zeal of those who have already estimated their value . The civilservice reform is the truest issue before the country . We have had a sham fight over it , but we are preparing for a real battle . It will be in five years the chief issue , and settle , if not the next , then the next but one , Presidential canvass . Meanwhile we must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in civil.service reform . We believe him to be truly in earnest , and doing the best he can . But he has had little support from his Cabinet , and less from Congress . The Secretary of the Interior has perhaps done his best , but he has had a discouraging discountenance from the Senate and from the House . We have had , doubtless under Presidential inspiration , a real civil-service reform going on in the New York Custom-House , and in the New York Post-Office , of a most creditable kind ; but it is local , and carried on by the volunteer labor of heads of the departments who ought not to be charged with it , as it imposes new cares upon those who have already enough to do . We want a universal system , a commission supported by the nation and having for its sole duty to inaugurate and carry out the method of open competition for all governmental offices , not excepted for obvious and defensible reasons .
