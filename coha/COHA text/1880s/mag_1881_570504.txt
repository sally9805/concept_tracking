ARTICLE VI-PREACHING TO THE BOYS AND GIRLS . THE children rule the age . The boys and girls claim more time , money , and care to-day than ever before . The school books and general literature provided for our youth are abundant and costly . The great publishing houses rival each other in their attempt to command the patronage of the young . Si . Nicholas costs the Scribners a fabulous sum , and pays them handsomely , for it meets this spirit of the age* The Harpers have of late been forced to publish a magazine for the young people . No religious paper dares to omit its two or three columns for the children . Men count our Sabbath school children by the millions , and this vast army has leaders , supplies , organization , and drill ample and imposing , and yet the pulpit of America has lost its hold upon the boys and girls . Fewer of them by far , in proportion to the adults of our congregations and population , go to church to-day than attended the ministrations of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the school mistress , the magazine , and the Sunday school teacher , those whom it should and must reach , if the church is to be perpetuated . To see to it that the young habitually attend church , and are met with suitable instruction when they attend , seems to be a matter quite out of the range of ministerial functions . Those who lecture to young men preparing for the ministry ignore this matter . Works upon Homiletics have little to say concerning it , and the boys and girls grow up as best they can , unfed by the hand of the pastors , who ought to heed the divine command : " Feed my lambs . " What is to become of the youth of America , with its present environment , home training , and pastoral care at the minimum point , the school , the magazine , and the street at the maximum , and their souls to be saved ? The public school once was an ally of the church ; the minister had an open field of usefulness within its walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All this has gone by ; in many // portions of the United States the baldest secularism has taken its place ; in a few sections infidelity is taucrht . We can no .1 0 longer regard the public school an ally of the church . Our children may learn to read , write , sew , and , if you please , how to use a plane or trowel , to practice law or medicine , at the expense of the State , but their spiritual life and even their moral training , except as it has to do with the discipline of the school , are more and more ignored . We can not expect to tax our people to train recruits for the kingdom of heaven . The magazines and other youths ' papers are not published to lead our youth into the highest and best manhood . No Christian parent can fail having noticed that they nearly all are becoming each year less instructive , although doubtless more entertaining . With a large number of articles that are valuable , there is a padding of too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and press employ their force , and quite legitimately , in developing the mental powers of our youth , compelled perhaps to ignore the fact that they have souls to save . And here it is that we have summoned the help of the Sabbath school , and have come to throw upon it the duty of training our children for eternity ; and we have seemed to feel that it was adequate to accomplish this vast undertaking . We have expected too much , and we deserve to be disappointed . We have an institution , holding one hour*s session each week , under the guidance of men and women who are willing to take it in charge , but who , from the nature of the case , are rarely if ever examined in respect of their capabilities for the work . The pupils are too infrequently prepared to receive the benefits of instruction by previous study of their lessons . Strict discipline is never expected and would sometimes be resented . And yet we expect a school thus managed to do for the spiritual life of our boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed , while to train their intellects twenty hours each week is given , under the guidance of teachers trained for their work and having , from the nature of the case , ample time to secure the preparation of lessons and authority to maintain discipline , adding to this meanwhile all the effect which the reading of children 's literature can produce . // Certainly if we measure our valuation of our children 's lives by the forces which we employ to mould them , we are either forgetful of their souls or regard the Sabbath school possessed of a miraculous energy , which none of us , in view of the results it has achieved in its century of life , would dare claim for it . That the Sabbath school has done the good it has accomplished , is a source of profound thanksgiving to God , who takes the weak things of this world to confound the mighty , but that it needs to be supplemented by still another weak force , even the foolishness of preaching , seems , in view of the facts before us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and untrue to ignore the fact that many attempts have been made for many years , to give the children and youth their portion of meat in due season in the ministrations of the sanctuary . The numerous editions with which Todd 's Lectures to Children was honored , is evidence among other things that not a few of the Christian ministry would learn from the successful doctor how to preach to the children . Dr. Newton 's valuable contributions to the same class of literature have given him an enviable place among the many who have succeeded in reaching the young from the pulpit . Both of these men , however , and those who have followed in their footsteps , have adopted the plan of setting apart children 's days or appointing special children 's services , some once in a month , others once in three months , and in some instances insisting upon it that the children should sit by themselves , and now and then that there should be no adults in the congregation . Thus , Dr. Todd , in his preface to the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote : " The best way of preaching to children is to have them entfrely alone-not an adult in the house . You can then come down to them and can interest them . The next best way is to have all the children in the center of the house and the congregation above and around them ; and then let the speaker forget , if he can , that anybody is present besides the children . This has been my method , at the close of the second service on the Sabbath : The congregation have had permission to retire , but have , to an individual , preferred to remain . I have usually delivered one of my little sermons once in three months , supposing this to he no more , certainly , than the share of the lambs " // To criticise the methods of one who has achieved the marvelous success won by Todd 's Lectures seems impertinent , and especially when nearly thirty years ago the author of the Preface to the illustrated edition of the first series could say : " This little work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we know not how many in England , after having been translated into French , German , Greek , and many more languages , printed in raised letters for the blind , and last of all having been adopted as a school-book for the liberated slaves at Sierra Leone , js now sent forth in a new dress with the addition of new Lectures . " And yet it is not wholly unkind to infer that one who could do so well might have done better had he been able to have acted upon the principle that God made Sunday come once in seven days for the children as well as for their fathers and mothers . We all go on the principle , that those who are growing , need food quite as frequently as those who have gain*d their growth , and if the fathers and mothers to thrive must have a weekly allowance of spiritual food the children need their nourishment equally often . No beings thrive when fed upon the feast and famine principle , and the fact that our young folks have failed to become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part due to the parallel fact that they can expect only occasional instruction upon the Sabbath . And yet to have preached every Sabbath as long and copiously illustrated sermons to the children as we find in Dr. Todd 's books , would require a larger reservoir of anecdote , and fanciful devices than perhaps even he could have owned , for as he , quoting Cecil , says : " Nothing is easier than to talk to children : but to talk to them as they ought to be talked to , is the very last effort of ability . A man must have a vigorous imagination . He must have extensive knowledge to call in illustration from the four corners of the earth ; for he will make but little progress , but by illustration . It requires great genius , to throw the mind into the habits of children 's minds . II aim at this , but I find it the utmost effort of ability . No sermon ever put my mind half so much on the stretch . I am surprised at nothing which Dr. Watts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have written as well as he in other // 251 works ; but how he wrote these hymns I know not . " The same criticism could be passed upon Dr. Newton 's sermons , and few are the ministers who could preach every Sabbath to the adult congregations were they as lavish of their resources as Dr. Newton 's published discourses declare him to be when preaching to the children of his fortunate Church . Other attempts to reach the youth , happily now out of vogue , have been made by the professional children 's talker . The men who pick up everywhere stories long and short and stringing them together upon an invisible thread amuse the little ones who constantly fed upon such confectionary lose all relish for healthful food . These men in the short period that their services were in demand , made apparent the fact that there was need of reaching the youth and at the same time that they could only fail of meeting the need , and the superintendents of Sabbath schools , in which department of church life they put forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pious " tramps . " Others have tried to reach the end in view , to be helpful to the boys and girls , in varied ways which need not be recounted , for enough has been presented to disclose the fact , that the Church and ministry have not been blind to the needs of the youth . But it is not until quite recently that an attempt has been made upon the part of any considerable number of the clergymen of America to give every Sabbath a sermon to the boys and girls . The underlying thought in this new method is that the children should be preached to . The Church can not afford to leave unused the divine instrumentality , the preaching of the Word . It is as true to-day as it was in Paul 's time , for after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God , it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe . Preaching as we all know is something other than teaching , and greatly as any may be benefited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are wiser than God if we imagine that in securing the best results , in securing all that is comprised in complete salvation we can forego preaching to the young . The sermon implies the man , with God 's word in his hand , with the love of souls , using all legiti // mate methods of speech to reach his hearers . It has , if rightly constructed a beginning , a middle , and an end logically connected . With many points in common with an oration , an essay , a poem , and sometimes a story , it differs from each and all in that it is the utterance of a human being who stands before his fellows with a message from God which he would make them hear and heed . It may be said that there is no need of any new methods here , that a sermon is a failure that does not reach all the congregation , young and old , learned and unlearned . " Jesus ' sermon , " says the objector , " must have interested the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard it or have read it . The only other sermons which God saw fit to have printed in the Bible are as well adapted to interest children as their seniors . " This is all quite true , but judged by this standard nine out of every ten sermons preached now-a-days are failures . As men have come to regard sermons , very few have the genius to meet the needs of the entire congregation in a single discourse . To be sure , a minister may rely on his thought to reach the intelligent , on his flowers of rhetoric to delight the superficial , on his stories to please the children , and on his action to arouse the dull and at the same time animate the youth of his congregation . But as a matter of fact he will find that while he is developing his thought which is to hold the thinking men , the children will have become tired of waiting for their anecdote , and will need to be aroused by their seniors to get in readiness to hear it ; and if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children , the thoughtful man becomes impatient , and all the while the superficial members of the congregation say to themselves : " I do wish our pastor would keep such milk for babes out of the bill of fare that he offers * In this view of the case , the average minister has come to despair of reaching the young in his ordinary sermons . When he prepares his discourses arid when he preaches them , he has in mind the adult members of the congregation , and too often a select few among these . The choice spirits , also , by their appreciative attention each Sabbath , are his constant inspiration . Hence it has come to pass that with the sermons doctrinal , // ethical , philosophical , philological , etc. , such as our choice hearers enjoy , Christianity is administered to the few , and those children whose parents wisely think that the whole household should worship God together in His house on His day , are forced to endure that which their parents would themselves be unwilling to pass through . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrange the service of God 's house that the young can know that the pastor had them in mind when he was preparing the food for his flock . This can be done by preaching a short sermon to the children separate from the general sermon . The adult portion of the congregation , it has been found upon trial , are quite willing to have a few moments thus devoted to the little ones , and the boys and girls having been fed can and do sit quietly during the remainder of the service . Having been fed , they have a tranquility of mind that makes the discourse that follows quite endurable ; while , as a matter of fact , any man who prepares a sermon each week for the youth , will unavoidably obtain a simplicity of utterance and picturesqueness of style that will , while not harming his sermon for the thoughtful , make some portions of it at least intelligible to the young , many of whom as the years go by will have been so trained in sermon hearing , that they will become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sermons , coming every Sabbath , should be of such a character as to edify rather than to amuse or entertain the children . It is an insult to the boys and girls to treat them as though they were unable to think upon grave truths . And it is a truth hardly worth being developed which does not in some of its relations or bearings have a child 's side to it . Hence it is found that there is not the slightest occasion to mar the unity of a service by preaching a sermon to the boys and girls before the main discourse , and if , as is the practice of some who have adopted this new method , a hymn which old and young can sing is introduced between the two discourses , the congregation receive the main sermon with some such relish as we partake of the second course at dinner after an appropriate entree . Very often , moreover , it will be found that the matter which ordinarily constitutes the introduction , of a sermon , can be // brought out in the discourse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he begins his main sermon , enter at once upon the theme of the day . Nothing has been more surprising in the use of this method for a term of years , than the amazing many-sidedness of truth , if only we are content to use it in its right relations , and not attempt to see all sides at once and in precisely the same light . And while often much is gained by the use of different texts for the two discourses , and sometimes in treating of different subjects , it is never necessary to choose a theme out of hai -- mony with the thought of the main discourse , in order to find a thought which the youth can grasp . There are lower branches which they can touch of the loftiest truths which the greatest minds climb to reach . There are , I am aware , certain matters of interest to the young which do not need to be often brought forward in our preaching to their fathers and mothers , the lessons of the seasons , the teachings of anniversary days , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the harmony of a service , from the fact that the logic of surrounding circumstances is quite as keenly felt as that logic which would make the invocation the alpha , and the benediction the omega of a stately sequential service . An incidental advantage gained by this method is that it enables the minister to reach a large number in his congregation who , although men in years , are but children in spiritual attainments . These " grown persons " quite likely would consider it an insult for their minister to deliberately present to them the truth in the only form in which they can appreciate it . But if this truth is served to the children in their presence , nothing hinders their sharing it and being nourished by it . Many a church member is lost in the higher mathematics of his minister 's discourse , because he has never mastered the principles of arithmetic which the children are learning , while very few are the Christians , however far along they may be in the sciences of the kingdom , who have lost their relish for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefer to have it under . stood that no one should intimate that they have need of such a review . // But a still greater advantage inseparable from this new method , is in the fact that it keeps those who employ it from growing old . It does not seem possible that any man can age very rapidly , mentally , who every week has felt the life of the growing boys and girls . To preach to them so as to do them good , he must enter into all their fresh views of life , and there is nothing in the Adirondacks or the Rocky Mountains that can , for a few weeks in summer , bring back the life to a jejune spirit in comparison with contact with the overflowing vigor and spirit of the boys and girls every month in the year . But all this implies work . Those who have preached to the boys and girls a seven-minute sermon every Sunday for a period of years , have found that the mental force required to do it is not at all in proportion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It requires a vigor of mind which can be dispensed with in many sermons that will edify the general congregation ; and he has greater facility than most men possess who can secure his boys ' and girls ' sermon without a day 's work-all that he can do in a day . It is a costly enterprise , this trying to meet the demands of the young , but none too dear if only we are able to do it . One-sixth of our working time , and oneeighth of our Sunday sermons are none too much to employ in reaching the third of our parish , which is found between the ages of seven and seventeen , and especially when we recall the fact that at least a third between the ages of seventeen and seVenty , will profit more by the labor which I am advocating , than by the sermons which seem to us more worthy of us and have a larger name . It is not necessary to parade statistics , which shall tell us how many persons become Christians before they reach the age of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minds are more easily moulded and at a more important period of human existence than those which are in the very beginnings of their mental and moral life . If it would not open too broad a discussion , it might be profitable to consider the relation of this new method of work to the Christian nurture which once received more attention than it has for some years past , but which to-day is becoming more a vital question , and is to be the vital question of the near future , But -I forbear . It is enough to // rejoice that when , in following the footsteps of the Master , we care for the sick , comfort the sorrowing , clamber the heights of devotion , and walk through the Gethsemane of grief ; after we have preached to the poor and have guided the learned , we can , like Him , turn to the choicest duty of all as we say : " Suffer the little ones to come , for of such is the kingdom of heaven .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
