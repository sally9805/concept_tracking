THE 29th day of May , 1865 , President Johnson issued a proclamation for the reorganization of the State of North Carolina . By that proclamation William W. ilolden was appointed provisional governor , and it was made his duty at the earliest practicable period to prescribe such rules and regulations as might be necessary and proper for the election of delegates to a convention that should be competent to alter or amend the constitution of the State , and to do whatever might be necessary to enable the loyal citizens to restore the State to its constitutional relations to the Federal Government , and to present such a Republican form of State government as would entitle the State to the guarantee of the United States . The voters were required to take and subscribe the oath prescribed by the proclamation of amnesty of the same date . The officers of the army and the navy were required to aid the governor in the performance of the duty imposed upon him . The proclamation assumed that the work of reconstruction was in the hands of the President alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was possible for the President to complete the work of reconstruction before the judgment of Congress or of the country could be obtained . After an examination of the document , my apprehensions were such that I made a visit to Washington for the purpose of conferring with the President , and of offering such suggestions as then occurred to me , and which I hoped might change his policy . At the interview I stated my objections to the proclamation . He said in reply that the step was experimental ; that North Carolina was his native State ; and that he had a wish to see the State restored to the Union at an early moment . At the end he assured me that no other State would be reorganized until the experiment in North Carolina had been tested . Upon this assurance I was in a degree satisfied , saying , however , as I was leaving , that a continuance of the policy would end in the division of the Republican Party . // I did not then realize that my closing observation was an encouragement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was protesting . This was afterward made to appear by the testimony of the Hon. Stanley Matthews . The first day of July , 1867 , Stanley Matthews , now a judge of the Supreme Court of the United States , was examined by the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives . As a part of his testimony he said : " I had an interview with Mr. Johnson in February , 1865 , at the Burnett House , in Cincinnati , where he was stopping on his way to Washington to be inaugurated as Vice-President . I called upon him , having been one of the electors of President and Vice-President , to pay my respects to him , and I had some conversation with him at that time upon public affairs . The earlier part of the conversation had reference to some personal matters growing out of our relations when I was in Nashville as provost-marshal . After they had been disposed of in conversation , I inquired as to the state of public feeling on political matters in Tennessee at that time . He remarked that very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that many of those who at first were the best Union men bad turned to be the worst rebels , and that many of those who had originally been the worst rebels were now the best Union men . I expressed surprise and regret at what he said in reference to the matter . We were sitting near each other on the sofa . He then turned to me and said : You and I were old Democrats . ' I said Yes . ' He then said : I will tell you what it is , if the country is ever to be saved , it is to be done through the old Democratic Party . ' I do not know whether I made any reply to that , or , if I did , what it was ; and immediately afterward I took my leave . " ( " Impeachment Investigation , " p. 781 . ) This avowal by Mr. Johnson is the key to the whole of his subsequent political career . Although he had been appointed military governor of Tennessee by a Republican President , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take the second highest office in the nation at the hands of the Republican Party , he had no hope for the salvation of the country except by the agency of the old Democratic Party . That avowal explains the proclamation of the 29th of May , for the reorganization of the State of North Carolina , which opened the way for the return of the old Democratic Party to power in the // government of the United States . It explains the proclamation of the 13th of June , 1865 , for the reorganization of the State of Mississippi-a State which had no claim to special consideration at the hands of the Republican Party , of which Mr. Johnson was then the recognized head . It explains the several proclamations , all hearing date as early as July 13 , 1865 , by which provisional governors were appointed for Georgia , for Texas , for Alabama , for South Carolina , for Florida ; and authority was given for the erection of a State government in each . It explains also the unnecessary declaration in the proclamation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently in rebellion were still States of the American Union , and by the Constitution and laws of the United States were " made equals , and placed upon a like footing as to political rights , immunities , dignity , and power , with the several States with which they are united . " It explains his separation from the Republican Party , which then , indeed , he had in opinion , and probably in purpose , abandoned , and at a moment when no controversy with its leaders had arisen , and at a moment when he was accepting its highest honors . The avowal made to Judge Matthews casts reasonable doubt upon the sincerity of all Mr. Johnson 's subsequent declarations in which he denounced traitors and treason as odious , and it prepares the ordinary human mind to accept as truthful the statements attributed to General Grant , touching the events and incidents of his relations to President Johnson in the autumn of 1866 . Upon my arrival in Washington to attend the session of Congress which began December 3 , 1866 , I received a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the War Department at the earliest moment possible . I called without delay . He directed me to his private room , where he soon joined me . Without preface he said : " I am more concerned for the fate of the country than I was at any time during the war . " His exact words further I can not recall , but he gave me to understand that the President had issued orders to officers of the army , of which neither he nor General Grant had knowledge , and that there was danger that General Grant would be sent away from Washington . He spoke of an article I had published in the October number of the " Atlantic Monthly , " and said that it had disturbed the President , but that the scheme for the reorganization of Congress was // not abandoned . He did not allude to the attempt to send General Grant to Mexico , nor did he refer to General Sherman , unless the remark about orders related to the order to Sherman to report in Washington . At the request of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what afterwar4 became the second section of the Army Appropriation Act , approved March 2 , 1867 . In that section it was provided that the head-quarters of the General of the Army should be at the city of Washington , and that he should not be detailed for service elsewhere except at his own request or by the previous approval of the Senate ; that all orders and instructions relating to military operations issued by the President or Secretary of War should be issued through the General of the Army , or in case of his disability , through the officer next in command ; and , finally , that all orders issued in any other manner should be null aud void , and that the officer issuing such orders , and all officers who might obey them , knowing that they had been issued in any other manner , should be alike guilty of a misdemeanor . I submitted a fair copy of this paper to Mr. Stevens , then Chairman of the Committee on Appropriations , and repeated to him in substance the conversation that I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the constitutional questions that occurred to us , and also upon the mode of proceeding , whether by a separate bill or by its incorporation as a section in the Army Appropriation Bill . The provision was inserted in the Army Bill , and in that bill it passed the House after some debate which did not relate directly to the merits of the measure . I took the precaution to communicate to Mr. Fessenden , then the Chairman of the Committee on Finance of the Senate , the substance of my conversation with Mr. Stanton . The debate in the Senate was limited to amendments proposed which did not extend to the merits of the bill . Mr. Stevens reported the Army Appropriation Bill the 5th day of February , and at that time , if not at an earlier date , President Johnson had knowledge of the purpose to limit his authority as commander of the army , and he could not have been ignorant of the events in which the purpose originated . At that time I had not had any conversations with General Grant touching his relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President , I had many conversations with him , and , as he detailed his interviews with President Johnson , I was able to understand the causes which induced Mr. Stanton to advise and urge the passage of the act of March 2 , 1867 . General Grant 's statement to me was this : That on an occasion , which I understood to have been in the year 1866 , summer or early autumn , Johnson said to him , " If I should have trouble with Congress , which side should you support ? " to which Grant said , That would depend upon which side the law was. ** President Johnson may have interpreted this remark as equivalent to a declaration by the General of the Army that he should support the Congress composed of members from the loyal States exclusively , until governments should have been organized in the South in conformity to acts passed by the Congress composed only of men from the loyal States . It was in fact , however , a declaration that he should obey the laws and Constitution of the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is fully proved by his testimony taken by the Judiciary Committee . Speaking of the North Carolina proclamation , and giving his opinion of it at the time it was issued , he said : " I looked upon it simply as a temporary measure , to establish a sort of government until Congress should meet and settle the whole question . " ( " Impeachment Investigation , " p. 834 . ) General Grant was not ignorant of President Johnson 's opinions concerning the legality of the 39th Congress . In his testimony ( p. 832 ) he said , speaking of Johnson , " I have heard him say  --  and I think I have heard him say it twice in his speechesthat if the North carried the elections by members enough to give them , with the Southern members , a majority , why would they not be the Congress of the United States ? I have heard him say that several times . . . . I mean , if the North carried enough members in favor of the admission of the South . " There can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious and persistent attempt , in the autumn of 1866 , to send General Grant to Mexico ; and it is equally certain that the most thorough knowledge of our relations with that country fails to disclose any sufficient and honorable reason for the undertaking . After the election of General Grant to the Presidency , he gave me an account of his interviews with President Johnson , in reference // to the project of sending the General to Mexico in the autumn of 1866 . It was , in substance , this : " At a casual meeting the President said , I may have occasion to ask you to go to Mexico . ' I said , in reply , I am so situated that it will not be convenient for me to leave . ' Not many days after this conversation the President sent for me to come to his office . Upon my arrival I found Mr. Seward and the President . Mr. Seward opened his portfolio , and read a long paper addressed to me , and containing instructions for my guidance in Mexico . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end he came out at the same hole he went in at . When Mr. Seward had concluded , I said to the President , You know I told you that it would not be convenient for me to go to Mexico . ' The President then began to argue with me , and to urge . I as steadily resisted his arguments . The President grew warm ; and finally , rising from his chair and striking his table violently with his fist , he said , I would like to know if there is an officer of the army who will not obey my orders ! ' I rose , took my hat in my hand , and said , I am an officer of the army , but I am a citizen also . The service you ask me to perform is a civil service , and , as a citizen , I may accept it or decline it , and I decline it . ' I then left the room . " The distinction thus made by General Grant left to the President authority to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the United States that the President might select , and hence the solicitude of Mr. Stanton for the passage of the section in the Army Bill of the 2d of March , 1867 . Certain facts in Mr. Johnson 's career are established upon proofs that would be satisfactory to judges and juries when dealing with the ordinary affairs of men . ( 1 . ) The attempt to destroy the Union having been overcome , Mr. Johnson did not sympathize with the leaders of the Republican Party nor believe in its principles . ( 2 . ) He entertained the opinion , common to the Democratic Party , that , upon the suppression of the rebellion , the States that had been engaged in it were still States of the American Union ; and , as such States , that they were entitled , through the agency of the loyal citizens in each , to immediate and unconditional representation in the Congress of the United States . ( 3 . ) Consequently , he entertained the opinion that the 39th // and 40th Congresses were illegal assemblages , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were voidable. ( 4 . ) As set forth in his avowal to Judge Matthews , he was a believer in the policy of " the old Democratic Party ; " consequently , when the war was ended and the attempt to destroy the Union had failed , there was no obstacle of opinion or of policy separating , or tending to separate , Mr. Johnson from " the old Democratic Party . " If it be assumed that these propositions concerning the opinion of Mr. Johnson are established by trustworthy evidence , we shall then , consequently , find him in such a state of mind in the year 1865 , that he might have justified himself to himself in the adoption of the policy which he attempted in regard to the reconstruction of the Union . General Grant was then in command of the army , with his head-quarters in Washington . He was then fresh from a series of victories covering a period of three years , and never marred by a single defeat . A million men had recognized him as their leader and chief . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The IRepublican Party , with few exceptions , supported the policy of Congress . Any attempt to resist or reverse that policy must end in a disastrous failure , unless General Grant could be conciliated or exiled . There can be no reasonable doubt that President Johnson attempted first to reconcile General Grant to his policy , and , failing in that , he then attempted to send him out of the country . We are not left in doubt as to Mr. Johnson 's opinions upon the questions in controversy in 1865 and 1866 ; but whether he had a fixed resolution as to his own conduct in the premises is not so clear . In his opinions he was ' fixed to obstinacy ; but his actions were often spasmodic and erratic . In many forms of speech he asserted the rights of senators and representatives chosen in the rebel States under the provisional governments which he had set up ; but it is not clear that he had a fixed and continuing resolution to recognize a Congress composed of those senators and representatives combined with duly elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defend such a Congress by force . The project , however , must have been in his mind , and there may have been moments // when he entertained the thought of attempting its execution . With Mr. Johnson , conrage was a passion and not a habit of life . Hence he was likely to form resolutions which he had no continning ability to execute . There is a chapter in Mr. Johnson 's history remote from the subject of this inquiry at the beginning , but which at the end may have had a relation to the project for the reorganization of Congress . In 1862 , Mr. Johnson was military governor of Tennessee , and J. S. Fowler , afterward a Senator from the State of Tennessee , held the office of comptroller . During the summer of that year General Buell was forced back upon Louisville , and all regular communication between Nashville and the Ohio River was interrupted . There were troops at Nashville who had not been paid . Many of them were from the vicinity of Nashville , and their families were in want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Johnson and Mr. Fowler went to the Planters ' Bank and the Union Bank , and obtained a loan of forty thousand dollars , twenty thousand from each , for which they signed two notes , or drafts , of twenty thousand dollars each . The money of these banks was then at twenty or twenty-five per cent . disconnt . Of the sum so obtained , about thirty-four thousand dollars were paid ont at par to the soldiers , and upon the usual pay-rolls . The remainder was used in the hospitals . When communications were opened , the pay-rolls were sent to Washington , and in due time Mr. Johnson received a draft for the payments that had been made to the soldiers . Mr. Fowler was reimbursed for the hospital expenditures , and that money he placed in Mr. Johnson 's hands . The government was then receiving money on deposit and allowing interest at the rate of six per cent . per annum . At the request of Mr. Johnson , Mr. Fowler took the money to Cincinnati , deposited it in the United States depository @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all in the name of Mr. Johnson . Mr. Fowler said : " Then of course he was to meet those notes . I was very much pressed afterward to pay the notes , and annoyed in reference to them . I presented the matter to Governor Johnson after he became acting President of the United States , and what was done in regard to it I do not know personally . The last time I called his attention to it he remarked , Let them call on me , and I will attend to it , ' // THE NORTH AMERICAN REViEW . or words to that effect . " ( " Impeachment Investigation , " p. 176 . ) The Planters ' Bank failed , was put into the hands of receivers , and a Mr. Michael Burns , a friend of President Johnson , was designated as agent , with authority to arrange for the payment of the notes . Mr. Burns was examined in February , 1867 . He stated that he had an interview with the President in the preceding November . At that interview @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes arranged ; that he did not get much value from them ; that he paid the money to the troops and got a good deal of cursing because it was a depreciated currency . ( " Impeachment Investigation , " p. 164 . ) The statement of Burns was this " After he became President the parties became clamorous for their money . He said he thought they should not demand the money from him in full . He then asked them to compromise it , and he thought they ought to take $10,000 each . The banks sent on a Mr. White to arrange the matter . Mr. White returned with an offer from the President of $10,000 each . I told the President , when he mentioned the matter to me in the latter part of 1866 , that I thought the banks would not take that offer , and that he should offer more . I telegraphed early in January , 1867 , to him , that the Union Bank claim could be settled for $15,000 . He acceded to this proposition . . . . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not take less than $16,250 . I got fretted about it , and in order to be rid of it , having told him I could settle it for $15,000 , I gave a check on my own private account in the bank for the $1,250 . . . The claim of the Planters ' Bank had been previously paid by him . " They took $14,600 . The reason he claimed a compromise *ras that when he got the money the currency of the bank was about twenty per cent . below par . " ( " Impeachment Investigation , " p. 1147 . ) " The money paid to the Planters ' Bank was the proceeds of twenty Tennessee bonds , then worth about seventy-two or seventythree per cent . of their par . " ( " impeachment Investigation , " p. 1148 . ) President Johnson kept an account with the First National Bank , Washington . The cashier , W. S. Huntington , was examined by the Judiciary Committee , March 30 , 1867 . When that account was opened he placed in the bank certificates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Cincinnati , to the amount , as Mr. Huntington thought , of $50 , 000 . These certificates were collected by the bank , and $48,000 of the proceeds were invested in United States seven-thirty bonds . The bonds were of the par value of $50 , 000 , as their market value was then less than par . An additional purchase of bonds to the amount of $10,000 was subsequently made . Finally , all these bonds were sold , and the proceeds , amounting to $64 , 947 , were placed to Mr. Johnson 's credit under date of December 15 , 1866 . ( " Impeachment Investigation , " p. 181 . ) The balance to the credit of President Johnson , at the First National Bank , March 28 , 1867 , was $57,302.27 , showing that the sale of the seven-thirty bonds had not been for the purpose of changing the investment . Mr. Huntington testified that he made a suggestion to the President " that he had better sell them , as the price was pretty good . " This chapter in Mr. Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bonds was due to any plan or purpose that might disturb the credit of the country , or lead him to the thought that it might be convenient to have at command a considerable sum of ready money . It is a legal conclusion from the evidence that the transaction was a financial one , solely ; but the circumstances , that the sale was made in December , 1866 , and that the money lay in bank unused for more than a hundred days , may lead some minds to an opposite conclusion .
