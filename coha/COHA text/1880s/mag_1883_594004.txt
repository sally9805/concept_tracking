NEARLY all the petroleum that goes into the world 's commerce is produced in a district of country about a hundred and fifty miles long , with a varying breadth of from one to twenty miles , lying mainly in the State of Pennsylvania , but lapping over a little on its northern edge into the State of New York . This region yielded , in i88i , 26,950,813 barrels , and in 1882 , 31,398,750 barrels . A little petroleum is obtained in West Virginia , a little at various isolated points in Ohio , and a little in the Canadian province of Ontario . There is also small field in Germany , a larger one , scantily developed , in Southern Russia , and one still larger , perhaps , in India . The total production of all the fields , outside of the region here described , is but a small fraction in the general account , however , and has scarcely an appreciable influence upon the market . Furthermore , the oil of these minor fields , whether in America or the Old World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the great Pennsylvania reservoir holds out , can only supply a local demand in the vicinity of the wells . The petroleum region of Pennsylvania and New York is a hilly or mountainous country , covered largely by forest growth and drained by the Allegheny River or its tributaries . It must not be supposed that the oil-bearing sandstone stratum underlies all this region . It is found only in spots , patches , and belts , and there are no surface indications to show where it can successfully be sought . The entire productive territory covers an area of only i8o ,  - -  000 acres . The outlines of a producing district are established only by experiment , and new districts are discovered by wasting large sums of money on " dry holes . " When once a new " pool , " or belt of producing territory , is found , the wells multiply rapidly on all sides of the pioneer well until the limits are found . When a dry well demonstrates that the edge has been reached in one direction , no more are bored so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After the territory is outlined , it is tolerably safe to bore within it , though there will be important differences in the yield of wells close together , and as the number increases the average yield will diminish . A glance at the accompanying map will show the shape and extent of the different producing fields . The first to be developed was the Oil Creek field , with the outlying pools of Pithole and Pleasantville and the little belt near Tidioute . Next in order came the Butler , Clarion , and Warren fields ; then the great Bradford field , the Allegheny field , then the phenomenal and disastrous Cherry Grove field ; and , last of all , a little pool lying in the extreme southern end of the region and called Bald Ridge . It will thus be seen that production , beginning in the center of the now known region , has been pushed north-east and south-west , constantly opening new fields of greater or less extent , but never going very far off a diagonal line on the map . Oil men talk a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that any future discoveries of producing territory will be found either on an extension of that line or in the gaps that now exist in it . The older districts are now nearly exhausted . A little oil is got in them by pumping ; but more than nine-tenths of the wells that used to flow abundantly are now abandoned , and only the blackened and rotting derricks mark their location . Towns in these districts which once counted their inhabitants by thousands , and were busy marts of trade and speculation , have absolutely perished and disappeared from the face of the earth , leaving scarce a vestige behind .

In speaking of the different producing districts , I have not mentioned that surrounding the town of Franklin . Its product is a heavy oil , used in its natural state for lubricating purposes , and worth five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only a small quantity is obtained , and the article is as distinct from the general product of the region as though it were lard oil or sperm oil . A few barrels of this thick oil are also obtained from wells at Mecca , in Trumbull County , Ohio , and a few in Illinois . On Oil Creek , the first wells struck the oilbearing sandstone at a depth of 6oo feet . In the Butler and Clarion fields the wells are about 1400 feet deep , in the Bradford field from iioo to 2000 feet , in the Allegheny field from 900 to 1400 feet , and in Cherry Grove i6oo feet . The variation of depth in the same field is caused by the hills . The oil stratum lies on a level , and a well sunk on a hill-side or a hill-top must go down as much deeper than a well in a valley as its mouth is elevated above the valley . In the early days of the oil business , all wells were sunk in valleys ; but , after awhile , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the slopes and summits of the neighboring hills , and a matter of three or four hundred feet more drilling was not important . The oil sand-stratum varies in thickness from five to thirty feet . It is thickest in the Bradford field . There it is dark colored and fine-grained ; elsewhere it is of lighter color and more porous . There are no streams or ponds of petroleum in the earth , as was once supposed . The sandstone is saturated with the oil , and a strong pressure of gas forces the fluid through the porous rock and up to the surface when a hole is drilled down to it . After the gas pressure is relieved , a well is pumped , sometimes for a few weeks only , sometimes for years . Some wells flow intermittently , from periodical accumulations of gas ; some continuously until exhausted . Some will yield only a barrel a day ; some have been known to spurt three // 3oth , 1859 , when Colonel E. L. Drake struck oil on the Drake farm on Oil Creek . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the surface of the creek and oozed from crevices in the rock could be found in large quantities by sinking wells . This fluid had long been sold by a patent medicine company , under the name of Seneca Oil , as a remedy for rheumatism . Its curative virtues were known to the Indians at an early day , and they used to gather it by stretching their blankets on the surface of the water and then wringing out the oil absorbed in the fabric . It was the patent medicine company that furnished Drake with the money to bore the first well , the motive being to procure a larger and more trustworthy supply of the liniment for rheumatism . No one dreamed at the time that the medicine compounded by nature in the boWels of the earth would , in a few years , become the cheap and popular light of the whole civilized world . Yet the value of rock oil for illuminating purposes was known long before . In the " An ' *erican Journal of Sciences " for 1826 there is a letter from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of petroleum on the Muskingum River , near Marietta , Ohio , by a man who sunk a well for salt water . The searcher for brine put down a hole four hundred feet , and , instead of salt water , it " discharged vast quantities of petroleum or , as it is vulgarly called , Seneca Oil . " Dr. Hildreth speaks of powerful explosions of gas from the well , and goes on to say that " the petroleum affords considerable profit , and is beginning to be in demand for lamps thousand barrels within the first twenty-four hours after the drill struck the oil sandstone . Of all forms of property , an oil well is about the most uncertain . No one can predict how much it is going to yield or how long its life will be . Thus the whole business of petroleum production has always rested , and must always rest , upon a basis of speculation far more venturesome and less stable than is known in the production of any other important commodity . Boring for petroleum is less than a quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in workshops and factories , " and that " it gives a clear , brisk light , and will be a valuable article for lighting the street lamps in the future cities of Ohio . " Probably the well on the Muskingum soon ceased to flow . The tradition of it remained , however , and after the Oil Creek discoveries , new wells were sunk near its site which produced and , I believe , still produce a few barrels each per day . The new light soon found favor in the United States . In 1859 , Colonel Drake 's well produced about 2000 barrels of oil ; in i86o , new wells brought the total yield up to 500 , ooo barrels ; in r86i , it was 2,113,609 barrels , and in 1862 , 3,056,690 . Inventions speedily produced improved lamps to burn the new fluid , and refiners succeeded better and better from year to year in taking out the substances that clogged the wicks and made the lamps smoke . The " coal oil , " as it was then generally called , taking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not compare in purity and light-giving quality with the refined oil of the present day ; but it was cheaper and better than any lamp oil then in use . In fact , it supplied an urgent demand of the whole world for " more light . " The whale had almost been exterminated , and sperm oil was so dear as to be out of the reach of the poorer classes . Candles made of tallow were the common light of people living outside of cities where gas was provided . They were costly in proportion to the light they gave , and it was a poor light at best that could be got from them by frequent snuffing . A fluid called " camphene " was made from turpentine , which was a slight improvement on the tallow dip . Later , an oil was made from bituminous coal in considerable quantities . Poor people could not afford sufficient light to read by of evenings . A few flickering candles were all that the economy of the ordinary class of farm-houses allowed . Who can estimate the value of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done in twenty-three years for intelligence , culture , and the household virtues ? It has made the evenings bright and cheerful in millions of homes . The luminous lamp invites to study and reading , to social games and music , to good conversation , to wit and merriment . In a word , it is a powerful force in the advancement of civilization , - a force which the social scientists , who have so much to say about railroads and electricity , rarely take into their account of the world 's progress . The production of crude petroleum fell off in 1863 , 1864 , and 1865 ; but the discovery of the new Tidioute district and of the famous flowing wells of Pithole brought it up , in i866 , to 3,887,700 barrels . The Butler and Clarion counties fields , and fresh discoveries in Venango County , ran the production up steadily during the following years , until it reached 10,809,852 barrels in 1874 . Then came two years of decline , the older wells giving out and the newer ones yielding less and less . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development proceeded so rapidly , and it proved to be of so great extent , that , in i88o , its yield was double that of all other fields in 1874 , and about six times as great as all others at that time . Of the 26,000,000 of barrels produced in i88o , over 22,000,000 came from the Bradford district . The Allegheny district was opened in i88i , and now ranks next to Bradford ; and the phenomenal Cherry Grove field in Warren County had its rise and fall in 1882 . A number of small districts , or pools , in Warren , McKean , and Venango counties were opened between 1875 and i88i . For sudden and enormous effect upon values , the Cherry Grove excitement of last summer was without parallel in the history of the petroleum trade . It surpassed the famous Pithole furore of i86* . Cherry Grove is a wilderness township of Warren County , which , prior to last May , was almost uninhabited , its population consisting of half a dozen farmers and a few tan-bark cutters . On election night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly how the township would vote , and did not need to wait for the returns from that quarter when figuring up the result . For many years the vote stood twelve Republicans and two Democrats . Nearly in the center of the township was a little clearing embracing a few farms ; all the rest was a dense , primeval forest of hemlock and birch , where so little light penetrated the canopy of interlaced branches that it always seemed after sundown . About ten miles from the clearing lay the little oil town of Clarendon , on the Philadelphia and Erie Railroad ,  --  a pocket-field , as the oil men call it , developed about ten years ago , and containing about two hundred wells within sight of the railway station . The " wild-catters , " as the prospectors are called who take the risks of sinking wells in unknown territory , had long had a theory that oil would be found south-west of Clarendon ; but it was only in the spring of 1882 that a party of four of them ventured to put up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drill . There seemed to be a premonition in the oil exchanges of the tremendous consequences to follow the sinking of 646 , as the well was called , from the surveyor 's number of the lot upon which it was located . Its progress was observed with feverish interest . The leading oil brokers of Bradford and Oil City employed scouts to watch it after the hole had got down nearly to the depth where it was expected the oil-bearing sandstone would be reached , and to make daily reports of its condition . The owners boarded the derrick up and stood guard at night with shot-guns , firing at random into the woods to keep the spies from getting near enough to learn anything . In spite of these precautions , one young man managed to evade the guard , and , crawling up to the well in the night , concealed himself under the derrick floor , where he lay for seventeen hours , escaping at last with the precious knowledge that 646 was a flowing well-knowledge which , it is said , brought fortunes to him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mystery about the Cherry Grove well was cleared up , and the fact was established beyond dispute that it was spouting out the largest stream of oil that ever came from a single well ,  --  actually yielding four thousand barrels the first day ,  --  the effect was tremendous . It is estimated that in a few days ' time the value of oil on hand and of oil territory and wells suffered a shrinkage to the enormous amount of thirty millions of dollars . Crude petroleum , which had been selling at eighty-five cents per barrel , tumbled down and down and down until it got to forty-nine cents - a figure far below the cost of production by any except big-flowing wells . The reader will ask why the opening of a single well , even though it produced the prodigious yield of four thousand barrels a day , should have been followed by such serious results . The answer is , because every one in the oil regions knew that it was not a question of one new well but of a new producing district , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon be flowing within gun-shot of 646 . In a few days the hemlock woods of Cherry Grove township were alive with men and // qwq profits of the big strike . With its partial failure , however , the price of oil has gone up , and prosperity has returned to the whole petroleum country . When crude oil brings ninety cents or a dollar a barrel , everybody is happy ; when it goes down to fifty cents , times are hard , and nobody wears a cheerful face save the speculators who have sold " short . " The tools and appliances employed in sinking a well are few and simple . A derrick is first built of cheap hemlock lumber , and attached to it is a rude shed which shelters the steam-engine and the machinery for working the drill and sand-pump and for pumping the oil . Frequently the boiler is placed out-of-doors , without protection from the weather , and it usually stands at some distance from VOL . XXVJ. - 31. the derrick , so that it will not be injured in case the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The engine works a huge rude walkingbeam which , by the movements of one arm , gives the motion to a stout cable , passing over a pulley at the top of the derrick , required to raise and lower the drill . Attached to the derrick is also a big windlass , called the " bull-wheel , " which hoists the drilling apparatus out of the well . There is also a smaller windlass , called the sand-reel , which serves to lower and raise the sand-pump . After the rig is got upon the ground , a drive-pipe is forced down through the earth to the rock . The drilling tools consist of the " bit , " which is a long bar of iron as heavy as a man can lift , with a sharp end to cut and pound the rock , the " auger stem , " an iron bar perhaps SHOOTING A WELL . // eight feet long screwed into the bit , the jars , " two heavy bars linked together , the " sinker-bar " resembling the auger stem , and the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end , reach nearly to the top of the derrick when hoisted out of the well . Then there is the " temper-screw , " which lowers the drilling apparatus inch by inch as it goes down , and the " sand-pump " and " bailer , " employed to take up and hoist out the pulverized rock and water . Once every six feet , in the progress of a well , the creaking bull-wheel is set in motion , the drilling apparatus is hoisted out , and the sand-pump ( a cylinder with valves ) is lowered and raised with the detritus . Frequently , the bit is unscrewed and sharpened at a forge under the derrick frame . Two or three men are sufficient to put down a well . The movements of the engine are controlled from the derrick by a simple apparatus of cords and wheels . When the well is down about three hundred feet , the " casing , " a six-inch iron tube , is put in to keep the water from veins in the rock from getting into the well . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas , spurts up with great force , perhaps as high as the derrick . Then the " tubing , " two inches in diameter , is put in , and a " seed-bag " is forced down between it and the casing . The tubing runs to a tank several rods from the well , into which the oil flows as long as the well is a flowing well , and from which it is afterward pumped . It costs about 8o cents a foot to sink a well by contract . The cost of a finished well , with apparatus complete , varies from $3000 to $4000 , according to the depth at which the oil stratum is found and the expense of getting the engine and boiler on the ground . If a well proves a dry hole , or fails to yield enough oil to pay for pumping , and the owner removes the machinery to other ground for a fresh experiment , he is out of pocket from $*ooo to $1500 . When a well is completed and productive the drilling apparatus is by no means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or , perhaps , bored a little deeper . It does not always behave well , and it is necessary to find out what the matter is . In connection with the " outfit , " as a Western man would say , must be mentioned the " sucker-rods , " long sticks of ash coupled together and used in pumping , and the " fishing tools , " which come into important service when the drilling apparatus or the rope breaks in the well . When a well fails it is usually " torpedoed " to start the flow afresh . A long tin tube , containing six or eight quarts of nitro-glycerine , is lowered into the hole and exploded by dropping a weight upon it . The tremendous force of the powerful explosive tears the sand rock apart and loosens the imprisoned oil and gas . Nothing is heard on the surface save a sharp report like a pistol shot , but the ground heaves perceptibly , and pretty soon the oil comes spurting out in a jet that breaks in spray above the lofty derrick . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the oil region who is seen with most satisfaction from a distance . He travels about in a light vehicle with his tubes and his nitroglycerine can , traversing the rough roads at a jolly round trot , taking the chances of an accidental explosion , and whistling or singing as he goes . Sometimes the chances are against him , and a blow of a wheel against a stone sets free the terrible force imprisoned in the white fluid in his can . There is no occasion for a funeral after such an accident , for there is nothing to bury . Man , horse , and " buggy " are annihilated in a flash , and an ugly hole in the ground and a cloud of smoke are all that is left to show what has happened . The torpedo company buys a new horse and hires a new man , and there is no more difficulty about one transaction than the other . The business of " torpedoing " wells is in the hands of a single company , which has made a large amount of money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fluid . Most oil producers regard the patent as invalid , because nature supplies the fluid in the well into which the nitro-glycerine tube is lowered ; but the courts have sustained the patent . Sometimes well-owners " torpedo " their wells stealthily by night to avoid paying the high price charged by the company . This opera*-tion is called " moonlighting , " and many lawsuits have grown out of it . In the whole Pennsylvania and New York field , the number of producing wells is at this time not far from 20,000 , of which about 13,000 are in the Bradford district . The number of " dry holes " and exhausted wells no man has endeavored to compute . It is a common saying in the region , however , that since i879 more money has been put into the ground than has been got out of it . No consideration of the general interest of the trade or of the risk involved in sinking new wells checks the business of boring . Production constantly runs ahead of consumption . It is useless for the newspapers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trade and all dependent upon it would be if the price of crude petroleum were kept up to a dollar a barrel , by limiting production . As soon as the price goes up high enough to be fairly remunerative , hundreds of new wells are sunk in old territory , and " wild-catting " becomes active . // " Wild-catting " is the name applied to the venturesome business of drilling wells on territory not known to contain oil , in the hope of finding it . A man engaged in this pursuit is called not a wild-cat , but a " wildcatter . " The typical " wild-catter " is a restless , speculative person , rich to-day and poor to-morrow , now making a lucky strike , and now sinking all his available means in a dryhole . He has wonderful vitality , and never gives up . If " dead-broke , " he will always manage to borrow money enough to sink " just one more well . " When he begins to put down a wild-cat well , he usually leases all the land in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the oil obtained if any is found . Should he make a strike , he sells his leases , for a handsome bonus , in tracts of five acres each , and pockets at once a large sum of money besides what he makes from his own well . Sometimes the " wild-catter , " finding he has got a dry hole , secretly conveys a few barrels of oil to the spot in the night , empties them on the derrick platform and the ground , and manages to make a profit by selling his leases before the fraud is discovered . This operation corresponds to what is called " salting a mine " in the gold and silver regions of the far West . Petroleum wells exist in India which are said to have been flowing for thousands of years . Doubtless the business of gathering the oil to serve some simple uses in its crude state is as old as civilization . Talking one day about the first discoveries of oil with a " wild-catter , " on one of the narrow-gauge railway lines that run over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Warren and MeKean counties , the man said : " Why , the oil business is no new thing . It 's as old as the Scriptures . Job was an oil man . He struck the rock and it poured forth rivers of oil . He got rich in the oil business . " " Yes , " chimed in a stranger on the other side of the car , " and that 's the way he got his boils . I know men who ca n't be about oil wells without getting boils . They breathe in the carbon , and it goes into their blood . " The " wild-catter " agreed to this theory , and added that he had no doubt Job 's wells took fire , burned up his children , and reduced him to poverty . As he was speaking , we saw a large column of inky black smoke rising above the forest to the right of the train . " A tank 's on fire , " said the brakeman . The news caused a movement of excitement in the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others put their heads out the windows , but the occurrence did not appear to be so unusual as to cause lasting interest . A curve in the road soon brought the train near the fire . A tank belonging to a well was burning with tremendous fury , making a great circular mass of rosy flame , and throwing up an enormous volume of smoke . It is no rare thing , I learned , for the small wooden tanks attached to the wells to take fire ; but when one of the large storage tanks of the A BURNING WELL AT CHERRY GROVE . // Pipe Lines is struck by lightning , the spectacle is so magnificent that people gather from miles around to witness it . The owners make haste to bring a cannon by special train from the nearest town , and shoot holes in the tank to let the oil run out . None of it is saved , but if it is not released the tank boils over and bursts , and other tanks near by are ignited . Lightning is the great enemy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever witnessed in the oil regions was that of the burning well in the Cherry Grove district last summer . A flowing well , yielding over a thousand barrels a day , took fire . The derrick was soon consumed , and the blazing fluid , spouting up high in the air and breaking in a shower of fiery drops , continued to burn for four days ,  --  a wonderful fountain of fire in the midst of the forest . It was finally extinguished by shooting off the casing head with a cannon shot , and then applying an ingenious device for plugging the well below the fiery column . The method of producing petroleum , as described above , has undergone but little change since the first wells were sunk in Oil Creek in 1859 . The derrick is nearly twice as high as then ; the drilling apparatus is much longer and heavier ; there are improved implements for getting out the pulverized rock and water , and for fishing broken tools out of a well , and with the heavier apparatus now in use much less time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process is the same pounding of a hole through the rock , and the general appearance of a new well just sunk does not differ noticeably from that of a well of twenty years ago : It is in the means for the transportation and storage of the oil that great progress has been made . An admirable system has been developed in recent years , by which the product of widely scattered wells is gathered by small pipes into huge storage tanks , and then forced by powerful engines through larger pipes that run straight over hills and valleys , across forests , farms , and rivers , to the chief marts of refining and shipment . No other important product of industry is handled and transported with such small expenditure of labor and capital , and such rapidity and efficiency . The refineries of Pittsburg , Cleveland , and Buffalo are supplied by pipes from the heart of the producing regions in Pennsylvania , and the enormous tanks grouped on the hill-sides and in the valleys at Olean discharge their contents at Bayonne , on New York Bay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covers the whole oil-producing territory , reaching every well , uniting all the isolated districts , and collecting the little streams of oil from twenty thousand different subterranean springs into rivulets and rivers that pulsate in their iron tubes like the arteries in the body of a living creature , and flow with powerful current straight to their appointed outlets . Two pipe-line companies supply the whole oil country with storage and transportation . One of these , the Tidewater Company , taps a portion of the wells in the Bradford field alone , and ends at Tamanend , in Eastern Pennsylvania , where it transfers its oil to tank cars on the Philadelphia and Reading Railway and the Central Railway of New Jersey . It is comparatively a small concern , but is important as the only competitor to its gigantic rival , the United Pipe Lines , a corporation running its mains to every district , large or small , in the oil region , having its termini at the sea-board and at the three principal refining cities of the interior , and possessing a tankage capacity of over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the great Standard Oil Company under a different name , the controlling interest in the stock of the two concerns being owned by the same men . The United stores and transports ; the Standard buys , refines , sells , and exports . This double-headed corporate power is the monarch of the oil trade . Only the producing interest remains in a multitude of hands ; all else is virtually concentrated in the grasp of a little group of men who manage the two companies . Let us look for a moment at the system by which petroleum is handled . It is remarkably simple , inexpensive , and efficient . When the tank at a well is nearly full , notice is sent to the nearest agency of the Pipe Lines . A man comes promptly with a measuring pole and a little book of certificates . He gauges the oil in the tank , unlocks the stop-cock connecting with the outlet pipe , and lets as much oil run out as the well-owners want to dispose of . Then he shuts off the flow , measures what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certificate , showing depth of oil at the beginning and at the end of the run . One he gives to the well manager who has signed with him , one he sends to the central office of the Pipe Lines at Oil City , and one he keeps . A telegram is then sent to the central office , giving notice that so many inches of oil have been run from the tank . Every tank has its number on the books of the company , and its capacity is recorded in inches . On receiving the certificate of the run , the number of barrels and hundredths of a barrel taken from the tank is ascertained by a table , and credit is given to the well for that amount of oil less three per cent. , which is deducted for sedi // ment and evaporation . The account is not only kept in gross with the well , but is divided so that each share-owner , if there be many ( and there are usually from three to a dozen ) , gets his separate credit for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The United Pipe Lines is not only a transportation company , but also a bank of deposit for oil and an insurance company , and it keeps the books of every well it serves . The oil from the well is now in possession of the Pipe Company , and is in one of its big storage tanks mixed with oil from scores of other wells . There is no separation and no distinction of quality . All crude petroleum , from whatever well or district it comes , is A BURNING OIL-TANK . ( CAPACITY , 3500 BARRELS. ) // classed together as of uniform value . When a producer sells oil , he gives an o1der for a transfer to the purchaser of as many barrels from his credit balance as he has disposed of ; or , if he wants to use his oil in store as co*-lateral to borrow money upon or convert it into a negotiable certificate , he gets what is called an acceptance , which is virtually a certified check . These acceptances are issued in even amounts of one thousand barrels each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world , but must , by a rule of the coinpany , be sent in once in six months for renewal , or a double storage charge is made . Frequently they return covered on their backs with indorsements . When the holder of an acceptance or a credit balance wants the oil for use or shipment it is delivered at either of the main shipping points , he paying twenty cents per barrel as the pipage charge , and a storage charge of fifty cents per day per one thousand barrels . Storage for the first twenty days is free , however , to the producer , and a purchaser has ten days ' storage without charge . Insurance is a mutual affair . Losses are assessed on all the oil in the lines and on holders of acceptances and credit balances for oil in store . Last year the assessments amounted to only eight-tenths of one per cent . A loss of less than twenty thousand barrels is considered too small to assess , and is borne by the Pipe Company . Nearly all losses are caused by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which in turn ignites the oil . In i88o eight tanks were burned in this way , but in 1882 only one tank was struck , although the number of tanks had been doubled during the two years . A method of protection was recently devised , which is believed to be effective . A lightning rod , twenty-five feet high , is attached to four broad bands of iron sheathing , reaching from the apex of the covered tank and out to the sides , and thus , according to the accepted theory , the electricity which the tank accumulates is safely discharged into the air . The pipe line system was a thing of small beginnings and slow growth . As long ago as 1863 a young Boston attorney , who had established himself on the Tarr farm , one pf the first producing districts on Oil Creek , conceived the plan of transporting crude petroleum through tubes , and had some pipe manufactured for the purpose , but never put it down . Two years later the first pipe was laid . It extended from Pithole to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the joints were so defective that it was used only a few weeks . It served to show , however , that the general plan of pipe transportation was practicable , and it was not long before a number of pipe companies were formed . Their object was only to take the oil from the wells to the nearest railway line or to the Allegheny River , on which it was then floated down to Pittsburg in tanks upon flat-boats . For a number of years the pipe lines were in bad odor , owing to numerous failures among the companies and to their lack of efficiency . The system gained ground , however , from its evident superiority , and in 1876 the consolidation of a number of lines formed the United Pipe Lines , a corporation which grew in power from year to year , and OIL-SIDING AND PUMPING-STATION . TRANSPORTING OIL FROM THE PIPE-LINES TO THE CARS . // finally absorbed all the old concerns . It now owns over three thousand miles of pipes and over five hundred iron tanks , with a storage capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal of oil still goes to market by railroad however , not directly from the wells , but from shipping stations to which it is brought by the pipe lines . Tamanend and Williamsport are important shipping points , nearly two hundred miles from the oil fields ; Kane , much nearer , is another , and there are numerous points where trains are loaded on the roads penetrating the producing districts . The long trains of tank cars , greasy , dirty , and malodorous , are familiar sights on most of the railways leading to New York , Philadelphia , and Baltimore . The tanks are cylindrical in form , holding about twenty-five thousand gallons each , and surmounted by a " cupola , " which gives space for the oil to expand when heated by the sun 's rays . The long pipe lines are : Two from Olean on the northern verge of the great Bradford field to New York Bay , three hundred miles ; one from Coal Grove in the Bradford field to Milton on the Philadelphia and Erie and Philadelphia and Reading railroads , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City in the same field to Buffalo , seventy-eight miles ; one from Hilliard 's , in the Lower field to Cleveland , one hundred and five miles ; one from Carbon Center in the Lower field to Pittsburg , thirty-eight miles ( all these belonging to the United Pipe Lines Company ) , and one from Rixford in the Bradford field to Tamanend on the Reading Railroad , one hundred and seventy miles , belonging to the Tidewater Company . There are also important lines connecting the different fields , so that oil can be transferred from one to another . On the main lines there is on an average a pumping engine every twenty-five miles . The engines may be much nearer together or much further apart , depending on the extent to which gravity can be used as a motive power . Main line pipes are four , five , or six inches in diameter . Through a six-inch pipe twenty thousand barrels a day can be conveyed . When oil is being forced through a pipe there is a constant clicking sound like that made by steam-heating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dense forests which cover mountainous country in the oil regions will hardly go many miles without hearing this sharp , metallic sound ; then he has only to follow the pipe to come to a cluster of wells , or a pumping station , or perhaps to a narrow-gauge railway climbing up a frightfully steep grade . The resonant pipe leads him out of the wilderness . Every new producing district discovered in the oil regions develops one or more new towns . They spring up with marvelous rapidity , and bloom into full-grown municipalities in a few weeks , with stores , hotels , amusement halls , a fire department , and a police force . If the yield from the wells holds out for a year , the rude wooden structures are succeeded by brick blocks and comfortable dwellings ; but most of these petroleum settlements never get beyond the shanty stage . Their decline is not so rapid as their rise , but their fortunes steadily fail as the yield of the district decreases . Some of them disappear altogether ; others remain , shrunken and dilapidated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnitude of the producing business as a whole , however , and of the various interests of refining and transporting and of furnishing machinery and supplies dependent upon it , has recently developed a few important and prosperous little cities , whose existence does not hang upon the fate of any one particular district . The chief of these are Oil City , at the junction of Oil Creek with the Allegheny River , in what is known as in the Lower field , and Bradford in the Upper field . Oil City dates back to the first opening of wells on Oil Creek , and is a well-built place of about ten thousand inhabitants , wedged in two narrow valleys , dirty , smoky , and busy ,  --  a railroad center , a large refining point , and the chief market for speculations and actual sales of crude petroleum . The chief offices of the United Pipe Lines and the most important oil exchange in the world are established here . Bradford was a petty country village in 1875 , when oil was struck near by ; now it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange , an opera house , a street railroad , and two daily newspapers . The derricks stand thick among the houses , and dot the sides and crests of the steep wooded hills encircling the town . Railway lines run to every point of the compass , the narrow-gauge roads making no account of mountains , but getting up and over them on grades that would be impracticable to an ordinary train . Titusville , on Oil Creek , once the metropolis of the petroleum country , has lost its importance as a center of oil production and trade , but is the favorite residence town of prosperous brokers and producers , and boasts of its fine business buildings , well shaded streets , and handsome dwellings . It has a population of about five thousand . Warren , an old , quiet , county-seat town , with four thousand inhabitants , on the upper Allegheny , converted into an oil center by the opening of producing districts in its vicinity , is a pretty , homelike place , almost hidden under maple trees , and looking out // 336 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yield oil , but discharge a steady flow of gas , not equal in illuminating power to good artificial gas , but so cheap that it is burned lavishly . To a great extent it is used as fuel , a supply pipe run into an ordinary coal stove being the only apparatus required . Were it not for a slight odor , it would be an ideal fuel . You have only to turn a stop-cock to regulate the heat , and there are , of course , no ashes or cinders or coal dust . Huge blazing torches , lighting up the woods for rods around and illuminating some lonely cabin or derrick with a theatrical stage glare , make weird night effects that startle the traveler , new to the oil country , who first traverses the great forests of the Bradford district . A curious feature of the new settlements in the Cherry Grove district is the great number of shanties and sheds bearing the sign " Bottling Works . " There are no saloons proper ; but everywhere , on the dusty highways , at cross-roads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group of wells , this singular legend , " Bottling Works , " greets the eye . The equipment of one of these establishments consists of two or three kegs and a dozen bottles of beer . No glasses are kept on the bar , and there are no seats for tired and thirsty wayfarers . I stopped at one of these places and asked the proprietor , a decent looking fellow , to explain why he entitled his bar a bottling works instead of a beer saloon . He replied that the Pennsylvania license law empowered the courts to grant licenses . When oil was struck in Cherry Grove , the court in Warren county was not in session and would not sit for six months . Meanwhile , what should the thirsty multitude that rushed to the new field do for something to drink ? Somebody remembered that there was a law authorizing every person who paid fifty dollars to the county treasurer to bottle ale or beer , not to be sold by the glass , and not to be drunk on the premises . The bottling works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platform in front of my house , " continued the beer-seller . " Well , it 's not on my premises . The house stands right on the line of the public highway . When I sell a customer a bottle of beer , he do n't drink it on the premises ; he stands right here on the porch , and the porch is in the highway . " Just then a red-faced man , whose clothes were redolent of petroleum , called for a bottle , swallowed the beer , put down ten cents , and went his way . " Do n't you give them glasses to drink from ? " I asked . " No ; that would be selling by the glass . I gOt some tin cups and used them for awhile , but concluded I might get into trouble . The court might VOL . XXVJ. - 32. hold the tin-cup dodge as an evasion of the law . As long as they drink the beer from the bottle , the law ca n't touch me . " " Then the effect of the liquor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a mug of beer must buy a whole bottle ? " " That 's what it comes to , my friend . " The beer-seller went on to say that he voted for prohibitory laws every time . The more stringent a law was the better it suited him . " You see , " he explained , " taint every man that 's got sand enough in him to violate such a law , and those who have can make lots of money . I always set up in a place where there 's some sort of a strong local option or license law to stop the sale of drink . Men will have liquor , and when they are obliged to get it on the sly they 'll pay a good price for it . I was two years in the town of Sharon , where they had local option . Even the druggists durs n't sell liquor . Well , I took a room , sub-leased it to a man to store brooms , so it did n't appear to be occupied by me , boarded up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , got myself a false face , and laid in a stock of whisky and pint bottles . When a customer rapped on the window I put on my mask , handed him out a pint bottle of whisky , and took in a dollar . Nobody could swear he got his liquor from me . I often made over a hundred dollars a day . The liquor cost me a dollar and a quarter a gallon , and I sold it for a dollar a pint . Finally they got a case against me in court . Some fellow swore he bought whisky from me . I got the case postponed six months , and went on selling . Then the jury disagreed . So I got six months ' more time . At last I only had to pay a fine of fifty dollars . " Across the road from this man 's bottling works was a neat country school-house , and near by , at a cross-roads , a big sign announced that the place was Vandergrift City . The brick buildings of a huge pumping engine sending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at its work , feur huge tanks , and half-a-dozen houses made up the city . The beer-seller said he " located " there because the school was so convenient for his two little children . The oil exchanges at Bradford and Oil City are noisy and animated places during business hours , and at other times they serve as clubrooms for the members . There are pleasant reading-rooms attached , where the daily papers from the large cities are received ; and there are comfortable sofas and chairs , inviting to lounging and chat . In the Bradford Exchange there is also a music room with a piano , where of evenings the tuneful brokers sing popular ballads . The buying and selling // at these places is carried on with the clamor and gesticulation which , for some mysterious reason , is a feature of stock and produce exchanges the world over . Why men , who in all the other affairs of life are quiet and dignified , should think it necessary , when arranging a commercial transaction in stocks or grain or oil , to shout and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raving lunatics , is a problem in human nature which remains unexplained . On a day when prices fluctuate , and the bulls and bears are peculiarly active and excited , the roar and racket from one of these oil exchanges can be heard a block distant . By far the greater part of the transactions are speculative , the oil nominally sold never changing hands at all , and . never , in fact , being in the possession of either seller or buyer . The average daily sales at the Oil City Exchange in September last exceeded six million barrels ; those at the Bradford Exchange exceeded two millions . I have not the figures for the other exchanges at Titusville , Pittsburg , and New York , but it is probably a moderate estimate to say that the grand total of daily transactions the year round averages ten million barrels , whereas the total production of the whole petroleum field is only about eighty thousand barrels per day . Petroleum is a peculiarly fascinating article for speculative operations , because of the heavy and frequent fluctuations in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from forty-nine cents to one dollar per barrel . A variation of ten cents in a single day is no uncommon thing . The mere rumor of a successful well in a new district will sometimes send the price down five cents . No other great natural product is subject to such changes in value . The wheat crop and the cotton crop can be estimated months in advance , and one year 's scant yield is compensated by the surplus of the next . The annual output of coal varies only with the demand , and there is no fear of the supply becoming exhausted . But with petroleum the case is different . No one can tell how long a well or a large group of wells will hold out . No one knows what new and untapped fountains the earth still conceals . The future of the oil business is not clear from week to week , much less from year to year . Perhaps the supply will so far fail as to send the price up to five dollars ; perhaps new flowing wells will so increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the cost of transportation from the tanks . The reader will see what a field these conditions afford for bold and reckless speculation and for large profits and losses . The business of refining petroleum grew very naturally out of that of distilling kerosene from bituminous coal , which had developed into an important industry in the United States and Europe during the decade prior to the oil discoveries in Pennsylvania . The establishments using coal as a raw material from which to obtain kerosene substituted petroleum as soon as it became the cheaper of the two substances . The name coal oil was readily transferred to the new illuminating fluid obtained from the earth , and it is still widely known by that name or by the Greek appelation kerosene , originally taken as a trademark by one of the early distillers of cannel coal . It is an interesting fact , showing how persistently special industries cling to the localities of their first choice , that the great petroleum refineries of Hunter 's Point , Long Island , whose odors are a serious offense to the noses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York city , are the successors of one of the earliest kerosene factories in the United States , which was established on Newtown Creek in 1854 . The chief seats of the refining industry in this country are Cleveland , Buffalo , Pittsburg , Oil City , and Hunter 's Point ( now called Long Island City ) . With the exception of Oil City , all these places are situated at a considerable distance from the oil fields , and were chosen for convenience in domestic and foreign shipment of the refined product rather than for nearness to the supply of the crude material . The pipe system , however , brings them practically close to the wells . Most of the exports of petroleum go abroad in the shape of refined oil . There are , however , r*efineries in Europe , and notably in France , which buy large quantities of crude petroleum in America . No fewer than ten substances are obtained from petroleum by the refining process besides the beautiful ' aniline dyes , which are extracted from the residuum by chemical processes . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which varies from 625 to 848 , are as follows : ist , rhigolene , the most volatile product of first distillation used to produce local amesthesia ; 2d , gasolene , used in artificial gas machines ; 3d , 4th , and 5th , three grades of naphtha , used for mixing paints and varnishes and dissolving resin ; 6th , kerosene , the common illuminating oil of commerce ; 7th , mineral spern* oil , a heavier oil for burning in lamps , which does not take fire under a temperature of three hundred degrees , and is employed on steamers and railroads ; 8th , a lubricating oil for machinery ; 9th , paraffine , from which candles are made ; and roth , paraffine wax . Then there is the residuum , usually called // coal tar , which has a variety of uses . In most refineries the products are only naphtha , kerosene , and residuum . The refining process removes the coloring matter and the gummy substances which would clog the lamp-wick and separates the naphtha , which makes the oil dangerously inflammable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and honesty exercised in the distilling process . Good oil is not dangerous , as many people suppose all kerosene must be . Only the poorer grades are liable to take fire . A very simple test can be applied by any housekeeper to ascertain whether the fluid is safe or not . Partly fill a cup with water warmed to one hundred and twenty degrees Fahrenheit ; turn in a little oil , stir the mixture , and apply a lighted match to the surface . If it takes fire , the oil is unfit for use ; if not , it is entirely safe . What is the future of the petroleum business ? With a productive territory virtually confined to a few small strips and spots in six counties in Western Pennsylvania and New York , and an inexorable law of rapid exhaustion applying to all wells , the time would seem to be close at hand when this great blessing , the cheap light of the whole civilized world , would fail . Still , the history of the business in the short period since it began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invariably been discovered when the yield of the old ones began to decline . Oil men have confidence that there is plenty of undiscovered territory yet to be found . Providence , they say , would not bestow so great a gift upon mankind to withdraw it when its use had become universal and the need of the human race for its benefits the greatest . Scientists may say that this view is based on an optimistic or pietistic theory of the universe that will not stand investigation . So far as the great stores of fuel and light , the coal and the petroleum , are concerned , it has , however , held good thus far . They have not failed . If the oil of the rock is destined to run dry , the chemists will perhaps be ready , by the time it is exhausted , to produce a cheap illuminator from water . E. V Smalley. @
