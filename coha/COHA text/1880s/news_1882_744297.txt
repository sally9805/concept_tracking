txt The Legislature wasted a considerable part of the late session in an effort to defeat or ruin ail important public measure on the pretense that the Governor could not be trusted to exercise a power belonging to his office in the interest of the people . Now the Governor is engaged in saving the people so far as possible from the consequences of the mischievous work which made up a large part of the record of this same Legislature . Yesterday he put on file  --  his reasons for not approving the bill which was intended to relieve the elevated railroads of this City of more than half their share in the burden of taxation . His action was so obviously a matter of public duty that he is deserving of no special credit for it , but in these times we are fain to express gratitude for the honest performance of a public duty , as if it were hardly a matter to be expected . At all events , Gov . CORNELL has shown his superiority over the Legislature which professed so much distrust of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests of the State and or the people . The passage of the Elevated Railroad Tax bill was a disgraceful episode in the career of the Legislature of 1882 second only to the whitewashing of the judicial character of Judge WESTBROOK , and the responsibility of those who took part in it should not be forgotten because the Governor has prevented the consummation of its iniquitous purpose . The elevated railroad combination holds a public franchise of enormous value , for which it has paid nothing . Its property professes to represent a capital of more than $45,000,000 , much of which is in reality fictitious , but on the whole of which it has intended and still intends to obtain an income . Interest on its $20,000,000 and more of bonds must be paid and dividends on its $26,000,000 of stock it proposes to have . If it can not earn the latter there is certainly no justification for the existence of the fictitious half of that stock . Its property is assessed at something like $18,500 , - 000 , and it has the audacity to claim , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much . It still owes taxes for the years 1880 and 1881 amounting to $1,230 , - 936 on this very moderate assessment , the collection of which it is resisting in the courts . A bill was introduced in the Assembly at the instance of the Mayor and Controller of the City providing for an equitable reassessment of the property of corporations for the years 1880 and 1881 , in consequence of litigation that had arisen out of the application of the new laws affecting the taxation of corporate property . The questions at issue will no doubt be finally settled by the courts , but it was thought that trouble and expense might be avoided by the legislative action proposed . This bill passed the Assembly , but in the Senate . where it came to be known as bill No. 401 , the elevated railroad monopoly got at it through the good offices of that eminent anti-monopolist , THOMAS F. GRADY , and secured the interpolation of an amendment which commuted the entire taxa- tion of its property for the last two years , and for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . on the gross receipts of the railroads . The gross receipts are said to be about $6,000,000 annually , and it is easy to cipher out the loss to the City which this change contemplated . It would amount to more than $750,000 on the overdue taxes and $316,000 on the levy of the present year . This would , of course , have to be made up by the general tax payers . But aside from the question of direct loss there was a very important principle involved . Other corporations and individual citizens pay taxes on their property according to a valuation deemed by the proper authorities to be just , without reference to the income derived from it . Means are provided , available to all alike , for rectifying any injustice or inequality that shall be proved to exist . This bill proposed not simply to make a discrimination in favor of the most unscrupulous monopoly of modern times in the mode of levying and collecting taxes , but to reduce by more than one-halt Its contribution to the public revenues . This amended measure got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The concurrence of the Assembly was secured in the first instance by a reckless application of gag-law , with the countenance and support of the Speaker ; but its character was well known to most of those who voted for it . After it became fully understood , a motion for its reconsideration was defeated , and a joint resolution adopted by the repentant Senate to recall it after it had gone to the Governor met a similar fate in the lower house . Every one of the Tammany members present when the votes were taken voted for the amended bill and against reconsideration , notwithstanding their loud professions of hostility to monopolies . Among its supporters were only nine Republicans , conspicuous among whom were the venerable ALVORD , of Onondaga ; BAKER , of Monroe , and BRODSKY , of this City . In the main its supporters were Democrats , and it was pressed by one of the boldest and most corrupt gangs of lobbyists which the Capitol has ever known . Surely the Governor is entitled to no extravagant praise for his refusal to approve a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as this was , and resolutely opposed by the Mayor , Controller , and Corporation Counsel of the City and by every honest tax-payer and public-spirited citizen . The history of the bill furnishes a striking illustration of the character of the great Manhattan monopoly and the need of stronger safeguards for public rights against the centralized power of corporations . More than all , it warns the people of the absolute necessity of strenuous efforts to secure a higher standard of honesty and integrity among the men chosen to represent their interests in the Legislature .
