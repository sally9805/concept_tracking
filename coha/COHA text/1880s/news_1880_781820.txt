txt To a native-born American man , unquestionably entitled to the right of suffrage when arrived at the age of 21 , there is something pitiful in the attitude of the ladies who arc working for the right of women to vote . One who is secure in his safety and privileges mil well afford to look back with a mild sort of pity upon those who are yet buffeting the billows of adverse fortune . Men who vote , and whose right to vote has never been called in question , can regard with mild commiseration , not unmingled with amusement , the struggles and labors of SUSAN B. ANTHONY , LILLIE DEVEREUX BLAKE , and all the rest , as they journey from pillar to post , from one party to another , seeking comfort and finding none . But we must understand that these ladies long with an exceeding great longing for the right to vote . Politicians amuse them with idle promises , but it is pretty certain that , so long as men control the right of suffrage , they will never consent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more hopeless problem than this which is presented to the advocates of female suffrage . How shall the privileged class , independent of the non-privileged class in all essential matters , be persuaded to surrender a part of their privileges to those who are now deprived of the liberties which they seek ? This is the riddle which the " female suffragists " are endeavoring to solve . Mrs : BLAKE and other members of the Wonsan Suffrage Society waited upon the Democratic National Committee , the other day , and asked the committee 's authority to speak , and to make a personal canvass for HANCOCK and ENGLISH . They said that Miss SUSAN B. ANTHONY had waited upon Gen. GARFIELD , who had told her that he was not in favor of giving women the right to vote . Gen. GARFIELD , it appears , has opinions on the woman suffrage question ; and , what is more peculiar , he gives his opinions with great freedom , when asked for them . Indeed , knowing what we do about GARFIELD , we should say that any committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know what the Republican candidate thinks about any given subject , - would be sure to find it out if he ( or she ) asked for it . Mrs. BLAKE and her fair associates in the glorious cause of reform had read in the newspapers an account of the visit of a working men 's committee to Gen. HANCOCK , to find out what the Democratic candidate thinks about the labor question . They found that " the superb soldier , " as if he had no opinions of his own , ( as he possibly has not , ) told them to go to the Chairman of the National Democratic Committee . Mrs. BLAKE and her charming associates , having a large amount of baby-tending and stocking-darning on hand , thought to economize time by going directly to head-quarters  --  Democratic headquarters . The Chairman of the State Committee received them with bland smiles , and having told them that the matter would receive the earliest attention of the committee , politely showed them the door . When the ladies , overwhelmed with courtesy , found themselves outside of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sure whether they had made anything or not . But nobody had told them that Gen. HANcocK was opposed ( or not opposed ) to female suffrage . What these women desire is an opportunity to make a personal canvass for one of the Presidential candidates . They desire , individually , to be able to set before their several husbands a table to which he may not sit down to eat until he has promised to vote the ticket of the female suffragists . They desire to say to the lord of creation , " You shall not have another button sewed on your shirt until you agree to vote as you are told . " And they think to obtain this power from whom ? From the men who hold and control it . This would be like the enchanted Prince in the opera , who gives to his adored wife the secret of his parentage and name , knowing very well that she will use it to drive . him from her and from his kingdom , as she subsequently does . It is soberly thought that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the situation to the women , and possibly consent to be hoisted with his own petard . And this delightful piece of strategy is to be accomplished upon Gen. HAN-coot , a man who has no opinions , no ideas , no notions , except those which relate to the Army , and to the Army 's relations to the civil power . There are many people who think of abolishing the Army , it is so small and insignificant . But Gen. HANCOCK knows nothing outside of the Army , and if that is abolished , he is abolished , and he has no plank left to float upon . That is , he would have no plank left if he should turn hip military and high-shouldered back upon woman suffrage . Here is his opportunity . GARFIELD has said , or is said to have said , that he is not in favor of giving the ballot to women . Let HANCOCK declare in favor of female suffrage . Let him make an effort to have an opinion that is not twenty years old . The slogan shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By this sign he may conquer .
