txt The managers of the Great Western Railway have naturally been trying to make the British public believe that it has been shaken by a false alarm about the Windsor station fire . The bottle " supposed to contain explosives " was filled , they declare , with horse medicine , perfectly harmless , except to horses when taken internally . There was no infernal machine , the " American clockwork " was British fishing tackle , and the fire was such an accident as will occur to the best regulated parcel room . This announcement will be greeted with considerable disgust by the advocates of Irish independence . The organ of those advocates in Dublin took the ground , when the explosion occurred at London Bridge , that it was prepared under the auspices of the London police in order to heap unmerited odium on peaceable Irishmen . Our own O'DONOVAN , who is really a peaceable Irishman , and who not only . welcomes but invites the heaping of unmerited odium , in connection with subscriptions , upon himself , has heretofore maintained , when explosions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that with a few more subscriptions he could arrange an explosion under the throne at a time when it was occupied by her Majesty and supported by bloated aristocrats who were . willing to collect rents from the industrious peasantry of Ireland . Sadly few people have hitherto credited these assertions . It is the general belief that O'DoNoVAN would not harm a fly , unless the fly had more money than brains , in which case O'DONOVAN might be induced to cultivate the latter at the expense of the former by procuring from the fly a subscription to the emergency fund , which might be applicable , in the absence of a national , emergency , to the personal emergencies of O'DONOVAN . We are not aware whether O'DoNovAN has committed himself , in his mysterious way , to the authorship of " the Windsor horror . " It is to be hoped he has , for such a claim would not strain the credulity even of those persons who utterly decline to consider him capable of deeds of blood . We know of no reason to doubt that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some fishing tackle and a bottle of horse medicine in the parcel room of an English station .
