txt The difficulties , whether real or imaginary , which spring from the possession of the right of suffrage by the negroes in the South are so far aggravated in the State of South Carolina , and are exciting such a degree of serious attention there , that the ques , tion of dealing with them may well be called the South Carolina problem . That is the one State in which there is a decided preponderance of colored population , and consequently a strong majority of negro voters . The State is also conspicuous for the admission that is now very generally made that violence and fraud are the instrumentalities by which the political majority has been brought into subjection to the minority . But there is a growing recognition of the seriousness of this business of introducing violence and fraud as the most potent agencies in political action . In the Legislature of the State , at its last session , several propositions were submitted having in view changes in the laws relating to elections . One of these contemplated a " commission to consider and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will prevent irregularities and frauds , and to consider and report upon proposed amendments to the Constitution of the State and to the election laws . " Finally , the whole subject was referred to a joint committee of the two houses , which is to make its report at the . next session . A member of this joint committee , a Charleston lawyer by the name of EDWARD MCCRADY , Jr. , has issued in pamphlet form his own suggestions as to the cure of what he regards as thb evil that affects the body politic of his State . His one practical proposition is that the Constitution be circumvented and the power of the negro as a voter curtailed by means of a registration law which shall require every voter to register his own name with his own hand . This is in effect imposing an educational qualification . by act of the Legislature and in spite of the Constitution , and Mr. MCCRADY 'S paper , which is submitted to his fellow-members of the joint committee , is simply a labored argument in support of this remarkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for its admissions , for its political morality , and for its'reasoning . The writer quotes from the preamble of one of the resolutions referred to his committee the grotesque declaration that the Democratic Party " has always advocated the doctrine of a fair election and honest count , " and follows it by a plea of guilty to the worst charges ever made against that party in his State . He even argues in extenuation of violence and fraud , going back into the dark periods of English political history , and working his way to the conclusion that " bribery , intimidation , and fraud have been the common incidents as well in England as in this country from the earliest times . " He thus prepares himself for a " clean breast " in regard to what has been done in South Carolina . Referring to the Government of the State prior to 1S76 , he says : " By a most vigorous effort we overthrew this Government and restored to intelligence the rule of our State ; " and now the question is ' how to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and at the same time preserve our political integrity . " " Preserve our political integrity " is evidently not intended for sarcasm ; but how was this Government of " ignorance and vice " overthrown ? We have heretofore been told of the dividing of the negro vote , of the return of the colored man to a sense of fealty to his old master , but Mr. MCCRADY says : " It has so far been found impossible to divide the negro vote or in any appreciable degree to affect it , even in those cases in which the utmost effort has been made to do so . " To how many solemn asseverations of the past does this admission give the lie ! Then he plainly and plumply declares that " under our election law as it now stands , in order to secure the control of the Government to the intelligent race , that is , to the white people , but one of two courses is open to us , that of violence or fraud . " Violence he declares to be no longer practicable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rid of as speedily as possible . What , then , is the problem in the mind of this representative South Carolinian ? Not to admit the negro 's rights as a citizen , prepare him for their exercise , and persuade him to a use of his power for the common benefit of all the people . Not to accept him as a fellow-citizen , and so fuse his sentiments with those of the community at large as to make the political cleavage forsake the color line , but to contrive some ingenious way of filching from him the exercise of his rights through a registration law . Mr. MCCRADY says plainly for himself and his political associates , " We did not give the negro his vote ; we did not , and do not now , admit his moral or political right to it . " He will only admit that negro suffrage has been " permanently fixed upon us " and can not be wholly got rid of . The question , then , is " what to do with it . " The Constitution of South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It provides that all male citizens of the United States of the age of 21 , not under certain specified disabilities and having certain qualifications as to residence in State and county , shall , " without distinction of race , color , or former condition , " be entitled to vote " for all officers that are now , or hereafter may be , elected by the people , and upon all questions submitted to the electors at any election . " It also declares that the . " General Assembly shall never pass any law that will deprive any of the citizens of this State of the right of suffrage except for treason , murder , robbery , or dueling , whereof the persons shall have been duly convicted . " It is in the face of this that arguments are employed , which can not be said even to be plausible , in support of a proposition the avowed purpose of which is , by act of the General Assembly , to deprive citizens of the right of suffrage for illiteracy and on . account of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This is proposed without amendment of the Constitution , and without the consent of the citizens to be disfranchised . Plainly , Mr. MCCRADY has discovered a new form of political fraud , but not a way of escape from the consequences of the old .
