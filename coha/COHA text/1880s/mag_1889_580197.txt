FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION . EMERSON says , " If there is any period one would desire to be born in , is it not the age of revolution , . . . when the energies of all men are searched by fear and by hope ? " New England , for many years before the civil war , was the scene of a slow moral revolution , which will never be fully understood until a good deal is known about the private lives of many comparatively humble individuals and families . To contribute to this knowledge is my purpose in offering some reminiscences of that period . Apologies are due to the public when narratives personal to the writer are imposed upon it ; and my excuse for the story I have to tell lies in the fact that this very element of personality sometimes helps to make real to readers the environment of a past epoch . It not infrequently happens that though we care nothing at all for Jane or Joseph , we are still very much affected if we are told just what Joseph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or how Jane felt while the shells were flying over Yicksburg . I have no material earthquakes or batthes to describe , but I have hoped that interest might attach to an account of the way in which the principles of liberty were handed down from generation to generation in one family , and became part of the vital experience of all its members , even the young children . In the household which I shall seek to re-create on paper , all daily life had an anti-slavery background , and , to carry the figure farther , this background was painted on a Quaker canvas . The elements of anti-slavery and Quaker beliefs so blended in the characters of the parents , and so conspired together to endow existence with whatever peculiarity it had , that I can not separate them now and give the reminiscences of one influential factor without those of the other . My great-grandfather , William Buffum , a man in the early f , rime of life during our Revolutionary War , was a farmer possessed of property and wielding local influence . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slaves were still held in the North . He sheltered , in a little 1 Livy , i. 29. // house on his land , a family of negroes who had escaped from bondage in New York State . They had been in hiding for some time before they came under Mr. Buffum 's protection , and a baby had been born during this interval . The father considered this child different from the others , and used to tell his experiences to Arnold , the young son of his benefactor . One can easily fancy the quaintly dressed Quaker lad standing by , his serious eyes growing more thoughtful as the tale proceeded to its end , for the freedman always finished with these words : " An ' Pedro love all his chll'en , but he love Cuffy best of all , because Cuffy was born free . " This speech sank into the listener 's heart , and made an Abolitionist of my grandfather , who grew up and led an active moral and mental life . At his death he left to his descendants a large number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty years of the republic 's history . Those taken out in the beginning of the century bear witness to the fact that governmental business was not very pressing then , since they show that it was the custom for the President , the Secretary of State , and the AttorneyGeneral to sign all such papers . These documents , therefore , which represeiit little other wealth , past or present , are rich with the autographs of Thomas Jefferson , James Monroe , James Madison , and John Quincy Adams . Arnold Buffum spent some years in Europe between 1825 and 1830 . He knew the English Abolitionists , and in Paris he frequented Lafayette 's salon . He brought home a story which the Frenchman told him , that Washington never learned to control his naturally violent temper . This statement , imparted to me in my childhood , together with an incident which Lafayette related confirmatory of it , I naturally held in such reverential credence that it prevented me from accepting the calmsouled image of Washington presented by more public chroniclers for the consideration of juvenile minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know not . The Indian matter was so far a topic of conversation as to lead the marquis to say that he was very much interested in that race when he was in America . A few years after his return to his native country , Mr. Buffum went , as a matter of course , to Boston , and sought out William Lloyd Garrison in that " small chamber " where , " friendless and unseen , " he toiled over his types . The act was the inevitable result of the Quaker 's nature , of his principles and his past life . All his experience , inherited and personal , converged naturally in the pathway that led him up those narrow stairs to the printer 's room . Mr. Garrison was thankful enough for Mr. Buff um 's sympathy , - the sympathy of a respectable , middle-aged Quaker with the enthusiastic purposes of " a poor young man . " It was one of those instances , frequent in history , when the lcsser man , by dint of coming at the right time , seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time soon restores the correct perspective , and the stature of the real leader looms up in its due proportion . Nevertheless , a light remains on the figure of the other , who dared to be as true , though he was not as great . Thus it was that Arnold Buffum became the first president of the first society ever formed in the United States to advocate the immediate abolition of slavery , and he was also its first lecturer in the field . Meanwhile , two of his daughters busied themselves in a female anti-slavery society in Fall River , which place was then merely a big village . Somebody proposed that one or two colored women should be admitted as members of this society , and other good ladies objected vehemently thereto . They wanted the slaves to be free , but they did not want 6 // any negroes to belong to the same association to which they did , or to seat themselves iiear their white persons while they were bending their philanthropy to bear on the lot of their race . Mr. Buffum 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that early day , free from any prejudice against color . One of them was a woman of decided character , who afterwards became the wife of Mr. B. , the first mayor of Fall River . This gentleman was at one time a member of Congress , and when Millard Fillmore came to the city , after his presidential term was over , he proposed , having known him in Washington , that he and his wife should go and pay their respects to the ex-dignitary . Mrs. B. refused to go , saying emphatically that she would never shake the hand which signed the Fugitive Slave Law . Although the Quakers have always had the credit of being anti-slavery , the New England yearly meeting did not show itself to be , in season and out of season , disposed to insist on the abolition of the obnoxious institution after it had been retired to the distant Southern States . Many Friends deprecated the discussion of the matter because it was calculated to stir up strife . A prominent Quaker wrote home from Ohio , while Arnold Buffum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ought to be silenced in some way . Finally , the yearly meeting decided that the religious houses belonging to the scattered societies in New England must not be used for secular purposes . This resolve prohibited antislavery meetings in them ; and then my mother decided that if the slave was to be thus shut out from the church of her ancestors , she must depart with him . She was influenced by the same sort of indignant determination to make common cause with those who needed aid that used to induce Wendell Phillips to walk a steamboat deck all night in coinpany with Frederick Douglass , rather than enjoy in the cabin below the shelter denied to his comrade . The step which this woman proceeded to take was really heroic , for she was at that time an ardent Friend and a person of intense religious experience , having no sense of separation from the Quakers in theology , sentiment , or moral ideas except as related to this one question of " bearing testimony " against slavery . Quakerism , it must be remembered , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held to be born a Quaker , just as the child of Americans is born an American . The instincts of this faith were part of my mother 's flesh and blood , brain ' and heart . Her mind spoke naturally in its formulas , her spirit moved easily to expression in its conventionalities . Such an one might find another faith for her soul , but scarcely another religious language for her tongue to use in this world . It requires nerve , something like physical as well as moral courage , to break a spiritual relation such as was hers to Quakerism . She determined to do it , and thus threw the Society of Friends into an odd dilemma . It was an age of dilemmas for American establishments in church and state . My mother sent into the meeting a written statement that she resigned her inembership . The elders informed her that that availed nothing . The Book of Discipline , which is the code of rules governing Quakers , provided no way for a member to dissolve his connection with the society of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disowned " for various kinds of ill-conduct , but apparently it had not entered into the minds of the framers of the Discipline that anybody could ever be so misguided as to think the society guilty of ill-conduct , and to wish to sever connection with it . When this was explained to my mother , she replied simply that , by rule or without rule , she had left the meeting , and that she should take no // further steps about it . She expected then to c6ntinue always her regular attendance upon its religious services , but after a while she discovered that her ideas of life and of theology were altering , - an alteration which was aided by talks with the Burleigh brothers and with Theodore Parker , who visited the Rhode Island home , when anti-slavery or other work brought them to that part of the country . She no longer felt much interest in the Quaker meetings , and ceased to go to them . Meanwhile , the puzzled authorities of the society decided that her wish to resign her membership might very reasonably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee to " deal with her . " After their interview , they reported that they did not find her " inclined to make Friends satisfaction , " - using a technical Quaker phrase which the " world 's people " must interpret as best they may . For this lack of " inclination " the mother of our family was then quietly expelled , as though she had never gone out herself . The father was always an Abolitionist , but in perplexing times equally tender consciences construe duties differently ; and while he did not oppose his wife 's action , he never felt it incumbent upon him to leave the Quaker meeting . My father 's house in those days was eminently fitted for a purpose to which it was sometimes put , namely , the concealment of fugitive slaves . It was full of unexpected corners and cupboards . It had chambers in odd relation to each other , and there was a room in the attic that was usually locked , where jelly was hidden - was it really hidden ? - from the children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it was a mysterious closet , whose ( loor I think I never saw open more than once ; and I can not now believe that it sheltered nothing more strange than old clothes , or gave protection from no enemy more dangerous than the moth . That was a place , had such been needed , for dusky hunted outlaws . Practically , I presume our poor fugitives generally slept in beds in our best rooms , and ate jelly openly at our own table . I confess I do net remember exactly what was the family custom as to these points , but I should be very much surprised were any diving into the records of this remote period of domestic simplicity to divulge the practice of any less democratic and fraternal habit towards these outcast ones . Was it not Colonel Higginson who said , long afterwards , that he had all his life enjoyed the privileges of the best society , to wit , that of Abolitionists and fugitive slaves ? None of that earlier generation of " fanatics " thought it necessary to apologize for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the great thoroughfares of the Underground Railway , but on a side track . To speak plainly , it sometimes happened that slaves in Southern ports secreted themselves on vessels bound for Massachusetts harbors , whence they were occasionally conveyed by anti - slavery friends to my aunt , Mrs. B. , in Fall River . She would fit them for a further journey , and a worthy Scotchmnan of the town , Mr. R. A. , would take them , concealed in the back part of a carryall , and ( Irive them across the country in the night to our place . If it seemed best , the house doors were locked while the refugees were sheltered , so that no officers of the law could obtain easy entrance ; and much advice was given to the children how they must behave if the constables should come and carry the father and mother off to jail . It is needless to say that the little ones promised to be very geod if such a thing should occur . Possibly in their relish for martyrdom they almost hoped it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It does report , however , that these young persons felt a great admiration for an Irishman who did chores on the // place , and who had been heard to say that in such a case he for one would fight before he would let the officers have their unhappy prey . Fighting , real fighting , it must be borne in mind , implied a very energetic expression of unwillingness to these children , since their parents had tried to indoctrinate them with the theories of Quaker and Garrisonian non-resistance . It was rather a harder task to make non-resistants of us all than Abolitionists , but the effort was attended with at least some temporary success ; for one of our number remembers gravely asking the mother why she supposed Wendell Phillips had never adopted the extreme doctrine as to the wrongfulness of resisting evil by force . When some explanation was given which sought not to convict Mr. Phillips of any very marked moral laxity , - for in those days Mr. Phillips was on ho account to be blamed for anything in a family of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight or nine years old , made a serious remark to the effect that she did not see what was going to prevent a man who thought it was ever right to kill anybody from killing people almost any time ! It would certainly seem as if human slaughter appeared to be a natural sort of occupation , to this youthful person . After a fugitive had been harbored in our house until it was deemed safe for him to be launched again into the world , my father used to put him on the train and go part way to Worcester with him . There was one conductor on the road who could be trusted with the perilous secret , and the outlaw would be left in his charge , to be started at the junction on the northern train . My parents gave each refugee , as they speeded him away , an addressed envelope , and this posted in the first Canadian town which was reached would come back to tell the friends who waited behind that they need be anxious no longer , for the exile was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the waving of the stars and stripes . One evening there came a ring at our door , and when my father opened it a sudden burst of laughter startled the inmates of the house . The Scotch guide from Fall River stood there with a negro man who had been disguised by my aunt in a bonnet and shawl . The fellow , in spite of his dangerous plight , was so conscious of his ludicrous appearance that he could not contain himself . It was the fugitive who laughed then , but many years later it was the world that laughed at a fugitive of a different hue , who because he had sought to keep other men in slavery was destined to don a woman 's clothes and fly before the advancing law . When the Fugitive Slave Law was passed , many colored persons who had escaped from the South long before , and had lived in peaceful security in the North , felt that they were no longer safe within the borders of the United States . These unfortunate creatures huddled together their poor effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for years in Fall River , when it was reported that the constable who arrested Anthony Burns had been seen prowling about the dwellings of the colored people in town . The Abolitionists became alarmed , thinking she was probably the object of his search , and sent her with three of her children to my parents , who kept her several days , till an older son , who had been at work at a distance , could be brought to go with her to Canada . In fear and terror this mother waited with her babies behind the locked doors of our house , and special plans were made to save her youngest child , should the officers get possession of the others . Finally the unhappy family were started on their journey , and the superintendent of the road going north from Worcester vowed he would put on an extra train to speed them onward , if it were necessary to do // so , to secure their escape . The envelope came back at last , with the Canadian postmark , but no other tidings were ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only persecute . Impositions were of course sometimes practiced on the Abolitionists . My parents once sheltered for several days a very charming , lovable young man , nearly white , who they afterwards had reason to think was a desperate criminal that had recently escaped from prison in Albany . On one occasion two men came together to our place . The colored steward of a coasting vessel which ran between a Southern and a Massachusetts port secreted them on the bark , when it was bound on its homeward journey . He did not expect to go South again , and so dared to do it . He stowed one man in the hold , and kept the other hidden in his own berth . When the vessel reached its destination , he made them promise to remain on board all day , so as to give him time to get away inland , in order that his connection with their presence should not be suspected by the captain , if they were discovered . While they waited in such suspense as may be imagined , the captain went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to the very berth where the frightened slave lay , and reached across him to feel of the wall . " An ' oh , " said the fugitive afterwards , " I made myself as flat as I could , but he felt me , an ' pulled me out ; an ' I fell a-beggin ' an ' a-prayin ' of him to let me go . " The captain answered not a word , but turned on his heels , and left the dusky creature who was crying to him ; and as he went up-stairs he locked two doors behind him . " But God knows , " continued the poor fellow , " I could n't go back down dah , an ' me a-layin ' along-side of dat wharf . " He burst open the doors and fled up the staircase into the cold March sunlight . He sprang off the boat , - the captain ordered the sailors to stop him , but they never stirred , - and , bareheaded , without coat or shoes , the negro darted hither and thither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who took him in and cared for him . " An ' they fed me , " he said , " an ' they warmed me , an ' they put a coat on me , an ' they put shoes on me , an ' I du n no what they did n't do to me . " He told his new friends about the other man who was still on the vessel , and in danger of being discovered by the captain , who evidently did not want to run the risk of being branded on the hand , like Jonathan Walker , when he returned to the South . A white man , who was taken into confidence , offered to get the fugitive away , and was told just where he was secreted . The rescuer went down after dark to the vessel , chatted with the captain , poked about the boat , and found the man . One can only fancy the excitement of that moment , and in what quick and agitated whispers instructions were given the negro what to do . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the black man also , left the boat , - a trifling fact which the sulky captain did not notice . We had in our family for a time as cook an old colored woman named Ellen . She and her son Charles had been slaves in Maryland , but their freedom had been purchased for them . She was a thrifty , useful creature , whom we all liked . The thing I most clearly remember about her is that she used to make a stew of the feet of chickens , which was pleasing to our juvenile appetites . We must have been a stupidly incurious set of youngsters , wholly absorbed in our own ways of living , for notwithstanding our intimacy with her I do not recollect that we ever got her to talk with us about her Maryland life , or tell us stories of her former experience . Ellen expressed a desire to attend religious services soon after she came to our village , and was recommended to // go to the Baptist church . She went once , and refused to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I never was in such a cold place . " " Why ? " asked my mother innocently . " Did n't they have a fire ? " " Oh , " cried the disgusted negro woman , " mebbe they had fire , but they did n't have no real religion in them ! I did n't hear a single groan there ; no , not so much as a grunt ! A child 's ideas of what information people possess as a matter of course vary according to circumstances . One of our small band once mentioned Socrates in Charles 's presence , and when he asked who Socrates was made no reply , supposing that he knew and was inquiring in fun , and our mother had to interfere to draw an answer from the little lips . The unimportant fact that the questioner had been a slave in a State where he was not allowed to learn even to read did not seem to the eightyear old Northerner a sufficient cause to make ignorance about the Athenian philosopher presumable in any full-grown person . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In those days common people in New England had scarcely heard of the labor question . We lived peacefully and prosecuted our affairs calmly , while we condemned our Southern neighbors for sin , and our Northern ones for lukewarmness in regard to that sin , without once suspecting that conditions would ever arise which could cause our relations to human beings to come under criticism almost as sharp as that with which we favored the relations of the slave-holder to his slaves . There was a refreshing simplicity about the anti-slavery issues as they lay in the minds of Garrisonian Abolitionists . They were very nourishing to the soul , though they sometimes conduced to a spirit of self-righteousness , and induced a habit of disobedience to the old command that we should judge not , lest we be judged . My private opinion is that most of these so-called fanatics , whether with or without good reason for their courage , would have feared no judgment which could have been meted out to them on earth or in heaven . They did not see two sides to any phase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only right and one only wrong in all matters appertaining to it . As for worldly wisdom , they believed the phrase to be a contradiction in terms . There was but one wisdom , and that was not of this world , - it was of God . They were called irreligious because they termed the American church a brotherhood of thieves . The fact was that the certainty of their religious conviction as to right and wrong gave them the cool daring to use such phrases . They held that God cared for consequences when men did their duty . It was strong doctrine for eager , impressible children to imbibe . In our household we took it very seriously . Antislavery held the place in our family life which had been withdrawn from the occupancy of church influences , since they had been deemed tainted by the spirit of moral compromise . We made no jest and no play about anything concerned with Abolitionism , - unless it could be considered trifling with the sacred subject to name a pet kitten after Jessie Fr6inont . But then Garrisonians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Fr6mont 's name scarcely favored an approach to the inner temple of the family political creed . We used to play we were Indians , as we ran through the long aisles of green corn in the fields that stretched down to the river behind our house , but I do not remember that we ever pretended to be fugitives or slave-holders , or played at anything of the sort . At the period of our family life , as regards our relations to anti-slavery and to Quakerism , which I am best able to // describe , our nursery and school-room were filled by a group of the younger children of our parents , the older ones having passed To where beyond these voices there is peace . " Our habits were simple , and as we did not go to school , but received tuition at home , our development was not affected by a variety of influences which might have opposed and modified that exerted within the domestic shelter . Our garb still bore traces of Friendly fashions . The change from one religion to another is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first religion has been one like Quakerism , prone to express itself in conventions and mannerisms , the transition period is inevitably marked by whimsicalities of conduct and curiosities in the way of opinion and feeling which , like fogs and dancing lights , obscure or render grotesque the solemn thoughts behind them . Hence there was great question among us whether hats were not too gay for the elder daughter to wear , and bonnets were made for her of drab silk drawn over a frame , and corded in little rows . Bonnets , however , would never stay on her head , but always tumbled to the back of her neck , and before she was ten years old her own preferences were consulted so far that she was allowed to wear hats , with the provision that although they might be trimmed under the brim with scarlet ribbons , the decoration of the crown was to be sober in color . In fact , notwithstanding the objection our parents had to concessions in politics , this child 's head-gear was for many years a matter of compromise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our walls , for strict Quakers do not thus ornament their houses ; and one good Friend , in the early years of our gradual departure from the ancient ways , mournfully rebuked my mother for keeping a plaster image , called The Fisher Boy , standing in an empty fireplace . He had come to make what is called a " religious visit , " and he said - saintly , ignorant soul that he was - that he could not help , when he saw it , thinking of what " our Saviour said , that thou shalt not make to thyself any graven image , " etc . It is perhaps needless to add that our mother did not feel , after this remark , as if she were likely to receive much spiritual enlightenment from the worthy brother . We had some pictures , as far back as I can remember , - an engraving of Correggio 's Holy Night , and certain portraits , a print of George Fox , one of Wendell Phillips and of Theodore Parker , and that one of William Lloyd Garrison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am in earnest , I will not equivocate , I will not excuse , I will not retreat a single inch , and I will be heard . " Our library was not large , but sufficient to insure some culture , though the works of Shakespeare and Milton were not there at first , and those of Young and Cowper were . Shakespeare was , however , soon conceded , and the reading of his plays formed an integral part of the education sought for the children . Anti-slavery literature was , of course , always open to us . Henry C. Wright once questioned one of the girls when she was six years old , and decided that she had already read Uncle Tom 's Cabin . She was thenceforth considered a mild prodigy ; but she herself was afterwards inclined to think her familiarity with the story at that time arose from diligent study of an illustrated abbreviation of it , part in prose and part in rhyme , prepared for infant minds , rather than from a complete mastery of the original volumes . Certain it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually read the novel she was still so young that when she came to Topsy 's assertion , " I love candy and sich , " she supposed " sich " to be the name of // some especially delectable sweetmeat . Another book which this same little maid was fond of poring over at odd moments was a kind of anti-slavery catechism , wherein , by means of questions and answers , the cardinal doctrines of the Garrisonian Abolitionists were duly set forth and explained for the benefit of children . She was , in consequence of this occupation , quite able , at a very tender age , to give reasons very satisfactory to herself for believing that the " Union with slaveholders " should be dissolved , and for thinking it wrong to vote under the Constitution as it then stood . Whittier was naturally the favorite family poet , and even the publication of Hiawatha scarcely obscured this preference . Our mother used to gather us about her , and have us read aloud the Quaker poet 's verses in concert with her . This vocal exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a household whose musical faculty had not been prostrated by two centuries of Quakerism and consequent disuse . We also committed his poems to memory , for childish declamation . Some of his lines , whoever pronounces them or in whatever manner they are spoken , still waken in my ear , like a spiritual echo , the young sing-song accents in which I heard them uttered then . And what words they were to sink into the souls of children in times when every word meant an existing fact ! " Gone , gone , - sold and gone , To the rice-swamp , dank and lone , From Virginia 's hills and waters , - Woe is me , my stolen daughters ! " Or the stanzas of the Branded Hand , which epitomize a complete moral philosophy as to the relations of man to man and to God , and declare That he who treads profanely on the scrolls of law and creed , In the depths of God 's great goodness may find mercy in his need ; But woe to him who crushes the soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the awful form of God . " Soul was , of course , emphasized to the extent of our juvenile ability , in delivering this passage ; and not a bad word , either , is it to teach children to treat with reverential emphasis . There is no hint in these lines that the lower classes of human beings are hardly worthy the effort of the higher to save them . " What difference is there , " asked a thoughtful young man of me , not long ago , " between a mere man and a brute ? " Whittier 's verses taught the youtl* of that earlier generation that " the one sole sacred thing beneath the cope of heaven is man . When men believe their fellow-beings are little better than beasts they go to their aid reluctantly , lest it be not worth while to do so , or at best with a sort of melancholy tinging their determination . The Abolitionists believed that people were unlike animals , and were well worth saving , and so they possessed not only the courage of the martyrs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His was the happiest life I ever * said Wendell Phillips of William Lloyd Garrison . The rendition of Anthony Burns was the first public event which I remember to have agitated our nursery . My mother wrote a little dialogue , which the two older boys , lads of eight and ten , recited at a village festival called an " exhibition . " They personated two school-boys , one of whom was represented as being - perhaps rather unnaturally - unhappy because a fugitive had been returned to slavery from Boston . " Sumner has got whipped , " announced one of the boys on a certain day , and then had to explain very carefully what had happened before a younger child could comprehend the sad and disgraceful story . After that , the newspapers were searched , and much interest was taken by the children in reading // every item about the great Senator 's health , especially during the long years he spent in Europe . We were simply delighted at the death of Brooks . I remember rushing into our school-room with a wild cry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The instinct for savage justice is , I fancy , more natural to children than any feeling of sympathy or pity . Hence we were only a trifle awed , and not in the least sorry , when our mother told us rather solemnly that the assassin 's death had been very painful . Indeed , whether she meant it or not , I am quite sure I gathered from the tone of her voice the impression that she too considered that pain to be in the nature of divine retribution . Our juvenile politics were somewhat affected by the Fr6mont campaign . We read poetry celebrating the exploits in the West of the popular hero , and what little sentiment was developed in us at that tender age was gratified by the romance of Jessie Benton 's love . Our grandfather , Arnold Buffum , visited us at this season . He had never felt the force of Mr. Garrison 's objections to political action , and was an ardent Republican . He went out into the fields and talked with the harvesters , and when he found one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . " The village bestirred itself and got up public meetings . At one of these , my grandfather , while making a speech , fainted in the middle of a sentence , just as he pronounced the word " liberty . " My mother , in commenting upon the occurrence , said that very likely her father would never speak in public again , for he was an old man by this time , and she thought it was very fitting that that word should be his last . My small heart swelled to hear such talk , and I felt that my grandfather must be a very important person ; and had I had any clear notion what a martyr was , I should certainly have supposed that his fainting in the service of Fr*mont was something nearly akin to martyrdom . Under all these influences our oldest boy swerved from strict Garrisonian principles , and went over to the Free Soil party . Being by some eight years too young to vote for his caudidate , he contented himself with rigging up a United States flag . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in those days . The boy got blue cloth , sewed white and red stripes on it , painted the stars in the proper place , and then wrote across the bottom the Frimont motto . He hoisted his banner on the barn . Then his younger brother went to work and made another flag , a large white one , and printed on it the Garrisonian shibboleth , " No Union with slave-holders , " and this he placed on the housetop . These two emblems of the divided nature of the family antislavery faith floated serenely on the breeze during the campaign which ended in the election of James Buchanan to the presidency . Several of our friends were interested in Spiritualism , and I heard at this period that a prophecy had been published in some paper to the effect that the struggle then pending would result in the choice of a President who would be a worse tool of slavery than any the country had yet had ; that he would not serve out his term , which would be followed or interrupted by a terrible war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this coming war . Of course all the abolition speakers who declaimed in our neighborhood were our guests , and I believe that the children of the house liked them one and all . Sojourner Truth came once , and arranged for a meeting in the village church . The old colored woman seemed so sure beforehand that she was going to have a large audience that my mother warned her that she must not be too much disappointed if only a few persons came to hear her . // " Oh , bless yer , chile , " retorted Sojourner , " I never troubles myself about no such thing as that . If the Lord sees fit to send me anywheres to speak , an ' do n't see fit to send anybody to hear , it ai n't no concern o ' mine . She told my mother that she had formerly mourned because she did not know how to read , but she had come not to mind it much ; " for , " she said , " if I could read , I s'pose I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other people 's , an ' now I have to think my thoughts out myself , an ' I may as well have em first hand as anybody . " I first saw William Lloyd Garrison in an anti-slavery meeting in Providence , and the eagerness with which I waited his entrance into the hall testified to the constancy of the teaching which had impressed a very young person with the conviction that she was to see in this then comparatively obscure agitator the really great man of his day . In later years , Mr. Garrison 's family and our own were on terms of friendly intimacy . He often visited our home , and the wondering awe with which I at first regarded him gradually grew into filial and familiar affection . No daily life was ever more perfect than Mr. Garrison 's , and no one was ever kinder or more lovable both as host and guest . My warmest memories of him , however , belong to a period and to occasions which remove them from consideration in this paper , but still I must refer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happiest and our saddest hours : that he stood by the coffins of our dead ; and that I saw him last , not long before his own death , when he smiled his benediction upon one of our number on the evening of her wedding-day . This leads me also to say that as many of the anti-slavery families of New England had been driven by various phases of their long moral warfare to break connection with the established churches , the leaders of the cause for whose sake they had made of themselves religious outlaws came to fill in their lives very much the same place that ministers had formerly held . If a death occurred , Mr. Garrison , or Mr. Phillips , or some other of the prominent speakers , was sent for to officiate at the funeral . Only such an one could say words which fitly embodied the moral aspirations and the religious hopes of his followers , and only such an one could offer the consolation suitable to men and women who had sacrificed social standing , business prosperity , church communion , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No one but an Abolitionist could enter into the heart of an Abolitionist in the supreme hour of bereavement , or could say , as Whittier did when the young Torrey died , with a full comprehension of what kind of excellence it was which had suiik into the grave , - " Be thy virtues with the living And thy spirit ours . " Indeed , nolody but an Abolitioiiist desired the perpetuation of those especial virtues and that unyielding spirit . So the leaders of the cause became quite naturally , and in the best sense of the words , the religious priests of their party . They officiated at Sunday meetings as well as conducted funerals , and doubtless would have performed the marriage ceremonies in anti-slavery families could they have done so legally . Our acquaintance with Wendell Phillips was never quite on the same footing as that with Mr. Garrison , partly , perhaps , because his wife was a childless invalid , and our family lives did not touch each other ; but the charm of his beautiful personality was so strong that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once winningly courteous to the little child who interrupted grave talk with some impatient question , and tenderly considerate to the same child when a fit of bashfulness caused it to stand dumb // and helpless before him , dreading to break in on his conversation with the farewell salutation which politeness required should be made at the hour of bed-time . It was in such simple ways that he won and kept affection , and made his entrance to a house a signal for joy to the children . There was an element in his nature somewhat difficult to understand , which in public declared itself in his apparent calmness while he was pouring forth his fiery eloquence . In private conversation , on the contrary , he permitted an easy play of superficial emotion in his words and manner . I fancy that he held so much in reserve that this minor manifestation of feeling was almost a necessity . However much or little he knew of art in its usual sphere of action , he was personally artistic ; that is , there was a quality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gesture with which he made them articulate . There was something graceful not only in his affections , but in his hatreds . He was artistic in oratory , because he not only spoke , but felt , according to some law of harmony , which caused all his passions as well as his moral sentiments to translate themselves into ideal forms . I never knew him intimately , and I saw most of him during the later years , which for various reasons probably were among the saddest of life . He was susceptible to the influences of society and friendship , and I have seen him several times when he was pleased and once or twice when he was gay ; and I recall the gentle smile with which he listened when , on one occasion , I made my baby , who was just beginning to talk , recite a few words from one of his own speeches . A tinge of melancholy often prevailed with him , and sometimes showed itself in ways that were pathetic , as if he had endured so much that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Probably many of those who were boys and girls in anti-slavery families during Mr. Phillips 's career formed their ideas of political ethics from his speeches , and some such found in his teaching a moral method which they have been able to apply to the questions that have loomed into prominence in later days . He foreshadowed , indeed , many of the political and ethical problems that have recently become important . He was perhaps the first American of gentle blood and breeding to perceive sympathetically the significance of the infant labor movement . He may have made mistakes in his estimates of certain men or measures connected with it , but no errors in such matters of detail , committed in the vague and confused beginning of a historic period or evolution , are of any consequence , compared with the inimense merit of having seen so early that a great idea was struggling into birth . The tendency of his mind was , I think , distinctly opposed to the no-government theories which sway such men as Tolstoi on the one side of the radical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their final aims and ideals of life are similar to those by which he was actuated , and one can not help wondering whether , if he were living now , he would be at all influenced by them . He was a consistent believer in government of the people by the people , yet he said to me , not many years before his death , that the ideal government would be one by an enlightened and conscientious oligarchy , were it possible to get such an oligarchy . He did not think it was possible , because he held that power always demoralized its possessor . He detested mobs , though he believed in revolution . He certainly thought that if men did wrong society had the right to do something about it ; hence he was not an extreme individualist , although he had set his individual conscience against the law and the socity and the church of his day . *y mother had a habit of preserving newspapers , and our attic was stored 1889. - 175 // with rolls upon rolls of old Liberators and Anti-Slavery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a time , and read with a fascinated attention the reports of stirring debates and eloquent speeches , and thereby not only learned the anti-slavery history of the country , but got at the very heart of a movement in which I was too young to share . There were others beside myself , among the children of that period , who in some similar way experienced a sort of participation in a struggle which closed just as they were ready to enter into it actively . To such as these there ensued a mental age , even while they were still young in the flesh . Nothing makes the mind feel old like the sense of having been intimately connected with a phase of life that is wholly dead , and these youths had entered into the spirit of the anti-slavery epoch as fully as their elders . They have followed its heroes to the grave , and find it strange , " With so much gone Of life and love , to still live on . " Sometimes , they almost feel that their keenest interests , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fate . They were trained for a conflict in which they were not permitted to fight , and like the last knight of the Round Table , when that circle was dissolved " which was an image of the mighty world , " they go forth " companionless " to meet " new men , strange faces , other minds . " It was by means of these hoarded newspapers that I became familiar with the wit of Edmund Quincy , who spent his best powers in a series of letters to the Standard* His style was elegant and his mind effervescent , but his heart directed the bubbling action of his brain , and so reform instead of literature received that rare and delicate wine into its chalice . When John Brown made his attack on Harper 's Ferry our quiet household was deeply stirred . Mrs. S. , a sister of my mother 's , took her eldest son and traveled through shuddering Maryland to Charlestown , and by persistent effort obtained admission to the old man 's prison cell . She found that there was no way she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few kind words . Deeply impressed by his manner and character , which she said were far finer and grander than she had expected , she returned home , and devoted all her energies for the next few weeks to procuring for him such comforts as the authorities permitted him to have . After his death she continued her friendly ministrations to his young comrades , and concerned herself in a plan to rescue two of them . She became especially interested in Stephens and Hazhitt , who were not executed until the following March . She corresponded with Stephens , and the letters she received from him proclaimed him to be a man of simple , earnest , sincere nature , and of unpretending heroism . She entertained his friends in her home , and speeded on her way a young girl who went to Virginia , and , literally on her knees , vainly besought the governor to pardon him . After the execution of Stephens and Hazhitt , Mrs. S. and her husband had the bodies of the victims brought to their house for funeral honors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. to lose Southern trade , a result which did not prove wholly unfortunate , since , when the war broke out , the firm with which he was connected had few non-paying Southern creditors over whom to mourn . In this connection I find it incumbent on me to make a confession . The only time I remember to have felt shy or shame-stricken over the family peculiarities of political opinion was on that December day when John Brown was hanged . Some of my village comrades asked me who was dead , that we had crape on our door . They asked so simply , and seemed so unconscious that // anything was happening in distant Vii ' - ginia which could possibly cause grief in Rhode Island , that I became suddenly abashed with a vague sense that it was a little absurd to be so different from one 's neighbors as to put crape on one 's door when nobody else did . I hesitated somewhat and made my answer brief , as if I wished to close conversation on that subject . It must , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it may be that my little friends had in their turn a moment of surprise and mortification because they were different from us , and had no sign of lamentation on their own doors . When the Southern troops fired upon Fort Sumter , childhood ceased in many a Northern home rather prematurely . During the following four years some strong emotion was felt every day , which was caused by something quite outside the trivial events of home life ; and such experience could not fail to leave lasting marks on the characters of the boys and girls of that generation . They were never quite careless and light-hearted , like the youths who are nurtured in peace . Their most mirthful meetings were " circles , " where the maidens sewed and knit for the soldiers . Their jests often savored of tragic and historic passions , as when my young brother vowed he would not cut his hair till Richmond was taken . My father was over sixty when the war broke out and threatened him with financial ruin , but he said that he djd not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if only the slaves got free . " He was a reserved man , shy of expressing feeling or thought , and the effort of speech on such a matter made his lips tremble . He had a very beautiful face , and it is still easy to fancy the glow upon it when , one September morning , he came eagerly into the house , and shouted up the staircase to the mother and children above the good news that the President had issued the first Emancipation Proclamation . After that day the Abolitionists were possessed of an assured hope that the country would be saved , and that " after freedom " her bells would " ring peace . " That hope , though sometimes obscured , was never wholly darkened again , even on that later April day when once more the father came sadly home , bearing the tidings that Abraham Lincoln had been murdered .
