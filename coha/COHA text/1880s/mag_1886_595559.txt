BALLOON EXPERIENCES OF A TIMID PHOTOGRAPHER . MY FIRST ASCENSION . A LTHOUGH I had always wished ( as who VX. has not ? ) to taste the pleasures ofa balloon ascension , yet , when in July , i88* , Mr. A. E. Moore confided to me that he was having a large balloon built , and asked my opinion concerning the possibility of photographing from it , nothing was further from my thoughts than that I should ever realize my aspirations . Later Mr. Moore consulted me about the construction of some parts , but still I had no suspicion that I was destined to be his companion in two ascensions. // The first ascension with the new balloon was made from Winsted on July 29th ; and on his return from what was to him an eventful trip , Mr. Moore proposed that I should go with him , and attempt the feat of photographing from the balloon . This direct proposal nearly threw me into a fever ; but I wished to go , and had a good degree of theoreticai confidence in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter , I decided to accept the offer , and after this decision , which I felt to be final , went about with the emotions of a criminal whose sentence is deferred ; for the day of the ascension had not been fixed . As , however , we expected to ascend soon , it became necessary to make all the photographic preparations at once ; and I wrote my orders for apparatus and materials in such a condition of nervous apprehension that , to this day , I wonder that they were understood . At length Mr. Moore came to me " with a piece of bad news , " as he put it . There was to be an ascension on the 2d of September ! Upon receiving the announcement , my heart stopped for two beats , and then went on to make up for lost time . Feeling now that I had but a week to live , my preparations and experiments were continued with great care . If a balloon was mentioned in my presence , my heart would give a fearful throb , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glanced up at a cloud floating high overhead , the thought would instantly come , " Perhaps I may go higher than that cloud ! " and 1 would at once grow sick and faint with the dizzying fear . I detail the " premonitory symptoms " with such minuteness , in order to show that no one who ever thinks of making an ascension can possibly dread the experience more than I did , and to give the reader some faint idea of the revulsion of feeling which took place when the ascension was made , and I at last found myself where I had feared to be - higher than the clouds ! On awaking in the morning of September 2d I was somewhat comforted to find that a strong wind was blowing from the north-west ; but on visiting the ground from which the ascension was to take place , I was shocked to discover that preparations for the inflation were already begun . I heard a gentleman say to the aeronaut , " Is n't it too windy for you to go ? " and listened eagerly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst fears : " Oh , no ; we would n't go if there was not wind enough to take us away from Winsted . " After partly inflating the balloon , it was decided , notwithstanding this courageous declaration , to wait awhile , and let the wind moderate if it would . At noon the wind was still strong , and to wfy great relief it was thought best to wait until two i . M. Two o'clock arriving found the wind apparently as fresh as ever , and after a consultation another postponement was made to four o'clock . Then , if the wind continued as strong as ever , Professor Brooks was to go alone . During the day some of my kind friends advised me not to go ; others offered to bet that I would n't ; and some one started a story that I had backed out . These latter persons receive a large share of gratitude , as they helped materially to strengthen my resolution . A large part of my fear was lest when once up , and too far away for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the business for which alone I was to be taken from the earth . As four o'clock approached , the inflation was resumed , and I noticed with an increase of alarm that the violence of the wind was much abated ; but , after all , there was a chance that only one could go up , as the gas , which had been standing in the balloon since morning , had lost much of its buoyancy . At last the great balloon was filled , and rounded out to its enormous proportions above the heads of the crowd . It is necessary for the passengers to take their places before the basket is attached to the netting . Moore took his place , and I was told to get my apparatus and get in ; camera and plate boxes were brought from their place of storage , and I made my way back through the crowd gathered around the balloon , conscious of being very white , and moving very carefully to avoid trembling . Even to the last moment the vague hope , which was half a fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sufficient to carry both the aeronaut and myself . The car contained , besides its two passengers and a rather bulky amount of photographic apparatus , a large coil of rope attached to the anchor , and two bags of sand for ballast , with a frame intended to hold my camera perpendicularly over an opening which had been left in the bottom of the car for the purpose of taking views directly beneath us , and a bag containing three pigeons . Having taken our places in the car , the hoop was raised above our heads , and the cords from the balloon netting were connected with pegs attached to the hoop , which in its turn is permanently fastened to the car by cords . Those who were holding the cords from the balloon were directed to let it up while a few men took hold of the car , to test the lifting power of the machine . In this final moment of uncertainty my breath came short , and it was hard to resist a wild impulse to separate the cords , which // seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the crowd . It was quickly ascertained that the balloon had sufficient lifting power , the word was given to let go , and with a gasp I caught one deep breath , as though in preparation for a plunge into water , as with a dizzying whirl the car swung to its position under the great gas-bag , and we were off ! I had looked forward with indescribable fears to the time when I should feel myself torn from the barth and lifted rapidly into the sky ; but now that the time was come , how unlike was the reality to my anticipations ! Instead of seeming to be carried rapidly upward , we felt as though standing at ease upon a secure support , while the crowd from the midst of which we had just started sank quickly below us , and was soon out of sight and hearing . Many things combine to make this my first ascension more impressive and more vividly remembered than any other , though they should be counted by the hundred . On the occasion of my first ascension my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly following , which did not occur in so great a degree again , as before my second ascension the distressing fears previously experienced were almost wholly absent . To complete the inflation of the balloon , and attend to the smaller details in the arrangement of the various apparatus , all of which are important when we consider that our lives are to hang literally by a thread , consume much time ; so that our ascension was not begun before five i . M. , when the sun had set behind the hills and the chill of gathering darkness was felt . We were soon lifted from the gloom of deepening twilight into the full glow of light and warmth from the sun , which , as we were carried up , presented the singular effect of a sudden sunrise in the west . This change in our physical condition was paralleled , in my own case at least , by an equal change in my feelings ; as we rose from darkness to light my spirits rose from a sickening fear to a wonderful sense of relief from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town we had left , and looking around , I was amazed at the wonderful widening of the horizon . From the point of our departure the view was shut in on all sides by the near hills ; at the next glance the Highlands and Catskills of the Hudson were in sight , while the view to the east was without limit , the eye ranging at will over stretches of hill and valley , a one might look out over the ocean . Any person who makes a balloon ascension is sure to hear from his friends one question , many times repeated : " How did it feel ? " After an earnest attempt to answer this question , I have been driven to the conclusion that the sensations of an ascension take the form of a tremendous mental impression , instead of producing any noticeable physical manifestations . In my . own experience the paralyzing fear felt at starting was entirely lost before we had risen one hundred feet , being followed by the emotions of surprise and wonder , growing into a strong feeling of awe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained in the air . All fear and dread were lost so suddenly that before we had been ten minutes from the earth I found myself wondering at the change , and trying to recall my former feelings for comparison with those of the present . As the balloon rises gradually , the many sounds of earth , striking the ear at first with confusing variety and force , grow quickly faint and distant . Soon only the loudest sound reaches us , and at last we attain an altitude which no earthly sound can reach . The only physical sensations noticed by me at any time are the ringing in the ears caused by the unbalanced pressure behind the tympanum , which may be relieved by swallowing , only to return again as the balloon is rising or falling ; and , at the greater heights , a curious feeling of lightness and inclination to breathe fuller and more frequently in the rarefied air . After our departure from the earth , and my recovery from the first impression of surprise , the rustling of the doves , our unwilling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly set free , and , after circling about the car a few times , decided on the proper course , and soon disappeared in the direction of Winsted . It was at about . this time that our attention was attracted to the peculiar appearance of Long Lake near Winsted . From the altitude at which we were sailing , the whole surface of the lake was in sight far below , giving us an excellent idea of the comparative size of its three bays and of the outline of its very irregular shores . The rays from the sun , still high in the west , were reflected directly to us from the surface of Third Bay , causing so bright a spot upon the rippling water that it could only be glanced at for an instant ; nor was the camera 's eye less dazzled than ours , for a spot of white appears* upon the picture of this scene , a photographic record of the phenomenon . The race-track east of the lake , so far below that the buildings were hardly visible , was apparently of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elliptical in shape . Another dove was now thrown out , its // actions giving us sufficient proof , were all other means lacking , of the increasing rarity of the air , as it exhibited much hesitation at leaving us . At first its wings beat the air rapidly for a short flight ; then it returned to the ballooti , perching upon the hoop near our heads ; seeming at last to gather courage for its plunge , it spread its wings , and , describing a series of ever-widening circles , was soon out of sight far beneath us . Now as never before could I realize the great variety of lake scenery in Litchfield county . One hundred bodies of water are indicated upon a map of this county , and it seemed to us that a large proportion of them were in sight at once , either sparkling brightly , as they reflected the setting sun , or lying , dark and cool , in the shadow of the hills . While passing directly over Shepherd 's Pond , in New Hartford , Mr. Moore referred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ease with which the bottom of lakes and rivers might be seen ; it was apparent to us that such statements should be made with caution , or some explanation should accompany them . There would seem to be only one position from which , under the proper conditions , it is possible to see objects at a considerable depth under water : the observer must be at not too great an angle with the vertical , and the water must be quite smooth . It is also necessary that the sun should be low down , so that there shall be no direct reflection of light from the surface of the water ; and though in the case of a s/ia/low pond the whole of the bottom might be seen , yet , when the body of water is of much depth , the bottom is only visible near the shore , except when the water is quite clear and the bottom has a light hue , reflecting the light which has reaohed it through the water . Having at length gained an altitude of over six thousand feet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was accordingly dropped from the bag in which it had been confined . The singular actions and evident fear of the creature excited at once our interest and pity . Three times , after as many attempted flights , the dove returned to perch on the hoop attached to the car , breathing rapidly , and evidently exhausted by the violence of its efforts to sustain itself in the rarefied air . At last , as we persisted in driving it away , it made another attempt at flight , which proving ineffectual , it was seen to turn and plunge directly downward with a velocity which soon carried it beyond our sight . As we continue rising , the scene becomes every moment more impressive in its grandeur ; the earth , with its network of streams and roads spread out below us , resembles a marvelously perfect map , with every variety of color and shading . The silence is absolute , unless broken by our own actions ; and the experience of being carried along without effort or consciousness of motion , over this wonderful picture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Silence , the least sound proceeding from the balloon or its occupants is startling in effect ; the blood is plainly heard as it pulses through the brain ; while in moments of extra excitement the beating of the heart sounds so loud as almost to constitute an interruption to our thoughts . The sound caused by a slight shifting of the gasbag inside the netting occasions frequent starts of alarm ; and the cracking of the willows of which the car is woven causes an involuntary grasp at the hoop or ropes . The sensation produced by a little gust of wind , often felt upon the face while the balloon is passing from one air-current to another , is weird and unearthly , and has caused me to glance in the direction from which it came , with the idea that I felt the breath of some invisible being . At last our barometer indicated an altitude of seven thousand two hundred feet , after which we began to descend slowly . From this height we enjoyed a magnificently extended view over an area much larger than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other mountains of Massachusetts were in sight , as small points above the dead level of the horizon ; to the east , beyond the Connecticut River , no prominent objects arrested the attention , but the landscape gradually rose up to the horizon , at the level , apparently , of the eye , showing many miles of country beyond the river ; to the south lay Long Island , beyond the narrow line of light which we knew to be the Sound ; while in the west , after ranging over the hills and valleys of Litchfield county , the eye rested upon the Catskills and the mountains forming the Highlands of the Hudson . The maplike effect of the landscape is very striking . The course of streams , with the different railroads and highways , may be traced for many miles , dividing the country into irregular plots , which are again subdivided by the farms . I was pleased to see the large area of forest which still remains , notwithstanding the great amount cut for lumber and the land annually cleared by the iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after which the balloon began to descend , we were compelled to resort to our ballast in order to remain longer at a considerable altitude . The frame mentioned as having been intended to hold my camera was first thrown out , as it was found to be unnecessary in our work ; we // watched it as it fell , whirling round and round until nearly out of sight . The sunset scene was one of the most beautiful I have ever witnessed . From clear , dark blue overhead , the sky gradually shaded down into deep red in the west ; and in this glorious setting of color , the sun , seeming slightly flattened , as when seen sinking at sea , blazed out a deep orange color . Suddenly our attention was caught by the blowing of a number of whistles ; we were again within hearing distance of the earth . My first thought was , " We are getting a salute " ; but we soon found that the whistling was from the factories in the many towns below us . In our position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once , as all were blown at the time for stopping work . At this time the trains on several railroads were in sight , and we could hear their rumbling faintly , while a surprisingly long time elapsed between our sight of a puff of steam from a locomotive and the hearing of the whistle . The balloon continued to descend , and soon we could distinguish human voices ; some remarks were exchanged with the inhabitants of the farm-houses we were passing . An interesting phenomenon observed by us , and to which I have seen no reference by other a*ronauts , is the distinctness of the echo returned from the earth . When within easy shouting distance quite long sentences are returned with startling clearness ; many times I was deceived into thinking that those below were mocking us by a repetition of our questions . The order to pack the instruments caused me a feeling of deep regret that my voyage should end so quickly . Having left the ground with the greatest reluctance , I was about equally unwilling to return to it ! As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the western side of which was a precipice two or three hundred feet high , while its flat top was thickly wooded . Well knowing the inconvenience of a landing in the woods , Mr. Moore at once threw out the last of our ballast in the hope of clearing the trees ; but the balloon sunk rapidly , and soon we could hear the rustling of the wind through the tree-tops , and then the chirping of crickets . One or two sand-bags were sacrificed , and Mr. Moore was stooping to remove his shoes , when I saw that we should clear the woods , and we turned to see where the balloon would land . Not until then did we see that the land beyond the trees was on a lower level ; in fact , that the east face of the hill was higher and more abrupt than the west . Our balloon cleared the trees by only a few feet , and we were then directly over the precipice ; all consciousness of support from the balloon was for a moment lost ; we seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath as we sank over the edge . This impression was of short duration , yet I learned in that moment how it feels to fall from a great height . Our confidence restored , we glanced back at the gray , lichen-covered rocks , and then down to the pasture towards which we were gently sinking ; we narrowly escaped the top of a large tree , and descended to the ground so slowly that we might have gathered leaves from the tree in passing . We struck the ground so lightly that I hardly felt the shock , and then , standing in the car while the gas was escaping , I could feel the relaxation following a period of intense excitement . Soon the sound of hurrying feet was heard , and quickly a party gathered about us , all eager to help and ask questions . MY SECOND ASCENSION . As we were compelled to wait until five i . M. before beginning our ascension on September 2d , I had very little confidence of success in my attempt at photographing ; and the results obtained proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of year the light is very weak , so that the taking of instantaneous views is difficult , even under the most favorable conditions . When we remember that in addition to this the light also grows rapidly weaker as the sun approaches the west , it is easy to understand that the conditions were very unfavorable to balloon photography . When the result was known , Mr. Moore offered to make another ascension solely for the purpose of photographing . As my first ascension had quite overcome my fears and had left me with an earnest desire to again experience the pleasures of an aerial voyage , I gladly agreed . My first ascension enabled me fully to understand what I had suspected before , that it was a much more difficult matter to get instantaneous views from a balloon than from some more secure support . After much time spent in altering apparatus , constructing some new parts , and in further experiments , it was decided to make an ascension on October i6th , if the weather should be favorable . The day was all that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the atmosphere ; the wind was very gentle , blowing from the south-west , and high in air we could // see by the motion of the clouds that there was an upper current , also moving slowly , toward the south-east . As the inflation progressed , and it was evident that we might soon be off , I found it impossible to ignore a rapid increase of nervousness at the prospect . Those who have made many ascensions assure me that this dread felt at the moment of starting is rarely outgrown by any amount of experience . We went up much more slowly than before , and were for some time within hearing distance of our friends . This was because our ascensional force was more nearly balanced by the greater weight of sand carried . We were soon over the hills east of Winsted , and before turning from it exposed one plate on a part of the town on which the illumination seemed particularly favorable , and which fortunately proves to be one of our best views . This photograph , taken just as we attained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp as some of the others , is nevertheless one of our best , owing to its fine gradation of light and shade , and to the superior delicacy of chemical effect in the negative . The portion of Winsted included in the view is at the northern end of the borough , and at the lowest point within its limits reached by the stream which supplies power to the factories closely set along its banks . Part of our main street passes through the center of the view , and some other streets are included , mostly occupied by dwellings . Within the limits of the picture are three of the many factories whose business forms the chief support of the place . Many of the garden plots near dwelling-houses are plainly shown ; also the woods on a steep hillside at the farther side of the view . The shadow from a passing cloud darkens one corner of the picture , blotting out all definition in that part , and showing how useless it would be to try such work without a good light . As some may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will give a description of it . We used five-by-eight-inch plates , which size seems best suited to our purpose , as it allows a considerable extent of country to be included in the view , while the apparatus need not be unduly bulky or heavy . The camera was quite light , as all the apparatus used in a balloon must be , but not so fragile as to sacrifice rigidity in keeping the distance at which the plate is set from the lens , as this is of even more importance than lightness . The plates used , which must be of the utmost sensitiveness , were contained in the necessary number of dry-plate holders ; which in turn were carried in two boxes made to pack them securely . In any future ascensions these boxes will be provided with locks , as we have learned to our cost that nothing will so excite the curiosity of the average hotel . porter as a photographic apparatus left in his care . The object of packing our plate-holders in boxes was twofold : first , the plates were better protected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary work ; second , as we knew that the landing is not always as orderly as could be wished , we hoped , by keeping hold of our holders at such a time , to save our exposed plates , at least , from injury . A " finder " was attached to one side of the camera , to enable the operator to see just what would be included in the view at the moment of exposure . This instrument is like a smaller camera , except that no provision is made for focusing , and th' ground glass is permanently fixed at the proper distance from the lens . The ground glass of the finder was of the same proportion as the larger plates on which the views were secured , and had lines drawn from either side , crossing at right angles in the center . The finder is attached to the camera in such a position that any object appearing on its screen will be sure to occupy the same position on the dry plate . The lens used was of the rectilinear kind , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , used to cut off the light and give the plates their very brief exposure , was fastened in front of the lens , and was ot the kind called an eclipse , but was considerably changed by me before our second attempt . The springs which caused the sudden motion , and admitted light to the camera for an instant , exerted a force of eleven pounds when the shutter was set for action , and were , of course , adjusted to give a quick rather than a forcible motion . My manner of operating while in the balloon , when we had determined on " taking " any place we might be approaching , was , after deciding on the correct focus , first to " set " the shutter , then insert the plate-holder and draw the slide ; the camera was then taken in the left hand , with the rubber bulb of the " pneumatic release " of the shutter in the right . Then we must wait until the revolution of the balloon had brought the desired place opposite the camera , when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the screen of the finder , the rubber bulb was pressed , and the exposure was made ; the slide was then inserted in the plate-holder , the holder removed and boxed , and we were ready for another subject . At the same time Mr. Moore recorded the exposure for me , taking down the number of the plate-holder , the sub- // H E*H oz C oH ZH A C u2H z // ject , and the altitude as shown by the barom eter . The record was a very necessary guide in developing the plates , and it was kept by Mr. Moore , because in our flight objects of interest were presented in rapid succession , and much time was saved by this division of labor ; as it was , the camera was hardly out of my hands during the whole time of our ascension . The revolution of the balloon referred to is a very curious phenomenon , which was a source of much inconvenience ; a free balloon revolves almost constantly , and with Varying rapidity . The direction of its motion was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found the balloon was on the point of disappearing in a bank of cloud , which shut out the blue sky for some distance on each side of us . Under this bank of cloud , which appeared level and dark gray in color , the light was much reduced , and the chill felt at its near approach produced a feeling of depression . The balloon entered the cloud , being gradually cut off from our sight as the mist thickened ; at length the cords passing up from our car seemed to melt away into the mist , leaving us " without a visible means of support . " Soon we were in the midst of the both instances of my observation " with the sun " ; that is , the side of the balloon and car towards the south turned towards the west , and its northern side towards the east . Many times , just as I was about to expose a plate , one of the cords from car to hoop would come in the way , and force me to wait for another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had secured the view of Winsted , and the wind carried us towards the north-east , when , at an altitude of 3750 feet , we were nearly south of Riverton , of which we caught a good view . We continued rising , and soon Moore told qwq cloud , and could feel the dampness ; it seemed like moving through a thick fog . As we emerged from the upper surface of the cloud , a most wonderful picture was presented to us . In the south a line of the same stratum of cloud we had just left stretched across the sky . This line was at such a distance that we could see both the upper and under sides at once , the dark lower side forming a fine contrast with the upper , glowing in the sunlight . The sun 's rays , streaming across the edge of the clouds , projected a series of long beams of light and shadow to the earth , as is sometimes seen at sunset . In the distance the eye VIEW OF BALLOON IN THE ALE OVEN WIN5TED , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflection of light from Bantam Lake at Litchfield and from Lake Waramaug farther west , while the many lakes of Winchester and New Hartford seemed directly beneath us . Our barometer told us that the clouds which formed so beautiful an object , and of which we secured a fine picture , were floating at a height of fifty-five hundred feet from the earth . While sailing above a large extent of cloud , one s sense of isolation from the world is oppressive . My view from above the clouds , was no disappointment . The appearance of the clouds , seen from above , has been compared by some to the ocean , and by others to an expanse of snow . It is all and more than this , for the continual change , clouds breaking up to form other masses , surging and rolling , with their wonderfully silent , steady , slow motion , impressed me with a deep sense of grandeur and awe . While passing over a large detached cloud , it was our good fortune to observe a phenom VIEW ABOVE THE CLOUDS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A MILE . CLOUDS TOWARDS SPEINOFIELD. // enon rarely seen by man . We had been watching the shadow of the balloon as it slid along the ground , or as it was occasionally projected on an intervening cloud , being then surrounded by a brilliant circular rainbow . We were much surprised on passing over such a cloud to see the shadow as before , but with the addition of another balloon The second balloon-shadow was directly opposite the first or upright one , and inverted , so that one shadow of our car served for both , while there were two perfect shadows of passengers , netting , and gas-bag ; the rainbow which inclosed the whole was at this time of exceptional brilliancy . We are entirely at a loss in attempting any explanation of the double balloon-shadow ; it is certain that we saw it , an object of wonderful brilliancy and distinctness , for about thirty seconds , while we passed over one large cloud ; then it was gone , and we hardly hope to see it again . In connection with this picture we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made an exposure on that shadow as we were passing quickly over it , and naturally wished most earnestly that I might develop the image successfully , but fate was against us ; for in Hartford some one , out of curiosity to see the picture , opened the plate-holder , exposing the plate to gaslight , and the invisible spirit of my most valuable negative was gone beyond recall . As the subject was of so much interest scientifically as well as for its rarity , we had a drawing prepared from which our illustration is taken , and which is a correct representation of the phenomenon as we saw it . After gaining a considerable altitude the gas , which does not at first entirely fill the balloon , expands by the diminished outside pressure of the rarefied air and quite fills the envelope ; then the neck of the balloon hangs wide open , giving a fine view of the interior , which seems as DOUBLE SHADOW OF BALLOON UPON CLOUDS WITH RAINBOW ENCIECLINO IT , SEEN AT THE HEIOHT OF 6ooo FEET . // though filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This view , the cords of the netting plainly outlined through the cloth , gave us a keen sense of the frailty of our support ; there really seemed to be nothing to keep the whole affair from falling down upon us .

The hole had been left open , and was at first a source of considerable annoyance , as it took us a long while to overcome the impression that , as one or two towns might be seen through it , we were in danger of falling through ourselves. * The picture obtained by looking directly down through this hole is one of the best for * I asked Mr. Moore why he lifted his foot so high in crossing from one side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But look down there , and you 'll see I 'm stepping over two towns .

The camera was quickly made ready , and when the cloud was about one hundred feet from us , I fired ; the next moment the car swung through the top of the cloud , and a wave of cold air , like a blast from an ice-house , passed over us . During the few moments from our first notice of the cloud to our plunge into it , we gave it our undivided attention ; in its swift and silent approach , with the huge mass slowly unfolding , and fleecy particles tearing off in the wind , with the outer surface white in the sunlight , and with clefts in the mass dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us up forever .

This little lake , almost circular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surface without a ripple , and its waters lying dark and apparently unfathomable , presented a picture of silence and solitude which held our attention while it remained in sight .

This view , taken at the height of one mile , is wonderfully distinct , when we consider the distance of the objects from the camera , the conditions necessary to the taking of an instantaneous picture , and our very unsteady support . The stone and rail fences , bounding the fields of all sizes and shapes , are shown with , great sharpness . The pasture , meadow , and cultivated land are plainly indicated ; also the curiously regular arrangement of the crops . The trim and regular appearance of the orchards is well contrasted with the variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photographic effect of the autumnal colors is indicated by the foliage of a group of white birches near the center of the view , as contrasted with the dark , unchanged green of the orchards .

The Capitol reflected the sunlight from its dome , and many of the prominent buildings of the city could be distinguished . A line of clouds hung over the country south of Hartford , cutting off the light , and producing the singular effect of a view under a shelf or table . The Connecticut River was in sight for many miles above Hartford , until the thickening haze cut off the light far to the south . We were astonished at the number of abrupt turns in the river between the city and Wethersfield . As we were so nearly there , and sailing in exactly the right direction , we were anxious to remain in the upper air-current , and land in Hartford ; in order to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the balloon still descended , and soon we saw that our hope VOL . XXXII. - 9o. must be abandoned , as the lower current began to take us away from the city and in the direction of Windsor . When we had secured a view of Windsor and the junction of the Farmington and Connecticut rivers , Mr. Moore decided to land before going farther from the railroads ; and , opening the valve to let the gas escape , we descended rapidly . The point selected for our landing was an open field near a large tract of woods ; but such calculations are very liable to failure , owing to the difficulty of estimating distance and rate of motion of the balloon , and it was soon evident that the wind would take us over the woods before we could reach the ground . As we had already thrown out all the ballast , and did not wish to sacrifice the photographic apparatus , we could only let things take their course ; but we wished for a few pounds of sand , by the loss of which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The balloon sunk rapidly , and soon , as before , we heard the sound of the wind in the trees ; we looked anxiously to see where we should strike , but were not long left in doubt as we passed quickly down beside a large chestnut-tree , and the netting of the balloon , which curves far out on each side , caught in the upper branches , when our fall was suddenly checked . At first the weight of the balloon and load , descending with such force , bent the top of the tree far over ; then , as our momentum was gradually checked , there was a recoil which lifted us again about fifteen feet , where we hung , planning how we should get the balloon down . We could not climb out , for then the balloon , relieved of our weight , would rise and leave us ; but , after much hauling and jerking , the netting was detached from the tree , and we were on the ground again . Even then we were but little better off , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one left the car the other would surely go up again . Considerable gas was allowed to escape , and then , while I held fa* to a bush , Mr. Moore climbed out and secured our anchorrope to a tree ; then I made my escape , and , leaving the balloon pulling at its moorings , we started to find help . After walking nearly a mile we met two men and a little boy , who asked if we " had seen anything of a balloon around there . " , The balloon had fallen near a road cut through the woods , and we determined to get it to the road if possible . To do this , we persuaded the boy to get into the basket , in order to overcome part of the buoyancy , and let the balloon up the length of the anchor- // rope . We were then able to work the rope through the trees , and so led the balloon out to the road . But when we tried to tow it along to the clearing we quickly found it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let the gas escape , as the trees were too near together to admit of the usual practice . A man was found to carry the balloon to the railroad and us to Hartford ; and during the ride there I busied myself trying to recall the experiences of the ascension . As on the former occasion , I observed a singular loss of memory . Immediately after the excitement of landing it was hardly possible to recall a single incident of the ascension . I seemed to have just awakened from a wonderful dream , and the startling experiences so recently passed through appeared to have left only the faintest traces upon the mind . It was not until I had retired for the night , and would have slept , that memory revived , and I was treated ( unwillingly ) to a complete review of every incident connected with our trip . I am told that this has often been the experience of the soldier after passing through the dangers and excitements of the battle-field.             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
