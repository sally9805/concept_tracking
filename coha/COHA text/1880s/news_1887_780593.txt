txt The Erie Railway officials have just issued an order changing the name of their station , 44 miles out from New-York , from Greenwood Works to Arden . The change marks the final collapse of the great iron mining and smelting industries that were carried on in the locality for more than three-quarters of a century . The fur . naces at Greenwood were erected in 1812 by two brothers named Cunningham , for the purpose of reducing the valuable ores found in the Mount Bashan , Hogancamp , and other valuable mines in the vicinity . In 1852 the property , which then included the smelting furnaces , mines , tramways , and machinery , and 10,300 acres of land , was purchased by Peter and Robert Parrott , and they , atter operating the works for 28 years , were succeeded in the ownership in 1880 by the Parrott Iron Company , a corporation , with $500,000 capital . The Parrott Company made a bad failure about two years ago , and the subsequent sale of the property under legal proceedings by the Referee appointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the great industries connected therewith . Workmen arc now engaged dismantling the furnaces and taking up the railroad tracks . The mining machinery and apparatus was purchased and removed recently by Pennsylvania parties . The 10,300 acres of laud wore bought in by some of the creditors of the Parrott Iron Company , who propose , It is said , to convert it into a rural pleasure resort on a grand scale , after the pattern of Tuxedo Park . The tract includes a body of land in the Ramapo Highlands , stout three miles wide and five miles long . lying north of the Erie Railway , and in the towns of Monroe , Highland , Blooming Grove , and Haverstraw , in Orange and Rockland Counties . It is said that the tract vies with Tuxedo Park in the beauty and variety of its lake , Mountain , and forest scenery , and its natural adaptation to the purpose in view . Arden , which will be the principal railroad station of the new park , is six tulles west of Tuxedo.       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
