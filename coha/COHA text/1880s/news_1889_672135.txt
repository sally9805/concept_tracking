txt ENLARGIIVG THE CITY 'S AREA . The question of enlarging the area of the city of New-York by taking in the environs which are now or are sure in the future to become integral , parts of the metropolis , whether included in the municipal boundaries or not , may strike many people as novel , but it has occupied the minds of some of our far-seeing citizens for a long time . It has been plain enough that New York and . Brooklyn have for years constituted . in fact , commercially . if not socially , a single community . While by far the greater part of its business has been carried on this side of the East River , the division in respect to residence has been more nearly equal . Very many of those whose homes are in Brooklyn have their daily occupation and their business interests in New-York , and so far as the general affairs of life are concerned , the division between them is purely imaginary . Many people live in Brooklyn simply because they can do so on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New-York . Their real preference - would be to live on this side of the river , and even if what is now called Brooklyn were a part of New-York they would find a degree of satisfaction in that mere fact . What is true.of Brooklyn in its relation to New-York is true in a less degree of Long Island City . In the gradual growth of the civic community which occupies the two sides of the East River , the spread . of population now and in the future can take no note of boundaries , and if the union into a single municipality were to be effected , the boundaries might as well include all the area that is in effect occupied by the people whose interests nave a common centre . The question of the desirability or expediency of thus enlarging the borders of the metropolis and including within a single municipal area all that really belongs to it , except that which is necessarily excluded as within the jurisdiction . of another State , is a very large one , involving many details in regard to taxation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people concerned . can not properly consider it and . form intelligent opinions . They need to have it studied . out for them and presented in its various aspects to their minds . Preliminary to any attempt - to decide the question there must be some sort of an inquiry , a gathering of facts and information , a bringing together of the various considerations involved , a presenting of the arguments on both sides , and an indication in outline at least of how the scheme would . be carried out and what its effect would be . For this ' reason we regard . favorably the proposition to constitute a commission to inquire into the whole subject and report upon it . Whether the general idea impresses one favorably or not , it must be admitted that the matter has never been so fully presented as to justify positive opinions , and there should . be a willingness to have it thoroughly considered and laid before the people whose interests would be affected . A bill is pending in - the Legislature which provides for a commission to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area of ? the city of New York . " As its members would serve withoat pay and would . be allowed only $5,000 for expenses , the whole of which would be paid by this city , we see no ground for opposing the measure . No reasonable person can object to receiving light on the subject and being enabled to form a rational opinion about it . The proposed commission would consist of thirteen persons , six of whom are named in the bill . These six include prominent citizens of New-York and Brooklyn who are understood , to take a deep interest in the enlargement scheme ; and Mr. CALVERT VAIJX , who is in a sense an expert on the subject of the treatment of municipal area4 . The seventh member would be the State Engineer and . Surveyor , whose ' knowledge and judgment would . be of great value . The other six would be named , respectively , by the Mayor of New York , the Mayor of Brooklyn , and . the Supervisors of the counties of Westchester , Queens , Kings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' of all those concerned would be fairly represented . It strikes us as very desirable to have such a commission constituted to prosecute the inquiry suggested . There is something that attracts the imagination and . appeals strongly to the sentiment of local pride in the idea of having the community that has . grown up - with such vigor on the imperial harbor that nature made as the gateway of this continent , organized into one teeming ana expanding metropolis , which shall stand in its proper proportions among the cities of the earth . The Thames and the Seine are insignificant when compared . - with the arm of the sea which reaches from our outer bay into Long Island Sound , and the capitals that sit on either side of those streams , with centuries of history behind them , are pigmies compared to what the imagination may portray ' as seated about these waters a century hence . Straggling and struggling with the pulses of impeded growth as it is now , this young giant would hardly be second to Paris at the start , and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not the lines and . scope of its development be laid . out very soon 7 We must not be carried away by sentiment or act without considering the problems and . the consequences , but it is not too soon to set the right men at work studying these .
