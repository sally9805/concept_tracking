I. " A TIME TO SPEAK. ** IN Tivoli Circle , New Orleans , from the center and apex of its green , flowery mound , an immense column of pure white marble rises in the fair unfrowning majesty of Grecian proportions high up above the city 's house-tops into the dazzling sunshine and fragrant gales of the Delta . On its dizzy top stands the bronze figure of one of the world 's greatest captains . He is all alone . Not one of his mighty lieutenants stands behind or beside him or below at the base of his pillar . Even his horse is gone . Only his good sword remains , hanging motionless in its scabbard . His arms are folded on that breast that never knew fear or guile , and his calm , dauntless gaze meets the morning sun as it rises , like the new prosperity of the land he loved and served so masterly , above the far distant battle-fields where so many thousands of his ragged gray veterans lie in the sleep of fallen heroes . Great silent one ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the halls of the conqueror ; to hear the victor 's festal jubilations ; to behold a redistribution of rights riding over the proud traditions of his people , and all the painful fruits of a discomfited cause shaken to the ground ; to hear and see the tempestuous and ofttimes bloody after-strife between the old ideas and the new ; to see , now on one side , now on the other , the terms of his own grand surrender and parole forgotten or ignored ; to have his ear filled with the tirades and recriminations of journals and parties , and the babble of the unthinking million ; to note the old creeds changing , and to come , himself ; it may be ,  --  God knows ,  --  to respect beliefs that he had once counted follies ; and yet , withal , never , before the world that had set him aside but could not forget him , never to quail , never to wince , never to redden with anger , never to wail against man or fate , or seek the salve of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the times to stand and wait , making patience royal , with a mind too large for murmuring , and a heart too great to break , until a Messenger as silent as his bronze effigy beckoned Robert II* . Lee to that other land of light and flowers where man s common inheritance of error is hidden in the merit of his honest purpose , and lost in the Divine charity . So this monument , lifted far above our daily strife of narrow interests and often narrower passions and misunderstandings , becomes a monument to more than its one great and rightly loved original . It symbolizes our whole South 's better self ; that finer part which the world not always sees ; unaggressive , but brave , calm , thoughtful , broad-minded , dispassionate , sincere , and , in the din of boisterous error round about it , all too mute . It typifies that intelligence to which the words of a late writer most truly apply when he says concerning the long , incoherent discussion of one of our nation 's most perplexing questions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But the times change - have changed . Whatever the merit or fault of earlier reticence , this mute , firm-rooted figure , with sheathed sword and folded arms , must yield a step , not backward , but forward . " Where it has been silent it now should speak . " Nay , already it speaks ; and the blessing of all good men should rest on this day if it reveals the Silent South laying off its unsurrendered sword , leaving brawlers to their brawls , and moving out upon the plain of patient , friendly debate , seeking to destroy only error , and to establish only truth and equity and a calm faith in their incomparable power to solve the dark problems of the future . Within the last few months the voice of temperate discussion has been heard in wellnigh every quarter of our Southern States on themes that have scarcely been handled with patience and clemency these forty years . True , there has been some clamor , throwing stones , and casting dust ; but calmer utterances have come from Memphis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dallas , and far San Angelo ; some on one side , some on the other , of the debate , professing in common at least three quiet convictions : that recrimination and malignment of motive are the tactics of those who have no case ; that the truth is worth more than any man 's opinion ; and that the domination of right is the end we are bound to seek . Under these convictions the following pages are written ; written in deprecation of all sectionalism ; with an admiration and affection for the South , that for justice and sincerity yield to none ; in a spirit of faithful sonship to a Southern State ; written not to gratify sympathizers , but to persuade opponents ; not to overthrow , but to convince ; and begging that all harshness of fact or vehemence of statement be attributed entirely to the weight of the interests under debate . // II . POINTS OF AGREEMENT . IT is pleasant to note how much common ground is occupied by the two sides in this contest of opinions . By both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rights bill has not decided and can not dismiss the entire question of the freedman 's relations ; but that it puts upon trial in each Southern State a voluntary reconstruction which can never be final till it has established the moral equities of the whole case . Says one opponent , imputing his words to a personified South , " Leave this problem to my working out . I will solve it in calmness and deliberation , without passion or prejudice , and with full regard for the unspeakable equities it holds . " * Says Mr. Watterson 's paper , in Louisville , " We believe there is a general desire among the people of the South , that the negro shall have all the rights which a citizen of the United States , whatever be the color of his skin , is entitled to , but we know of no method to argue away or force down what may be called the caste of color . If we did . . . or if anybody else did , the dark problem as to the future of this unfortunate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ None more earnestly than the Courier-Journal desires to see this question happily settled . " Is not this progress ? It seems scarce a matter of months since we were saying the question was dead and should be buried . Now it rises to demand a wider grave , which both the writers quoted admit it must have , though one thinks nobody knows how to dig it , and another insists it must be dug without cutting away any more ground . But the common field of assertion and admission broadens as we move on . On this side it has been carefully demonstrated that , not from Emancipation or Enfranchisement , or anything else in or of the late war , or of Reconstruction , but from our earlier relation to the colored man as his master , results our view of him as naturally and irrevocably servile ; and that hence arises our proneness to confuse his social with his civil relations , to argue from inferiority of race a corresponding inferiority of his rights , and to infer that they fall , therefore , justly under our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arbitrary abridgment . The point is made that these views , as remnants of that slavery which , we all admit , has of right perished , ought to perish with it ; and the fact is regretted that in many parts of the South they nevertheless still retain such force - though withal evidently weakening - that the laws affirming certain human rights discordant to the dominant race are * " In Plain Black and White . " April CENTURY , 1885. sometimes openly evaded and sometimes virtually suffocated under a simulated acceptance of their narrowest letter . How plainly we feel the date of this discussion to be 1884-85 - not earlier - when we hear this evasion , once so hotly denied , admitted freely , nay , with emphasis , to be a " matter of record , and , from the Southern standpoint , mainly a matter of reputation . " And there are yet other points of agreement . As one who saw our great Reconstruction agony from its first day to its last in one of the South 's most distracted States and in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the issue , and his convictions drifting irresistibly to the other , the present writer affirms of his knowledge , in the initial paper of this debate , that after we had yielded what seemed to us all proper deference to our slaves ' emancipation and enfranchisement , there yet remained our invincible determination - seemingly to us the fundamental condition of our self-respect - never to yield our ancient prerogative of holding under our own discretion the colored man s s/a/us , not as a freedman , not as a voter , but in his daily walk as a civilian . This attitude in us , with our persistent mistaking his civil rights for social claims , this was the tap-root of the whole trouble . For neither would his self-respect yield ; and not because he was so unintelligent and base , but because he was as intelligent and aspmng as , in his poor way , he was , did he make this the cause of political estrangement . This estrangement - full grown at its beginning - was the carpet-bagger 's and scallawag 's opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gentility makes a mistake , however sincere , against the rights of the poor and ignorant . Is this diagnosis of the Reconstruction malady contested by the other side ? Nay , it is confirmed . The South , it tells us , " accepted the emancipation and enfranchisement of her slaves as the legitimate results of war that had been fought to a conclusion . These once accomplished , nothing more was possible . Thus far and no farther , ' she said to her neighbors in no spirit of defiance , but with quiet determination . In her weakest moments , when her helpless people were hedged about by the unthinking bayonets of her conquerors , she gathered them for resistance at this point . Here she defended everything that a people should hold dear . There was little proclamation of her purpose , " etc . Surely hope is not folly , as to this Southern question , when such admissions come from this direction . What salutary clearing of the ground have we here ! Our common assertion in the South has long been that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force because they had become so corrupt that they were nothing but huge machines for the robbery of the whole public , a tangle of low political intrigues that no human intelligence could unravel ; that our virtue and intelligence sought not the abridgement of any man 's rights , but simply the arrest of bribery and robbery ; that this could be done only by revolution because of the solid black vote , cast , we said , without rationality at the behest of a few scoundrels who kept it solid by playing upon partisan catchwords , or by promise of spoils . And especially among those whose faith is strongest in our old Southern traditions , it always was and is , to-day , sincerely believed that this was the whole issue . It was this profession that averted the interference of Federal arms . It was upon this profession that the manliest youth and intelligence of New Orleans went forth to stake their lives , and some to pour out their hearts ' blood in internecine war on the levee of their dear city . Sad sight to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spring of trouble lay yet deeper down . To such it brings no small or selfish gladness to hear , at length ,  --  if one may without offense coin a term ,  --  to hear Southern traditionists admitting a truth which the South has denied with sincere indignation ten thousand times ,  --  that in all that terrible era the real , fundamental issue was something else which the popular Southern mind was hardly aware of . " Barely " - say these- " barely did the whispered word that bespoke her the South 's resolution catch the listening ears of her sons ; but for all this , the victorious armies of the North , had they been rallied again from their homes , could not have enforced and maintained among this disarmed people the policy indicated in the Civil Rights bill . " This was the point at which , they say , and they say truly , the South " gathered for resistance . " Let us be sure these so gallantly spoken words are not misunderstood . There were two policies indicated in the Civil Rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case ; and the policy of legalizing , at all , such rights as it declared . One raised a question of State rights ; the other , of Human rights . But the State-rights issue , by itself  --  the mere question of whence the legislation should emanate , could never of itself make fierce strife . Any State could have settled that point by simply stepping ahead of Congress with the same legislation . No ; the irreconcilable difference was not as to whence but as to what the law should be . The essential odium of the bill lay not in its origin , but in its definition of the black man 's rights . Indeed , the main object of most of those who have written on the other side in the present controversy has been to assert the resolution never to recognize the freedman 's rights upon that definition of them . In the meantime a gentle movement of thought that sounds no trumpet before it is gradually pressing toward that very recognition . Iii . THE STiCKING POINT . BUT now that we have clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question follows  --  and half the nation are asking it to-day with perplexed brows-why is it ? Yet the answer is simple . Many white people of the South sincerely believe that the recognition of rights proposed in the old Civil Rights bills or in " The Freedman 's Case in Equit ) r " * would preczjpitate a social chaos . They believe Civil Rights means Social Equality . This may seem a transparent error , but certainly any community in the world that believed it , would hold the two ideas in equal abomination ; and it is because of the total unconsciousness and intense activity of this error at the South , and the subtle sense of unsafety that naturally accompanies it ,  --  it is because of this , rather than for any lack of clearness in its statement of the subject , that the article on " The Freedman 's Case in Equity " is so grossly misinterpreted even by some who undoubtedly wish to be fair . That this is the true cause of the misinterpretation is clear in the fact that from the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only among those whose thinking still runs in the grooves of the old traditions . Nothing in that paper touches or seeks to touch the domain of social privileges . The standing of the magazine in which it appears is guarantee against the possibility of the paper containing any such insult to the intelligence of enlightened society . Social equality is a fool 's dream . The present writer wants quite as little of it as the most fervent traditionist of the most fervent South . The North , the West , the East , and the rest of the intelligent world , want quite as little of it as the South wants . Social equality can never exist where a community , numerous enough to assert itself is actuated , as every civilized community is , by an intellectual and moral ambition . No form of laws , no definition of rights , from Anarchy to Utopia , can bring it about . The fear that this or that change will produce it ought never to be any but a fool 's fear . And yet there is this to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing so THE CENTURY for January , 1885. // much for Social equality as those who , while they warmly charge it upon others , are themselves thrusting arbitrary and cheap artificial distinctions into the delicate machinery of society 's self-distribution as it revolves by the power of our natural impulses , and of morality , personal interest , and personal preferences . This , of course , is not the intention , and even these persons retard only incidentally , unawares and within narrow limits , nature 's social distributions , while taking diligent and absolutely needless pains to hold apart two races which really have no social affinity at all . Do we charge any bad intention or conscious false pretense ? Not at all ! They are merely making the double mistake of first classing as personal social privileges certain common impersonal rights of man , and then turning about and treating them as rights definable by lawwhich social amenities are not and can not be . For the sake of any who might still misunderstand , let us enlarge here a moment . The family relation has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But beyond the family circle there are no such things as social rights ; and when our traditionists talk about a too hasty sympathy having " fixed by enactment " the negro 's social and civil rights they talk - unwisely . All the relations of life that go by impersonal rzght are Civil relations . All that go by personal choice are Social relations . The one is all of right , it makes no difference who we are ; the other is all of choice , and it makes all the difference who we are ; and it is no little fault against ourselves as well as others , to make confusion between the two relations . For the one we make laws ; for the other every one consults his own pleasure ; and the law that refuses to protect a civil right , construing it a social privilege , deserves no more regard than if it should declare some social privilege to be a civil right . Social choice , civil rights ; but a civil Jrivilege , in America , is simply heresy against both our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Freedman 's Case in Equity " pleads for not one thing belonging to the domain of social relations . Much less the family relation ; it does not hint the faintest approval of any sort of admixture of the two bloods . Surely nothing that a man can buy a ticket for anonymously at a ticket-seller 's hand-hole confers the faintest right to even a bow of recognition that any one may choose to withhold . But what says the other side ? " The South will never adopt the suggestion of the social intermingling * of the two races . " So they beg the question of equity , and suppress a question of civil right by simply miscalling it social intermingling " ; thus claiming for it * Italicized only here . that sacredness from even the law 's control which only social relations have , and the next instant asserting the determination of one race to " control the social relations , " so-called , of two . Did ever champions of a cause with blanker simplicity walk into a sack and sew up its mouth ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a doctrine that neither political party in our country would venture to maintain ; for no party dare say that in these United States there is any room for any one class of citizens to fasten arbitrarily upon any other class of citizens a civil status from which no merit of intelligence , virtue , or possessions can earn an extrication . We have a country large enough for all the unsociality anybody may want , but not for incivility either by or without the warrant of law . " What history shows , " says a sound little book lately printed , " is thatrights are safe only when guaranteed against all arbitrary power and all class and personal interest . " Class rule of any sort is bad enough , even with the consent of the ruled class ; un-American enough . But the domination of one fixed class by another without its consent , is Asiatic . And yet it is behind this error , of Asian antiquity and tyranny , this arbitrary suppression of impartial , impersonal civil rights , that we discover our intelligent adversaries in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position ! " Neither race wants it , " says one ; alluding to that common , undivided participation in the enjoyment of civil rights , for which the darker race has been lifting one long prayer these twenty years , and which he absurdly miscalls social intermingling . " " The interest , as the inclination , of both races is against it , " he adds . " Here the issue is made up . " But he mistakes . The issue is not made up here at all . It is not a question of what the race wants , but of what the individual wants and has a right to . Is that question met ? No . Not a line has been written to disprove the individual freedman 's title to these rights ; but pages , to declare that his race does not want them and shall not have them if it does . Mark the contradiction . It does not want themit shall not have them ! Argument unworthy of the nursery ; yet the final essence of all the other side 's arguments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public rights separate from the whites ; and that anyhow it has got to take that or nothing ; " The white and black races in the South must * walk apart . " One writer justifies this on the belief of a natal race instinct ; but says that if there were no such thingthe South " would , by every means in its power , so strengthen the race preiudice* that it would do the work and hold * Italicized only here . // the stubbornness and strength of instinct . " Could any one more distinctly or unconsciously waive the whole question of right and wrong ? Yet this is the standpoint on which it is proposed to meet the freedmen* s case in equify . Under the heat of such utterances how the substance melts out of their writer 's later proposition for the South to solve the question " without passion or prejudice and with full regard for the unspeakable equities it holds . " It is not the Louisville gentlemen who are found at this untenable standpoint . They admit the desirability of extirpating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Equity , ' ' and merely ask with a smile , in what manner the writer expects that evil to disappear before high-sounding imperatives , " etc . As to that we leave others on that side to give the answer ; hear it , from Atlanta : " Clear views , clear statement , and clear understanding are the demands of the hour . Given these , the common sense and courage of the American people will make the rest easy. ** IV . civiL RIGHT NOT SOCIAL CHOICE . LET us then make our conception of the right and wrong of this matter unmistakable . Social relations , one will say , are sacred . True , but civil rights are sacred , also . Hence social relations must not impose upon civil rights nor civil rights impose upon social relations . We must have peace . But for peace to be stable we must have justice . Therefore , for peace , we must find that boundary line between social relations and civil rights , from which the one has no warrant ever to push the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever faithfully the same , no matter whose the social relations are on one side or whose the civil rights are on the other . Suppose a case . Mr. A. takes a lady , not of his own family , to a concert . Neither one is moved by compulsion or any assertion of right on the part of the other . They have chosen each other 's company . Their relation is social . It could not exist without mutual agreement . They are strangers in that city , however , and as they sit in the thronged auditorium and look around them , not one other soul in that house , so far as they can discern , has any social relation with them . But see , now , how impregnable the social relation is . That pair , outnumbered a thousand to one , need not yield a pennyweight of social interchange with any third person unless they so choose . Nothing else in human life is so amply sufficient to protect itself as are social relations . Provided one thing ,  --  that the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the foremost of which is that both men and laws shall let us alone to our personal social preferences . If any person , no matter who or what he is , insists on obtruding himself upon this pair in the concert-hall he can only succeed in getting himself put out . Why ? Because he is trying to turn his civil right-tobe-there into a social passport . And even if he make no personal advances , but his behavior or personal condition is so bad as to obtrude itself offensively upon others , the case is the same ; the mistake and its consequences are his . But , on the other hand , should Mr. A. and his companion demand the expulsion of this third person when he had made no advances and had encroached no more on their liberty than they had on his , demanding it simply on the ground that he was their social or intellectual inferior or probably had relatives who were , then the error , no matter who or what he is , would be not his , but theirs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to turn their social choice into a civil right ; and it would be simply increasing the error and its offensiveness , for them to suggest that he be given an equally comfortable place elsewhere in the house providing it must indicate his inferiority . There is nothing comfortable in ignominy , nor is it any evidence of high mind for one stranger to put it upon another . Now , the principles of this case are not disturbed by any multiplication of the number of persons concerned , or by reading for concert-hall either theater or steamboat or railway station or coach or lecture-hall or street car or public library , or by supposing the social pair to be English , Turk , Jap , Cherokee , Ethiopian , Mexican , or " American . " But note the fact that , even so , Mr. A. and his companion 's social relations are , under these rulings , as safe from invasion as they were before ; nay , even safer , inasmuch as the true distinction is made publicly clearer , between the social and the civil relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of unwelcome social advance , much or little , as ever he was ; and as to his own house or estate may eject any one from it , not of his own family or a legal tenant , and give no other reason than that it suits him to do so . Do you not see it now , gentlemen of the other side ? Is there anything new in it ? Is it not as old as truth itself ? Honestly , have you not known it all along ? Is it not actually the part of good breeding to know it ? You can not say no . Then why have you charged us with proposing " to break down every distinction between the races , " and " to insist on their intermingling in all places and in all relations , " when in fact we have not proposed to disturb any // distinction between the races which nature has made , or to molest any private or personal relation in life , whatever ? Why have you charged us with " moving to forbid all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have done is to condemn an arbitrary assortment of the races , crude and unreasonable , by the stronger race without the consent of the weaker , and in places and relations where no one , exalted or lowly , has any right to dictate to another because of the class he belongs to ? We but turn your own words to our use when we say this battery of charges " is as false as it is infamous . " But let that go . Having made it plain that the question has nothing to do with social relations , we see that it is , and is only , a question of indiscrimma/lye civil rights . This is what " The Freedman s Case in Equity " advocates from beginning to end , not as a choice which a race may either claim or disclaim , but as every citizen 's individual yet impersonal right until he personally waives or forfeits it . The issue , we repeat , is not met at all by the assertion that " Neither race wants it . " There is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not because either of them is one race or another , but simply because they are members of a civilized human community . It is that thing of which our Southern white people have so long had such an absurd fear ; neither race , or in other words nobody , wants to see the civil rewards of decency in dress and behavior usurped by the common herd of clowns and ragamuffins . But there is another thing that the colored race certainly does want : the freedom for those of the race . who can to earn the indiscriminative and unchallenged civilnot social-rights of gentility by the simple act of being genteel . This is what we insist the best intelligence of the South is willing-in the interest of right , and therefore of both races  --  to accord . But the best intelligence is not the majority , and the majority , leaning not upon the equities , but the traditional sentiments of the situation , charge us with " theory " and " sentiment " and give us their word for it that " Neither race wants it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we used to say about slavery ! Where have these traditionists been the last twenty years ? Who , that lived in the South through those days , but iknows that the darker race 's demand from the first day of the Reconstruction era to its last , was , " If you will not give us undivided participation in civil rights , then and in that case you must give us equal separate enjoyment of them " ; and from the close of Reconstruction to this day the only change in its expression has been to turn its imperative demand into a supplication . This was the demand , this is the supplication of American citizens seeking not even their civil rights entire , but their civil rights mutilated to accommodate not our public rights but our private tastes . And how have we responded ? Has the separate accommodation furnished them been anywhere nearly equal to ours ? Not one time in a thousand . Has this been for malice ? Certainly not . But we have unconsciously - and what people in our position would not have made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the lines of even justice by our old notion of every white man holding every negro to a menial status . Would our friends on the other side of the discussion say they mean only , concerning these indiscriminative civil rights , " Neither race wants them now " ? This would but make bad worse . Fortwo new things havehappened to the colored race in these twenty years ; first , a natural and spontaneous assortment has taken place within the race itself along scales of virtue and intelligence , knowledge and manners ; so that by no small fraction of their number the wrong of treating the whole race alike is more acutely felt than ever it was before ; and , second , a long , bitter experience has taught them that " equal accommodations , but separate " means , generally , accommodations of a conspicuously ignominious inferiority . Are these people opposed to an arrangement that would give them instant release from organized and legalized incivility ? - For that is what a race distinction in civil relations is when it ignores intelligence and decorum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to settle this question of fact . One side in this debate advocates indiscriminative civil rights ; the other , separate - racial civil rights . It is not to be doubted that our opponents have received many letters from white men and women full of commendation and thanks for what they have written . Such , too , has been the present writer 's experience . Such testimonials poured in upon him daily for four months , from east , west , north , and south . But how about the colored race ? Have they written him , begging him to desist because " Neither race wants " the equities he pleads for ? The pages of this magazine are precious , but we beg room for a few extracts from colored correspondents ' letters , each being from a separate letter and no letter from any colored person whom the present writer has ever seen or known . One letter ends , " May all the spirits that aid justice , truth , and right constantly attend you in your effort . " Another , " I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun , and may God bless you . " Another , " Accept this , dear sir , as the thanks of the colored people of this city . " Another begins , " I am a negro . In behalf of the negroes and in behalf of equitable fair dealing on the principle of giving a dollar 's worth for a dollar , without any possible reference to social matters , permit me to tender you my sincere thanks , " etc . Says another , " The judicious fairness with which you have treated our case renders your thesis worthy of our adoption as a Bill of Rights . " A letter of thanks from a colored literary club says , " . . . We thank you for your recognition of our capacity to suffer keenly under the indignities we are made to endure . " A similar society in another town sent a verbal expression of thanks by its president in person . ( Followed since by its committee 's formal resolution ornamentally written and mounted . ) In Louisville a numerous impromptu delegation of colored citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks . Another letter says , " If the people of the South will only regard your article in the same spirit as I believe it was intended , then I know , sir , great and enduring good will be accomplished . " In Arkansas , a meeting of colored people , called to express approval of the article on " The Freedman 's Case in Equity , " passed a resolution pronouncing its ideas " consonant with true religion and enlightened civilization , " etc . Not one word of adverse criticism , written or printed , has come to him from a person of color . Has the same race given " In Plain Black and White , " or " The Freedman 's Case in Reality , " or any of the less dignified mass of matter on that side of the question , a like cordial ratification ? Or has only Mr. Jack Brown sent in his congratulations ? * * The Selma " Times , " quoted in " The Freedman 's Case in Equity " as rejoicing in the flogging of a colored preacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when ordered out by irresponsible ruffians , has since published a letter purporting to come from one " Jack Brown , colored , " of Columbia , South Carolina . The letter denounces the present writer as one of the sort " that has brought on all the trouble between the white and colored people of the South . I do not know his initials or address , " it continues , " or I would address him in person , as I am anxious to test his sincerity . " t " Now , " says the Selma " Times , " " the above article bears every imprint of honesty and truthfulness . We do n't believe any one hut a sharp negro could have written or did write it . The handwriting , the loose grammar , the postmark on the envelope , all mark it as a genuine document coming from the man it purports to have come from . Not only is this true of such external marks as we have named , but so is it likewise of its internal , essential substance . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written by a negro only . We can not conceive of a white man 's putting himself so thoroughly into the place of a negro , mentally , as to have executed such a thing as a forgery . We shall find out if there is such a negro in Columbia , S.

Then let us go one step farther . There are , it is said , eighty - some say a hundred - journals published in this country by colored men . They look to the colored race for the great bulk of their readers and subscribers . Hence they are bound to be in large degree the organs of popular thought among the reading part , at least , of that people . But these papers are a unit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Case in Equity . " Now , to believe the other side we should have to make two impossible assumptions ; that among a people treated rigorously as one race , compacted by a common status , the intelligent and comparatively refined part numerous enough to send- in spite of its poverty- twenty thousand students to normal schools and colleges and to support eighty newspapers , this portion , moreover , associated with the less intelligent portion more cordially in every interest than two such classes are amongst any other people in the world unless it be the Jews - that such a lump of leaven as this has no power to shape the views of the rest on matters of common public right ! Such a thing may be credible on some other planet , not on this . And the second impossible assumption : That the intelligent and sensitive portions of a people shall submit to an ignominious mutilation of their public rights because the unintelligenceof their race chooses ( ? ) to submit to it . This assumption is a crime against common justice ; the other is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake that " the assortment of the races which has been described know Mr. Cable and others are sure to challenge its authenticity .

Writing from a. small inland city , getting through one hundred and seventy-five words of his letter before making a grammatical slip , a colored man in sympathy with the tritest sentiment of the dominant race and with a taste for public questions ,  --  such a man could not be hid , much less overlooked , in Columbia .

An exhaustive search and inquiry amongst the people of both races by a white gentleman resident on the spot , fails to find any " Jack Brown " except - to quote the gentleman 's letter ,  --  " a poor , illiterate fellow , who can not read or write his name , " and who , instead of being " twenty-seven years of age , " is - to quote another letter - " an aged man . " So italicized originally . // as shameful and unjust . . . commands the hearty assent of both . " True , our traditionist friends , who think they believe it , are glad to take the witnessstand and testify ; but surely some of them should be lawyer enough ' to know that when they say the colored race shall not have the other thing in any event , their testimony as to which the colored race prefers is of no further account . At Atlanta , they are equally unfortunate in another witness . If the Georgia State Commissioner of Public Education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and admires him , we may say that throughout the United States he has won the high regard and praise of the friends of public education for the exceptional progress he - a man of the old South - has made in unlearning our traditional Southern prejudipes . He stands a noble , personal refutation . of the superficial notion that the world must look to the young South , only , for progressive ideas of human right among us . May be it was easy to make the mistake of calling this admirable gentleman to testify that " neither race wants it . " But see how quickly Commissioner Orr provokes the reader to dismiss him , too , from the witness-stand : Speaking of mixed schools , which , he says , " both races would protest against "  --  but which , mark it , " The Freedman s Case in Equity " does not ask to have forced upon any community or forced by either race upon the other anywhere-Mr . Orr says , " I am so sure of the evils that would come from mixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would see the whole educational system swept away before I would see them established . " Ah ! gentlemen , you are not before a Congressional investigating committee that gets Republican facts from Republican witnesses and Democratic facts from Democratic witnesses , and then makes two reports . You are before the judgment-seat of the world 's intelligence ; and if you can not bring for evidence of a people 's feelings their own spontaneous and habitual expressions to those who think with them ; and , for the establishment of facts , the unconscious or unwilling testimony of your opponents , then it is high time you were taking your case out of this court. * As for us we can prove all we need prove by the gentlemen themselves . Once only does the opposite side bring forward the actual free utterance of a colored They might easily have brought in colored schoolteachers . Many of these favor separate colored schools , for the obvious reason that those are the only schools they may teach in . They do bring in just two witnesses from a side avowedly opposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either . One is the late Bishop Haven , of whom we shall speak presently . The other , a young white woman on a railway train , who - forbidden to enjoy her civil rights and her peculiar social preferences man professing to express a sentiment of his race ; well nigh a magazine column of " negro eloquence " and adulation poured upon a conference of applauding " Bishops and Brethren " because of the amazing fact that when in the neighboring vestry-room , he had " thoughtlessly asked " the governor of the State if he could get a drink , that magnate sent for and handed him a glass of water ! Unlucky testimony ! which no candid mind can deny is an elaborate confession of surprised delight at being treated with indiscriminative civility . We are told , however , that it is offered simply to show the affectionate " feeling of that people toward their white neighbors . " Thus a display of affection is utilized to give a color of justice to the mutilation of just such equal rights as this one whose unexpected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go round and round their tether. vi . GUNS THAT SHOOT BACKWARD . OUR demonstration is complete ; but there follows a short corollary : While the colored people always did and still do accept with alacrity an undivided enjoyment of civil rights with the white race wherever cordially offered , they never mistake them for social privileges , nor do they ever attempt to use them to compel social intercourse . We might appeal to the everyday street-car experience of hundreds of thousands of residents in New Orleans and other Southern cities ; or to the uniform clearness with which civil rights are claimed and social advances disclaimed in the many letters from colored men and women that are this moment before the writer . But we need not . We need refer only to our opponents in debate , who bring forward , to prove their own propositions , a set of well-known facts that turn and play Balaam to their Balak . Hear their statement : " They " - the colored people - " meet the white people in all the avenues of business . They work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect accord and friendliness . When the trowel or hammer is laid aside , the laborers part , each going his own way . Any attempt to carry the comradeship of the day into private life would be sternly resisted by both parties in interest . " We prove , by the other side 's own arguments . that the colored people always accept at the same time - threw away a civil right to retain the social preference ; which was her business , not ours , and proves nothing whatever for or against anybody else ; but whose expression ofg5ride at being mistaken for a quadroon proves her an extremely silly person . They summon her for " the sole object " of suggesting that she and such as agree with her - which lets us out as plainly as it does the other side - are " unsafe as advisers and unfair as witnesses . " Certainly they are . // the common enjoyment of civil rights and never confound civil with social relations . But in just one phase of life there is a conspicuous exception ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our opponents . And who furnishes our evidence this time ? Themselves again . We allude to the church relation . We are asked to confront the history of an effort made , they say , many times over , by Bishop Haven and the Northern Methodist church generally , soon after the late war ; an effort to abolish racial discrimination in the religious worship of the church in the South composed of Northern whites and Southern blacks ; its constant and utter failure ; and the final separation of those churches into two separate conferences , and into separate congregations wherever practicable . These facts are brought forward to prove the existence of race instinct , intending to justify by race instinct the arbitrary control , by the whites , of the relations between the two races ; and the conclusion is sanguinely reached at a bound , that the only explanation of these churches ' separation on the color line is each race s race instinct , " that spoke above the appeal of the bishop and dominated the divine influences that pulsed from pew to pew . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their haste they omit to do is to make any serious search at all for a simpler explanation . And how simple the true explanation is ! Bishop Haven and his colleagues , if rightly reported , ought to have known they would fail . They were attempting under acute disadvantages what none of the Protestant churches in America , faithfully as they have striven for it , has ever been able extensively to accomplish . That is , to get high and low life to worshzjp together . The character of much ritual worship and of nearly all nonritual worship naturally and properly takes for its standard the congregation 's average intelligence . But this good process of assortment , unless held in by every proper drawback , flies off to an excess that leaves the simple and unlearned to a spiritual starvation apparently as bad as that from which non-ritual worship , especially , professes to revolt . Bishop Dudley has lately laid his finger upon this mischief for us with great emphasis . But , moreover , as in society , so in the church , this intellectual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station . Thus the gate is thrown wide open to the social idea , and presently not our Dorcases only , but at times our very bishops , are busy trying to make the social relation co-extensive with the church relation . With what result ? Little , generally , save the bad result of congregations trimming themselves down to fit the limitations of social fellowship . See the case cited . Here were whites , cultured , and counting themselves , at least , as good as the best in the land ; and here was an ignorant , superstitious race of boisterous worshipers just emerged from slavery ; one side craving spiritual meat , the other needing spiritual milk , and both sides beset by our prevalent American error that social intimacy is one of the distinct earnings of church membership . Of course they separated . It is but a dwarfed idea of the church relation that cramps it into the social relation . The church relation is the grandest fraternity on earth. * Social relations are good and proper , but can the social relation grasp all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circle span from the drawing-room to the stable , from the counting-room or professional desk to the kitchen , from the judge 's bench to the tailor 's and cobbler 's , from the prince 's crown to the pauper 's bowl ? Yet without any social intimacy the prince may be the pauper 's best friend , and even the pauper the prince 's ; and the church relation ought to be so wide and high that all these ranks might kneel abreast in it in common worship , and move abreast in it in perfect , active , co-laboring fraternity and regard , gathering any or every social circle into its noble circumference , never pressing one injuriously upon another , and above all things never letting in the slender but mischievous error of confusing Christian fraternity with social equality . Yet the high and low nigh all our country over are kept apart in divine worship by just this error or the fear of it . Fifty thousand Bishop Havens could not , until they had overthrown the domina* tion of this mistake , get the lofty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate ? And the dragging in of a race instinct to account for the separation is like bringing a pole to knock down strawberries . Other things will , but a belief in instinct will not , keep the races apart . Look at the West Indies . But not even miscegenation - may the reader forgive us the disgusting word - could have saved such a scheme from failure . The gentlemen prove absolutely nothing for their case , but much against it . For here is shown by actual experiment that even where there is not of necessity a social relation , yet when the social idea merely gets in by mistake of both classes , the effect will not be social confusion , but a spontaneous and willing separation along the strongest lines of social cleavage . The log  --  the church-will not split the wedge  --  the social impulse ; but the wedge will split the log . The uncultured , be they white or " There is neither Jew nor Greek , there is neither bond nor free , there is neither male nor female . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North or South , will break away on one side with even more promptness and spontaneity than the cultured on the other , and will recoil , moreover , to a greater distance than is best for any one concerned . Thus far are we from having the least ground to fear from the blacks that emptiest of phantasms , social aggression . Thus far are we from needing for the protection of social order any assumption of race instinct . And so do the advocates of our traditional sentiments continually establish the opposite of what they seek to prove . They cite , again , to establish this assumption of race instinct , the spontaneous grouping together of colored people in such social or semi-social organizations as Masonic lodges , military companies , etc . But there is no proscription of whites in the lodges of colored Odd-fellows or Masons . In Georgia , for example , the law requires the separation of the races in military companies . The gentlemen forget that the colored people are subject to a strong expulsive power from the whites , which they say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and that the existence of a race instinct can never be proved or disproved until all expulsive forces are withdrawn and both races are left totally free to the influences of those entirely self-sufficient social forces which one of the gentlemen has so neatly termed " centripetal . " But even if these overlooked facts were out of existence , what would be proved ? Only , and for the second time , that the centripetal force of social selection operates so completely to the fulfillment of these gentlemen 's wishes , that there is no longer any call to prove or disprove the existence of race instinct , or the faintest excuse for arbitrary race separations in the enjoyment of civil rights . Thus , setting out with the idea that the social integrity of the races requires vigorous protection from without , they prove instead by every argument brought to establish it , that every relation really social , partially social , or even mistakenly social , takes - instinct or no instinct - the most spontaneous and complete care of itself . We are debating the freedman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all impersonal rights ; and they succeed only in saying , never in bringing a particle of legitimate evidence to prove , that " Neither race wants it " ; an assertion which no sane man , knowing the facts , can sincerely make until , like these gentlemen , he has first made the most woful confusion in his own mind between personal social privileges and impersonal civil rights . VII . THE RIGHT TO RULE . BUT they have yet one last fancied stronghold . They say , " The interest of both races is against it " ; that is , against a common participation in their civil rights ; and that it is , rather , in favor of a separate enjoyment of them . Now , there are people - but their number is steadily growing less - who would mean by this merely that the interest of both races is against common participation because they are against it and have made separate participation the price of peace . But the gentlemen whom we have in view in this paper , though they must confess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less offensive in its intention . They say common participation means common sociality , and common sociality , race-amalgamation . Have we not just used their own facts to show conclusively that this is not what occurs ? Yet these two reasons , so called , are actually the only ones that scrutiny can find in all the utterances pledging these gentlemen to " the exactest justice and the fullest equity . " Nay , there is another ; we must maintain , they say , " the clear and unmistakable domination of the white race in the South . " - Why , certainly we must ! and we must do it honestly and without tampering with anybody 's natural rights ; and we can do it ! But why do they say we must do it ? Because " character , intelligence , and property " belong preeminently to the white race , and " character , intelligence , and property " have " the right to rule . " So , as far as the reasoning is sincere , they are bound to mean that not merely being white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , intelligence , and property . " And the true formula becomes " the clear and unmistakable domination " of " character , intelligence , and property " " in the South . " But if this be the true doctrine , as who can deny it is ? then why - after we have run the color line to suit ourselves through all our truly social relations - why need we usurp the prerogative to run it so needlessly through civil rights , also ? It is widely admitted that we are vastly the superior race in everything - as a race . But is every colored man inferior to every white man in character , intelligence , and property ? Is there no " responsible and steadfast element " at all among a people who furnish i6 , ooo schoolteachers and are assessed for $91,000,000 worth of taxable property ? Are there no poor and irresponsible whites ? So , the color line and the line of character , intelligence , and property frequently cross each other . Then tell us , gentlemen , which are you really for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , intelligence , and property that divides between those who have and those who have not " the right to rule " ? You dare not declare for an inflexible color line ; such an answer would shame the political intelligence of a Russian . Another point just here . The right to rule : // What is it ? It is not the right to take any peaceable citizen 's civil right from him in whole or in part . It is not the right to decree who may earn or not earn any status within the reach of his proper powers . It is not the right to oppress . In America , to rule is to serve . There is a newspaper published in Atlanta called " The Constitution . " The Instrument of which this name is intended to remind us , and of which it is well to keep us reminded , is founded on a simple principle that solves the problem of free government over which Europe sat in dark perplexity for centuries , shedding tears of blood ; the principle that the right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the majority by the consent of all . It took ages of agony for the human race to discover that there is no moral right of class rule , and that the only safety to human freedom lies in the intelligence , virtue , and wealth of communities holding every right of every being in such sacred regard , and all claims for class or personal privilege in such uniform contempt , that unintelligence , vice , and poverty , having no potent common grievance , shall naturally invest intelligence , character , and property with the right to rule . It took ages for us to discover the necessity of binding intelligence , character , and property to the maintenance of this attitude by giving , once for all , to the majority the custody and right-of-assignment of this truly precious right to rule . Is this mere sentiment ? A scheme in the clouds ? Who says so can not truly qualify as a whole American citizen . The safety of American government is that intelligence , virtue , and wealth dare not press any measure whose viciousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vice , and poverty divided among themselves ; and that intelligence and virtue hold themselves entirely free to combine now with wealth and now with poverty as now the lower million or now the upper ten shows the livelier disposition to impose upon the other . But the only way to preserve these conditions is to hold sacred the will and voice of the majority . Of course there are friction and imperfections in their working ; but human wisdom has not yet found any other scheme that carries us so near to perfect government . The right to rule is a right to earn the confidence and choice of the majority of the whole unfettered people . Yet it is in the face of this fundamental principle of American freedom that our traditionist friends stand , compelling six million freedmen to mass together under a group of common grievances , within a wall of these gentlemen 's own avowed building , then charging them with being " leagued together in ignorance and irrespon sibility , " and then talking in large approval about " minorities " - not earning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And a proposition to set such antique usurpation of human rights aside , to remove the real grievances that make a common cause for six million distrusted and distrusting people , to pull down that wall of civil - not socialdistinctions that tends to keep them " leagued together in ignorance and irresponsibility , " to open to them the civil - not social - rewards of gentility and education , and the responsibilities of knowledge and citizenship , to arouse in them the same concern in common public . interests that we feel , and to make all their fortunes subject to the same influences as ours ,  --  this , we are told , is " against the interest of both races " ! And this we have from men who , claiming a preeminent right to speak for the South , claim with it a " right . to rule " that fails to signify anything better than the right of the white man to rule the black without his consent and without any further discrimination between intelligence and unintelligence or between responsibilityr and irresponsibility . In other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as ; no freeman could possibly choose and whicW can not be the best interest of any Americani community . So the other side are our witnesses again . And now we may say to them , , as the lawyers do in court ,  --  " That will do . viii . SUMMING UP . THE case is before the reader . The points* of fact made in our November paper - the privations suffered by the colored people in their matters of civil rights-have been met with feeble half-denials equivalent to admissions by opponents in controversy too ' engrossed with counter statements and arguments , that crumble at the touch , to attend to a statement of facts . In the end they stand thus : As to churches , there is probably not a. dozen in the land , if one , " colored " or " white , " * where a white person is not at least profess-. edly welcome to its best accommodations ; : while the colored man , though he be seveneighths white , is shut up , on the ground that " his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unprofitable appointments of the " African " church , whether he like it best or not , unless . he is ready to accept without a murmur dis -- tinctions that mark him , in the sight of the whole people , as one of a despised caste and that follow him through the very sacraments . As to schooling , despite the fact that he is today showing his eager willingness to accept separate schools for his children wherever the white man demands the separation , yet ; // both his children and the white man 's are being consigned to illiteracy wherever they are too few and poor to form separate schools . In some mountainous parts of Kentucky there is but one colored school district in a counly . In railway travel the colored people 's rights are tossed from pillar to post with an ever-varying and therefore more utterly indefensible and intolerable capriciousness . In Virginia they may ride exactly as white people do and in the same cars . In a neighboring State , a white man may ride in the " ladies ' car , " while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - nay , his wife or daughter-must ride in the notorious " Jim Crow car , " unprotected from smokers and dramdrinkers and lovers of vile language . " In South Carolina , " says the Charleston " News and Courier , " on the other hand , " respectable colored persons who buy first-class tickets on any railroad ride in the first-class cars as a right , and their presence excites no comment on the part of their white fellow-passengers . It is a great deal pleasanter to travel with respectable and well-behaved colored people than with unmannerly and ruffianly white men . ' In Alabama the majority of the people have not made this discovery , at least if we are to believe their newspapers . In Tennessee the law requires the separation of all firstclass passengers by race with equal accommodations for both ; thus waiving the old plea of decency 's exigencies and forcing upon American citizens adjudged to be first-class passengers an alienism that has thrown away its last shadow of an excuse . But this is only the law , and the history of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which a colored woman gained damages for being compelled to accept inferior accommodation or none for a first-class ticket , is the history of an outrage so glaring that only a person blinded to the simplest rights of human beings could cite it in such a defense . A certain daily railway train was supplied , according to the law , with a smoking-car , and two first-class cars , one for colored and one for whites . The two first-class cars were so nearly of a kind that they were exchangeable . They generally kept their relative positions on thetrack ; but the " ladies ' car " of the morning trip became the " colored car " of the return , afternoon , trip , and vice versd . But the rules of the colored car were little regarded . Men , white and black , were sometimes forbidden , sometimes allowed , to smoke and drink there . Says the court , " The evidence is abundant to show that the rule excluding smoking from that car was but a nominal one , that it was often disregarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule , and that adequate means were not adopted to secure the same first-class and orderly passage to the colored passengers occupying that car as was accorded to the passengers in the rear car . Nor was the separation of the classes of the passengers complete . There is no evidence tending to show that the white passengers were excluded from the car assigned to colored passengers , and it appears that whenever the train was unusually crowded it was expected that the excess of white passengers would ride , as they then did ride , in the forward one of the two first-class cars . So , too , it appeared that persons of color , of whom the plaintiff was one , had several times occupied seats in the rear car . " A certain " person of lady-like appearance and deportment , " one day in September , 1883 , got aboard this train with a first-class ticket . She knew the train , and that , as the court states it , " in the rear car quiet and good order were to so great an extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passenger gave annoyance by his conduct to his fellow-passengers . " In the colored car there was at least one colored man smoking , and one white man whom she saw to be drunk . She entered the rear car and sat down , no one objecting . She was the only colored person there . The conductor , collecting his tickets , came to her . He was not disconcerted . Not long previously he had forbidden another colored person to ride in that car , who must also have been " of lady-like appearance and deportment , " for when he saw this one he " supposed her to be the same person . . . intentionally violating the defendant 's ( Railroad 's ) rules and seeking to annoy his otizerpassengers . " Twice they exchanged polite request and refusal to leave the car ; and then , in full presence of all those " other passengers " whom this person of lady-like appearance and deportment was erroneously suspected of " seeking to annoy , " there occurred a thing that ought to make the nation blush . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infraction of a rule was interfering neither with the running of the road , the collection of fares , nor the comfort of passengers , and " by force removed her from her seat and carried her out of the car . When near the door of the car the plaintiff promised that she would then , if permitted , leave the car rather than be forcibly ejected ; but the conductor , as he says , told her that her consent came too late , and continued to remove her forcibly . On reaching the platform of the car , plaintiff left the train . " Judgment was given for the plaintiff . But the point was carefully made that she would have been without any grievance if the " colored car " had only been kept first-class . In other words , for not providing separate first-class ac // commodations , five hundred dollars damages ; for laying violent hands upon a peaceable , ladylike , and unprotected woman , nothing ; and nothing for requiring such a one publicly to sit apart from passengers of the same grade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Fancy the passenger a white lady , choosing , for reasons of her own , to sit in a first-class " colored car " ; infringing , if you please , some rule ; but paying her way , and causing no one any inconvenience , unsafety , or delay . Imagine her , on insisting upon her wish to stay , drawn from her seat by force , and lifted and carried out by a black conductor , telling her as he goes that her offer to walk out comes too late . If this is not ignominy , what is it ? To the commission and palliation of such unmanly deeds are we driven by our attempts to hold under our own arbitrary dictation others ' rights that we have no moral right to touch , rights that in ourselves we count more sacred than property and dearer than life . But we must not tarry . If we turn to the matter of roadside refreshment what do we see ? Scarcely a dozen railroad refreshment-rooms from the Rio Grande to the Potomac ,  --  is there one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be he ever so perfect in dress and behavior , can snatch a hasty meal in the presence of white guests of any class whatever , though in any or every one of them he or she can get the same food , and eat with the same knife , fork , and plate that are furnished to white strangers , if only he or she will take a menial 's attitude and accept them in the kitchen . Tennessee has formally " abrogated the rule of the common law " in order to make final end of " any right in favor of any such person so refused *dmission " to the enjoyment of an obvious civil right which no public host need ever permit any guest to mistake for a social liberty . As to places of public amusement , the gentlemen who say that " each race gets the same accommodation for the same money , " simply- forget . The statement comes from Atlanta . But , in fact , in Atlanta , in Georgia , in the whole South , there is scarcely a place of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are no seated audiences - in which a colored man or woman , however unobjectionable personally , can buy , at any price , any but a second - sometimes any but a third or fourth class accommodation . During a day 's stay in Atlanta lately , the present writer saw many things greatly to admire ; many inspiring signs of thrift , stability , virtue , and culture . Indeed , where can he say that he has not seen them , in ten Southern States lately visited ? And it is in contemplation of these evidences of greatness , prosperity , safety , and the desire to be just , that he feels constrained to ask whether it must be that in the principal depot of such a city the hopeless excommunication of every person of African tincture from the civil rewards of gentility must be advertised by three signs at the entrances of three separate rooms , one for " Ladies , " one for " Gentlemen , " and the third a " Colored waitingroom " ? Visiting the principal library of the city , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no person of color would be allowed to draw out books ; and when a colored female , not particularly tidy in dress , came forward to return a book and draw another , it was quickly explained that she was merely a servant and messenger for some white person . Are these things necessary to - are they consistent with-an exalted civilization founded on equal rights and the elevation of the masses ? And the freedman 's rights in the courts . It is regarding this part of our subject that our friends on the other side make a mistake too common everywhere and very common among us of the South . That is , they assume the state of affairs in more distant localities to be the same as that immediately around them . A statement concerning certain matters in Florida or Maryland is indignantly denied in Tennessee or Texas because it is not true of those regions ; and so throughout . It is in this spirit that one of these gentlemen explains that in Georgianegroes are not excluded from the jury lists except for actual incompetency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the other States . " But really , in Tennessee they may not sit in the jury-box at all , except that in a few counties they may sit in judgment on the case of a colored person . While in Texas , at the very time of the gentleman 's writing , the suggestion of one of her distinguished citizens to accord the right of jury duty to the colored people , was being flouted by the press as an " innovation upon established usage , " and a " sentimental and utterly impracticable idea . " This in the face of a State constitution and laws that give no warrant for the race distinction . So much for assumption . The same mistake is repeated by the same writer in discussing the question of the freedmen 's criminal sentences . No fact or person is brought forward to prove or disprove anything except for Georgia . And even the prcsecuting attorney for the Atlanta circuit , brought in to testify , says , for the State 's cities and towns , that the negro there " gets equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not willing to deny " a lingering prejudice and occasional injustice " in remote counties . Why , with nearly 6 , ooo , ooo freed people getting " full and exact justice in the // courts whether the jury is white or black , " why could there not be found a ; wong them two or three trustworthy witnesses to testify to this fact ? Their testimony would have been important , for these lines are written within hand 's reach of many letters from colored men denying that such is the case . The present writer does not charge , and never did , that our Southern white people consciously and maliciously rendered oppressive verdicts against the freedman . On the contrary , it is plainly stated by him that they acted " not so maliciously as unreflectingly , " and " ignorant of the awful condition of the penitentiaries . " His only printed utterance on the subject is on record in " The Freedman 's Case in Equity , " and is too long to quote ; but he cited the offeial retorts of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts before us we are to escape the conviction that the popular mind had been seduced-as every student of American prison statistics knows it has-by the glittering temptations of our Southern convict-lease system ; and not one word of reply have we had , except the assertion , which nobody would think of denying , that the black man , often in Georgia , and sometimes elseWhere , gets an even-handed and noble justice from white juries . Have our opponents observed the workings of this convict-lease system ? To put such a system as a rod of punishment into the hands of a powerful race sitting in judgment upon the misdemeanors of a feebler and despised caste would warp the verdicts of the most righteous people under the sun . Examine our Southern penitentiary reports . What shall we say to such sentences inflicted for larceny alone , as twelve , fourteen , fifteen , twenty , and in one case forty years of a penal service whose brutal tasks and whippings kill in an average of five years ? Larceny is the peculiar crime of the poorest classes everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this offense always exceed and generally double the number of convicts foi burglary . Larceny has long been called the favorite crime of the negro criminal . What , then , shall we say to the facts , deduced from official records , that in the Georgia penitentiary and convict camps there were in 1882 twice as many colored convicts for burglary as for larceny , and that they were , moreover , serving sentences averaging nearly twice the average of the white convicts* in the same places for the same crime ? This , too , notwithstanding a very large number of short sentences to colored men , and a difference between their longest and shortest terms twice as great as in the case of the whites . Without counting the exceptional forty years ' senFor larceny the difference is five times as tence mentioned . IX . POLITICAL " SOLIDITY " - WHY AND TILL WHEN . IN the same number of THE CENTURY that contains " In Plain Black and White . " appears an open letter on " The Solid South . " It tells us that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of candidates nor questions , is an emphatic national and still greater local evil ; but that the whites of the South " had to be solid , " because they feared , and that they still fear , the supremacy of the blacks . That if this fear were removed the whites would divide . Hence , we must first procure the division of the blacks ; this is what it calls " the prerequisite . " Is it ? Is that a wise or just arbitration ? Must the side that is immeasurably the weaker begin the disarmament ? Is " noblesse oblige " untranslatable into " American " ? We are only told that " once divide the negro vote and the great. * Shall we from these facts draw hasty conclusions ? We draw none . If any one can explain them away , in the name of humanity let us rejoice to see him do so . We are far from charging any one with deliberately prostituting justice . We are far from overlooking " the depravity of the negro . " But those who rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows the greater maliciousness ; for one man to be guilty of hog-stealing or for twelve jurors to send him to the coal mines for twenty years for doing it ? In Georgia outside her prisons there are eight whites to every seven blacks . Inside , there are eight whites to every eighty blacks . The depravity of the negro may explain away much , but we can not know how much while there also remain in force the seductions of our atrocious convict-lease system , and our attitude of domination over the blacks , so subtly dangerous to our own integrity . Here is a rough , easy test that may go for what it is worth : These crimes of larceny and burglary are just the sort - since they are neither the most trivial nor the most horrible - to incur excessive verdicts and sentences , if the prejudices of one class against another come into the account . Now , what is the fact in the prisons we have mentioned ? Of all the inmates under sentence for these crimes nineteen-twentieths are classed as of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the jury-box . We ask no opinion on these points from the stupid or vicious of either whites or blacks ; but is it wise for us not to consider what may be their effect upon the minds of the property-holding , intelligent , and virtuous portion of the " dominated " race ? Is it right ? // solid South ' is broken . " True statement , but sadly antique . An old catchword pulled out of the rubbish of the Reconstruction strife . And why was the negro vote solid ? The carpet-bagger and scalawag ? It was so believed , and these - the most of them richly deserving their fate-were suppressed . What then ? Less political activity among the blacks . But division ? No . Then why were the blacks still " solid . " The open letter gives two causes : first , gratitude to the Republican party ; second , fear of the Democratic . But these sentiments , it says , are fading out . Will their disappearance reveal the solid blacks divided ? That depends on the matter that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid bottom of this question . But the more ambitious article in the same number of the magazine boldly confesses it when it decrees the subserviency of the freedman 's civil rights to the white man 's domination . As long as that continues to be or to threaten , the blacks will be solid . We-any people-would be so - would have to be so , in their place . Such a decree is equivalent to saying they must and shall be solid . Only let it be withdrawn and the solidity will vanish from the white vote and the black at the same instant . This is what is coming . There is to-day no political party in America that is " solid " for this un-American and tyrannical principle ; and the reason why the negro vote is a divided vote in the North to-day and in the South shows more signs of dividing than ever before is that the Republican party has grown fat and lazy concerning civil rights , while Democratic legislatures and governors , north , east , west , have been passing and signing civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular sentiment this heresy of domination by fixed class and race , and throwing to the winds " legal discriminations on account of color which are not based on character or conduct and have no relation to moral worth and fitness for civic usefulness , but are rather relics of prejudice which had its origin in slavery . I recommend , " says the present Democratic governor of Ohio , from whose message we are quoting , " I recommend their total repeal . " It is but little over a year since the Democrats joined the Republicans in the legislature of Connecticut in making liable to fine and imprisonment " every person who subjects or causes to be subjected any other person to the deprivation of any rights , privileges , or immunities secured or protected by the Constitution of the State or of the United States , on account of such person being an alien or by reason of his color or race . " The time is still shorter since a Democratic majority in the legislature of New Jersey passed a bill of civil rights , as its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every race and color . " Nor are they afraid of the names of things . " By direction of Governor Abbett , " writes the executive clerk , " I send you copy of the Civil Rights bill as passed by the Legislature and approved by him . " In Indiana , while these pages were being written , Democrats were endeavoring to pass a civil rights bill . In May of last year the legislature at Albany passed a bill removing the last remaining civil disabilities fromthe colored people in the city of New York , by a unanimous vote , " three-fifths being present " ; and the governor who signed the act is now President of the United States . " Ah ! " some will say , " these Northern Democrats do this in their ignorance ; they do not know the negro . " Is this the whole truth ? Do not we forget that they have only gradually put aside from their own minds the very worst opinion of the negro that ever we had ? To get where they are they have left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights that we are called to lay aside , and no others . Nay , even we assert facts now , that twenty years ago we used to say no man who knew the negro could honestly believe . " But "  --  the answer comes again- " if they had the negro among them numerically powerful , they would not venture to concede " - etc . Let us see : From Georgia , where , we are told , the freedman shall never enjoy " the policy indicated in the Civil Rights bill , " pass across its eastern boundary , and lo , we are in a State under Southern Democratic rule , where the blacks are in the majority , yet which is not afraid to leave on the printed page , from the days of Reconstruction , a civil nghts bill , not nearly so comprehensive , it is true , but " fully as stringent , " says its leading daily journal , " as any that Congress ever placed upon the statute-books , " and attending whose enforcement " there is no friction or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time be not long delayed when her strong , proud people , that are sometimes wrong but ever conscientious and ever brave , not content with merely not undoing , shall broaden the applications of that law until it perfectly protects white man and black man alike in the enjoyment of every civil right , and their hearts behind the law open to the freedman equally with the white man , as far as in him lies to achieve it , every civil reward of intelligence , wealth , and virtue . Then shall it still be as true as it is to-day that " No special harm has come of it . " Not only so ; but the freedman , free indeed , shall along with his other fetters cast off the preoccupation in this question of civil rights which now engrosses hisbest intelli // gence , and shall become a factor in the material and moral progress of the whole land . Be the fault now where it may , he will not then outnumber the white man on the prison rolls eleven to one . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . The temptations to which the negro-shut out from aspirationsnow yields , will lose their power , and his steps be turne ith a new hope and desire toward the prize in ustry , frugality , and a higher cultivation . Multiplying and refining his tastes , the rank energies of his present nature will not , as now , run entirely to that animal fecundity characteristic of all thriftless , reckless , unaspiring populations ; his increase in civic value will be quickened , his increase in numbers retarded to a rate more like our own . And neither all the crops our sun-loved South can yield , nor all the metals and minerals that are under the soil made sacred by the blood of her patriots , can bring us such wealth and prosperity as will this change in the hopes and ambitions of our once unaspiring , timeserving slaves . The solid black will be solid no longer ; but he will still be black . X. THE GEOGRAPHY OF AMALGAMATION . Is IT not wonderful ? A hundred years we have been fearing to do entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give the black man an equal chance with us in the race of life lest we might . have to grapple with the Vast , vague afrite of Amalgamation ; and in all this hundred years , with the enemies of slavery getting from us such names as negrophiles , negro-worshipers , and miscegenationists ; and while we were claiming to hold ourselves rigidly separate from the lower race in obedience to a natal instinct which excommunicated them both socially and civilly ; just in proportion to the rigor , the fierceness , and the injustice with which this excommunication from the common rights of man has fallen upon the darker race , has amalgamation taken place . Look - we say again - at the West Indies . Then turn and look at those regions of our common country that we have been used to call the nests of fanaticism : Philadelphia , Boston , Plymouth Church , and the like . Look at Oberlin , Ohio . For years this place was the grand central depot , as one might say , of the " Underground Railway " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fugitive slaves ; weeping over them , praying over them , feeding them , housing them , hiding them in her bosom , defying the law for them , educating them , calling them sir and madam , braving no end of public contumely , and showing them every exasperating consideration . Look at Berea , VOL . XXX. - 73 . Kentucky , where every kind thing contrivable that , according to our old ideas , could destroy a white man 's self-respect and " spoil a nigger " has been practiced . What is the final fact ? Amalgamation ? Miscegenation ? Not at all . The letters of the presidents of these two famous institutions lie before the present writer , stating that from neither of them throughout their history has there resulted a single union of a white with a black person either within their precincts or elsewhere within the nation s wide boundaries . And of the two towns in which they are situated , in only one have there been from first to last three or four such unions . How have they been kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instinct ? No ! It was because they did ; wtfollow instinct , but the better dictates of reason and the ordinary natural preferences of like for like . But , it is sometimes asked , admitting this much , will not undivided civil relations tend eventually-say after a few centuries  --  to amalgamation ? Idle question ! Will it help the matter to withhold men s manifest rights ? What can we do better for the remotest future than to be just in the present and leave the rest to the Divine Rewarder of nations that walk uprightly ? XI . THE NATURAL-GROWTH POLICY . THERE is a school of thought in the South that stands midway between the traditionists and us . Its disciples have reasoned away the old traditions and are now hampered only by vague ideas of inexpediency . They pray everybody not to hurry . They have a most enormous capacity for pausing and considering . " It is a matter , " says one of them in a late periodical , " of centuries rather than decades , of evolution rather than revolution . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their prayer is not so much that our steps may be logical as geological . They propose to wait the slow growth of civilization as if it were the growth of rocks , or as if this were the twelfth or thirteenth century . They contemplate progress as if it were a planetary movement to be looked at through the telescope . Why , we . are the motive power of progress ! Its speed depends on our courage , integrity , and activity . It is an insult to a forbearing God and the civilized world for us to sit in full view of moral and civil wrongs manifestly bad and curable , saying we must expect this or that , and that , geologically considered , we are getting along quite rapidly . Such talk never won a battle or a race , and the hundred years past is long enough for us of the South to have been content with a speed that the rest of the civilized world has left behind . The tortoise won in the race with the hare , the race // did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already to those who teach the safety of being slow . " hake haste slowly , " is the true emphasis . Can not these lovers of maxims appreciate that " Delays are dangerous " ? For we have a case before us wherein there is all danger and no safety in floating with the tide . Our fathers had such a case when African slavery was first fastening its roots about the foundations of our order of society . They were warned by their own statesmen to make haste and get rid of it . " You must approach the subject , " cried the great Jefferson . " You must adopt some plan of emancipation or worse will follow " ; and all the way down to Henry Clay that warning was with more or less definiteness repeated . But our fathers were bitten with the delusion of postponement , and the practice of slavery became an Institution . It grew , until every element of force in our civilization - the political arena , the sacred desk , the legislative hall , the academical chair-all - were wrapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South be to-day , far on in front , but for that sad mistake ? At length , suddenly , rudely , slavery was brought to an end . What that cost we all know ; yet let us hope there are many of us who can say with our sainted Lee , not merely " I am rejoiced that slavery is abolished " ; but " I would cheerfully have lost all I have lost by the war , and have suffered all I have suffered , to have this object attained . " * Such was our fathers ' problem . The problem before us is the green , rank stump of that felled Institution . Slavery in particular - the slavery of the individual man to his one master , which rested upon the law , is hy the law abolished . Slavery in general - the subordination of a fixed ruled to a fixed ruling class - the slavery of civil cask , which can only in part , and largely can not , be legislated away , remains . Sad will it be for our children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man traveling in the North and a Northern man just returned from a commercial tour of the South lately fell into conversation on a railway train . Said the Northerner , " What the South needs is to import capital , induce immigration , develop her enormous latent wealth , and let politics alone . " " Sir , " said the Southerner , " I know you by that sign for a commercial man , as I might know a hard student by his glasses and peering eyes . With you all things else are subsidiary to commerce ; hence , even commercially , you are near-sighted . It is true the South should seek those things you mention . They are for her better safety , comfort , and happiness . But what are politics ? In this land , at least , simply * See open letter in THE CENTURY for May , 1885. questions concerning the maintenance or increase of our safety , comfort , and happiness ; questions that can not be let alone , but must be attended to as long as those things demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a depot . Men could be heard under the wheels , tapping them with theirhammers to test their soundness. - " To ask us to let politics alone is to ask us to leave the wheels* our train untested , its engine unoiled its hot es glowing , while we scurry on after more passengers and passengers ' fares ; - which is just the way not to get them . Do not ask it of us . Our scantiness of capital , meagerness of population , and the undeveloped condition of our natural resources are largely owing , this day , to our blindly insisting that certain matters in our politics shall be let alone . It was our letting them alone that brought Federal interference , and that interference has been withdrawn upon our pledge not to let them alonebut to settle them . " About a year ago the present writer visited the thriving town of Birmingham , Alabama . Its smelting furnaces were viewed with special interest . It was fine to see the crude ore of the earth , so long trampled under foot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the prime factors of the world 's wealth . But another thought came with this , at sight of the dark , brawnymen standing or moving here and there with the wild glare of molten cinder and liquid metal falling upon their black faces and reeking forms . These were no longer simple husbandmen , companions of unfretted nature . If the subterranean wealth of the South is to be brought to the surface and to market all over the land , as now it is in this miniature of the great English Birmingham ; if , as seems inevitable , the black man is to furnish the manual labor for this vast result , then how urgent is our necessity for removing from him all sense of grievance that we rightly may remove , and all impediment to his every proper aspiration , ere the bright , amiable influences of green fields and unsoiled streams , of leafy woods , clear sky , fragrant airs , and song of birds pass out of his life , and the sooty , hardening , dulling toils of the coal-pit and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , breed a new bad knowledge- of the power of numbers and a thirst for ferocious excitements , and make him the dangerous and intractable animal that now he is not . For our own interests , one and all of them , we ought to lose no time . Our task is one whose difficulties can never be less , its facilities never be greater . We have no wars to distract and preoccupy . Here is a kindly race of poor men unlearned in the evil charms of unions , leagues , secret orders , strikes and bread-riots ; looking not upon the capitalist as a natural enemy ; stranger to all those hos // tilities against the richer and stronger world around them which drive apart the moneyed man and the laborer wherever living has become a hard struggle . What an opportunity is ours to-day that will never return when once it goes from us . Look at Ireland . XII . " MOVE ON . " WE occupy , moreover , a ground on which we can not remain . It is not where we stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ownership of himself . We see and feel there is no going back from universal suffrage . And its advocate may make a point of tremendous strength in the fact that this very universality of suffrage is what has bred in the South a new sense of the necessity of public education for all and of whatever else will enlighten and elevate the lower mass . Ignorance , penury , unintelligence , and the vices that go with themthe bonds that hold the freedman down from beneath - we are helping them to cast off . But to cut these loose and still lay on the downward pressure of civil caste-is there any consistency in this ? We can not do it and respect our own intelligence . Socially we can do nothing for the freedman or against him by rule or regulation . That is a matter , as we might say , of specific gravity . But as to his civil rights , we can not stay where we are . Neither can we go backward . To go forward we must cure one of our oldtime habits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ours . It grew out of our having an institution to defend that made a united front our first necessity . We have none now . Slavery is gone . State rights are safer than ever before , because better defined ; or , if unsafe , only because we have grown loose on the subject . We have nothing peculiar left save civil caste . Let us , neighbor with neighbor , and friend with friend , speak of it , think of it , write of it , get rid of it . Ruskin 's words seem almost meant for our moment and region : " For now some ten or twelve years , " he says , " I have been asking every good writer whom I know to write some part of what was exactly true , in the greatest of the sciences , that of Humanity . " We speak for this when we speak truly against civil caste . It is caste that the immortal Heber calls " a system which tends . . . to destroy the feelings of general benevolence . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at least , let us be rid of it . This done , the words North and South shall mean no more than East or West , signifying only directions and regions , and not antipodal ideas of right and government ; and though each of us shall love his own State with ardor , the finest word to our ear as citizens shall be America . To her we see irreversibly assigned the latest , greatest task in the " science of Huinanity " : to burst the last chrysalis of the national relation and consummate its last grand metamorphosis . Once it knew no wider bound than the tribal relation . But the day is on us at length , the problem is ours , and its great weight and responsibility and the honor of it when achieved rest and will rest on our Southern States . It is to make national harmony and unity broader than race ; to crystallize into fact the truth that national unity need not demand unification of race ; to band togetherwithout one single class disability or privilege diminishing or enhancing any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undistinguished enjoyment of every human civil right which only can insure national harmony and unity , two antipodal races ; two races that have no wish to , and for all we know never will , mingle their two bloods in one stream . Nationalization by fusion of bloods is the maxim of barbarous times and peoples . Nationalization without racial confusion is ours to profess and to procure . It is not a task of our choosing . But our fathers , unawares , entailed it upon us , and we can not but perform it . We can not hold American principles in perfect faith and not do it . The good doctrine of liberty to all and license to none thrusts it inevitably into our hands . To make national unity without hybridity - the world has never seen it done as we have got to do it ; but it is the business of every generation that comes into the world to bring into it better things than it has ever seen . We have got to build a nationality as free from all civil estrangement as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of human races . This is the meaning of the great revolution upon us to-day . Daily the number increases of those who grasp it . A little while ago the whole nation rejected it . To reject it to-day is to be left behind the nation 's best thought . How fast that thought is spreading in the South few know . Like the light of kindling watch-fires it is catching from mind to mind . The best men of the South are coming daily into convictions that condemn their own beliefs of yesterday as the antiquated artillery of an outgrown past ; and to the present writer , as one who himself found this not easy , but hard , to do , it seems no improbability that our traditionist friends , even before this reply can reach them , may be found ranging themselves among that number , for the promotion of this revolution that everybody knows must come . To say what must , is to say what will be ; and so shall the reproach of slavery , the greatest moral mistake made by the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this noble gain for the cause of humanity and universal peace .
