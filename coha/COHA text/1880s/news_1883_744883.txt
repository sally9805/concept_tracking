txt There was a hotly contested dog-fight in Red Bank , N. J. , last . Monday ; and now we are told that many leading citizens and " strict members of the church " are to be arrested for being present at this dogfight , and for aiding and abetting it . " A member . of the . church " is a phrase of very wide application . As used by most newspapers it includes everybody who. has any connection with any religious body , from the Church of Rome down to a Mormon conventicle . , As to what particular kind of church members attend dog-fights in Red Bank no clue is . given us , but from the fact that they are described by the adjective " strict , " we may assume that they belong to some one of the so-called evangelical sects ; and , in all probability , to that particular sect which holds in the highest honor the religious poet WATTS . The presence of these men at a dog-fight is doubtless the result of the pernicious seed sown in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moral Songs " of the aforesaid WATTS . poems of the most notorious of that person 's poems begins : " Let dogs delight to bark and bite . " This poem is written for children , and is put into their hands by misguided or igno ? rant parents . Its brutal advice to children to encourage dog-fights works deep into their innocent souls . The fatal lesson thus taught is rarely forgotten , and when the child whom WATTS has taught to regard dog-fighting as a duty grows to man 's estate he is always ready to encourage dogs to tear one another to pieces . Those " strict members of the church " who are to be arrested for participating in the Red Bank dog-fight are probably the victims of WATTS 'S pernicious poetry , and on that account should be dealt with tenderly . If , on the contrary , it should be proved that they are Roman Catholics or Episcopalians , it will be evident that they have sinned willfully and without any encouragement on the part of WATTS , and hence they should be punished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to call the attention of parents to the poisonous literature miscalled " Divine and Moral Songs , " and procure its banishment from respectable families .
