txt As stated already in the dispatches to THE TIMES Mr. Bradley has at home made several statements to the effect that he would vote against Conkling and Platt . Mr. Congdon , of Cattaraugus , brought this report from Judge Bolles , of Olean , who was yesteraay interviewed in buttaio by a reporter of the Express . His statement is as follows : " The first question naturally was as to what he thought of the bribery case . Ho replied at once that he thought it a put-up job : that the money came from the Conkling side , and that Bradley had not even been imposed upon . Bradley represents the First Assembly District of Cattaraugus County , and this is his first term in the Legislature . He is from 30 to 35 years of age , an oil operator , and at the time he was elected was pretty well thought of . although it was known that he had before openly received and used money for political purposes . Judge Bolles did not consider him a very sharp politician ; infect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp . The Hon. Lorin B. Sessions , who Bradley alleges gave him the $2,000 conditional that he should vote for Depew. is the Senator for the district composed of the Counties of Cattaraugus and Chautauqua . When the first several votes were taken , Judge Bolles continued , Bradley voted now for one man , then for another , then a third . Sze. , but it was probable that he was in with the Conkling managers from the first . Since tho resignations he had been home three times , and each time he declared that he was against Conklim and knew that four out of five of his constituents were . The first time ? and this led the Judge to distrust him  --  while declaring his opposition to the return of Conkling and Platt , he averred that the half-breeds , as he called them , were opposed to a caucus ; that this did n't suit him ; they must have a caucus . Last Saturday he was home for the third time , and made the same avowal of opposition to the ex-Senators , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a CentralHailroad man and a monopolist ; the reason he was voting for Conkling was to deprive Depew of what influence he could ; by and by they were going to elect two men who would be perfectly satisfactory to the people of the State of New-York and to his constituents . All this wiggling about convinced the Judge that the Conkling men had early got control of Bradley , that they furnished him with his argument and supplied him with the money for the pretended bribery trick . They thought to got up a reaction which would either re-elect Conkling and Platt or so scatter and annoy the Administration men that they would adjourn . The trick was transparent and palpable . The Judge could not say that he was an ardent admirer of Senator Sessions. but he entirely believed his statement given before the investigating committee . " " Why 1 " queried the reporter . " Because I do n't think him a fool , " replied the Judge . " He is one of the smartest politicians in the State , and with his knowledge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of utter folly . " Without more passing between them than Bradley lied sworn to , he considered that the thing would have been utterly senseless . Concerning Bradley 's reputation in bis county , he had heard of nothing in particular against him except his corrupt use of money in a political canvass . Bradley was at one time very dissipated , but the Judge could not say as to the truth of the report that he bad been an inmate of an inebriate asylum , and he believed that of late Bradley had not been drinking . During his stay in Albany he had seemed to be entirely under the control of a prominent Cattaraugus County politician who was in Conkling 's interest . In relation to the sentiment in Cattaraugus County , the Judge said it was all one way . The people were more than indignant ; they felt outraged . He bad been three weeks at the Circuit Court , and accordingly met a great many of the leading citizens of the county . He had heard of two or three who favored the return of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that way . Last Saturday Bradley said , " I know the people are down on Conkling and Platt . " " Nine-tenths of them , " spoke up a prominent Olean man . " Yes . I know it , " replied Bradley , " and I will do as far as I can what my constituents want , but I must consult some one else , and that 's Bradley . "
