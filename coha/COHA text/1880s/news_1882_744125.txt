txt One of the chief points in dispute between the trunk lines of railroad is that of a difference in through rates between the West and the principal commercial cities of the Atlantic coast . Under the old pooling arrangement the rates were the same for New-York and Boston , but a discrimination was made in favor of Philadelphia and Baltimore . The difference established was purely arbitrary , and was in the nature of a concession from the New-York roads to the Pennsylvania and the Baltimore and Ohio , as one among the considerations on which the pooling agreement was based . Dissatisfaction with the differential rates , if not one of the chief causes of the recent railroad war , was at least one of the chief difficulties in the way of bringing it to a conclusion . The preliminary understanding by which the old tariff of rates has been re-established leaves this question to be examined and decided by a commission , but , as we understand it , no agreement was made to accept and be bound by the decision . It will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Commissioners have been selected and are men identified in no way either with the rival railroads or the rival cities at which they terminate , but their names have not been given to the public . This question of differential rates is one in which the City of New-York has a deep concern , and no settlement of it can be final which disregards its interests . It may further be said that there is only one decision in regard to it which will be acceptable to the merchants of New-York and which can afford a basis for a permanent settlement of the question . Differential rates must simply be abandoned . They are founded neither in reason nor justice , and it is not for four or five railroad corporations to agree among themselves that the commerce of the Metropolis shall be handicapped for the benefit of other cities which have not , the same advantages . Whatever the natural or acquired advantages of New York as a sea-port may be , it is entitled to the full benefit of them , and they should not be offset by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a view to building up the business of other ports . The effect of differential rates is perfectly obvious . If a few cents more per hundredweight is charged for the transportation of merchandise between this City and Western markets and shipping points than is charged on the same merchandise between Philadelphia or Baltimore and the same points , there can be but one result . An incubus is placed upon the commerce of this port that checks its natural growth and freedom of movement and enables the other cities to prosper at its expense . They arc entitled to all the prosperity they can make for themselves or that their railroads can make for them , but they are not entitled to put a tax upon the prosperity of New-York , and the railroads of New-York have no right to agree to help them do it for a consideration of any kind . The only ground on which the Philadelphia and Baltimore claim for differential rates is or can be based is that the distance between them and the shipping points of the West is less than the distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Chicago to New-York-is 900 miles , to Philadelphia 823 , to Baltimore 802 ; from St. Louis to New-York 1,050 miles , to Philadelphia 973 , and to Baltimore 917 ; from Cincinnati to New-York 743 , to Philadelphia 667 , to Baltimore 576 ; from Cleveland to New-York 580 , to Philadelphia 682 , to Baltimore 661 . To and from these and all other places of shipment in the West there has been for years a discrimination in rates against New-York , and most of the time it has been in favor of Boston , which is 100 miles further , as well as Philadelphia and Baltimore . Now , there is in reality no justice in the claim that rates should be arbitrarily fixed at a lower figure on account of the difference in ' distance . If other things were equal , this difference would be a trifling matter in such a long haul of freight , but other things are not equal , and the question of distance should not be the controlling one in fixing rates . In the case of so small a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are other considerations which may entirely overcome it , and in case of New York and its railroads these actually exist . The rate at which railroads can afford to transport merchandise depends on many things besides distance . They can . afford to carry it through a country that furnishes a large way traffic cheaper than through one which does not . They can afford to carry it to and from a region that opens to them large and varied local markets cheaper than to and from those which do not . They can afford to carry it to and from a sea-port which has large facilities for foreign commerce and can give them great bulk of traffic cheaper than to and from those whose facilities and commercial connections are smaller . Now , New-York can afford business advantages to railroads terminating here which far outweigh in importance and possibilities of profit a difference of less than a hundred miles in the distance over which their traffic is carried . Under any system of free competition no railroad would ever think of finding its account in charging more for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between Philadelphia or Baltimore and the West . Such a policy would be the reverse of profitable . Nothing but a pooling of business and a distribution of its proceeds in arbitrary proportions under an agreement could ever sustain a system of differential rates such as has been maintained in past years to the detriment of New-York commerce . Such an arrangement may possibly be made satisfactory for a time to the railroad companies concerned , but the business community of this City has found out just what it means and what its effect must be , and it will never be tolerated again for any length of time . No commission can make it acceptable or cause it to be accepted . If a new railroad combination attempts to force it into effect , means will be found to break the power of the combination . Such an embargo on New-York commerce can not be permitted without imperiling interests that are strong enough to raise it , if it has to be done by building a freight railroad to the West which will cut under the figures of all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
