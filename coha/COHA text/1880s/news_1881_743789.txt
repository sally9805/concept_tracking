txt The fact that a number of different propositions have been urged upon the attention of the Legislature for the improvement of the Erie Canal as a link in the transportation system of the State and the country shows that there is a growing perception of its value and importance and of the urgent necessity of increasing its efficiency . These propositions have come from a variety of sources , and are urged upon a wide range of considerations , but they are all based on the need of doing something to utilize to better advantage the water connection between the lakes and the Hudson River . Both the State Engineer and the Superintendent of Public Works dwelt in their annual reports on the importance of increasing the capacity of the canal and facilitating ells navigation , with a view to meeting the competition which will soon open through Canada , when the Welland Canal and the improvements on the St. Lawrence River have been completed . A resolution is pending in the Senate for an amendment of the Constitution freeing the canals from State tolls and providing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been made to remove the constitutional restriction on expenditures for repairs and improvements , to allow the transfer of the Erie Canal to the United States Government , to be enlarged and improved as a national water- , way , and to permit it to go into the keeping and management of private enterprise . There has been a project for the construe : . tion of a railway on the berme bank , and the application of locomotive , towage , all the property and advantages of the new system to fall ultimately to the State , after the projectors had derived remuneration from the profits of a series of years under the restriction and supervision of State authority . ' Now comes another . project for lining the , prism of the Erie Canal throughout its whole length with hydraulic cement , with an increase rather than a diminution of its capacity , which would relieve it from the necessity of dredging and ? constant repairs , and enable it to carry small propellers coming through the lake 's from Chicago and the North-west . We find in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canal are beginning to be realized , as well as the danger to the commercial supremacy of New-York threatened by other water lines from theinterior to the sea-board . The development of the vast and productive region of the North-west has only just begun . The enormous and increasing bulk of its productions must reach the markets of the world by way of the sea-ports , and every mile of water carriage is an important economic advantage . Nature provided two great outlets  --  one by way of the Mississippi River to the Gulf of Mexico , the other by way of the lakes and the St. Lawrence  --  to the Atlantic Ocean . The navigation of the Mississippi has been slow in developing , and encounters a variety ? of obstacles and ? disadvantages , which can be . ? overcome only by time and expense . That , of the St. Lawrence has been interrupted by cataracts and rapids , which are soon to be circumvented , and is impeded by long and severe ' Winters . But nature prepared the way for another and better route than either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enterprise and energy of man to complete it .

CLINTON two generations ago accepted the suggestions ; of nature and constructed the Erie Canal , to which New York mainly owes its start on the way to commercial supremacy . It was a great work for its time , but it was owned and , controlled by the State , and has , therefore , been slow to respond to the impulses of progress and improvement .

Not only is the Erie Canal inadequate to meet the exigencies of the future for water communication , but the State has been , in- , duced to tie its own hands and hamper its own resources with . constitutional ments to its improvement . It can not be disposed of or placed in other hands , and money can not be expended upon it in excess of the revenue of the year preceding the expenditure . These restrictions should be removed , but at the same time some intelligent canal policy should ' be entered upon .. By some means the capacity of the Erie Canal should be increased to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the means and methods of navigation should be improved as far as the skill arid invention of the time will ' admit , and the policy : of management : should serve the great commercial interests of the country and the State and of their chief Metropolis , rather than a petty notion of balancing the direct receipts and expenditures . There is a scheme well under way for connecting the Mississippi River itself with . Lake Michigan through the Illinois River and a canal to Chicago . There is now a project talked of for connecting Lake Michigan with Lake Erie by a direct line across the southern part of the State of Michigan , which would save a thousand miles of navigation by way of the Mackinaw Straits . Let these be carried out and the Erie Canal be improved in accordance with modern ideas of enterprise , with a subsidiary railway that would in a measure continue its advantages through the Winter , and New-York will make the world the tributary of its expanding wealth , and its harbor will teem with the peaceful fleets of the nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more powerful than restrictive legislation , but the railroads themselves will share in the benefit of the fuller and more vigorous currents of our commerce .
