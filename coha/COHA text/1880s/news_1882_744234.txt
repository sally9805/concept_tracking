txt The Senate Spent four or five hours to-day in talk  --  some of it excellent as talk  --  but it did nothing else but talk . Mr. Beck , who called up his bill to make over-certification of checks a misdemeanor , encountered the solid opposition of the Republican side , and a tie vote prevented its consideration . The Senate then plunged into a sea of speech-making , on a motion of Mr. Hampton to consider the bill for the relief of Dr. A. Sidney Tebbs . Dr. Tebbs , when a boy , was a'page in the rebel Legislature of Tennessee , and he now seeks service in the United States Army . He is debarred by section 1,218 of the Revised Statutes , which says that " No person who has served in any capacity in the military , naval , or civil service of the so-called Confederate States , or either of the States in insurrection during the late rebellion , shall be appointed to any position in the Army of the United States . " By a vote of 28 to 22 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Edmunds 's opposition , and then Mr. Edmunds took the floor . He desired the ease of Dr. Tebbs to go to the Judiciary Committee , which was considering other similar cases . Mr. Garland suggested that Congress , which was being called on from time to time to relieve persons from such disabilities , could and should repeal the statute disqualifying them , as the statute was a result of the bitter feeling remaining just after the war . In his usual dispassionate way Mr. Edmunds opposed this suggestion . He said that it was a bitter thing for any country to see the men it had educated and reared desert the flag which had protected them , no matter how much they might have felt it to be their duty to do so . Men had done so , and it had been provided that those who had entered the rebellion should now reenter the Army of the United States . They might propose to admit Jefferson Davis and make him a Brigadier-General upon the promise that nothing would induce him again to desert ; but what sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be to the country , to those who were being taught that they ought to stick to their country through thick and thin . The trouble lay in the disposition to lose sight of the fact that one side or the other was right . There could not be two right sides , and there ought to be some everlasting monument to show that there was a right side and a wrong side . As the Government turned out to be on the right side , it ought to be made clear that we knew we were on one side or the other . While Mr. Edmunds 's tone was friendly , it was inevitable that his words should cut deeply , and they did . Mr. Beck characterized the statute as unjust , for , as the war was over 17 years ago , it was plain that no man who was old enough to take part in it against the Government could now hope to get in the Army , for he would be above the eligible age . The only vengeance that could be taken in keeping- this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take service iu the rebellion . Meanwhile , the sons of wealthy leaders , who were off at college during the war , were eligible to appointwent anywhere . It was shameful , in his opinion , that such a section should be allowed to remain . Mr. Hampton regretted the speech Mr. Edmunds had made , and suggesting that the old notions held had reared monuments to those who had fallen in civil wars , related an incident of the late war . A man who had one son m the Federal Army and another in the Confederate had them both brought home dead at the same time . He buried them together , and over them raised a stone with the epitaph : " God alone knows which was right . " Mr. Edmunds admitted that perhaps God alone know which side was right , but he maintained that the Government did not stand as the parent of many States . His idea was that several children were making war on their creator , and that one side was right and the other wrong . He was firmly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Stars and Stripes , waved over the capitol that the country would know that there was a right and a wrong . " I ca n't get it out of my mind , " said he , ? that the future welfare of the country depends upon our adhering to the idea that the Government did achieve the victory . " That victory had been won on principles of liberty and equality , and yet the Government was not to distinguish between classes of men . with keen and cutting language he referred to one party in Congress which had since the war persistently fought to obstruct the consummation of the results of the victory ; had made threats to stop the wheels of government , and yet Senators stood up and said : " How vindictive it is ? " How vindictive you are about the rebellion ? " When Mr. Vest found a chance to respond he expressed the opinion that Mr. Edmunds did not voice the sentiment of the people of the country . He believed the people were anxious to obliterate the monuments of the late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no necessity for the statute under discussion , as the national supremacy was everywhere acknowledged and the results of the war accepted . " If there was a foreign war , " said be , " I ask the Senator from Vermont if he would accept the offer of our blood and arms in its defense ? " Without mincing words , he would say that it was useless for the Senator to say that he believed his ( Mr. Vest 's ) profession of loyalty when he kept on his brow the brand of disloyalty , and said : " I am not willing to trust you ? " Two o'clock having arrived , the matter was summarily dropped . From 2 o'clock until nearly 5 the Senate discussed the Anti-Chinese bill . Mr. Edmunds withdrew an amendment offered by him yesterday proposing to modify the fifteenth section . Mr. Farley , in a long speech , which was repeatedly interrupted , found some fault with his colleague , Mr. Miller , for the manner in which the bill had been allowed to go through the committee . Mr. Vest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill . It was a Caucasian speech , an out and out demand that this Government should be regarded as a white man 's Government . He ridiculed the squeamishness that had led to the passage of the Polygamy bill . while the esthetic Senators from Massachusetts had been defending the Chinese , who are practical polygamists , and who care so little for this country that when they die their polygamous bones are returned to the home of their polygamous ancestors . No vote was taken on the Chinese bill , which was dropped to allow Mr. Plumb to report the result of the conference between the House and Senate on the Post Office Appropriation bill . in the explanation made by him it was made known that the item for increased fast mail facilities was fixed at $600,000 , as had been predicted , with the stipulation that , as far as practicable , there shall he a ratable distribution of the money among the principal cities of the country . The Senate recedes from an appropriation of $10,000 asked for the Second assistant Postmaster-General 's office . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Postmaster-General to exercise his discretion iu his treatment of them . The Senate gives up its amendment restoring the franking privilege . The report of the conference committee was agreed to .
