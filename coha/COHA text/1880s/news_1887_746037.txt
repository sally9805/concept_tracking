txt Boss Platt may be sad . dened to learn through the newspapers , the same medium through which he chose to communicate with the Governor , that his letter will receive no reply by post . But the Governor consented to make a statement to-day to the same public to which the boss has appealed for sympathy . By carefully comparing it with the boss 's letter it will be found to be much more temperate and with here and there a quiet gibe at its author which will be relished by newspaper readers . The statement is as follows : " I can not with propriety take any official no. ties of this letter . The Executive of the State can not properly enter into any ' bargain ' with a Commissioner of Quarantine or any other official as to who would be appointed his sue . cessor in the event of a resignation . I must de , cline to give any ' assurance ' or engage in anj dicker ' in reference to this or any other office , If Mr. Platt sincerely desires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without any promises on my part . Having last Winter nom. mated Dr. Douglass ( Gen. Grant 's physician ) in place of Mr. Platt , and endeavored for months to secure his confirmation by the Senate against the persistent opposition of Mr. Platt and his friends , and this year having nominated Col. Grant for the same place , and for weeks sought to secure his confirmation against the same powerful opposition , no assurance Li needed from me by the friends of Col. Grant ( at whose request 1 made his nomination in the first instance ) as to what course I should pursue in the event of Mr. Platt 's resignation . I am wills fug to state to the public that , while it would give me great pleasure to name Col. Grant as Mr. Platt 's successor , it certainly would be unbecoming , under these circumstances , if not positively illegal on my part , to make any promises in advance , or to arrange with Mr. Platt any terms whatever iu reference to it . " When Mr. Platt resigns ( if he ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to receive suggestions from him as to his successor . But he has not resigned and , in my opinion , does not intend . to do so . He knows very well that I could not enter into any negotiations with him , and his letter is only a part of his scheme to afford a plausible pretext for longer maintaining himself in his office . If Mr. Platt really intended to re% sign it is singular that ho did not inform his Senators , who could have confirmed Col. Grant at once for a full term without any reflection upon anybody . This is all I have to say upon . the subject of the conditional resignation . What official action I may take in reference to charges of mismanagement agaihst the Quarantine ring will be made known hereafter . " The politicians hereabout believe the boss 's proposition to resign is a piece of bluff . They say they never knew him to give up but one thing in his life and that was a United States Senatorship , and they add that his experience in that little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and white in advance of a resignation in the future . One of the principal incentives for his action on this occasion is doubtless a realization of the fact that the Grand Army of the Republic , which so generally demanded the confirmation of Col. Fred Grant , knowing that the responsibility of his rejection rests upon Boss Platt 's shoulders , will rebel when he , as the party 's leader , Plows this bugle next Fall and summons Republicans to fall in and support his candidates for State offices . In an effort to shift this responsibility was his vituperative letter written . The Governor could , if he chose , reconvene the Senate and nominate Col. Grant . Nobody pretends to believe that the boss would even then surrender his salary of $2,500 by allowing his Senators to confirm the Colonel . There may be trouble ahead for the Quarantine ring . The Governor seems to intimate as much in the closing sentence of his statement . There is a way of removing Health Officer Smith , and lie would be justified by many persons in resorting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to be sure , but possibly a few weeks ' acqUaintance with their constituents might persuade enough of the Republicans to unite with the Democrats in ridding the port of New York of the Treasurer of the Quarantine ring . The laws give the Governor the right to Investigate charges against the Health Officer . If , after examination , he finds that these are of sufficient gravity to warrant that officer 's removal , he may call the Senate together and lay the facts before it , together with a recommendation of removal . If a majority of the Senate indorses the recommendation the order of removal can be issued by the Governor . There is another method of procedure , which , however , would hardly be adopted . This is by impeachment . Both branches of the Legislature would participate in this , and the . Platt combine would doubtless devise enough ways to clog the attempt in the Assembly , as this is the body in which impeachment proceedings must originate . The added interest which the boss 's letter gives to the Quarantine ring leads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obnoxious public officers out of the way . The Governor himself is beginning to look into the matter .
