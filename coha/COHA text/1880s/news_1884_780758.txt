txt The cigarmakers held a meeting yesterday afternoon at No. 189 Bowery to discuss the best means to prevent the ratification of the Spanish treaty , by which the import tax on cigars is to be reduced 50 per cent . and the duty on tobacco leaf is to be abolished altogether . This was an adjourned meeting from a previous one , at which the cigar makers expressed their unqualified opposition to the treaty as not only derogatory to the tobacco manufacturing interests of the country , but also as prejudicial to themselves as workingmen , as such a treaty would lower their wages to the level of those of European workmen , and cause them great sufferings , if it did not drive a great portion of that industry out of the country . All were agreed as to the necessity of opposing the ratification of the treaty , and the only question was what was the best method to do it . For the first time in a long while , the manufacturers and workingmen were in unison , and behind the ; cigarmakers there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . Among these are the firms of Lesano &; rendes , manufacturers of line Havana tobacco cigars : Lichtenstem Brothers , Wengler &; Co. , Brown &; Earle , McCoy . Sutro &; Newmark . Sanchez , Hayga &; Co. , C. Upman , Kaufman Brothers , George P. Lies , Powell , Wenigmau &; Smith , A. A. Suma &; Co. , C. Bartolini , M. Staelielberg &; Co. , and M. Hutchinson &; Co . Although none of these manufacturers have taken part in the meetings of the workmen or have been known to be present at any of them , they are not any the less interested in. the agitation , and are working on their own account to obtain the same result  --  the rejection of the treaty by the Senate . A committee of 11 was appointed at the first meeting to go to Washington to appear against the treaty before the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs or any other committee to whom it might be referred . There were a number of workmen , however , who wanted to call a mass meeting of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanding its rejection , and to discuss the subject more thoroughly , and another meeting was called for yesterday afternoon , at which Samuel Gompers presided . A motion was made to hold a mass meeting , but that did not receive as much support as its friends expected . It was argued that while a great deal of indignation would undoubtedly be expressed , the reports of the arguments that would be made at the mass meeting would hardly be presented to the Senators , while the advocates of the treaty would be on the spot with all their arguments and persuasions . Nevertheless some of the German cigarmakers insisted on a mass meeting being hold , and Mr. Feltenberg , one of the Committee of Eleven , made an earnest appeal for one . The Senators , he declared , were the public servants of the workingmen , who had a right to demand the rejection of the treaty , and it was the duty of the Senators and of Congress to accede to the demands of the voters . All that the cigarmakers had to do would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demands . Unless a mass meeting was called Mr. Feltenberg threatened to resign from the committee , and , with his supporters , to withdraw from the agitation . Another more philosophic delegate remarked that there might not be time enough to call and make preparations for a mass meeting upon a grand scale , and that meanwhile the enemy might steal a march upon them . Still another delegate who supported Feltenberg suggested that all cigarmakers and other trades unions throughout the country be requested to make demonstrations . Mr. Gompers , in reply to Mr. Feltenberg , remarked that it was true that workingmen bad a right to make certain demands upon Senators and Congressmen , but when they dal not have the power to enforce those demands it was unwise and a waste of time to make them . - It was better to ask for what they wanted in a practical manner and to present their arguments in such a way as to obtain the desired result . The advocates of the treaty were on the spot , trying their utmost to make an impression upon the Senators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away in New-York and other cities , far from the scene of action . Mr. Gompers had acted as a committeeman to Washington upon a ? former occasion , and he knew that even if the Senators were honest in their intentions they were not posted on everything that came up before them . When he was last in Washington as a member of a committee they found that the Senators were to a great extent ignorant of the wants of the workingmen . SenatqF Allison requested Mr. Gompers to write out the workingmen 's case test as he would write it for an entirely ignorant man , and the Senator would thus be enabled to use it in his argument on the floor of the Senate . A black-eyed and black-haired woman came Into the meeting room , and after giving her name to the Chairman , was introduced as Mrs. Velasquez , of Washington . She spoke English fluently and said that she was a Cuban and had come to help the citrarmakers . She was an old worker in Congress , although she wanted it to be understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had been requested by several Senators to come on to Now-York and confer with the cigarmakers and sugar manufacturers . One hundred and forty members of Congress and 41 Senators were decidedly opposed to the treaty . The speaker said she was very well acquainted with Messrs . Edmunds , Blair , Sherman , Randall , and numerous other Senators and Congressmen . Mr. Foster 's object in drafting the treaty was to further his own individual interests and the interests of his friends , and they would do all that lay in their power to push it through the Senate . Mrs. Velasquez was not only opposed to the treaty , but she wanted to see Cuba annexed , and there were many in Washington who wanted that , too. , Mr. Hill , of.T0hio , was in her office on Saturday , and she had a letter . from Senator Blair asking her to see the different societiesln this city , She urged ' the ' eigarmakers to send representatives to - Washington , where coMmit-tees would arrive hem New-Orleans .
