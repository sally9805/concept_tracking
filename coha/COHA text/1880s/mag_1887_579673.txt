ONE of the commonest artifices of international malevolence is to attribute some vice or defect which is often met with in a foreign country to all the inhabitants of that country , as if there were no differences , no exceptions , no variety of character resulting from individuality . This artifice is constantly successful , because it answers to the common habit of thinking about the inhabitants of a foreign country as if they were all exactly alike . For the untraveled French " les Anglais " are so many copies of one type ; for the untraveled English " the French " are copies of another type . The persistence with which an illusion of this kind can maintain itself may be shown by the common French belief that the English are all of one physical constitution , that they have all fair complexions and sandy hair , that they are invariably tall and ungainly . Half an hour in a London street ought to convince any Frenchman that this type is only one amongst several different English types ; that brown hair is more common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might also notice that many Englishmen are of mediocre stature , and not a few are diminutive . I once happened to meet with a Frenchman who differed from the majority of his countrymen in not being the slave of preconceived ideas . He visited London , made use of his eyes , and told me how surprised he had been to see that the Frenchman 's Englishman , l'Anglais , was so far from being prevalent in the real living population of the capital . He had watched the current of people stream past him at different points , and had corrected his general impression by the only sure and trustworthy method , which is the observation of individuals , one by one . The observation of moral characteristics is not quite so simple a matter , but if faithfully carried out it leads to the same result , - the conviction that there is a very great variety , and that to ignore this variety willfully can only lead to error and injustice . Everybody is aware that there is great variety of character amongst his own countrymen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is the Frenchman who fancies that les Anglais are all alike . Those who live in a country are compelled to see the variety ; they could not , if they would , be blind to it . At a distance , even at a little distance , this kind of voluntary blindness becomes much easier . When our knowledge of a nation is the knowledge of living individual persons , we do not think of it in the abstract , but we remember the persons and think of them . The simplicity and decision of our opinions on a foreign country are wonderfully enhanced by not knowing anybody there . What happens when we do know the people may be made clear by a reference to some family amongst our friends . If the reader would please to think of a family in this way , where every individual member , with his peculiarities , is known to him , what would be his opinion of me if I were to affirm , for example , that every member of that family was drunken , or immoral , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had no right to attribute defects without a knowledge of the persons . And yet this is exactly the way in which the large families that form national communities are judged by the malevolence of foreigners . What happens usually in a family is that there are strong contrasts . I recall to memory an English family of eight . There was one drinker amongst them ; there was one very immoral man ; there were two imprudent men ; one son distinguished himself by exceptional industry , conduct , and ability . The same contrast was visible in the husbands of the daughters , who were as opposite as their brothers . Now , how is that family to be described by a single epithet ? Can we say that it was moral or immoral , foolish or wise ? To be just and accurate we are compelled to distinguish between individuals . We find , too , that the presence of a vice in one member of a family does not imply its prevalence amongst the other members . One brother is vicious and idle , the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the good-for-nothing brother would seem to have a deterrent effect . Instead of being a middling family , neither good nor bad , the family with a black sheep in it may be rather above the average . This is certainly the case in the great English family with regard to intemperance in drinking . The French gladly accuse the English of drunkenness , and we know that it is the national vice . But only the malevolence of a foreigner would seek to imply that all English people drank to excess . The observation of individual cases very soon leads us to the truth , which may be expressed in a short paragraph as follows - There is a great deal of drinking in England , but the excesses of some have produced , by way of protest and reaction , the complete abstinence of others and they have produced something more remarkable still than total abstinence , namely , an extreme habitual temperance without any rigid rule . Some Englishmen are drunkards , others are waterdrinkers , and between the two are to be found the most various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the English without taking account of these contrasts . The English are not a nation of drunkards , but a nation where drunkards are to be found . I was reading lately a French book of travels in England , quite of recent date . The author 's name is not worth mentioning , but he gives an account of a visit to a rich gentleman 's country house which deserves notice as a specimen of French malevolence . INow , there are certain signs by which an English critic knows at once whether narratives of this kind are genuine or fictitious . A Frenchman who invents anything about England , and pretends that he is recounting a real experience , is sure to invent clumsily . In the present instance , I know by two pieces of evidence that the writer has been drawing upon his imagination . He makes the men in the smoking-room , after dinner , talk about the absent ladies in a style absolutely incompatible with English breeding , and he describes these gentlemen as having all got nearly or completely drunk before they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read that such things happened under the Georges , and as lie is not describing a real experience he makes our contemporaries get drunk to gratify the malevolence of his French readers . Every one who has any acquaintance with modern England knows that in the most civilized classes the habit of excessive drinking has fallen into disuse . If the men remain together after the ladies have left the dinner-table , they consume very little wine . I knew some terrible drinkers in the English middle // 595 classes thirty or forty years ago , but the habits of those days belong to past history , though French ill-nature may affect to believe that they still survive . All the drinking Englishmen whom I have known are dead ; all the living Englishmen whom I still know are either temperate or abstemious . Here is an example that may represent a class . My friend drinks nothing but coffee or tea in the morning . At one o'clock he has lunch , and takes a rather large glass of claret , but no more . He drinks nothing between lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claret or sherry and two of port . This is the kind of Englishman who , according to a French witness , would be carried to bed drunk every night . Others , of course , may go beyond this moderate allowance : they may drink a glass of brandy and sodawater , they may appreciate bitter ale , they may take wine more freely at dinner ; but where is the harm if they remain sober , as they do , and keep their sanity and their health ? The French accusation against English ladies on the ground of drinking is even less justified by facts . I have known two or three ladies in England who were said to drink , and just as many in France . In great communities there will always be these victims of anxiety or ennui who have gone for a solace to the bottle . But , as a rule , English ladies confine their drinking to an allowance that can do them no imaginable harm . A glass of sherry drowned in a tumbler of water , or a glass of claret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even two if you will , can do no harm whatever to the nerves of a healthy Englishwoman . There is certainly not at English tables that free consumption of wine which is common everywhere in France , and in which both sexes have their share . With regard to the French accusation that English ladies drink brandy , all that needs to be said is that , as it is not done in public , the onus probandi rests with the accusers . Let them give names and addresses , and produce witnesses . With two or three exceptions , I have never known a valid reason for suspecting any English ladies of intemperance , and in all such cases we ought to hold the person entirely innocent until there is some sort of evidence against her . Why are we to go out of our way to believe that a woman drinks brandy in private , when we have no more reason for supposing it than for convincing ourselves that she smokes opium ? It is in the nature of these general accusations against whole classes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals there is no way of bringing the accuser to the test of producing evidence . If he said that my sisters got drunk ( supposing me to have sisters ) , an action might be brought , and he might be compelled to confess that he had no proofs ; but he may accuse the larger sisterhood of Englishwomen with impunity . " Vous savez , les Anglaises boivent de l'eau de vie . England is now , with reference to drinking , a country of very temperate , very intemperate , and completely abstemious people . If a man belongs to the refined classes , the probability is that he will take wine in moderation , perhaps in great moderation ; if he belongs to the humbler classes , he may be a besotted drunkard , a sober workman who appreciates a glass of beer , or an apostle of total abstinence with a blue ribbon in his button-hole . The country spends too much in drink , but its expenditure is gradually diminishing , and the burden of it falls very unequally upon the citizens . If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it shall not be by way of retaliation . The individual Frenchman has exactly the same right to be taken for what he really is as the individual Englishman . It will be said that this is a commonplace , // but it is very rarely recognized in practice . Drunkenness , though it has increased in France of late years , can not be called a national vice . You do not often see a really drunken man in France . The peasants get just tipsy on market-days , but they can usually drive home without accident , though the roads are crowded with their vehicles . A man of the middle or upper classes hardly ever betrays a sign of drinking . Nevertheless , the consumption of wines , spirits , and liqueurs is enormous and increasing , especially the consumption of spirits . How are we to reconcile the apparent sobriety with the vast expenditure in drink ? The answer is that France is the country of steady moderate drinking , that may become almost excessive without apparently losing its character of moderation . If there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love of wine is almost universal in France , as in most wine-producing countries . The usual allowance in the inns and restaurants is a bottle at each meal . The common people , when they have a drink together , prefer wine to everything else , 1 and order a bottle alternately till they have had enough . Now , with regard to the habit of drinking wine , a physician , who had practiced in a part of France where this habit was carried far , told me that he had never perceived any evil effects from it on the health of active men.2 His opinion was that winedrinking was perfectly innocuous , but he dreaded the effects of spirits , even in comparatively small quantities . He looked upon wine as a kind of safeguard , and on spirits as a terrible danger . The reader may remember a passage in Lewes 's Life of Goethe , where the biographer says that the illustrious German " was fond of wine , and drank daily his two or three bottles . The amount he drank never did more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for society . Over his wine he sat some hours . " Lewes appended to this passage a quotation from Liebig , in which he says that amongst the Rhinelanders " a jolly companion drinks his seven bottles every day , and with it grows as old as Methuselah , is seldom drunk , and has at most the Bardolph mark of a red nose . " The common daily allowance of a Frenchman who can afford to live coinfortably is two bottles of common wine , with an extra bottle of good wine when he meets a friend . There are , however , many exceptions to this rule . If there are the bottle men ( at each meal ) , there are also the half-bottle men , a division of the human race that is well understood in the Parisian restaurants , where they generally offer a whole bottle of common wine or half the quantity of " superior , " if you prefer it . Ladies , for the most part , seem to be of the hall-bottle persuasion . But besides this variety , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All physicians seem to be agreed that equal quantities of alcohol are not equal in their effects when taken pure or diluted . Pure whiskey , in the form of drains , is much worse than the same quantity of spirit in whiskey toddy . I never in my life saw a French peasant mix his wine with water ; there may be peasants who do it , but I have never met with one . The peasant will drink water abundantly by itself , but when he gets wine he seems to think that to water it would be a sin against the rites of Bacehus . When there is wine on a peasant 's table , the water-bottle is not to be seen . On the contrary , in the middle and upper classes it is the general custom to mix water with the yin ordinaire whilst people are eating , but the finer wines 1 Except in the cider country . least be one of the causes that predispose to 2 In the sedentary it may lead to gout , or at gout. // are never watered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the gentleman who puts three drops of water in his wine in deference to custom , though it is a mere form ; you have the gentleman who mixes the two liquids conscientiously in equal quantities ; and you have the drinker of eau rougie , who would probably be a water-drinker , like an English teetotaler , if he had not before his eyes the dread of the French proverb , " Les buveurs d'eau sont m6-chants . " I remember , however , one of those drinkers of " reddened water , " who used to maintain that a few drops of wine almost infinitely diluted gave the taste of the grape-juice far more delicately and exquisitely than the unalloyed grapejuice itself . The reader may try the experiment , if he likes . Let him take a glass of water , and just redden it with claret . If he fails to appreciate the exquisite taste of the beverage , it will , at least , inflict no injury upon his constitution . Unless , indeed , as the old bacchanalians affirmed , water brings on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Houx , the gentle singer who immortalized the Yau de Vire ?

Mon voisin qui est sage Ne lefaict , que je croy . Enough has been said about wine , except that some Frenchmen have the habit of drinking white Burgundy or Bordeaux early in the morning , and eating a crust of bread along with it . This habit is so pleasant that one might easily fall into it , but the nervous excitement produced by the white wine when taken into an empty stomach is found to be deleterious to the nervous system in the long run , and all prudent people avoid it . The working classes have a habit that is probably quite as bad . They take a dram of pure brandy every morning before starting work , often a large dram . If the brandy were fine old Cognac the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half poisonous . I have not seen this morning dram in use amongst the peasants . It is customary in the towns , and amongst the river and canal populati*x* . There is a general belief in England that all Frenchmen go to the cafe ' ; that a Frenchman can not be happy unless he has a cafd to frequent . Many go to the cafe every day , others occasionally , and others never enter the door of such an establishment . Amongst the daily visitors there is an immense difference in drinking habits . I remember a middleaged gentleman who confined himself to one tiny glass of pure Cognac per day , an allowance that he never exceeded . Another visits the cafe every day regularly at six in the afternoon , and takes his absinthe . A third drinks only ale . A fourth confines himself to coffee . In short , there is often some self-imposed restriction . There are also the unlimited drinkers , who take all kinds of liqueurs , one after another . They do not get drunk , but they damage their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends . A Parisian physician told nie ( what I had observed already ) that in France the commonest kind of excess is what is called " l'alcoolism , e des gens du monde . " This is not drunkenness , nor anything like it , but a steadily maintained , mild alcoholic excitement , which does great injury to health in course of time . The art of gentlemanly drinking has been reduced , in France , to a learned programme for every day , in which there is a scientifically ordered succession of wines , spirits , beer , and liqueurs , each at its most seasonable hour . The observer of these rites lives in a state of alcoholic pleasure without ever in any way disgracing himself . At night he has a verre d'eau in his bedroom , to // quench thirst if he awakes . What is called a " verre d'eau " is usually a very pretty glass tray , with a decanter for water , a little sugar basin , and a goblet . This description is , however , incomplete . **33;668;TOOLONG , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cafes occasionally make use of them merely as a convenience , either to meet somebody on business , or else to rest when in a strange town . In these cases there is no habit whatever . I was traveling with a French officer last year , who would go to a caf6 with a friend , but never alone . In a month 's travel he went to a caf 6 three times . The total abstainers from the caf6 are more numerous than would be easily believed . They have a set phrase by which they are known , their shibboleth . This phrase is , " Je ne bois jamais rien entre mes repas . " They are not teetotalers , as they drink at de'jeuner and dinner , but between these periods they observe a strict abstinence , like the Mahometans in the Ramadan fast , between the rising and the setting of the sun . They pretend that they are never thirsty , but I do not believe them ; it is merely the pride of their sect . Since we are talking about individual tastes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confesses to the weakness of thirst , but boasts that he quenches it effectually with a little warm water ! The French are not usually accused by other nations of being a drinking people , - indeed , I think their prowess in that respect is rather undervalued , - but they are often accused of being a nation of gourmands . Here , again , there are great individual differences . The basis of the accusation is the quantity of different dishes that are served in the hotels , but here lurks a misunderstanding . The variety of dishes at a table d'hôte is merely intended to give every guest a chance of selecting what he likes , and a man who limits himself to two dishes may choose them out of a dozen . The hotel-keeper is but a sort of shopman , who displays a variety of goods . In private houses the number of dishes is very limited , except on state occasions . The usual meal in ordinary private houses is scarcely more varied in that one repast than it would be in England , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than there is in an English week . The English have the advantage in the different character of their meals . The deijeuner and diner resemble each other too much . In the French middle classes , however , the dinner is often the lighter meal of the two , rather like an English lunch , and the heavy meal is in the middle of the day , according to the practice of our English forefathers . There are two broad varieties in French lovers of eating , the gourmets and the gourmands . The difference between them is so great that they may be considered as complete opposites . The gourmand is a mere glutton , who eats as much as he can , devouring one dish after another . He is simply an animal with a great appetite , feeding very much as a dog feeds , with the difference that he is far more omnivorous than the dog . The gourmand is the man who omits not one of the dishes at a table d'hôte , and then complains that lie can not dine properly in that hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the expense of others , and often growls over his meat , like the tigers in a menagerie . In a word , the animal nature of the gourmand is so predominant that in the matter of feeding he has not yet become a civilized being . The gourmet , on the contrary , is a product of high civilization . He enjoys with discrimination , and he is quite on the side of temperance ; he even values the commonest things , if they are excellent of their own kind . A French gourmet once said to me , " I am excessively fond of oysters , but I never exceed one dozen , being convinced that after the first dozen the palate // has become incapable of fully appreciating the flavor . " A real gourmet preserves his palate in the healthiest and most natural condition . He would not cover an oyster with pepper , nor even squeeze a lemon over it . Plain things are often preferred by a true gourmet to richer things . The uninitiated drink wine and eat cakes at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were unworthy of his attention ; with a wine of any quality he would eat a crust of bread . A gourmet prefers . the simplest meal , such as a fried mutton chop , if it is really well cooked , to an elaborate banquet where the cookery is less than excellent . In Thackeray 's imitation of Horace ( Persicos Odi ) , he expresses contempt for " Frenchifled fuss " in the first stanza , but in the second he exactly hits the taste of a French gourmet in praising the good qualities of a simple dish - " But a plain leg of mutton , my Lucy , I pr'ythee get ready at three : Have it smoking , and tender , and juicy , And what better meat can there be ? " I knew a Parisian who was a gourmet in Thackeray 's manner , and his way of living was to order one dish of meat , one of vegetables , and a little dessert , at an excellent and expensive restaurant * la carte . He did not desire the more abundant feeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He drank very moderately , also ; in a word , he lived as a gentleman ought to live , without excess , yet with perfect appreciation . The influence of the French gourmet on the prices of eatables is very remarkable . The dealers know that extravagant prices will be readily given for anything that is very good of its kind . The result is that the Parisian connoisseur in good living feeds very expensively . But in this , as in everything , individual They are probably sickened by the sight of so many dishes a day . I remember seeing a commercial traveler who complained that peculiarities tell . A wealthy Frenchman , who gave to the state a collection worth several millions of francs , used to dine , when by himself , in a little restaurant , for half a dollar . I have known another collector , who gave exquisite dinners to his friends , but lived in private with patriarchal simplicity . The accusation against the French that they are a nation of gourmands , who make gods of their bellies , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briefly as follows . France is the country where the preparation of food for luxury has become a fine art . It is also the country where the economical preparation of food for mere existence has been most studied and is best understood . It is a country where both the gourmet and the gourmand flourish , but in small proportion to the population . The great masses of the French people are peasants , soldiers , priests , members of religious houses , young people in educational establishments , and work-people . All these live simply . I used to suppose that the commercial travelers must be great eaters , but the hotel-keepers assure me that these men eat less , on the average , than their other guests.1 As for the richer classes , the smaller squires live quite as simply as the bourgeoisie . The very richest people are , I am told , as extravagant in their tables as in every other luxury . I have given more space to this question of eating and drinking than the subject may seem to deserve , but , besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international recrimination . The French constantly accuse the English of being drunkards and gluttons , whilst the English , on their side , at one time blame the French for being enormous eaters , and at another despise them for living on frogs , small birds , and other " kickshaws " unworthy of a everything was bad , and ordered two boiled eggs . This was but a natural desire to return to a simpler diet . // manly appetite . An English lady once told me that the French lived on air , and another complained that after the appetite had been satisfied by a heavy repast a roast fowl was invariably placed upon the table . ' I had occasion , in a preceding article , to make some reference to Mr. Matthew Arnold 's statement that wealth excites the most savage enmity in France , and I showed that the evidence of such enmity is not to be found in the behavior of the French people towards the rich . In the same paragraph ( Nineteenth Century , February , 1885 , page 225 ) Mr. Arnold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many evils which the French have to suffer from that worship of the great goddess Lubricity to which they are at present vowed . " In reference to an accusation of this kind , it is more than ever necessary to bear in mind that a nation is composed , not of a mingled mass , like the water in the Lake of Geneva or in the Dead Sea , of which you may truly say that it has this or that quality , all of it , but of separate creatures , belonging , indeed , to the same political body , yet differing from each other as much in their habits as they notoriously do in their opinions . If the object is merely to gratify international malevolence , any general accusation is good enough for that purpose . You may say that foreigners are given over to fieshiy lusts as easily as that they are liars and thieves , but if justice is your object you will consider individual cases . The method I would venture to recommend with regard to a foreign country is that which everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose a man to be innocent until I have often tried to determine , for my own satisfaction , which of the two nations is the more extravagant in food and drink . The difficulty is that the extravagance is of different kinds . The French are excessively economical in losing nothing , in making the most of everything , in providing a sufficient meal out of scant or poor materials , often out of small there is some evidence of his guilt . Wordsworth is supposed to have been moral because there is no evidence to prove the contrary . Byron is believed to have been immoral because we have evidence of his adulteries . Shelley is supposed to have lived according to a sort of morality of his own , leaving him liable to great errors . George Eliot believed herself to be strictly moral , yet she lived in an irregular liaison . George Sand was full of the most exalted sentiments , but in her case the liaisons were more numerous . In all these cases we have a chance of being just , because we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people individually . But if you put Wordsworth , Byron , and Shelley together as immoral men , you are positively unjust to Wordsworth , and relatively so to Shelley . If you class George Eliot and George Sand together as immoral women , you are unjust to George Eliot . The difficulty of justice increases with the extension of the group . Imagine a room where Byron , Wordsworth , and twenty of their contemporaries were present : you could not decide about them with any certainty unless you knew the twenty as you know the two . In the absence of evidence to the contrary , you would have charity enough to suppose that the twenty were more like Wordsworth than like Byron ; or rather , if perfectly wise , you would not trouble your head with useless conjectures about their morality or immorality at all . I know France more intimately than Mr. Arnold knows it , and when I hear him talk of the French being " vowed to the worship of the great goddess Lubricity " I wonder what evidence could be adduced against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of costly things . The English show less luxury , but their extravagance consists in waste caused by the display of abundance and by the desire to exhibit food in untouched masses . The combination of simplicity with costliness is carried to perfection in England . // a number of private persons whose names I could easily write down . This is the proper test . If it were not a breach of delicacy to mention private individuals in print , I would write down a hundred names , and ask for evidence against them . Miss Betham-Edwards has rather an extensive acquaintance with French people , she has many friends in France , and I asked her what she thought of Mr. Arnold 's accusation . It produced exactly the same effect on her mind that it had produced on mine ; she could only say that in her experience there had been no evidence to support it . I afterwards spoke of it to a French barrister , the mayor of an important place , and he said , " There is a good reason for supposing that cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of France , which is that they make such a noise and are so well remembered when they do occur ; they are remembered for forty years . " This is literally true . There was a case of adultery forty years ago , which is still talked about , and which has done permanent social injury to the innocent members of the family in which it occurred . I may add that French public opinion respects good conduct , and blames its opposite ; for example , the ladies of the House of Orleans have always been warmly respected in France by people of all opinions , whilst those of another dynasty have been little respected , it being generally believed that they were either light in their manners , or worse . The great evidence on which the accusation of general French immorality is founded is that afforded by the playwrights and the novelists . Such evidence ought to be taken exactly for what it is worth , and no more . Works of fiction are not made to paint the world as it is , but only to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incidents sell best . Morality is meritorious , but dull . Our own historians pass wearily over the moral monotony of George III . and Queen Charlotte ; they prefer to describe the court of Charles II . The French novelist does not write for France alone , but for all Europe , England included . His fictions sell by thousands in England , both in the original and in translations ; and a new play by Dumas or Sardou is announced in long telegrams in the great English newspapers , as if it were a political event . No English writer ever gets such effective advertisements . The most extreme " naturalism " is loudly condemned , but it is largely bought ; and the author has no objectioii to have stones cast at him , when he finds they are nuggets of gold . Besides , all these describers of immoral situations profess to be great moralists in their way . They expose vice by showing how it disturbs the peace of families ; they encourage to virtue by occasional , though transient , glimpses of its blessedness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monotonous like to read about anything that gives new sensations ; and as vice is at least different from virtue , and in itself more changeful , it seems to supply the want . In France , this is done by cleverly narrated fiction turning upon adultery ; in England , those who do not read French novels get the same material in the long reports of the divorce cases . The French method excels in art , but the English is far superior in that incomparable force , reality . The fictitious adulteress is but a phantom in comparison with the living beauty who is seen and heard in the court of justice ; and what fall of an imaginary hero ever impressed us like that of the gifted and ambitious politician who barred his own path to the premiership of England ? The reports of divorce cases are valuable , too , for the glimpses of high life that they afford to the middle and lower classes . One lady witness , much accustomed to the world , said that the only difference between a certain immoral // duke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of His Grace . In a novel this would have signified very little , but when it comes from a competent witness in real life its significance can hardly be overrated . iNor ought we to overlook the educational value of divorce reports for the young of both sexes . The French novel is kept as much as possible out of their way , - I mean in France , - and at least in the case of the jeune flue the precaution is usually successful , because she herself observes a rule of abstinence . But the English newspaper is not classed as immoral reading : it is on the drawing-room table , it lies on the sofa , it is everywhere ; consequently , if the young people are not theoretically well acquainted with sexual matters , it is entirely their own fault . It does not follow , in either country , that because people like to read about adultery they are ready to commit it . Old ladies are sometimes fond of reading about murders ; their faculties are dulled , and the murder in the shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But they would not even like to witness the shedding of blood . We have all read Hamlet , and it is considered perfectly moral , because it is a classical English play ; however , there are both murder and adultery in it , and the adultery is very crudely described . Well , the readers of Hamlet are not more inclined to imitate the adultery than the murder . A celebrated Englishwoman became successively the mistress of several men of very high rank on the Continent , and at the close of her career she wrote her memoirs . In form , the narrative was not more indecent than an account of successive marriages , and it found many readers in both sexes , who were impelled by mere curiosity . They wanted to know what the aspect of life might be to a woman who had such varied and exceptional opportuni ties for observation . Unfortunately for these readers , she had not made good use of her opportunities , and the book was stupid . Much of the blame on the score of morality that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a few comic newspapers that the Englishman compares to Punch . The French papers of this class are usually as inferior to Punch in wit as they are in morality , but I may observe that Mr. Punch occupies a much higher position in the state , and also a very different position in society , and therefore has certain responsibilities from which his French contemporaries are exempt . I have never yet met with one of the coarse and shallow French comic papers in a private house . I have only met with them in caf*s or hotels , where they are glanced at for a moment by the men . There is one of those little publications ( I forget its name ) which regularly illustrates vice in so dull a fashion that the effect of it must be almost moral . The Grelot is a very coarse sheet , with large colored caricatures , perfectly merciless , and in the style that pleased our grandfathers . But there are clever and amusing sketchers in France . Mars , for example , is refined and charming as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustrators in Randon and Lepic . As for the wit of Chain , it was inexhaustible , but more in the invention of sentences than in the art of the designer . Paul Renouard , the intentionally indiscreet revealer of all commonplace ugliness , is now as much appreciated in England as in France . Here , as everywhere else , there is a great difference between one man and another , a truth that I once ventured to insist upon to an old lady who was always calling one person by another person 's name , and considered the error of no consequence .
