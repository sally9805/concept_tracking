txt The Legislature at its last session author-. ized the repaving of Fifth-avenue at an expense of $225,000 . That thoroughfare has long needed repaving , but every previous measure providing for the work covered , but scarcely concealed , a corrupt job . The one which some weeks ago received the Executive approval was free from that objection , and this fact perhaps accounts for the delay in beginning the work , of which there is as yet no sign .

In order to be well laid this pavement must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks ' use before the first frost appears . In the taking up of the old pavement and the digging up of the saturated soil beneath there will be exhalations in the air which are far from wholesome .

The work of tearing up and putting down will also be a serious interruption to travel if it is not managed with a careful regard for public convenience . It strikes us that by proper preparation and skillful management Fifth . avenue may be taken block by block and have its pavement renewed in an expeditious , thorough , and workman-like manner in the next three months , with the least possible interference with the public health , comfort , and convenience . Here is a chance for Commissioner Tuompsores department to show what it can do .
