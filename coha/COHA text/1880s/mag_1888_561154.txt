IT will be thought doubtless by the majority that an article on those features of Wall street which are not directly connected with so-called stock-gambling should resemble the famous chapter on the snakes in Ireland . It must be confessed that the place has not a widespread reputation for conservatism . But it is doubtless true that no locality in the world , of equal notoriety , is subject to such general misrepresentation as the three or four blocks shadowed by the spire of old Trinity , and collectively designated as " Wall street . " Press and Pulpit make common cause against it . The severest comparisons , the most bitter denunciations are used to portray its dangerous and disreputable character . Young men and old , rich and poor , wise and simple , are alike warned to shun the fatal seductions of the place . It is possible to see there , almost any day , worthy men and women , who are making evidently their first visit to New York , and who move about with a half expectant and half frightened air , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sudden appearance in the flesh of the veritable bulls and bears of which they have heard so often . There are others whose distrustful and almost defiant manner indicates plainly that they are constantly on their guard and ready to resist any insidious attempt to draw them into the toils of speculation . Sometimes , too , preachers and teachers frequent the place , always , of course , with the desire and intent to gain knowledge of its ways and to gain nothing else . Occasionally , however , in order to make their experience as practical as possible , and that they may speak understandingly of the subject , they venture to speculate a little or " take a flyer , " as the phrase goes . Having no acquaintance with the business , their fate is that of most novices , and then they solace themselves for their losses by bitter attacks on Wall // street and eloquent denunciations of the evils of gambling in stocks . One well known preacher confesses that he visits dance houses and other places of evil repute simply for the purpose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he condemns such places with , if anything , less severe and uncharitable language than he uses in speaking of Wall street , I have thought it likely that his experience in the latter place has been rather more extensive and vivid than a purely theoretical knowledge would demand . Judges , too , occasionally say hard things about the Street-but there is reason to think that they also are not always moved by that impartial sense of justice which we are wont to associate with the bench . It is reported that one of the most prominent and witty lawyers at the New York bar once said that it was useless to argue a case before a certain court when the stock market was going down , and he has not yet been arrested for contempt of court . The editor who fails to have a fling at Wall street as often as two or three times a week , especially if he live in the South or West , must be unusually well supplied with prize fights and divorce cases . And what demagogue addressing his constituents omits in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monopolist and the hotbed of injustice ? All classes , in fact , seem to consider the place as fair game . And , without doubt , their action is , to a certain extent , justified . It can not be denied that there is speculation in Wall street , nor that it sometimes runs rampant . But it is equally true that the speculative fever seldom originates there . By themselves , the frequenters of that place can do but little to arouse public attention . Their operations , no matter how bold or desperate they may be , seldom create a ripple in the outside world . Panics and corners may succeed each other in quick succession , and the winners of to-day become the losers of to-morrow , but only those who read carefully the financial columns of the daily papers know whether the bulls or the bears are uppermost . It is only when the public is strongly impressed with a feeling of hope or despondency that Wall street assumes a prominent position . When the crops promise to be good , when the reports of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority of men take a cheerful view of the future , then Wall street shares and makes manifest this buoyant feeling . But let disaster appear in any form ,  --  even // though the cloud be no larger than a man 's hand ,  --  and the market then instantly reflects the change . In such popular movements the regular or professional dealers of the street are as powerless as puppets . When the panic of 1873 closed the Stock Exchange and brought to a standstill the business of every banker and broker connected with it , many said : " Oh , it 's nothing but a Wall street panic , " and went on their way accordingly . But within a few months business generally slackened , the real estate market became dull , speculation everywhere died out , depression took the place of confidence , and then it became apparent that Wall street had only shown first the signs of a great commercial wave . And , as usual , there were good and conservative reasons for it . Speculation had been running riot throughout the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extended and profits existed , in many cases , only on paper . The year before , in 1872 , our imports exceeded our exports by nearly *l 60,000,000 , and the inevitable pay-day could not be any longer postponed . But after the dull times of the five years succeeding the panic of 1873 ; after men had charged off their bad debts , marked down their inventories , reformed their business methods and reduced their living expenses , matters began to mend again . And as the first signs of trouble had been seen in Wall street , so there appeared the dawn of a new era of prosperity . In 1878 and 1879 bankers plucked up courage to negotiate loans for new enterprises . Money began to flow into the Street , and with it came customers who made brokers happy . In 1880 speculation was rampant again , and the whole country was buying stocks . Our exports were large , gold was flowing to us in a stream never before equaled , and our prosperity appeared to be boundless . Money brought a lower rate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise in the prices of stocks and bonds seemed to have no limit . But at such ' periods some event invariably occurs to bring people to their senses . As , in 1857 , it was the failure of the Ohio Life and Trust Company , and in 1873 , the failure of Jay Cooke &amp; Co. , so , in 1881 , the shooting of Garfield marked the culmination of the speculative fever . And in those long weeks when the nation awaited in breathless suspense the result of the assassin 's shot , the fluctuations of the stock market recorded the alternation of hope and despondency in the hearts of // the people . Then , too , men said when prices began to fall : " It 's nothing but a Wall street move , " and for a while those who predicted lower prices , and operated on their convictions , were actually condemned as wanting in loyalty to the wounded President . But the note of warning had sounded , and nothing could stop the liquidation of speculative ventures . Stocks fell without exception , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had sold at or about par , or $100 a share , fell to less than $10 . And in one instance-that of the Denver &amp; iRio Grande Railroad  --  the decline was over $107 per share ; or , in other words , the value of one hundred shares of stock fell from $11,200 in 1880 to $400 in 1884 . This depreciation was but the forerunner of depression elsewhere . Iron furnaces went out of blast , manufactories were closed and business generally became stagnant . Then followed two or three years of dullness in commercial circles throughout the country , succeeded by a general improvement , which was felt all over the land . And , in this case , again , the change began in Wall street . The settlement of the troubles between the trunk lines , and the amalgamation of the New York Central and West Shore railroads , in 1885 , was the first event which marked returning confidence . As before , the multitude were skeptical , and regarded it as having no significance outside of Wall street . But , gradually , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great railroads begat confidence in other roads . Men not only bought stocks which had been hitherto neglected , but began to reorganize bankrupt properties and to build new roads . This created a demand for steel rails , and their price advanced in a few months from $26 per ton to $40 . All over the land new iron mines were opened and new iron furnaces started , until the iron business of the country attained a prosperity hitherto unequaled . Now , in these great popular movements one truth becomes very evident to those who watch them carefully , and that is the inability of any one man or set of men to withstand them . The Vanderbilts and Goulds are as powerless as the smallest traders . Old Commodore Vanderbilt did try in 1869 to prevent the price of his favorite , New York Central , from falling below a certain figure ; but his brokers were literally swept away by the rush to sell . Jay Gould has lost millions in efforts to stem the popular current , and his present enormous fortune is due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . // The multitude lose money in Wall street because they fail to follow this course intelligently . The average trader simply bets that prices will fall to-day because they rose yesterday . Aud if they continue to rise for several days he doubles and trebles his bets , on the principle of the gambler at cards . As a consequence a steady popular movement swamps him . Such men are neither more nor less than gamblers . They are the men who continually talk stocks on the streets and in the cars , who boast over their petty gains and howl over their losses . The laws of trade and political economy are to them meaningless words . They are the froth , the scum , on the surface of the stream , and , to carry out the simile , their numbers are a sure indication of the depth and strength of the current beneath . Nothing connected with them is more remarkable than their sudden disappearance . Like the flies , they are here to-day and gone to-morrow . They learn their lesson and go their ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , however , soon supplied ; for Wall street , like the brook , can sing : " Men may come and men may go , But I go on forever . " It is a remarkable fact that Wall street is a most successful teacher of humility . Its lessons are hard , sometimes merciless , but they are effective . And sometimes , too , they are pathetic . During four years of active service in the late war I saw hosts of brave men and many deeds of even reckless daring . But I have met on the floor of the Stock Exchange men of as dauntless courage and steady nerve as could be found in any army . I have watched them fight a losing battle day after day , when their wealth was gradually wasting , and when every turn of fortune 's wheel made their positions worse . But they fought gamely to the end , with a cool bravery worthy of success . Sometimes , however , the overstrung nerves fail suddenly , and a pistol shot ends a career which usually deserves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is a proverb in Wall street that plenty of pluck and a good bank account will ruin any man . Nowhere can be found more striking exemplifications of the truth of the old saw " that he who fights and runs away , may live to fight another day . " Occasionally a bold and dashing genius scores a lasting success , but the percentage of such cases is almost infinitesimal . The men who control affairs , who conduct great negotiations and // who amass large fortunes are , as a rule , conversative to the verge of timidity . Watchful of the signs of the times , and quick to take advantage of them , they never follow popular movements to their end . Those who achieve the greatest success recognize the truth that the strongest combination in business affairs is a union of speculative and conservative elements . It is difficult to determine at times the line of demarcation between them . I suppose that whenever any one buys , with a view to subsequent sale , anything for which at the time of purchase he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a speculative one . This is as true of the small grocery man who buys fifty barrels of flour or potatoes more than his usual quantity , because he thinks circumstances indicate an advance in price , as it is of the trader in the Produce Exchange who buys 50,000 barrels for the same reason . If the commodities are actually bought and paid for in both cases , it is difficult to see why both are not equally legitimate . The test seems to be not so much in the kind of transaction as in the degree . There can be no objection to the speculative feature so long as it does not overpower and run away with the conservative . No merchant nor manufacturer can make a fortune simply by supplying an existing demand . The successful men of business invariably look ahead , and their reward comes in proportion to the correctness of their judgment of the future . Nearly every man has views more or less decided as to the course of events , and as few have all they wish of this world 's goods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income . As soon as receipts exceed expenditures the speculative element asserts itself . Very few are content to invest their surplus with an exclusive regard for income and return of principal . Nearly all , even of the most conservative , strive to secure both an assured income and a prospect for increase in the value of the principal . But there is another class , numbering far more than is generally supposed , who consider themselves , and who really are conservative , but who , nevertheless , are influenced by speculative impulses . They are the men , and the women , too , ( and I am bound to say that , proportionately , the women outnumber the men ) , who are content to go without present income from an investment , provided it promises large rewards in the future . I call them conservative because the gambling element of chance does not control // their operations . They act only after a study , more or less careful and intelligent , of the facts in the case , and invest their money with patient confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and stocks which do not pay dividends . They would be shocked , probably , to be told that they are the mainstay of Wall street . But it is true , neverthless . Nearly every one of our great railroads has been fostered by and reached prosperity through their support . The process is a familiar one , and has been repeated scores of times . A road is built , and the stock is pitched into the speculative arena , where it becomes a financial football . It is almost never successful at the outset . It gets involved in debt , becomes bankrupt , and the men who have started it simply as a speculation lose money . There are not only no dividends , but there are often assessments . Meanwhile , the country grows and business increases along the line . Gradually the stock is absorbed by this conservatively speculative class of investors . As the supply diminishes in the open market and the prospects of the road improve , it becomes easy for the professional speculators to manipulate the price to suit themselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or could only sell to each other , their careers would be brief . But this small yet steady investment demand becomes after a while an important factor in their calculations , and they make the most of it . Where the cantious outsider buys ten or twenty shares , the daring professional trader will buy as many thousand , and this is the reason why so many of them are ruined in stocks which prove profitable to the genuine investor . The speculator assumes too heavy loads and has to throw them overboard at a loss on the appearance of - a financial storm , while the man who has bought no more than he can pay for waits patiently for the clouds to roll by . There are illustrations of this process at our doors . Thirty years ago the stock of the New York &amp; New Haven Railroad was one of the speculative favorites of Wall street . It was even ultrafashionable , for the treasurer indulged in a fraudulent over-issue of stock . The road did not pay dividends , and the price ranged from fifty to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the market until not enough remained there to satisfy the demands of the traders , and now , with the price above two hundred dollars per share , transactions in it are few and in small amounts . // The New York Central is another instance . From 1867 to only a few months ago , notwithstanding the fact that it paid dividends , it was a leading speculative stock . The dealings in it were at times enormous , and the fluctuations in price frequent and of great range . But since the settlement of the trunk line troubles public confidence in it is so great that it seems to have taken its place permanently among the investment stocks . This is true , also , of the leading roads as we go further West . The Lake Shore , the Rock Island , the Chicago &amp; Alton , the Chicago , Burlington &amp; Quincy , the Chicago &amp; Northwestern , and scores of other roads have all gone through the same experience . In other words , the speculators of Wall street and the outside conservative element which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snpport these great corporations in the periods of their infancy and weakness . Under this protection they , in turn , have helped to develop the country , and are paying large return to those investors whose foresight enabled them to read the future aright . The history of the world shows no series of business enterprises so brilliant , so prosperous , and , on the whole , so beneficial , as the railroad system of this country , and nearly every important road in the system has been launched in Wall street . Granting the evils of speculation , and granting the gross mismanagement which has existed in some notorious instances , nevertheless , it can not be denied that there are redeeming features connected with an agency which has produced such splendid and beneficent results . I have made no special mention this far of that feature of Wall street through which its influence makes itself felt most potently , and which , in public estimation , often stands for the place itself ; I mean the New York Stock Exchange . The eleven hundred men who compose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do business in the Street . While the majority of them are possessed of comfortable fortunes , and while the list of membership includes a few men who are enormously rich , it must not be supposed that the influence of the Exchange is due to the wealth of its members or to the operations which originate with them . If , as I have said , Wall street is the heart of the financial interests of the country , the Stock Exchange is the heart of Wall street . It is the innermost centre to which all eyes are turned , and which , by common consent , reflects the condition of the financial world . // The fluctuations of feeling in monetary circles are recorded as quickly in the Stock Exchange as the changes in the atmosphere are noted by the barometer . A generation ago this was not the case . Then the Exchange was a place where a few men met for an hour or two every day , dealt in a moderate amount of stock and bonds , sat in comfortable chairs around a table or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jokes at each other 's expense and knocking off each other 's hats as in attending to business . Even in Wall street their influence was comparatively small , and outsidq of it they were unknown in the financial world . The war changed all this . The fever of speculation aroused by it manifested itself nowhere so much as in the Stock Exchange . The brokers were driven out of their chairs , and instead of a single call of stocks were forced to have continuous dealings during nearly the whole day . As the old board was too conservative to keep up with the times a new one was formed . In 1879 , after the older organization had tried in vain for several years to ignore and suppress its younger rival , the two boards were united . From that time to the present the influence of the Exchange has grown steadily and marvelously . In London , only a small number of prominent bankers are represented at the Stock Exchange , but with only two or three exceptions , all of the leading banking and foreign exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through one or more partners . Within the past year the sons of the senior members of two of the firms which have governed the rate of foreign exchange for the last quarter of a century have paid twenty thousand dollars each for memberships in the Stock Exchange . Twenty years ago these firms would have thought such a connection decidedly infra dig . The conservative character of this change is shown by the fact that these houses deal chiefly in bonds . Ten years ago the transactions in bonds were comparatively small , but now millions sometimes change hands in a single day . The total par value of the various issues thus far admitted to the Exchange exceeds eighteen hundred millions of dollars , while the amount of stocks on the list is over two billions three hundred millions of dollars . No security can he placed on its list until it has been first examined by a special committee , whose business it is to see that the company is legally organized , and its stock and // bonds properly engraved and duly registered in a reputable trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any responsibility as to the value of securities , they exercise great care to prevent swindling by illegal companies and forged or improperly issued certificates . Having done this , they feel justified in falling back on the old precept , " caveat ernjptor . " Their object is simply to create a market where buyers and sellers may deal under the protection of reasonable rules . That they have succeeded fairly in this effort is shown by the result . Boston , Chicago , and Philadelphia are as near Wall street for the purposes of business as though they were but a block away . One hundred and ten private telegraph wires run from offices connected with the Exchange to various parts of the country . Orders for the purchase and sale of stock have been sent from Chicago , executed in the Exchange and the transaction reported back to Chicago within a minute . The average time occupied in sending messages by cable to London is not much over six minutes . Many firms make a specialty of trading between the Stock Exchanges of New York and London , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist in the two markets in the same security . In order that this may be done with safety and profit great celerity is required on the part of the cable company , and messages have been sent to London and the answer received in New York within three minutes . During one day in December , 1886 , the Western Union Company alone delivered through its office in the Stock Exchange building six thousand eight hundred and sixty-nine messages . If to these are added those sent by other companies and those delivered to the various offices of the bankers and brokers , the number will exceed ten thousand . On this day the number of shares dealt in at the Stock Exchange exceeded one million , the par value of which would be one hundred millions of dollars . The impression prevails quite generally that these figures are deceptive , and that they represent only such an amount of bets on values . But nothing could be further from the truth . Every transaction reported in the Exchange presupposes the actual delivery of and payment for the property dealt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be infinitesimal . The securities have as tangible value as bank stock or merchandise . And when it is reported that fifty or one hundred millions of stocks have changed hands at the Exchange in a day it may be known that the transfcr // of property in settlement of these transactions will be as real and genuine as if they were based on dry goods or hardware . The certificates of stock are delivered to the purchasers and are paid for by checks which are certified by the banks and on which greenbacks or coin may be drawn . When it is remembered that dealings seldom amount to less than $10,000,000 in a day , that the daily average through the year is over $20,000,000 , and that it has exceeded $100,000,000 in one day , some idea may be formed of the extent of the public interest in Wall street . But perhaps a better basis for a correct estimate is the number of stockholders in the various great corporations represented on the Exchange . In the New York Central , Union Pacific , Western Union , Northern Pacific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number in each runs from 6,000 to 8,000 . One trust company reports that it has some 23,000 stockholders registered on its books , and others have still more . A majority of these hold small amounts , frequently as low as five and ten shares . Many of them are women and professional men , who invest their savings slowly , and who can not be justly considered otherwise than conservative . They are , however , classed by their less thrifty neighbors with the monopolists and bloated bondholders . And it would be well sometimes for our virtuous law-makers to remember that their outbursts of wrath against corporations affect the genuine and comparatively poor investor far more unfavorably than the professional speculator . The latter , alert and well informed , sees the impending storm and protects himself , while the former , too much occupied with other affairs or too inexperienced to detect the signs of danger , makes no move , and sees his or her property shrink rapidly in value . It is estimated that from one hundred to one hundred and fifty millions of securities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of this amount probably nine-tenths are negotiated in Wall street . No one from the West or South thinks of doing anything in the way of railroad building without first going there . The above figures may seem large , but to them must be added city and county bonds and the stocks of mining , manufacturing and other companies until the amount is swelled to many hundred of millions . Now what can the speculators , brokers and bankers of Wall street do with such a burden ? Left to themselves they would be crushed by it . But the countless // thousands whom they represent carry it off according to their various means . The great moneyed institutions and individuals of large wealth absorb $100,000 at a time . Lawyers , doctors , merchants and other small investors take lesser amounts , and after a while the immense mass of securities is dispersed , while the money received is sent all over the country to pay laborers and manufacturers , and , finding its way into general circulation again , gives a new impetus to the material prosperity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are so ready to denounce Wall street that in the stirring events of the past twentyfive years it has been found invariably on the side of the government , ready to throw its influence in favor of law and order , and that it has always taken a conservative position on financial issues . At the breaking out of the rebellion the government had to consider no more serious question than that of money . Men were abundant and so was patriotism , but soldiers had to be paid and munitions of war to be bought . There was no such national currency as we have now , and the government 's store of gold was soon exhausted . After the battle of Bull Run had shown that the war was to be a serious affair , Mr. Chase , the Secretary of the Treasury , came to New York and met , in one of the banks of Wall street , officers of the principal banks of New York , Boston and Philadelphia . I do not , of course , intend to claim for Wall street the exclusive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this time , but it can not be denied that the Government looked chiefly to it for support , and that it took the lead in the movement . The report of the Loan Committee of the Associated Banks of New York , issued in the Spring of 1862 , said : " The credit of the Government had become impaired to such a degree that a large loan could not be obtained in any ordinary way . Men 's hearts failed them ; the rebellion was on so large a scale and had so unexpectedly broken out and raged with such fury that to subdue it seemed to most persons to be impossible . Then it was after careful deliberation and consultation with the Secretary , that the banks decided it to be wise for them to depart from their usual legitimate business and sustain the Government credit and stand or fall with it . This act restored the public confidence and was the highest indorsement of the public credit that could // then have been given . " Acting on this determination the banks loaned the Government fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more in October , and still another fifty million dollars in November , or one hundred and fifty million dollars of gold in four months . The strain was too heavy for them and the next month specie payments were suspended . Then followed the various paper issues of the Government ,  --  legal tender and demand notes , postal currency , seven thirties , ten forties , and other bonds , all by the million . The expenses of the Government were never less than thirty millions of dollars a month , and sometimes they amounted to ninety millions . The public debt in August , 1865 , was about two billion nine hundred million dollars , and of the bonds representing this amount nearly all had been negotiated in Wall street , or through the instrumentality of its representatives . The importance of such an agency can not be over-estimated . It was second only to the army , and without it the army could not have existed . Of course speculation ran wild there , and it is not strange that among the traders there should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew nothing of patriotism . But it is a fact , nevertheless , that the best and most prominent men in the Street supported the Government not only with their wealth , but with loyal hearts and earnest counsel . The force of their example was far-reaching . In their efforts to sell the government bonds they appealed to the patriotism of Union-loving citizens all over the country . The business connections established in this manner have not been severed . They were indeed the basis of that broad and close relationship to the whole nation which has proved to be Wall street 's greatest strength . Its supremacy as the financial centre of the country dates from this period . Previous to the war Boston was the great clearing house for the banks of New England , which were comparatively independent of New York ; but , since the war , Boston , Philadelphia and Chicago are as dependent on Wall street in financial matters as the smaller cities , and are as closely connected with it as the cities of Great Britain are with London . Wall street supported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first of January , 1879 . The banks of New York , with those of Wall street in the van , strengthened // the hands of the Government by agreeing to receive United States notes , not only for ordinary balances , but in payment of the inter . est on the public debt and of all the coin obligations of the Government . Backed by this powerful ally the national treasury was safe in proclaiming its willingness and ability to pay all demands in specie . For the first time in seventeen years the public creditors could take , according to their desire , either coin or paper for their debts , and with the perversity which characterizes so large a portion of mankind , when they found that they could get coin , the majority preferred paper . I hope it will not be thought that I appear as a defender of Wall street . It is one of the advantages of living in New York that one is not obliged to take up the cudgels continually in its behalf . The inhabitants of smaller towns appear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But New York is sufficiently metropolitan , not to say cosmopolitan , to take care of itself . And every year makes this more true . The great cities of the interior may become greater ; Chicago and St. Louis may , metaphorically speaking , tear their hair in envious rage at each other 's progress ; but New York regards their growth and struggles with calm complacency , conscious that the increased prosperity of either or both must add to its own wealth and importance . As soon as a man makes three or four millions of dollars anywhere in the country , he feels impelled to go to New York and live there for at least a part of the year . And the most cosmopolitan part of New York is Wall street . It feels the increase of every kind of business . The rich merchants of Chicago may import their goods direct from England and the continent , and so ignore the New York jobber ; but they must look to Wall street for a market for their foreign exchange . The planters who ship their cotton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ port ; the Colorado and Montana miners , who send their bullion to the smelters in the various parts of the country , and sometimes even to Europe ; the great millers of the Northwest , who make and export thousands of barrels of flour a day ; the Western commission merchants , who ship a hundred millions of bushels of wheat yearly ,  --  all these look to Wall street as a clearing-house for the financial part of their transactions . Every year adds to its strength and importance . It should not be considered a mark of Yankee boastfulness to // predict that the next century will see New York assume the place now held by London as the financial centre of the world . All the indications point that way . The growth of our manufactures and the production of the piecious metals tend constantly to turn the balance of trade in our favor . No one who is not in a position where the fact is forced on his attention can realize the change which has taken place in this respect in the last fifteen years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money markets , the time of our complete dependence has passed . At present American securities are the most attractive investments for European capitalists . Our bankers no longer offer them at prices which yield the buyer excessive rates of interest , but demand and receive terms which are equal to those commanded by the choicest foreign securities . Our Government bonds , which twenty years ago paid the foreign purchaser , the discount included , a higher rate of interest than would be promised in these days by any Western wild-cat stock , now rank equal to the Consols . of Great Britain . Wall street is the delight of the free trader . I do not mean to imply by this that the majority of its frequenters know or care much about the principles of free trade as they are taught by learned professors , but that the laws which govern trade naturally , the principle of demand and supply , for instance , work with a certainty and regularity which must carry joy to the opponents of protection . Knights of Labor and capitalists are alike powerless to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and legitimate fluctuations of prices . If a Vanderbilt can not maintain the nominal value of a stock above its normal figure , it is equally true that Powderlys and Arthurs , with ignorant rabbles behind them , are impotent to block the wheels of commerce except temporarily , and thus influence unfavorably the prices of securities . The great mass of citizens hold the even tenor of their way , and their movements are reflected in Wall street with never failing accuracy . If a formidable strike occur , or riots or other disturbances , watch the stock market , and after the first shock is over it will record their course as quickly and correctly as a steam gauge notes the varying pressure in the boiler . During the war , Congress tried to stop speculation in gold by the enactment of a prohibitory law , but the only effect was to increase the speculation a thousand fold , and the law was quickly repealed . // A man can find protection in Wall street only in an active brain and a conservative temperament . It is no place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a paternal Government . I hope , furthermore , that I shall not be suspected of a desire to describe Wall street in such attractive terms as to tempt men to try their fortunes there , either as lambs or shearers . I might as properly advise a clever boxer to challenge Sullivan or Dempsey , , or any of the other shining lights of the prize ring . No one should venture there until he is quite sure that he is fitted for the work . To speak more particularly of the Stock Exchange : I know of no more severe test of virile qualities than it presents . A successful man there must be strong and active in mind and body , possessed of steady nerves , and ready to stand by his word , cost what it may . He must watch the telegraph instruments which bring news from various parts of the world , and be prepared to act promptly either for himself or his principals on the report of any important occurrence . The tempers of the various leaders in European politics , the condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ River , or the appearance of the potato-bug in Kansas ; all these may be reported in quick succession , and demand not only correct judgment but decisive action . II is like watching the pulse beats of the whole earth . The strain both on the nerves and the mind is at times terrific . Opinions formed in the morning must be changed at noon , and the evening 's news furnishes no safe basis for the next day 's operations . The actual physical wear and tear is exhaustive . The mere contact with constantly moving crowds of excited men , the incessant rushing to and fro consumes the bodily strength , and so indirectly saps the mental and moral power . Nevertheless , the arduous and perilous nature of the work will not deter confident and courageous men from undertaking it . In fact , it is in itself an inducement to many . And keenly alive as I am to the difficulties and dangers which beset any and every man who is engaged in Wall street life , I am not surprised that it attracts men with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well educated . They will find the field wide enough for their loftiest ambition and their most energetic efforts . They will value especially their education . The day has passed when bad spelling could be considered as indicative of a plethoric bank account . When Wall street represented but a small area , men // who were ignorant and narrow , but shrewd and determined , could take leading positions . But every day makes it more necessary that its leaders should be men of breadth and intelligence . Its constant and rapid growth in the future and the widening of its influence may be regarded as beyond dispute . Standing as it does to-day as the representative of the financial interests , both speculative and conservative , of sixty millions of people in this country , and intimately connected with the leading nations of the world , it is probable that the majority of those now living will see it conducting the operations of a hundred millions of American citizens and exercising a paramount influence in commercial transactions everywhere . It will be well for it if its course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And while , on the one hand , it will be benefited by their co-operation , it will , on the other , present to them a fitting field for labor , where their best powers will find the widest scope . I confess to being an optimist so far as the material prosperity of this country is concerned . While our commensurate improvement in moral and intellectual strength may not be altogether assured , it seems to me impossible to form an exaggerated eatimate of the increase of our wealth . Hitherto in the history of the world the great development of wealth has been accompanied by evils which have tended to make it a curse . But if the human race is really improving , this should eventually cease to be true . The most powerful factors in the improvement will be men of intelligence and education . We should develop higher types of men , those who have the power to combine theoretical knowledge arid the practical application of it . The tendency of large opcrations is toward concentration , owing to the inability of individna. s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the form of corporations , and corporations naturally find their homes in financial centres . The labor struggle of the day is merely the effort of working men to hold their own by organization , against the combination of capitalists under the protection of corporations . All thinkers regard it as one of the vital issues of the time and one which education on both sides will be most potent to settle . In no place in this country can the educated man put himself in more direct communication with the labor element than in Wall street , the home of corporations , and in no place will a just intelligence exercise a more widespread influence for good . The // conservative element , already so powerful and so efficacious in the development of the country , will be strengthened by the accession of such men and will contribute more than ever to the increase of the national prosperity . With its growth will come a comparative diminution of that speculative fever , which , although it has played a not altogether useless part in the 2ommercial history of the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will never disappear entirely , nor would it be well that it should , for it must always represent the emotional factor of the business community . It stands as the exponent of the popular confidence in the future of the country , and , when kept within bounds and serving only as a spur to conservative action , it will tend to produce a most beneficial combination . Then , and probably not until then , will Wall street cease to be the object of general criticism and censure . Meanwhile eulogies and denunciations are alike powerless to affect it . What the country is , that it will be . It will grow with its growth and strengthen with its strength . To intelligent observers , looking beneath the surface , the powerful underlying current will be visible , and they will recognize the fact that the place exercises an economic force which in extent and usefulness is excelled by no other in the country .
