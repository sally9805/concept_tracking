txt The many peculiarities of the tax laws in the Southern States are well illustrated by the sweeping changes in the Code which have been made by the Legislature of Texas . It has long been a custom in that , as in other cotton States , to make commercial travelers , or " drummers , " as they are called even upon the statute-books , pay very large fees for the privilege of pursuing their calling . Indeed , this has been in certain cities the chief source of public revenue . Under the law as it existed in Texas for a long time past , commercial and other establishments which sent agents through the State were obliged to pay an annual tax of two hundred dollars . For this sum they were permitted to have as many traveling representatives as they desired . Some of the larger houses in Galveston and the other principal cities , taking advantage of this provision , have frequently had from ten to twenty-five travelers going through the State at one time . Under the new law this privilege will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most direct and explicit manner , that each traveling salesman or other agent of any mercantile or business firm who shall solicit orders or procure business shall be taxed fifty dollars a year . This tax is to be levied without any regard to the frequency or extent of the wandering salesman 's trips ; and , warned by past experience , the law-makers have been particularly careful to render violations or evasions of the enactment very difficult and punishable by severe penalties . When it is-stated that under the old law more than two thousand of these traveling salesmen or commercial agents were engaged in Texas , the importance of the new enactment and the extent of the interest which it must affect will be the better understood . Should the same number of agents be continued , and . the expectation is that the number will be increased , it will readily be seen that from " the drummer tax " alone the State of Texas will derive an annual income of one hundred thousand dollars . Nor is this the limit of the profit which the State is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Controller , just made public , all individual salesmen or agents who have already paid the tax of two hundred dollars called for by the old law may continue to solicit and supply custom until , the expiration of the time for which their old license was issued . On the contrary , however , mercantile houses and business firms in Texas which have paid the old tax for the privilege of sending out any number of " drummers " they might desire , are now compelled to begin immediately the payment of the head tax of fifty dollars for each agent they may wish to so employ . ' That portion of the two-hundred-dollar license which they may have paid and for which they received no benefit is to be placed to their credit in part payment of the **28;82;TOOLONG tax which each merchant , great and small , in Texas will be obliged to pay to the State for the privilege of carrying on business . Mercantile and other houses outside of Texas who have recently paid the two-hundred-dollar tax for the privilege of employing traveling agents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is held that they paid this sum solely for the drummers ' privilege , and that as the new law supersedes the old one , they must now , even though their tax of two hundred dollars has only just been paid , again come forward and pay an additional fifty dollars a year for every salesman they send into the State . This may be good law in Texas , but it certainly can not be claimed that such a decision on the part of the authorities is sanctioned by common equity or any known rule of fair play and honorable dealing . From the taxbooks it appears that more than three hundred Northern , Western , and other merchants outside of Texas will be the sufferers by the new law . Of course , they will have no redress . The action of the Legislature must doubtless be taken as final . It is but justice to the Democratic Controller to say that he pointed out to the General Assembly the wrong which would be done by the new law and the discredit which through it would indirectly fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and suggestions , however , and , intent only upon reducing the ad valorem tax on real ' property to the extent of 20 per cent. , rushed the new law through . Other changes in the tax laws are quite as noteworthy as those which affect traveling salesmen . Hereafter the bell-punch system , which in Texas , as in Virginia , proved to be so easy of evasion as to be practically inoperative , has been abolished , and hereafter liquor saloons will be obliged to pay a license which , including fees to the State , county , and city or town , will amount to six hundred dollars a year , an increase of three hundred and fifty dollars . On most occupations other than that of saloon-keeping there has been a marked reduction of taxation . Hereafter photographers , auctioneers , sewing-machine dealers , and land agents are to pay 20 per cent . less in license fees than before . Lawyers and doctors are particularly favored by the new law . Their occupation tax is to be 50 per cent . less than formerly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on shooting galleries 75 per cent. , on billiard-tables 50 per cent. , and on livery stables the same . The horse-racing community , however , will , as heretofore , be made to bear its full share of the public burdens . For every race of four hundred and forty yards or less the tax will be fifty dollars , and in addition the State is to receive five dollars . for every horse entered for any race . Cotton-dealers  --  a very extensive class  --  are also made to do their part toward supporting the Gov ernment . All brokers , factors , commission merchants , and buyers of the vegetable wool will be required to pay a license fee of fifty dollars a year . Altogether , the object of those who framed the new law seems to have been to curry favor with the farmers and land-owners , who were beginning to get very tired of Democratic impositions , and to make business men , and , as far as possible , outsiders , pay the piper .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
