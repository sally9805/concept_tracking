THE HOME ACRE . BY E. P. ROE . IX-TIJE KITCIIEN-GARDEN. - ( 6'ontiuued from the October Number . ) J N my last paper I dwelt somewhat at length on two vegetables for which thorough and enduring preparation is profitable . There is one other very early garden product which requires our attention during the first warm days of springrhubarb , sold in some instances under the name of " wine-plant . " Wine is made from the juicy stalks , but it is an unwholesome beverage . The people call it " pieplant , " and this term suggests its best and most common use , although when cooked as if it were a fruit , it is very grateful at a season when we begin to crave the subacid in our food . Its cultivation is very simple . Those who propose to produce it largely for market will find it to their advantage to raise this plant from the seed , but for the home acre enough plants can be procured , at a moderate cost , from almost any nurseryman . In this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential , for the rhubarb bed , under good care , will last eight or ten years . A rich , deep , clean , warm soil is the chief essential . It belongs to that class of vegetables known as " gross feeders . " During the first year , however , I would apply the fertilizer directly to the hills or plants . These are obtained by dividing the old roots , which may be cut to pieces downward so as to leave a single bud or " eye " surmounting a long tapering portion of root . Each division will make a new vigorous plant , which should be set out so that the bud or crown is three inches below the surface in light soils , and two // inches in heavy soils . The plants should be four feet apart each way , and two or three shovelfuls of rich compost worked into the soil where the plant is to stand . You can not make the ground too rich ; only remember that in this , as in all other instances , light , fermenting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roots . Plant in either autumn or spring . In this latitude and southward I should prefer autumn ; northward , perhaps spring is the best season . Keep the intervening ground clean and mellow , and pull no stalks the first year , unless it be in the autumn if the plants have become very strong . In the fall , when the foliage has died down , cover the crowns with two or three shovelfuls of rich manure-any kind will do in this instance  --  and work in a heavy top-dressin* all over the ground early in spring . Unless seed is required , always cut down the seed stalks as soon as they appear . The best early variety is the Linumus . The Victoria is a little later , but much larger , and is the kind that I have usually grown . Radish seed may be sown one inch deep as soon as the ground is dry enough in spring , and if the vegetable is a favorite , the sowing may be repeated every two weeks . A common error is to sow the seed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is necessary to secure a crop . What has been said about radishes applies equally to early turnips , with the exception that the plants , when three inches high , should be thinned so as to stand four inches apart . The ground for these vegetables should be very rich , so as to secure* a very rapid growth , for otherwise they are attacked by a little white worm which soon renders them unfit for use . Mr. Harris recommends the following varieties of early radishes , and his selection coincides with my own experience : Round Scarlet Turnip , French Breakfast , Rose ( olive - shaped ) , Long Scarlet Short - top . Winter radishes - California Mammoth White , and Chinese Rose . For spring sowing of turnips , Mr. Henderson recommends Red-top Strap-leaf , and Early Flat Dutch . The earlier they are sown the better : Beets , a much more valuable vegetahle , require similar treatment . The ground should be clean , well pulverized , and very rich . I prefer to sow the seed the first week in April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet . The seed may be sown , however , at any time to the 1st of July ; but earliness is usually our chief aim . I sow two inches deep and thickly , pressing the soil firmly over the seed . Let the rows be about fifteen inches apart . Referring to the manure which had been left to decay in a sheltered place until it became like fine dry powder , let me say here that I have always found it of greater advantage to sow it with the beet seed and kindred vegetables . My method is to open the drill along the garden line with a sharp-pointed hoe , scatter the fertilizer in the drill until the soil is quite blackened by it ; then draw the pointed hoe through once more to mingle the powdery manure with the soil , and to make the drill of an even depth ; then sow the seed at once . This thoroughly decayed stahle manure has become the best of plant food ; it warms the ground and carries the germinating seed and young plants with vigor through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garden there are several reasons for sowing beet seed thickly . Unfavorable weather and insects will be less apt to cause a thin broken stand of plants . In order to produce good roots , however , the plants should be thinned out so as to stand eventually three or four inches apart . I do not advise very large , coarse roots for the table . For home use I think only thiree varieties are essential . The Egyptian Turnip Beet is the best very early variety , and can be planted closely , as it has a small top ; the Bassano is next in earliness , and requires more room ; the Early Blood Turnip is the best for a general crop and winter use . The beet is a root which deteriorates rapidly from age ; I therefore advise that the seed of the winter supply be sown the last of June or first of July in our latitude . Parsnips should be sown at the same time with early beets and in the same way , with the exception that the seed should be covered only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marked distinctions in variety , and would advise that only the Long Smooth or Hollow-crowned be sown . The carrot is not quite so hardy as the parsnip , and the seed may be sown a week or two later , and indeed at any time up to the middle of June . Its culture and treatment are precisely like those of the parsnip , but the roots should be gathered and stored before a severe frost occurs . // For home use a short row of the Early Horn will answer ; for the general crop , sow the Long Orange . Vegetable oyster , or salsify , is another root crop which may he treated precisely like the parsnip , and the seed sown at the same time . The seed should he sown in a deep , rich , melloxv soil , which is all the better for being prepared in autumn . Plant as early in April as possible , and in the same manner as described for beets , thin out to four inches apart , and keep the soil clean and mellow throughout the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is only one variety . The pea is another crop which may be put into the ground as soon as the frost is out  --  the earlier the better , if the smooth , hardy varieties are sown . There are so many varieties , the novice to-day can well be excused for perplexity in choice . Thompson , the English authority , gives 40 kinds and 148 synonyms . Mr. Gregory recommends the American Wonder , Bliss 's Abundance , Bliss 's Ever-bearing , McLean 's Advancer , Yorkshire Hero , Stratagem , and Champion of England . Mr. Henderson 's list includes Henderson 's First of All , American Wonder , Bliss 's Abundance , Champion of England , and Pride of the Market . Mr. Harris in his catalogue marks first and best , American Wonder , and also says , " For the main crop there is nothing better than the Champion of England . " My own experience would lead me to plant the Tom Thumb either just before the ground froze in the fall , or as early in March as possible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earliest picking . I should also plant Henderson 's First of All as soon as the frost was out , on a warm , well - drained soil . For second crops , American Wonder and Preminm Gem ; and for the main and most satisfactory crop of all , Chain . pion of England . The Champion requires brush as a support , for it grows from four to six feet high , but it is well worth the trouble . I plant the other kinds named because they are much earlier , and so dwarf a to need no brush ; they are also productive , and excellent in quality if not left to grow too old . For the dwarf kinds the soil can not be too rich , and the warmer the ground and exposure the earlier the crop . For the tall late sorts the soil can easily be made too fertile ; they should also be planted in cooler , moister , and heavier ground . In the case of the dwarfs I put a fertilizer in with the seed as I have already explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep , and the tall late sorts from three to four inches , according to the nature of the soil . Plant the Champion of England every ten days until the middle of June , and thus secure a succession of the best of all . We all know how numerous have been the varieties of potato introduced in this country of late years-many kinds sent out at first at the rate of one or more dollars per pound . I amuse myself by trying several of these novelties ( after they become cheap ) every year , and this season raised very early crops of excellent potatoes from the Vanguard and Pearl of S*voy . The Early Rose and Early Vermont have long been favorites . They resemble each other very closely . I have had excellent success with the Beauty of Hebron . It is a good plan to learn what varieties succeed well in our own neighborhood , and plant chiefly of such kinds ; then add to our zest by trying a few novelties . Not only much reading on the subject , but also my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like , " lead me to endorse the practice of planting large tubers cut into sets containing one or more eyes or buds . The eye of a potato is a bud from which grows the plant , and the stronger backing it has , the stronger and more able is the plant to evolve new fine tubers through the action of its roots and foliage . A small potato has many and immature buds , which , as a rule , produce feeble plants . The potato will grow on almost any soil , but a dry , rich , sandy loam gives the best if not the largest yield . I do not think the potato can be planted too early , after the ground is fit to work . One spring I was able to get in several rows the 15th of March , and I never had a finer yield . I observe that Mr. Harris strongly endorses this view . Nearly every one has his system of planting . There is no necessity of explaining these methods . I will briefly give mine for what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plough deeply in autumn , also in spring ; harrow and pulverize the ground as completely as possible ; then open the furrows with the same heavy plough , sinking it to the beam , and going twice in the furrow . This , of course , // would make too deep a trench in which to place the sets , but the soil has been deepened and pulverized at least fourteen inches . A man next goes along with a cart or barrow of well-decayed compost ( not very raw manure ) , which is scattered freely in the deep furrows ; then through these a corn plough is run to mingle the fertilizer with the soil . By this course the furrows are partially filled with loose friable soil and manure , and they average four or five inches in depth . The sets are planted at once eight inches apart , the eye turned upward , and the cut part down . The sets are then covered with three or four inches of fine soil , not with sods and stones . When the plants are two or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which merely levels the ground evenly . The next cultivation is performed by both corn plough and hoe . In the final working I do not permit a sharp-slanting slope from the plants downward , so that the rain is kept from reaching the roots . There is a broad hilling up so as to have a slope inward toward the plants as well as away from them . This method , with the deep , loosened soil beneath the plants , secures against drought , while the decayed fertilizers give a strong and immediate growth . Of course we have to fight the potato or Colorado beetle during the growing season . This we do with Paris green applied in liquid form , a heaping teaspoonful to a pail of water . In taking up and storing potatoes a very common error is fallen into . Sometimes even growing tubers are so exposed to sun and light that they become green . In this condition they are not only worthless , but poisonous . If long exposed to light after being dug , the . solanine principle , which exists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tubers . The more they are in the light , the less value they possess , until they become worse than worthless . They should be dug , if possible , on a dry day , picked up promptly , and carried to a dry , cool , dark cellar . If stored on floors of out-buildings , the light should be excluded . Potatoes that are long exposed to light before the shops of dealers are injured . Barrels , etc. , containing them should be covered ; if spread on the barn floor , or in places which can not be darkened , throw straw or some other litter over them . There is no occasion to say much about lettuce . It is a vegetable which any one can raise who will sow the seed a quarter of an inch deep . I have sowed the seed in September , wintered the plants over in cold frames , and by giving a little heat , I had an abundance of heads to sell in February and March . For ordinary home uses it is necessary only to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as the frost is out , and you will quickly have plenty of tender foliage . This we may begin te thin out as soon as the plants are three or four inches high , until a foot of space is left between the plants , which , if of a cabbage variety , will speedily make a large , crisp head . To maintain a supply , sowings can be made every two weeks till the middle of August . Hardy plants , which can be set out like cabba*es , can be obtained in March and April from nursery - men . Henderson recommend , the following varieties : Henderson 's New York , Black-seeded Simpson , Salamander , and All the Year Round . I would alse add the Black-seeded Butter Lettuce . We have now , as far as our space permits , treated of those vegetables which should be planted in the home garden as early in spring as possible . It is true the reader will think of other sorts , as cabbage , cauliflower , spinach , etc . To the professional gardener @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in his garden as to have cold frames and hot-beds , he will learn from more extended works how ta manage these . He will winter over the cabbage and kindred vegetables for his earliest supply , having first sown the seed in September . I do not take the trouble to do this , and others need not unless it is a source of enjoyment to them . As soon as the ground is fit to work in spring , I merely write to some trustworthy dealer in plants and obtain twenty-five very early cabbage and twenty - five second early , also a hundred early cauliflower . They cost little , and are set out in half an hour as soon as the ground is fit to work in spring . I usually purchase my tomato , late cabbage , and cauliflower , celery and e*g-plants , from the same sources . Cabbages and cauliflowers should be set out in rich warm soils , free from shade , a soon as the frost is out . After that they only need frequent and clean culture and vigilant watchfulness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown worm which usually cuts the stem , and leaves the plant // lying on the ground . The worm can easily be found near the surface the moment it begins its ravages , and the only remedy I know is to catch and kill it at once . In this latitude winter cabbage is set out about the Fourth of July . I pinch off half the leaves before setting . Good seed , deep ploughing or spading , rich soil , and clean culture are usually the only requisites for success . Experience and consultation of the books and catalogues enable me to recommend the Jersey Wakefield for first early , and Henderson 's Summer Cabbage and Winningstadt as second early . As a late root I ask for nothing better than Premium Flat Dutch . The Savoy is the best flavored of the cabbage tribe . Henderson recommends the Netted Savoy , which may be treated like other late cabbage . The cauliflower is ranked among the chief delicacies of the garden , and requires and repays far more attention . Even the early sorts should have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabbage . I advise two plantings in spring , of first and second early ; I also advise that late varieties be set out on rich ground the last of June . As with cabbage , set out the plants from two and a half to three feet apart , according to the size of the variety . From trial I recommend Early Snowball , Half-early Paris , and Large Late Algiers . Spinach thrives in a very rich , well-drai aed , fine , mellow soil . I prefer a sunny slope , but this is not necessary . Sow the seed from the 1st to the 15th of September , so as to give the plants time to become half grown by winter . Cover the seeds-three to an inch-two inches deep , and pack the ground well over them ; let the rows be three inches apart . When the plants are three inches high , thin out to three inches apart , and keep the soil clean and mellow about them . Just before hard freezing weather , scatter about three inches of straw , old pea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As soon as the days begin to grow warm in spring , and hard frost ceases , rake this off . The hardy vegetable begins to grow at once , and should be cut for use so as to leave the plants finally six inches apart , for as fast as space is given , the plants fill it up . By those who are fond of spinach it may be sown in spring as soon as the frost is out . It soon runs to seed in hot weather , and thinnings of young beets may take its place where space is limited . The Round or Summer is good for fall or spring planting . Those who need much instruction in regard to bush-beans should remain in the city and raise cats in their paved backyards . We shall only warn against planting too early-not before the last of April in our region . It does not take much frost to destroy the plants , and if the soil is cold and wet , the beans decay instead of coming up . If one has a warm sheltered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As a rule , however , bush-beans may be planted from the first of May till the middle of July , in order to keep up a succession . Cover the first seed planted one inch deep ; later plantings , two inches deep . I think that earliest Red Valentine , Black Wax or Butter , Golden Wax , and the late Refugee are all the varieties needed for the garden . The delicious pale Lima bean requires and deserves more attention . I have always succeeded with them , and this ha been my method : I take a warm , rich , but not dry piece of ground , work it deeply early in spring , again the first of May , so that the sun 's rays may penetrate and sweeten the ground . About the 10th of May I set the poles firmly in the ground . Rough cedar poles , with the stubs of the branches extending a little , are the best . If smooth poles are used , I take a hatchet , and beginning at the butt , I make shallow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little . These slight raisings of the bark or wood serve as supports to the clambering vines . After the poles are in the ground I make a broad flat hill of loose soil and a little of the black powdery fertilizer . I then allow the sun to warm and dry the hill a few days , and if the weather is fine and warm , I plant the seed about the 15th , merely pressing the eye of the bean downward one inch . If planted lower than this depth they usually decay . If it is warm and early , the seed can be planted by the 5th of May . After planting , examine the seed often . If the beans are decaying instead of coming up , plant over again , and repeat this process until there are three or four strong plants within three or four inches of each pole . Let . the hills be five feet apart each way , hoe often , and do not tolerate a weed . The Long White Lima and Dreer 's Improved Lima are the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us long since to associate corn with beans , and they hit upon a dish not surpassed by modern invention . This delicious vegetable is as easily raised as its " hail-fellow well met , " the bean . We have only to plant it at the same time in hills from three to four feet apart , and cover the seed two inches deep . I have used the powdery fertilizers and wood - ashes in the hill to great advantage , first mingling these ingredients well with the soil . We make it a point to have sweet-corn for the table from July 1 until the stalks are killed by frost in October . This is easily managed by planting different varieties , and continuing to plant till well into June . Mr. Gregory writes : " For a succession of corn for family use , to be planted at the same time , I would recommend Marblehead Early , Pratt 's , Crosley 's , Moore 's , Stowell 's Evergreen , and Egyptian Sweet . Mr. Harris names with praise the Minnesota as the best earliest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Henderson 's list is Henderson Sugar , Hickox Improved , Egyptian , and Stowell 's Evergreen . Let me add Burr 's Mammoth and Squantum Sugar , a variety in great favor with the Squantum Club , and used by them in their famous clam-bakes . The cucumber , if grown in the home garden and used fresh , is not in league with the undertaker . The seed can be planted early in May , and there are many ways of forcing and hastening the yield . I have had them very early in an ordinary hot-bed . Out-doors , I make hills in warm soil the first of May , mixing a little of my favorite fertilizer with the soil . After leaving the hill for a day or two to become warm in the sun , I sow the seed in a straight line for fifteen inches , so that the hoe can approach them closely . The seed is covered an inch deep , and the soil patted down firmly . It is possible that a cold storm or that insects may make partial planting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I put twenty seeds in the hill to insure against loss . For a succession or long-continued crop , plant a few hills in rich moist land about the last of May . The young plants always run a gauntlet of insects , and a little striped bug is usually their most deadly enemy . They often appear to come suddenly in swarms , and devour everything before you are aware of their presence . With great vigilance they can be kept off by hand , for their stay is brief . I would advise one trial of a solution of white hellebore , a table-spoonful to a pail of water . Paris green-in solution , of course-kills them , but unless it is very weak it will kill or stunt the plants also . My musk and water melons were watered by too strong a solution of Paris green this year , and they never recovered from it . Perhaps the best preventive is to plant so much seed , and to plant over so often , that although the insects do their worst , plenty of good plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the striped bug disappears , and the plants are four or fixTe inches high , I thin out to four plants in the hill . When they come into bearing , pick off all the fruit fit for use , whether you want it or not . If many are allowed to become yellow and go to seed , the growth and productiveness of the vines are checked . The Early White Spine and Extra Long White Spine are all the varieties needed for the table . For pickling purposes plant the Green Prolific on moist rich land . The other varieties answer quite as well , if picked before they are too large . The cultivation of the squash is substantially the same as that of the cucuinher , and it has about the same enemies to contend with . Let the hills of the bush sorts be four feet apart each way , and eight feet for the running varieties . The seed is cheap , so use plenty , and plant over from the 1st to the 25th of May , until you have three good strong plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the plants , when six or seven inches high , to this number , and keep the ground clean and mellow . I usually raise my running squashes among the corn , giving up one hill to them completely every seven or eight feet each way . Early bush sorts : White Bush Scalloped , Yellow Bush Scalloped . The Perfect Gem is good for both summer and winter , and should be planted on rich soil , six feet apart each way . The Boston Marrow is one of the best fall sorts ; the Hubbard and Marblehead are the best winter varieties . When we come to plant muskmelons we must keep them well away from the two above-named vegetables , or else their pollen will mix , producing very disagreeable hybrids . A squash is very good in its way , and a melon is much better , but if you grow them so near each other that they become alf and alf , " you may perhaps find pigs that will eat // them . The more completely the melon patch is by itself the better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while it is liable to all the insects arid diseases which attack the cucumber , it encounters , when the fruit is mature , a more fatal enemy in the predatory small boy . Choose rich , warm , but not dry ground for muskmelens , make the hills six feet apart each way , and treat them like cucunibers employing an abundance of seed . As soon as the plants are ready to run , thin out so as to leave only four to fruit . Henderson recommends Montreal Market , Hackensack , and Netted Gem . Gregory : Netted Gem , Boston Pet , Bay View , Sill 's Hybrid , Casaba , and Ward 's Nectar . He also advocates a remarkable novelty known as the " Banana . " Harris : Early Christiana and Montreal Market . Watermelons should be planted eight feet apart , but if one has not a warm andy soil , I do not advise their culture . The time of planting anti management do not vary materially from those of the musk variety . The following kinds can scarcely fail to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Black Spanish , Mammoth Iron-clad , Mountam Sprout , Scaly Bark , and Cuban Queen . The tomato has a curious history . Native of South America , like the potato , it is said to have been introduced into England as early as 159G . Many years elapsed before it was used as food , and the botanical name given to it was significant of the estimation in which it was held by our forefathers . It was called Lycopersieuin-a compound term meaning wolf and peach , indicating that , notwithstanding its beauty , it was regarded as a sort of " Dead Sea fruit . " The Italians first dared to use it freely , the French followed , and after eying it askance as a novelty for unknown years , John Bull ventured to taste , and having survived , began to eat with increasing gusto . To our grandmothers in this land the ruby fruit was given as " love-apples , " and adorning quaint old bureaus , were devoured by dreamy eyes long before canning factories were within the ken of even a Yankee* s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a general article of food , and one can scarcely visit a quarter of the globe so remote but lie will find that the tomato can has been there before him . Its culture is so easy that one year I had bushels of the finest fruit from plants that grew here and there by chance . Skill is required only in producing an early crop , and to secure this end the earlier the plants are started in spring the better . Those who have glass will experience no difficulty whatever . The seed may be sown in a greenhouse as early as January , and the plants potted when three inches high , transferred to larger pots from time to time as they grow , and by the niiddle of May jut into the open ground , full of blossoms and immature fruit . Indeed , plants started early in the fall will give in a greenhouse a good supply all winter . They also grow readily in hot-beds , cold frames , and sunny windows . We usually can buy well-forwarded plants from those who raise them for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a sunny slope , they mature rapidly , and give an early yield . The tomato is very sensitive to frost , and should not be in the open ground before danger from it is over . Throughout May we may find plants for sale everywhere . If we desire to try distinct kinds with the least trouble , we can sow the seed about May 1 , and in our climate enjoy an abundant yield in September or before . In the cool , humid climate of England the tomato is usually grown en espalier , like the peach , along sunny walls and fences , receiving as careful a summer pruning as the grape-vine . With us they are usually left to sprawl over the ground at will . By training the vines over various kinds of supports , however , they can be made as ornamental as they are useful . The ground on which they grow should be only moderately fertile , or else there is too great a growth of vine at the expense of fruit . This is especially true if we wish an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driest soil is necessary . But comparatively a few years ago the tomato consisted of little more than a rind with seeds in the hollow centre . Now , the only varieties worth raising cut as solid as a mellow pear . The following is Grego.ry 's list of varieties : Livingston 's Beauty , Alpha , Acme , Canada Victor , Arlington , General Grant . I will add Trophy and Mikado . If a yellow variety is desired , try Golden Trophy . If the tomato needs warm weather in which to thrive , the egg-plant requires that both days and nights should be hot . It is an East Indiaman , and demands curry in the way of temperature before it // loses its feeble yellow aspect and takes on the dark green of vigorous health . My method is simply this : I purchase strong potted plants between the 20th of May and the 1st of June , and set them out in a rich , warm soil . A dozen well-grown plants will supply a large family with egg-fruit . Of course one can start the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but it should be remembered that they are much more tender and difficult to raise than the tomato . Plants from seed sown in the open ground would not mature in our latitude as a rule . The best plan is to have the number you need grown for you by those who make it their business . Egg-plants are choice morsels for the potato-beetle , and they must be watched vigilantly if we would save them . There is no better variety than the New York Improved . The pepper is another hot-blooded vegetable that shivers at the suggestion of frost . It is fitting that it should be a native of India . Its treatment is usually the same as that of the egg-plant . It matures more rapidly , however , and the seed can be sown about the middle of May , half an inch deep , in rows fifteen inches apart . The soil should be rich and warm . When the plants are well up , thin so that they will stand a foot apart in the row . The usual course , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under glass , after all danger from frost is over . Henderson recommends New Sweet Spanish and Golden Dawn . The Large Bell is a popular sort , and Cherry Red very ornamental . From the okra is made the famous gumbo soup , which ever calls to vision a colored aunty presiding over the mysteries of a Southern dinner . If Aunt Dinah , so well known to us from the pages of Uncle Tom 's Cabin , could have Left her receipt for this compound , her fame might have lasted as long as that of Mrs. Stowe . The vegetable furnishing this glutinous , nutritious , and wholesome ingredient is as easily raised as any product of the garden . We have only to sow the seed , from the 1st to the 10th of May , two inches deep , and let the plants stand from two to three feet apart each way , in order to have an abundant supply . The new Dwarf Prolific is about the best variety . Fall turnips are so easily grown that they require but few words . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early crops , as pease , beans , potatoes , etc. , are removed . The seed of ruta-baga or Swedish turnips should be planted earliest-from the 20th of June to July 10 in our latitude . This turnip should be sown in drills two feet apart , and the plants thinned to eight inches from one another . It is very hardy , and the roots are close - grained , solid , and equally good for the table and the family cow . The Yellow Aberdeen is another excellent variety , which may be sown early in July , and treated much the same as the foregoing . The Yellow Stone can be sown on good ground until the 15th of July in any good garden soil , and the plants thinned to six inches apart . It is perhaps the most satisfactory of all the turnip tribe both for table use and stock . The Red-top Strap-leaf may be sown anywhere until the 10th of August . It is a general custom , in the middle of July , to scatter some seed of this hardy variety among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is usually a good crop . Every vacant spot can be utilized by incurring only the slight cost of the seed and the sowing . It may be well , perhaps , to remember the advice of the old farmer to his son . He said , " Stub your toe and spill half the seed before sowing it , for scattered broadcast it is usually much too thick . " If this proves true , thin out the plants ri*orously . This turnip is good for table and stock as long as it is solid and crisp , but it grows pithy toward spring . There are other kinds well worth a trial . I will speak of nasturtiurns under the head of flowers , for while it is a useful vegetable , it gives some of the most satisfactory blossoms of the border . Perhaps no vegetable is more generally appreciated than celery . Like asparagus , it was once , and is still by some , regarded as a luxury requiring too much skill and labor for the ordinary gardener . This is a mistake . Few vegetables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One can raise turnips as a fall crop much easier , it is true , but turnips are not celery any more than brass is gold . Think of enjoying this delicious vegetable daily from October till April ! When cooked , and served on toast with drawn butter sauce , it is quite ambrosial . In every garden evolved beyond the cabbage and potato phase a goodly space of the best soil should be reserved for celery , since it // can be set out from the 1st to tue 20th of July in our latitude ; it can be grown as the most valuable of the second crops , reoccupying spaces made vacant by early crops . I find it much easier to buy my plants , when ready for them , than to raise them . In every town there are those who grow them in very large quantities , and , if properly packed , quickly transported , and promptly set out in the evening following their reception , and watered abundantly , they rarely fail . There are decided advantages , however , *u raising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hot , or the plants must be long in transit . When they are growing in our own garden they can be moved with very slight check to their growth . In starting the seed there is no necessity for hot-bed or cold frame . It can be put in the ground the first week of April , and the best plants are thus secured . Much is gained by preparing a warm but not dry plot of ground in autumn , making it very rich with short half-decayed stable manure . This preparation should be be*un as soon as possible after the soaking September rains . Having thoroughly incorporated and mixed evenly in the soil an abundance of the manure described , leave the ground untouched for three weeks . The warm fertilizer will cause great numbers of weed seeds to germinate . When these thrifty pests are a few inches high , dig them under and bring up the bottom soil . The warmth and light will immediately start a new and vigorous growth of weeds , which in turn should be dug under . If the celery-seed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated several times before winter : the oftener the better , for by it the great majority of weed seeds will be made to germinate , and thus are destroyed . The ground also becomes exceedingly rich , mellow , and fine-an essential condition for celery seed , which is very small , and germinates slowly . This thorough preparation does not involve much labor , for the seed bed is small , and nothing more is required in spring but to rake the ground smooth and fine as soon was the frost is out . The soil has already been made mellow , and certainly nothing is gained by turning up the cold earth in the bottom of the bed . Sow the seed at once on the sun-warmed surface . The *rows should be nine inches apart , and *about twelve seeds sown to every inch of row . The drills should be scarcely an eighth of an inch deep . Indeed , a firm patting with the back of a spade would give covering enough . Since celery germinates so slowly , it is well to drop a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rows are . Then the ground between the rows can be hoed li* , htly as soon as the weeds start , also after heavy rains , so as to admit the vivifying sun-rays and air . Of course when the celery plants are clearly outlined , the lettuce should be pulled out . If the bed is made in siring , perform the work as early as possible , making the bed very rich , mellow , and fine . Coarse manures , cold , poor , lumpy soil , leave scarcely a ghost of a chance for success . The plants should be thinned to two inches from one another , and when five inches high , shear them back to three inches . When they have made another good growth , shear them back again . The plants are thus made stocky . In our latitude I try to set out celery , whether raised or bought , between the 25th of June and the 15th of July . This latitude enables us to avoid a spell of hot , dry weather . There are two distinct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varieties . A few years ago the former class was grown generally ; trenches were dug , and their bottoms well enriched to receive the plants . Now the dwarf kinds are proving their superiority by yielding a larger amount of crisp , tender heart than is found between long coarse stalks of the tall sorts . Dwarf celery requires less labor also , for it can be set on the surface and much closer together , the rows three feet apart , and the plants six inches in the row . Dig all the ground thoroughly , then , beginning on one side of the plot , stretch a line along it , and fork under a foot-wide strip of three or four inches of compost , not raw manure . By this course the soil where the row is to be is made very rich and mellow . Set out the plants at once while the ground is fresh and moist . If the row is ten feet long , you will want twenty plants ; if fifteen , thirty plants , or two plants to every foot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line forward three feet , and prepare and set out another row in precisely the same manner . Continue this process until the plot selected is occupied . If the plants have been grown in your own gar // den , much is gained by soaking the ground around them in the evening , and removing them to the rows in the cool of the morning . This abundant moisture will cause the soil to cling to the roots if handled gently , and the plants will scarcely know that they have been moved . When setting I usually trim off the greater part of the foliage . When all the leaves are left , the roots , not established , can not keep pace with the evaporation . Always keep the roots moist and unshrivelled , and the heart intact , and the plants are safe . If no rain follows setting immediately , water the plants thoroughly-do n't be satisfied with a mere sprinkling of the surface-and shade from the hot sun until the plants start to grow . One of the chief requisites in putting out a celery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press the soil firmly around , against , and over the roots . This excludes the air , and the new rootlets form rapidly . Neither bury the heart nor leave any part of the root exposed . Do not be discouraged at the rather slow growth during the hot days of July and early August . You have only to keep the ground clean and mellow by frequent hoeings until the nights grow cooler and longer , and rains thoroughly moisten the soil . About the middle of August the plants should be thrifty and spreading , and now require the first operation which will make them crisp and white or golden for the table . Gather up the stalks and foliage of each plant closely in the left hand , and with the right draw up the earth around it . Let no soil tumble in on the heart to soil or cause decay . Press the soil firmly so as to keep all the leaves in an upright position . Then with a hoe draw up more soil , until the banking process is begun . During September @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to blanch them they must be earthed up from time to time , always keeping the stalks close and compact , with no soil falling in on the developing part . By the end of October the growth is practically made , and only the deep green leaves rest on the high embankments . The celery now should be fit for use , and time for winter storing is near . In our region it is not safe to leave celery unprotected after the 10th of November , for although it is a very hardy plant , it will not endure a frost which produces a strong crust of frozen soil . I once lost a fine crop early in November . The frost in one night penetrated the soil deeply , and when it thawed out , the celery never revived . Never handle celery when it is frozen . My method of preserving this vegetable for winter use is simply this . During some mild , clear day in early November I have a trench ten inches wide dug just about as deep as the celery is tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that by no possibility can water gather in it . Then the plants are taken up carefully and stored in the trench , the roots on the bottom , the plants upright as they grew , and pressed closely together so as to occupy all the space in the excavation . The foliage rises a little above the surface , and it is earthed up about four inches , so that water will be shed on either side . Still enough of the leaves are left in the light to permit all the breathing necessary-for plants breathe as truly as we do . As long as the weather keeps mild , this is all that is necessary ; but there is no certainty now . A hard black frost may come any night . I advise that an abundance of leaves or straw be gathered near . When a bleak November day promises a black frost at night , scatter the leaves , etc. , thickly over the trenched celery , and do not take them off until the mercury rises above freezing-point . If a warm spell sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But watch your treasure vigilantly . Winter is near , and soon you must have enough covering over your trench to keep out the frost  --  a foot or more of leaves , straw , or some clean litter . There is nothing better than leaves , which cost only the gathering . From now till April , when you want a head or more of celery , open the trench at the lower end , and take out the crisp white or golden heads , and thank the kindly Providence that planted a garden as the best place in which to put man and woman also . GARNISHING AND POT HERBS . " There 's fennel for you ; there 's rue for you . " Strange and involuntary is the law of association . I can never see the garnishing and seasoning herbs of the garden without thinking of the mad words of distraught Ophelia . I fancy , however , that we are all practical enough to remember the savory soups and dishes rendered far more appetizing than they could otherwise have been by these aromatic and pungent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular sorts . // The seeds of fennel may be sown in April , about three - quarters of an inch deep , and the plants thinned to fifteen inches apart . Cut off the seed stalks to increase the growth of foliage . Parsley , like celery seed , germinates slowly , and is sometimes about a month in making its appearance . The soil should therefore be made very rich and fine , and the seed sown , half an inch deep , as early in spring as possible . When the plants are three inches high , thin them to eight inches apart . Sweet-basil may be sown in early May , and the plants thinned to one foot apart . The seeds of sweet-marjoram are very minute , and must be covered very thinly with soil finely pulverized ; sow in April or May , when the ground is in the best condition . Sage is easily raised from seeds sown an inch deep the latter part of April ; let the soil be warm and rich ; let the plants stand about one foot apart in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment as sage . I find that some of the mountain mints growing wild are quite as aromatic and appetizing as many of these garden herbs .
