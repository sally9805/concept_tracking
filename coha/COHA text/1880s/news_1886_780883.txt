txt One of the two barratry eases which the United States officers in Boston have had to deal with during the past week was to-day finally disposed of . It is that of Capt . John T. Iticard , master of the British schooner Evangeline , who is charged with barratry in attempting to burn his vessel in Boston Harbor on the night of Dec. 23 last . The penalty of the crime is death . Michael O'Brien , one of the crew of the Evangeline who had at first been arrested for complicity with his Captain , but was finally discharged , told the story of the fire before Commissioner Hallett to-day . He and another sailor were asleep in the cabin when the fire broke out . A few buckets of water were hastily thrown , and then the two men dropped their personal effects into a boat and went ashore . One Tirrel. a mariner , declared that Capt . Ricara had offered him $50 for two days ' work as his mate , and had confessed that ne wanted to burn his vessel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $1,500 . The fact that this man bad informed the firm which chartered the Evangeline of the design of the Captain only after he wanted to get the post of mate , went far to weaken his testimony . A Mr. O'Leary testified to having a mortgage for $2,000 on the schooner , which he considered worth fully twice that sum six months ago . He stated , moreover , that Capt . Rieartl had no interest in the insurance , and had hitherto borne an unstained reputation . Commissioner Hallett said that the fire itself was suspicious , and there were suspicious circumgtances connected with it . He could , however , see no motive for starting the fire , and the evidence showed no reason why Capt . Ricard should desire the destruction of the schooner . He would therefore discharge Capt . Ricard.
