txt The Empire Plaster Mills , Nos. 21 to 25 Bethune-street , which were owned by Gustavus Isaacs , of No. 322 West Twenty-third-street , were destroyed by fire on the morning of the 11th inst. , so that all that remained was the wreck of the roof and floors and the north or Bethune-street wall , and the west and east walls , the south wall having fallen . Each of the walls that stood was six stories high , and threatened to fall on the neighboring houses , so that a number of firemen were kept on duty there until Sunday . They looked after the smoldering fire in the ruins , Which had not been extinguished , razed part of the west wall , and " trimmed off " the other walls so that no beams or girders remained inside to drag them down . The north wall stood plumb , and was considered as safe as any of them , but Inspector McNamara , of Superintendent D'Oench 's bureau , recommended that it be shored up , and on Saturday an order was served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ braces put up . Mr. Isaacs employed a firm of movers to do this , and Tuesday morn-the wall was braced up , and there appeared to be no likelihood of its falling . Thou the Fire Department and Superintendent D'Oench considered that Mr. Isaacs became responsible for the safety of the ruins , but Inspector McNamara was required to visit the place now and then , as it was in his district , and a fireman was left in charge of a watch line , attached to a hydrant. to keep that part of the ruins that still smoldered constantly wet . Mr. Isaacs intended to rebuild his place as soon as possible , and instructed his foreman , Joseph Chapman , to hire a gang of meu and clear out the ruins . They began clearing out from the gateway of No. 21 Bethune-street , and yesterday afternoon had made such progress that they were working inside of the north wall toward the west wall . At that time Chapman and five laborers , Italians , were at work on the ruins , and Luke Clayton , a fireman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the watch line . The sidewalk from No. 19 to No. 27 Bethunestreet was barricaded , and a watch was kept for children who ventured beyond it . A plank was put across the street at No. 27 Bethune-street to stop carts from passing . At about 4 o'clock Patrick Cragin , a cartmau , of No. 759 Washington-street , who was in the gateway of No. 21 Bethune-street. prepared to leave the place with a cartload of rubbish . Just outside the gateway was Mary Conn. of No. 34 Bethunestreet , who was gathering wood . A bystander . one of Isaacs 's employes , had just said to her . " Look out for that woman ; she is stealing your wood , " Pointing to a neighbor of Mrs. Conti , and she had replied good-humbredly , " Nell . If she is she and I 'll have a fight . " As Cragin drove out of the gateway pieces of mortar fell on him , and looking up he saw the north wall swaying . Shouting to those in the ruins , he leaped from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cart aud halfburying the horse in bricks and mortar , but the animal by a mighty effort tore itself from its harness and ran to its stable . It was only slightly injured . W hen Cragin shouted Foreman Thomas J. Van Horn , of Engine Company No. 18 , was at the Bank-street end of the ruins with Private Clayton , and he saw the north wall totter and shouted . He says the top of it , down to the fourth floor , fell southward . Then it appeared to spring back and the rest of it , to the beams of the first floor , fell into Bethune-street . The wall fell so perpendicularly that the rubbish ? did not go hair way across the street except a few separate bricks , and no damage was done to the houses opposite . Chapman and the laborers in the ruins were not buried , but were struck by portions of the wall which fell inside . Two of the laborers , who were known as Richard or Ritchie arrd Salvatore. received slight bruises , but they were able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ c'arried to the street , where they were attended by Ambulance Surgeon Kelly aria his assistants as quickly as possible and removed to St .. Vincent 's Hospital . Meanwhile John Bradley and Bernard Brown had removed the bricks and mortar which , covered Mary Conn to a depth of two feet near the gateway . When they had uncovered her she breathed faintly , but she died almost Immediately . On attempting to raise her they found that her body had been terribly crushed . A stretcher was procured and she was taken to Mr. Isaacs 's temporary office in his stable opposite . Last night Coroner Messemer viewed the body , and it was taken to an uddertaker 's . Superintendent D'Oench arrived half an hour after the accident occurred . Inspector McNamara 's condition was such as to prevent him from giving much valuable information abs  --  t the accident , but Mr. D'Oench consulted witli Chief Gicquel and Foreman Van Horn and decided that the Fire Department and the Bureau of Buildings had done what was proper and had neglected nothin , r . He would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north wall . The span braces appeared to have been spliced , but the testimony of by-standeits was that the wall toppled over to the south first . The wall might have been rendered unsafe by " trimming down , " or the men under Chapman might have undermined Props which kept the wall up . There appeared to be no means of ascertaining the exact condition of the wall just before it fell . Chief Gicquel said that when he lett the ruins the wall was plumb , and appeared solid . Ex-Alderman Seaman was of the opinion that the north wall was not safe , because it was old and weakened by the lire . He did not think Isaacs would have allowed it to stand to use it in the erection of a new building . Superintendent D'Oench would condemn no one for the collapse of the wall , but he directed Chief Giequel to forthwith raze what remained of the west wall above the third floor , because it was snored up from the roof of No. 27 Bethunestreet . This was accomplished without accident by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Isaacs refused to be seen last night . After the removal of the injured to the hospital there were many stories of other persons who were buried in the ruins , but a thorough search failed to reveal any more victims . One of the laborers taken to the hospital  --  Joseph Boffe , 48 years old , of No. 140 Sullivan-streetdied at a little before 9 o'clock . He had received a compound fracture of the skull , both legs and his rigut thigh were fractured , and he received internal injuries . The other laborers at the hospital are : Ancha Georgia . age 28 .
