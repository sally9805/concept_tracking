IT is the aim of the College to give a liberal education . A liberal education implies a disciplined mind  --  a mind energetic in its varied activity , freed from all prepossessions having no basis in reason , hospitable towards all truth , and largely intelligent concerning the life of mankind and the order of nature . To secure such education the college provides courses of study in several literatures , in mathematics , philosophy , history , politics , economics and in the different branches of natural science . That these studies are adapted to the end sought is evident from their nature and from experience . The English Bible is the supreme book of the English speaking world , the most potent formative factor of modern civilization having literary form , and the inspiration of that intellectual life which creates and patronizes colleges . It is held in high esteem in all institutions of learning and in great degree moulds the philosophy taught in them , yet strange to say , is in very few of them taken up and studied-really studied-as are Plato , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has gained for it its preeminence , and reverence for that has obscured the fact that this book , taken all in all , is the greatest intellectual production of all ages , and as such , is fitted to render high service in the liberal training of the human mind . Sir William Jones , the master of twenty-four languages and familiar with all the great literatures , was not an enthusiast , when he wrote , " Theological inquiries form no part of my present subject ; but I can not refrain from adding , that the collection of tracts which we call from their excellence the Scriptures , contain-independently of their divine origin-more true sublimity , more exquisite beauty , purer morality , more important history , and finer strains , both of poetry and // eloquence , than could be collected within the same compass , from all other books that have ever been composed in any age or any idiom . " If this be half true , the Bible has adaptations unto intellectual training , the same in kind as the major part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside , and has them in an extraordinary degree . It is accordingly the purpose of this article to indicate some of these adaptations and to show that the English Bible should be , by reason of them accorded a place in the curriculum of every institution of liberal learnii*g . In deference to a general sentiment , it may be well to premise , that the chief use of the Bible is to develop and foster , through the revelation which it contains , the religious life of men . But this is not a good reason why its secondary and very important uses should be set aside . It is a mistaken reverence which fears that the glory of the revelation will be obscured by a larger knowledge of the vehicle conveying it . Thorough , scholari y , exhaustive study of the Bible can only tend to confirm its truth and exalt its authority . There is no greater error than that " ignorance is the mother of devotion. ** I. If a liberal education implies , as above suggested , a large intelligence , the college should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , or a conception worthy of an educated man . This involves intimate acquaintance with its contents , a knowledge of the origin and aim of the different books , and a rational theory of the scope and significance of the whole . In fact , the average graduate is without accurate and detailed knowledge of the contents of the Bible and has only a boy 's notion of the nature of it . He has studied it little since he left the Sunday school at fifteen . He has advanced intellectually in all directions more than in this . College students are a picked company , coming from the best families and Sunday schools in the land , yet though always familiar with the Bible , it is the one thing on which they have expended no intellectual energy , and of which their knowledge is only an impenetrable haze . A professor of English Literature in one of our largest colleges tells of flooring ten members of the junior class in succession , upon a line of Dryden in which allusion was made to the touching words of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest dealing , " th' voice is Jacob 's voice , but the hands are the hands of Esan . " Not one of them knew of the incident . This ignorance is constantly dis // played in classes of English Literature all over the land . The humiliating facts concerning students entering theological seminaries-and they are the more intelligent presumably-are too familiar to be repeated here . As to the structure and nature of the Bible , there is even less known . A lawyer of good standing , a graduate , a leading member of a Christian church , said nothing annoyed him more than to have his children come home with passages of old testament narrative and history for their Sunday school lessons . Such a remark is possible only from dense ignorance of the relations of the Old Testament to the New . Another lawyer tells how his confidence in the Bible was well nigh destroyed , when told , years after graduation , that the authors of the different books had their special aims , and that the books retain their human characteristics . To him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the writers , and the book was a fetich . For want of an intellectual view of the Bible , he came near losing his Bible altogether . These cases are typical of a large number . The fitness of things demands that there be an end of such ignorance . The community has rights worthy of respect . The Bible is held in too high esteem and society has in it too important a stake , to tolerate its disparagement by the ignorant and childish notions of men , who because they are supposed to be educated , have influence . Decency demands that intellectual men have an intellectual view of the Bible , and that college graduates have knowledge worthy of a college . Many come to feel this keenly . A prominent banker says , that when twenty-five years after graduation , he discovered what the Bible really is , he felt like denouncing his alma mater for neglect , and recommending the establishment of a chair of the English Bible , even if the Latin professorship should have to be abolished . This is only saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men a just view of the Bible than of the orations of Cicero . II . The Bible is adapted to the work of college training because it contains history of unsurpassed value . The study of history , the study of events in their causal order , especially those events that have most largely contributed to human progress , is admitted to be essential to a liberal education . By this standard the Bible justly claims a leading place . Comparison of ancient literature shows that this book contains the traditions and records of the rise and expansion of the human race in their purest and . // most rational form . After these we find the story of the most unique , and in some respects , the most remarkable nation of all ages . The Greek stands for philosophy , the Roman for law , and the Jew for religion . Is not the last entitled to equal consideration with the others ? The value of the supremacy of moral ideas in the national life is the lesson of Jewish history . Can anything be more vital to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social order of our time than intimate acquaintance with such a history ? The rise and growth , the decline and dispersion of the nation , the more influential causes , the striking experiences , the great crises , the distinguished men and their services , these offer a rich mine for inquiry and are a store of wisdom for all times . The puerile notion that this history because primitive , is infantile , should be dissipated . Bible history is especially important because it relates to the introditction of Christianity . The claims of Christianity upon men are not here under discussion , but it is here as an historic force , and how it got into the world and gained such ascendency is a question of deep intellectual interest . It can be answered only by learning how a nation was developed apparently for the purpose of introducing the new religion , and with a strange consciousness of that purpose . From this point of view , the people becomes one of intense and romantic interest , and of universal importance . Of equal interest is the process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself . All this is of commanding importance because the movement inaugurating Christianity was world-wide . the invasion of the Roman empire by the northern barbarians , the founding of colonies on the shores of this continent , were only national in their immediate scope . What shall be said of a movement which starts and goes forward with the astounding purpose , openly avowed , to extend over and change the face of the whole world ? Is any history more important for the educated man ? Further , it has claims because it is the key to all modern history . The historical student looks into the causes of things . No one can account for the world as it is without a study of this one great book . It has created Christendom out of barbarians . The nations that subjugated Rome were conquered by this book . It was a formative force of modern national life . It was the victor in the Lutheran reformation . It made its way through the // English revolution to supremacy in the Anglo-Saxon world . It is still reaching out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an educated man afford to be ignorant of it ? It is not too much to ask that an educated man shall have a just view of the nature of Christianity . Religion is a great fact in human life and history . There are many religions in the world and seine adequate knowledge of them , and of their comparative value , belongs to an intelligent man . Christianity , as the foremost of them , demands the chief attention . It can be understood only when studied in its historical development and relations . In this lies another reason for the investigation of this history . Many seem to think Christianity to be a system of dogmas , others that it is a body of precepts . In truth a Person is waited for and appears , unfolding in word and deed his character and aims , until his helpful relations to men are fully set forth in living and wonderful facts . This done a new life is in the world and men are uplifted with new hopes and aims . So Christianity is an historic power to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concrete relations and working will men see clearly its nature-see that while other religions are a law , this is a redemption . It is a weighty reason for the study of the history of the Bible , that by it alone can educated men get a clear insight into the nature of Christianity or an adequate view of its power . As a matter of training , what history , and in what direction can any history , be pursued more intellectually broadening and enriching than this ? III . The Bible has important relations to the prescribed studies of the college course in philosophy , ethics , and political science . Though it does not deal abstractly with principles , it has a philosophy of surpassing dignity , which no student can wisely ignore . At bottom , the fundamental questions of philosophy and theology are the same . The subject matter of both is God , man and the universe in their relations . According to Scripture , God is personal , spiritual , benevolent ; in relation to the world , creator , righteous and supreme ruler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God in unavoidable intimacy , accountable to him and redeemable from sin unto a blessed divine fellowship ; the universe is a realm for the beneficent activities and blessed experiences of spiritual beings . These simple and majestic answers to philosophical inquiries are brought forth in the Bible in the historical relations of living persons , in such a way as to make for // them a cogent argument . A sound philosophy finds in a studied Bible a powerful ally . The ethic8 of the Scriptures are such that the instructor in moral science can not pass them by . Where can be found such lofty moral ideals ? There are no subtle discussions but the profound inquiry into the nature of virtue seems to be satisfied in the comprehensive law , " Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and th' neighbor as thyself . " In the various applications of this principle appears the whole round of human duty . For a clear statement of duties can anything compare with the ten commandments , the book of Proverbs , and the Sermon on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the luminous interpretation put upon doctrine and precept iii the life and death of Jesus Christ . The law of love is not left to private construction but to the example of the cross , " That ye love one another as I have loved you . " In degree of disinterestedness , this goes far beyond the common understanding of the golden rule . The scope too of the love required is so widened as to include enemies as well as friends . The teachings of Jesus enforced by his life are unique , in that he puts the emphasis so weightily upon duty to God , sets up a new standard of greatness , even childlikeness of character , and exalts the virtues concerned in enduring evil , rather than those of a more forceful nature which , like bravery , easily ally themselves with personal pride . It would seem that the study of ethics required for a liberal training would be incomplete without a clear knowledge of these teachings . They are recognized more or less in most systems of college instruction , but it may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study in concrete form in the Bible itself . The science of government is one of the subjects of college instruction . In its pursuit no one can well ignore the institutions of Moses . No man ever did for his people so varied , comprehensive and lasting a work as did he . He was their great deliverer and leader , their prophet and law-giver . The commonwealth which he founded endured nearly a thousand years . Comparatively limited in territory and population , it held its own against the mighty empires in the East and South with amazing spirit and success . No nation ever evinced a more passionate patriotism or made more heroic sacrifices for their country . Moses adopted political principles of universal application , but made such adaptations to the peculiar conditions of his own people as secured // unity of spirit and fostered an intelligent interest in the public welfare . Though the form of government changed , generally the popular voice found ready expression and regard , and individual rights were thoroughly protected . Statesmen have found these institutions a most valuable study , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administer . They are best understood from their actual working in Bible history . JV . The Bible should have a place in the college curriculum because of its extraordinary quality and influence as a literary classic . Thus far we have treated the Bible as a source of knowledge . Literature proper embodies not merely knowledge but the results of it . It expresses , in forms more or less artistic , the thoughts and sentiments of the human soul in view of its knowledge and experience . It is fitted to awaken sympathy , stimulate thought , and shape conduct according to its own tenor . The study of literature is therefore one of the chief means of liberal training . Here is a reason for the study of Latin and Greek as well as for the establishment of chairs of English Literature in our colleges . The study of English Literature puts a young man into possession of the best thoughts , and into sympathy with the best tendencies of his time and so brings him into accord with his generation that he can influence it for good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceptional value here . Its compositions are written from the highest point of view They are an outlook upon the world from the Divine center . The Divine is always seen mingling in and controlling affairs . Again , the minds that write are in an exalted state of feeling and thought . " Holy men spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost . " And again the book is the joint product of the Semitic and English mind . That it is of Semitic origin gives it a peculiar claim . The few may study the Assyrian and Arabic , but the only access of most men to Semitic literature is in the Bible . And this is not unimportant . The ignoring of the Eastern nations an d their literatures , which has obtained for centuries , is amazing . Yet it can be accounted for . After those races failed to gain supremacy in Europe , they passed away . They were hated and disparaged by their victorious enemies . To flatter the pride of his own people , Herodotus gave the Assyrian group of peoples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roman alike fostered their own ignorance of the Semitic . Since the revival of learning in // the Middle Ages , universities have been dominated by Greek and Roman influence , and have transmitted Greek and Roman prejudices . Those two peoples among the ancients have monopolized the word classic . But we are discovering their injustice . Monuments and libraries have been unearthed in the Euphrates valley , and a literature is coming to light , having especially important relations to the Bible and of permanent value . Scholars are turning their eyes eastward with unanimous eagerness and expectancy . Now the study of the Bible as a Semitic book has the same liberalizing influence as does so-called classical study . An American boy inherits certain elementary notions of life , of man , of society , and government . These peculiar ideas difference him from the rest of mankind and make him an American . But as such he is not an ideal man . He needs to be broadened and to take in more of human nature . When he studies the Greek literature , he imbibes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Greek . His mind is carried beyond the limits of his American horizon , and he is liberalized . When from the Latin literature the Roman life and spirit are absorbed he is widened again . He is grown into a larger than the American type . Why now should not the Semitic literature be resorted to for a similar extension of the American boy 's intellectual territory ? The assumption that the Semitic is inferior must in all candor be denied . In all that makes literature great no collection of books in the Greek tongue can be made comparable to the Bible . We have Sir William Jones as authority for that . The Bible is the choice literature of a whole group of nations . The Semitic mind is here in all its distinctive peculiarities and power . The student finds here modes of conception and thought , of feeling and expression , more unlike his own than in the Latin and Greek , and for that reason more broadly liberalizing . He is led forth into a wholly new world . The Bible should be studied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , it should be studied because it is an English classic . Paradoxical as it may seem in view of what is above said , the Bible is the most thoroughly English book that we have . It embodies the characteristics of English life and thought more completely than any other . This for the reason that it has moulded English life and thought more than any other . // In the increasing attention given to the English literature , where can better models of any important variety of human composition be found than in the Bible . The stories which so charm the mind of childhood are worthy of study to ascertain the secret of their power . Who can tell anything better than the oldest book in the would tells the story of Joseph ? The chapter recounting the incidents of Isaac 's courtship has a fine delicacy , a graphic dignity , which the author of Miles Standish 's courtship never attained . Its power is worth searching after . There is Judah 's plea for Benjamin ; how eloquent with filial and fraternal tenderness . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journeyings , and especially the story of his tender and reverent burial of Sarah . it was Goethe who pronounced the book of Ruth unequalled among idyllic compositions . For the forensic mind where are such arguments as in the pleadings of many of the prophets and in the epistles and discourses of Paul ? There too , are the parables of our Lord , in their perfection of structure and simplicity , in their vividness and profundity altogether unapproached , illustrating the most effective methods of appealing to , and enlightening , the human mind . These may not be imitated , yet the union of profound insight with simplicity is a mighty protest against metaphysical obscurity and excessive elaboration in discourse . Contrast the conversations of Jesus with those of Socrates , the dialogue of the Phtedo with interview of our Lord with the woman of Samaria . It is not contrast but similarity one finds between Ahab and Jezebel on the one hand , and Macbeth and his Lady on the other . The mourning of Andromache over Hector is a choice passage in the Iliad ; how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jonathan . The appeal of Macduff over his murdered family is not so overwhelming in pathos as the inconsolableness of David over the fall of his worst enemy , his rebellious son Absalom . Byron has immortal lines upon the desolation of ancient Rome , " the Niobe of nations , " but for sorrowing utterance turn to the Lamentations of Jeremiah : " How doth the city sit solitary , that was full of people : How is she become a widow ! She that was great among the nations , and princess among the prov-inces , How is she become tributary ! She weepth sore in the night and her tears are on her cheeks : " // The loftiest poetry in the world is the poetry of the Bible . Its general theme is God , His character , His dealings with men in broad and universal aspects , His distribution of good and evil , and the various experience of men beneath His redemptive care . A sense of the Divine and Eternal is in all of it . Hence the deeper and grander sentiments of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ songs of Miriam and Deborah have a thrilling power not attained by the Marseillaise . Of Job , a sublime philosophical poem , Carlyle says , " there is nothing written I think , in the Bible or out of it , of equal literary merit . " The best hymns of Watts and Wesley are tame compared with the psalms of David and his successors . The passion of the prophets is too intense and high for anything but the most majestic poetry . Such are the third chapter of Habbakuk , the last half of Isaiah , many brief passages in the minor prophets and the visions of the Apocalypse of John . It is waste of time to argue that these are as worthy of study and as profitable for literary purposes as the poems of Homer and Virgil . This literature should be studied for its excellent English . The admirable article by Mr. T. W. Hunt , in the last issue of this periodical , suggests many important points , and may well be read again upon this branch of the subject . The process by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ versions to its present perfection , has gone on parallel with English history since the eighth century . Our version therefore is not the product of a single generation , but a growth that has gathered to itself the riches in forms of speech of many minds , and many generations of men . In Shakespeare the student finds the language of the dramatist 's time , and that of the Bible , is often commended as being of the same important era . But it is more , it has the English of all English time . It is conceded that to know English one should study it in the different periods of its development ; but he who studies the language of the Bible is face to face with the riches of all the periods . In times of the greatest intellectual activity , scholars have wrought upon the book and sought to make it intelligible to the common people . The facile nature of the original tongues , the elevation of the subject matter , the quality of the men , their practical purpose , have conspired to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought has compelled gravity and dignity ; the stress of the times has promoted vigor and intensity ; the scholarship of the translators // has insured purity , while their aim to reach the people has obliged clearness and simplicity . Hence , if a man would know his own tongue in its best estate , if he would learn to command it in the best manner , let him give his days and nights to the English Bible . Not only for practical advantages must the book be studied , but for a scientific understanding of the nature and growth of the language as a whole . It holds a causal relation to the speech as it is . It has been the most influential factor in bringing the language to its present state of development . Successive translations have been the most widely read productions of their time . They have accustomed the people to good English and led them to use it . They have done much to secure fixity for the better elements of the language and to resist downward tendencies . This indebtedness of the language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article already alluded to . It is suggested here to show that there can be no thorough study of the English language in college or anywhere , unless due account is made of the Bible as a causative force upon that language . What is here said of the speech may also be said of the style of the biblical writings . Different writers have differences of style , but the same causes have operated to ennoble and perfect the style of each . Professor Phelps teaches that style should have the seven qualities of purity , precision , individuality , energy , perspicuity , elegance and naturalness . In the narratives and discourses , in the arguments and poetry of the scriptures , there are few passages in which these qualities may not be found in good and generally in high degree , and incident to the theme and the ardor of the writer there is prevalent a fullness and breadth of style , a loftiness and freedom impossible in other literature . For the formation of his literary style the student can consult no book so advantageously as his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand its development , the student needs a familiar acquaintance with the Bible . Modes of English thought , its tone and feeling , prevailing conceptions of life and duty , of joy and sorrow , of good and evil , are inspired by the Bible . Biblical fact and expression are the common possession of writers and readers , of speakers and their hearers , and so easily become the ground and medium of a mutual understanding . Bible facts and stories are thus the basis of metaphors and allusions innumerable . Mr. Hunt quotes Bishop // Wordsworth as finding in Shakespeare " five hundred and fifty biblical allusions , and not one of his thirty-seven plays is without scriptural reference . " Like the painters and musical composers of immortal fame , the great poets as Milton , Dante , Tasso , Kiopstock , find their themes in Scripture , while a large part of the poetry of second yet important rank , finds its inspiration in biblical truths . Tennyson , Longfellow , Bryant and Whittier can be understood in their best moods only by the student of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the relation of the Bible to human life and literature , so potent is it over the minds of men that the study of it is needed to give basis and unity to all our study . That which is so widely educational upon the popular mind must be understood in its various hearings by the educated man , and that which is so helpful to the general mind will be found more so to the mind under special training . The effects to be expected from such study of the Scriptures in college may be inferred in some measure from single familiar instances . The wonderful speeches which Louis Kossuth delivered through this country in 1849 , in behalf of Hungary , were remarkable in nothing more than in their English . The secret of the fact was that when sent to an Austrian prison , he asked for and obtained for his companionship an English Bible and a copy of Shakespeare . The most majestic prose to be found among the productions of American statesmen is in the speeches of Daniel Webster . It is full of biblical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boyhood he committed large portions of the Bible to heart . He acquired considerable local fame for reciting them . While he was a mere lad , farmers would stop their teams on the road to listen to him by the half hour . In later life , he illustrated the justness of another lawyer 's view , who accounted for a Bible being found among his law books , saying , " I read Paul 's epistle to the Romans that I may know how to convince the understanding of men , and the Psalms of David that I may be able to move their hearts . " This article has not to do with the religious use of the Bible , but one incidental result of this study will be to allay youthful skepticism . To a young man who has enjoyed ten years of intellectual training and growth , notions of his childhood seem of little worth . If he have no other than a boy 's conception of the Bible , the book has slight hold upon his respect . Unless he be held by a vital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he thinks the Bible to be , is unworthy of the confidence of a // rational mind . Ignorance of the Bible is one occasion of doubt . Large intelligent study of it is an effective remedy for doubt . Many things , by themselves perplexing , are made clear and forceful when seen in their historic connection . One who sees the book in its parts and in its unity , who gets a proper idea of the growth arid relations of it , is compelled to accord to it profound respect and confidence . But for this end , the study of the Bible must be thorough , scholarly and exhaustive . The opinion of President Jordan , of Indiana State University , has a good basis in fact : " I do not think that the results have been valuable from such work as conducted in most of the Western colleges which have tried it ; but the causes of failure are obvious . " Ordinary methods of teaching the Bible must be superseded by such as shall make all ordinary knowledge of it seem elementary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he may be with the surface , he should be made to find every day , as much that is novel as well as important , in the Bible lesson , as in his Plato . Such work will both command his respect and enlist his interest . The value of the views presented in this article are likely to be tested by experience . Indeed , in some measure they have been not only tested but confirmed . From the foundation of Wellesley college , there have been required two lessons a week in the Bible throughout the entire course . The conception of the work has not been that of the ordinary Bible class , but the scholarly treatment of the book as literature and history . And it is safe to say that the graduates of no institution in the land are so well versed in the Bible as the graduates of Wellesley . The work has been done with increasing thoroughness and with growing satisfaction with the results . Yale and Amherst have this year introduced the Bible as an elective . The Inductive Bible Studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis of instruction , and students are finding the work exacting and richly remunerative . The public mind is doubtless favorable to the movement to put the Bible into all colleges . The approving public will do well to remember that to establish a new course of instruction requires money and men . S. H. LEE .
