SCENE I.  --  Street in the Minories ( London ) .  --  At the rising of the Curtain a great outcry as if people were pursuing a thief . Enter LAWRENCE CLISSOLD , followed by a mob , R. U. E. Clis . ( Holding a woman . ) Police ! police ! 1st Man . Let the woman go ! 2nd Man . She never took your purse ! Clis . ( Tipsy . ) Police ! police ! Enter POLICEMAN , L. 1 . E. Police . Holloa ! what 's all this about ? I ca n't allow this sort of thing in broad daylight . Clis . ( Hiccups . ) I 've been robbed ! Police . Nonsense , Mr. Clissold ; this is one of your old tricks . The last woman you charged with robbery , the magistrate discharged , as he said he could n't believe you on your oath . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let her go ! It 's all very well to say let her go ; but if I do my money goes at the same time . Mob . Let her go ! Do n't you hear the policeman ? Let her go ! Police . Now , Mr. Clissold , we ca n't have it . It 's only twelve o'clock , and you 're drunk already . Clis . Drunk ! who dares to say I 'm drunk ? This is my right arm , and this is my left . ( Raises the wrong arm each time he speaks . ) Eh ! No ! ( Correcting himself . ) This is my left and this is my right . Police . Well , as to your right and left , all I can say is , you are not acting right , and if I war n't a tender-hearted policeman , you would be left at the station-house . I ought to take you now ; but as you are occasionally a liberal gentleman , I advise you to " move on , " or I shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R. , followed by mob , severally laughing and jeering .  --  A clock strikes one . Clis . One o'clock ! Well , it ca n't strike less . Laurence Clissold , you ought to have been at your desk at ten . Unfortunate ; but it ca n't be helped ; must drown care , if I 'm to keep afloat . ( Hums an air . ) I 'll write to Raybrock , and put him off for a week or two . He 's an ugly customer , speaking both figuratively and literally ; and  --  eh ! Talk of the devil , and one of his imps appear ! Here is Raybrock ! Enter RAYBROCK , SEN. , L. U. E. Ray . How is this , Mr. Clissold , I find you in this state , and away from your office ? Clis . Why , you see , old fellow , we have been keeping it up at the club . Clubs are trumps , you know , and when I proposed your health , it was drunk , literally and figuratively , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Sings . ) Ray . Mr. Clissold , Benjamin Franklin says that the sound of a hammer heard at five in the morning in a tradesman 's house makes his creditor easy for the rest of the day ; but what would that great American moralist say to a debtor of 500 who is found intoxicated long before noon ? Clis . What would he say ? Why , he 'd say , most probably , " All right , old fellow ? " Ray . But I tell you it 's not all right , young fellow . You owe me 500 ; the warrant of attorney is long over-due , and I am now on my way to Messrs . Dingworth and Co. , to ask what is the exact amount of your yearly salary . Clis . Eh ! What , old fellow ? You do n't mean to say you are going to let the governors know of  --  Ray . Most decidedly ; and not only them , but all the world ! Clis . Lookee here , old fellow , I speculated on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To speculate with another man 's money amounts to nothing less than robbery ! Clis . Robbery ! Rather a harsh word , old fellow . Ray . Less familiarity , if you please , Mr. Clissold . Now , understand me . You have not yet paid the first instalment ; therefore , I see the principal is in danger . Clis . Both literally and figuratively , I presume ? Ray . Yes ; I shall not only enter up judgment ; but take you in execution for the whole amount ! Clis . ( Staggered , and gradually sobering . ) Eh ! What ? You do n't intend to  --  Ray . By Jupiter , I do ! Unless you raise me the money to-night , you shall cool your heels behind four walls of a prison to-morrow . ( Crossing , and going R. ) Clis . Stay ! You must give me more time ? Can you wait a week for the money ? Ray . No ! Clis . Twenty-four hours ? Ray . Not twenty-four seconds ! If the money is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consequences of your neglect ! Exit , R. 1 E. ( Clissold is left alone on the stage , and partially sobered and meditating . ) Clis . My hands are cold ; my head giddy ; my sight still dim ; but I have so far mastered the effects of the drink within me , to calculate clearly my position . Raybrock wants the 500 , and I can not lay my hand on five hundred shillings ! Am I ruined ? No , a thought strikes me ! ( Music . ) ' T is a bright one , and shall be embraced . ( Pause . ) The money must be paid . Ha ! ha ! It shall be paid ! Hurries out , L. 1 . E. SCENE II .  --  The office of Dingworth and Company , America Square .  --  TREGARTHEN discovered at desk counting notes , R. C.  --  Scene arranged with desks , &c.,; for the other clerks . Treg . Two , three , four thousand . Now having duly entered these in the ledger , they will be all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CLISSOLD , R. So you have come at last . What has detained you ? Clis . Oh ! a mere nothing  --  a trifle  --  but such as it is , it has left me in no mood to be catechised ! Treg . Such being the case , we will drop the matter now , and I hope we shall not have to refer to it in the  --  future . Here take this money to the bankers ( he gives notes ) , and return as quickly as possible , for it is drawing near the time for balancing the books for the day . Clis . All right , my particular friend ; but before I go , I beg leave to remind that an outsider has won the Leger , and that you are indebted to me  --  a  --  new hat  --  which I am willing to forego for a beefsteak dinner , and a bottle of Black Strap . Treg . Ah , Lawrence ! drink is your besetting sin , and I am afraid it will be your ruin . The hat you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As far as I can I will not encourage your intemperate habits , and if I had the power , as I have the will , I would wean you from then altogether . Clis . If you succeeded I should certainly be compelled to make a hole in the water  --  and figuratively and literally speaking , die , as I have lived , in liquor . But apropos of the bank  --  it is about closing time , you say  --  you ca n't ever accuse me of loitering in money affairs . ( Going , and then returning . ) By the way , old sobersides , I 'll lay you twenty to one against Busbottle for the Derby ! Treg . No , no ! Clis . Forty to one against Beelzebub ! Treg . No , I tell you ! Clis . You surely wo n't refuse sixty to one against Brimstone . Treg . Most certainly , I do . Clis . Then take eighty to one for the grey mare , always said to be the better horse . Treg . Once for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't persuade you to be on , I presume that , under the circumstances , I had better , speaking literally and figuratively , be off . Exit , R. Treg . Poor Clissold is certainly addicted to two of the worst vices of the age . Betting is the corner stone of the temple of roguery , and drinking but too often builds a superstructure of fraud and low chicanery . Enter TOM PETTIFER , R. Tom . Anyone in ? Treg . Yes , sir ! May I ask your business ? Tom . My business is more of a pleasure . I am given to understand the firm is about to refurnish their office ; but before they are on with the new , they wish to get rid of the old . Treg . Ah ! Mr. Dingworth did talk about something of the sort . There 's the old desk which is now but of little service , cost originally  --  ( Points to a desk at back , L. ) Tom . ( Interrupting . ) Oh ! my dear sir , buying and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which I am fully aware . Tom . Singly , the bid I am about to name  --  you would not perhaps like to make  --  but throw in a few other articles , and I may tempt you ? Treg . Well , sir ; you can proceed ! Tom . I do n't by any means intend to be inquisitive , but I presume from our present negotiation that your firm experiences a difficulty in raising the wind  --  Ah ! by the bye , talking of the wind , could you contrive among the articles I shall purchase to let me have a pair of bellows , if you could throw them in with a knife board , and a candle box , I 'm your man ! Treg . I suppose , sir , you have considerable commercial transactions in this way ? Tom . Yes , and so had my grandmother , Mrs. P. of Wapping . She was never known to purchase a single lot by itself in her life  --  yet stay , I think she did once . Treg . Indeed ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of Smith on it . When she brought it home . " Grandmother , " I said , " of what use can this be ? " " Use ! Why you are asking a fool 's question , " she replied . " Who knows but when I 'm a widow I may marry a man of the name of Smith , and then it will be a heirloom to the third and fourth generation . Treg . But , really , my good fellow , I can not afford to spend any more time in listening to you ; therefore , we must of a necessity close our discourse . The price of the desk is one pound , and  --  Tom . Have you an eight-day clock ? Treg . I have not . Tom . Nor a washhand stand ? Treg . No ! Tom . An easy chair ? Treg . ( Getting impatient . ) No ! No ! Tom . A cradle , or any domestic article I can take away at the same time ? Treg . There is only that desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ require " yes or no . " Tom ( Examining it . ) Ah ! I see it requires a great deal of repairing  --  will ten shillings do ? Treg . We are not the men here to ask double , and then take half ! Tom . It 's in a rather ricketty state , say fifteen bob ? Treg . You are wasting my time . Tom . Seventeen and six ? Treg . Not a penny under the sum I have named ! Tom . Well , if you are so hard , here 's the money . ( Gives it . ) I shall return in half an hour , and take the desk away . Tom goes out , R. Treg . The sooner the better . Hang the fellow ! I thought I should never have got rid of him ; but having done so , I must make up for lost time at my books . ( Goes to his desk . ) Tom . ( Returning . ) I beg pardon , if I am intruding ; but I want to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have among the lumber you are going to dispose of , such a thing as an old four-poster , I can spring another quid for it . Treg . ( Busy at his desk . ) This is beyond endurance . Sirrah ! I have neither bed nor bedding here , and if you require such , I must refer you to the upholsterer down the street  --  be off ! Tom . ( To himself . ) Humph ! Rather sulky . Wants to get rid of me . Well , I am not the man to neglect politeness . A well-bred dog always leaves the room when he observes signs of kicking him out ! Exit . Treg . ( At desk , over books. ) 0 and carry 8 , 8 and 16 , 24-2480 . Yes , right  --  balanced to a fraction . Now the firm can come and examine the accounts as soon as they please . By the way , I must question the secretary on the point of audit . Goes out , L. Clis . ( Re-entering , R. ) No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been an anxious day ; but one more little effort , and all will be right . ( Going to desk . ) So , here is the ledger . I 'll see if Tregarthen has struck his balance . Conder , 400 ; Jackson , 50 ; Kirk and Cross  --  Eh ! why , this is wrong according to my bank-book . I 'll correct the error for him . ( Takes out knife and begins to scratch the paper . ) Zounds ! my knife has perforated the leaf . I must tear it out , and imitate as near as possible his writing , or he and I will both get into hot water . ( Tears leaf out of book and writes . ) Conder , Jackson , Kirk and Cross  --  that 's it . This leaf I have torn out had better not be seen  --  I 'll destroy it at once ; the fireplace is conveniently at hand . Enter TOM , hastily . Ha ! an interruption ; I must hide it for the present . ( Drops paper through a crevice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps when you have done with that little piece of furniture , you will hand it over to me ? Clis . Hand it over to you ! What do you mean ? Tom . Why , I mean that it is now my property , and as the law allows every man to do as he likes with his own , I intend to place it in the van I have brought with me , and take it at once to my depository . Clis . Hang you and your depository . If you have purchased the desk , it must not be removed till after dark . It 's against office rules to admit strangers  --  and so get out of the counting-house at once . Tom . Certainly , to oblige such a polite gentleman as you are ; but touching this desk  --  after dark  --  did you say after dark ? Clis . Yes , and after dark I mean ! Tom . But you will please to remember that the police are mighty particular , and I shall have to show the landlord 's receipt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Clis . You see that door ? Tom . What , the green baize ' un , with brass nails ? Clis . Precisely ! Tom . Well , what do you want for it ? Clis . If you do n't make your exit through it at once , by the living jingo you shall make one through the window ! Tom . Well , as I have not the slightest desire for an rial trip , and I 'll take one on terra firma after dark ; I 'll come round at night for the desk , and in the mean time you can , if you like , look up a few old chairs , or a saucepan or two ; you might make some " tin " of ' em ! Ha , ha ! not so bad ! Humph ! he do n't see the joke . What a dreadful thing hignorance is . Exit , R. Clis . That fellow being gone , I think I ca n't do better than go myself . There 'll be a little sensation here , I suspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dingworth and Company to settle accounts with my fellow clerk in the best way they can . Exit , R. Enter DINGWORTH and TREGARTHEN , L. Ding . You have your book , you say , Mr. Tregarthen ? Treg . Yes , there it is . ( Gives book . ) And the account is right to a fraction ! ( Dingworth takes book and sits at table , C. ) Ding . Of that I can entertain no doubt , but as I am to-day taking upon myself the duty of auditor , I must for mere form sake run over the items . ( Reads . ) " Conder , Jackson , Kirk and Cross . " Here 's no mention of Davis , 500 . Do you carry that over till to-morrow , Mr. Tregarthen ? Treg . No , sir ! All the remittances received by this morning 's post are duly entered . Ding . This is your entry , is it not , Mr. Tregarthen ? Treg . Yes , sir ; and when Mr. Clissold returns you will find each sum tally with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can send Mr. Clissold to me . I have an appointment for him which will admit of no delay . ( Tregarthen goes out , and Dingworth again looks over ledger . ) Let me see , I have noted Conder , Jackson , Kirk and Cross , Davis  --  Yes , there I stopped . There can be no mistake , and yet I see no entry of the amount . ( While Dingworth is examining the ledger , a CLERK enters , R. ) Clerk . Mr. Raybrock , senior , wishes to see you , sir . Ding . Show him in , Williams , and let me have a light , that I may see clearly what I am about . Clerk . In the interim , sir , will you sign your name to this packet for to-morrow 's post ? Ding . Ah ! well thought of ; for to-morrow , at daybreak , Clissold must be off ! ( Clerk goes out , and Raybrock enters , R. , as Dingworth is signing paper . ) Walk in  --  walk in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir , to  --  But you 're perhaps busy  --  I may be intruding ? Ding . Not at all  --  not at all ! As you know , I am ever ready to show every attention to business . Ray . In a word , then , my son  --  have you heard of him ? Ding . Oh , yes ! a very honest young man , and bears a good character on board the Peruvian . I admit it , and so do all who have dealings with him . Ray . I have no doubt , Mr. Dingworth , you will laugh at me for what you may consider my folly , but I have a full belief in presentiments . The motive of my visit here is to know if you have received unfavourable intelligence of the vessel ? I can not account for the circumstance , but for the last few days I have been haunted by an idea that I shall never see my son again . I know you will excuse the liberty I have taken when I tell you I wished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , certainly ! I am happy to state that our letters contain reports propitious , and that therefore your apprehensions are unfounded , I will show you the last received . ( They retire up , L.  --  CLISSOLD has entered , R. , in time to hear the last sentence , and steps back so as not to be observed . ) Clis . ( Aside . ) Old Raybrock here ! Has he come to expose me ? If he has , I fancy I shall be even with him . The storm had better blow over , and until I get the lecture I expect I shall from Dingworth , it will be as well to fortify my nerves with a glass of brandy and a cigar . Exit , R. Ding . ( Coming down , L. C. ) Good day , Mr. Raybrock . You see , by the letter , you have no cause for uneasiness . I shall be glad to see you any time you come this way . Good day ! Ray . Good day , sir ! Exit , R. Ding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , come buzzing back into our minds as often as we repulse them , and with such thoughts as these I have now to deal . Tregarthen 's omission in the books is , to say the least of it , singular . Can he be dishonest ? He has been entrusted with large sums before now  --  but I must not be too hasty in drawing conclusions . Let me go through the figures again , I may perhaps have passed over any item . Here , Williams , it 's getting quite dark , bring me the light I ordered ; do you think I 've the eyes of a cat ? ( Seats himself at table again as the scene closes in . ) SCENE III .  --  A Street near the Minories . Kitty . ( Entering , R. ) . I have at last eluded my pursuer . I was compelled to seek refuge in a shop to avoid him . He has followed for some days , go where I would . I would have told father , but was afraid to  --  Heavens ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by CLISSOLD , who enters , R. ) Clis . So , I have you , my sweet girl ! Why do you endeavour to shun me ? Kitty . Your attentions , sir , are unpleasant . My conduct towards you must have sufficiently expressed my dislike , and I must again request that you leave me ! Clis . My dear , I am a gentleman , and  --  Kitty . Your actions are not those of one , or you would permit me to pass on unmolested . Clis . You must first permit me to explain my intentions . Though I appear so terrible to you , you have fascinated me , that fascination has begot respect , and  --  Kitty . The reason , I presume , that you insult me ? Clis . You may scold me , my charming creature , as much as you like , but I have , whatever my qualifications may be , sufficient discernment to admire a pretty face when I see one . I do n't think you can refuse me a kiss  --  at any rate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hand , sir ! Clis . Nay , as the song says , " One kind kiss before we part . " Zounds , my precious ! you are really very strong . Kitty . Desist , sir , or I will call for help ! Clis . You will call in vain ; for , fortunately , there is no one by to prevent my taking one chaste salute . ( Endeavours to kiss Kitty . TOM PETTIFER , L. , enters , carrying the desk , which he lets down , and comes between Clissold and the girl . ) Tom . You 're mistaken ; I 'm here to defend injured innocence , as the man at the play says ; and , what 's more , if necessary , ready to give you a good licking into the bargain ! Kitty . Oh , sir ! how can I thank you ? Tom . Do n't be alarmed , young woman ; go on , he sha' n't follow you ! Clis . Indeed ! You wo n't stop me ! Tom . Wo n't I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be sure ; but what right has one gentleman to interfere with the amusement of another ? Are not the streets of London free to all ? Tom . What right have you to insult that poor girl ? Clis . I have yet to understand that she has been insulted . Besides , I expect she is anything but what she seems . Tom . Then , as a woman , she should be protected , even by those who are supposed to set an example to their humbler brethren . If you consider yourself a pattern of good conduct , old fellow , let me tell you I consider you a spurious specimen of the article ! Clis . Ah ! I 've a great mind to  --  Tom . No , you have n't ; because you 've no mind at all , to act as you have done ! Clis . Dog ! ( He struggles with Tom , while Kitty commences calling " Police , " and CAPTAIN JORGAN enters , R. ) Jor . Waal , I dew like to see that . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gal , he is n't left a whole bone in his skin . ( To Tom . ) Go it , my young Britisher . I love to see good mettle  --  aye , if it 's only a cent . Kitty . I was going on an errand for my father , when this person molested me , and but for the timely arrival of yourself and your companion , should have suffered violence at his hands . Jor . Well , I somehow calculate , by the drubbing the crittur has got , that he 'll look twice afore he tries his hand at annoying one of the feminine gender again . You go your ways ; he sha' n't make tracks , or , if you 're afeared , I guess I 'll see you home . Kitty . Oh , thank you ! there is no occasion for that . I feel I am in safety now , and , if you will permit me , I will once more proceed on my way . Exit , L. Jor . ( To Clis . ) Waal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've evidently got the worst o n't . Perhaps it may kinder teach you better manners in future . Clis . Curse you , and your manners ! That fellow 's fist has so disfigured my countenance that it will cost me a fortune for sticking-plaster and eau de Cologne . If I were a Commissioner of Police , I 'd commit you both for harbouring that trollop . Tom . You inflated gas-pipe , what do you mean ? Call that unoffending girl that name again , and I 'll turn you into the ghost of a monkey ! Clis . Monkey ! monkey ! That 's a libel , and a libel 's actionable ! I 've a witness of the fact . My good fellow , you heard what he called me ! Jor . Not a syll-able . Guess I 'm gone deaf ! Clis . Oh , I see , an accomplice ! Better go , before I have the Yankee on me too . To be thus grossly insulted by a man who has probably not a shilling in his pocket is too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friend . ( As he is going out , L. , he falls over the desk .  --  The others laugh . ) Jor . Waal , I should kinder like to have that coon at sea with me for a week . Guess he 'd get more kicks than halfpence from the purser . Tom . ( To himself . ) That man spoke the truth . I 'm without a shilling . What shall I do ?  --  carry the desk home to my brothers , or take it to my domicile , where I 'm fearfully in debt ? That 's the question , as the man in the play says . Jor . And a pretty considerable question for a plucky crittur like you to ask yourself . If you 're running into debt , run out of it as fast as you can , and go to sea . Tom . Go to sea ? Egad , there 's good living there ! Lobscouse , sea-pipe , salt broth  --  eh ? I never thought of that ! Jor . If you come on board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you never saw before in all your mortal days . What do you think of peasoup ? Tom . If I have a weakness , it is for making that popular preparation . Ingredients  --  pork , peas , onions , mint  --  Jor . All very well on land , but you get none of that sort on board  --  do n't make peasoup in that fashion , stranger . I say , you seem to have half a mind for the trade ? Tom . Half a mind ! There 's an inconceivable bellyful idea in the calling ! Jor . Jerusalem ! I believe you . What do you say to a voyage ?  --  it 's only five months . Tom . Take five months from fourscore years , as I intend to live as long  --  there 's time enough to make a fortune . I 'll go . Jor . I think we can turn you to account . Tom . That you can . Mind you , I do n't brag of my cooking , but for making soup I 'd challenge  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leg-of-beef shops in London , Birch 's included . Jor . All right , then , old hoss  --  heave ahead . Tom . Yes , a bullock 's  --  ha , ha ! They go out , both laughing , R. SCENE IV .  --  A Parlour in Tregarthen 's House .  --  It is neatly  --  furnished  --  cupboard , R.  --  fireplace , L.  --  door and window , C.  --  clock on mantelpiece . KITTY runs on , D. C.  --  takes off bonnet and shawl , and places them on a chair . Kitty . I have escaped  --  but so terrified am I that I can scarcely support myself . Luckily it is getting so dark , or he might have seen me enter this house  --  perhaps have followed me , and had the impudence to knock . If this man continue to annoy me every time we meet , I shall soon be afraid to stir out . What shall I do  --  tell my father ? No ; it were better not . He is hasty , and his passion might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clock . ) By the bye , how late father is , to be sure . I wonder what detains him . Well , for the once it 's as well , for I 've not got the tea ready ; I must set about it at once . Dear me , the fire is almost out . ( Prepares tea , and busies herself . ) If the tea was n't made , how surprised he would be  --  bless me , the kettle boils already . Let me see  --  milk , sugar , butter  --  yes , here they all are . I wonder if the room smells of the lavender I bought of a poor woman at the door . Now for father 's round of toast . Enter TREGARTHEN , C. D. Oh , father , here you are ; you let yourself in with the latch-key , I suppose ? Treg . Yes , Kitty , I did . Kitty . How late you are , but I can guess the cause . Oh , what have you got in that paper  --  anything for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Kitty . I know it 's something for me . Treg . And why do you know it 's something for you ? Is everything in the world to be for you , good for nothing ? ( Patting her on the head . ) Kitty . Good for nothing ! You may well say that  --  just look at the things I 've ironed since this morning . ( Seizes the packet . ) Treg . Woman 's curiosity ! Just like her poor dear mother . ( Wiping away a tear . ) Kitty . Well , I want to see what it is . Dear me , what a tight string  --  I ca n't break it . Never mind , more ways of killing a dog than hanging him ; I 'll tear a hole  --  silk , as I 'm alive ! Aha ! now tell me , is n't it for me , father ? Treg . How do you know it is n't a sample of goods sent to Dingworth and Co. , America-square , London ? Kitty . Not a very likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treg . There now , go , for a silly , provoking , tiresome , good girl , as you are . You 're my only comfort now , Kitty ; though , in the present instance , you are nothing but a busy little bee , made to live upon honey . Kitty . Yes , and it takes a good deal of honey to keep me ; besides that , I want to be praised , flattered , and loved . It is n't enough , father , to have you love me . I want to hear others tell me so  --  yes , and every day , every hour , every minute , I want also to be praised for everything I do . Treg . Particularly when you tear holes in packages ! Kitty . Ah , to be sure  --  concerning the package , and my new silk dress within . You see , I could n't break the string  --  why do n't you cut it ? Treg . ( Cutting the string of the package . ) There  --  what do you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China , as a present to me , when he came home last week . Kitty . Oh , how lovely ! is n't it a beauty ? How kind , how good  --  dear , dear , how happy I am  --  how happy we are , ai n't we , father ? Treg . ( With a sigh . ) Yes . Kitty . I was up early this morning , on purpose to get all my washing done by the time you came home to-night . Ah ! you do n't know what a tea I 've got ready . ( Taking cake , &c.,; out of basket . ) You ca n't tell what I am doing all this for ? Treg . ( Appearing thoughtful . ) No , Kitty  --  no ! Kitty . Come , guess , and do n't be so thoughtful . Well , father , it 's your birthday ! Now , you thought , because I ca n't keep the day of the month , that I did n't know anything about it ; but I did , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for four weeks , right under where I keep my mangling account , so as to be sure of it ; and I 've been busy about it ever since eight o'clock this morning  --  and now , here , the water is boiling . ( Pouring water into teapot . ) Oh , good gracious ! I 've scalded myself . Who knew it was so hot ? Treg . Silly girl ! Come , let me look to it  --  and I 'll make the tea . Kitty . No , father ; I 'm going to do everything myself  --  I 'm not hurt much . I do think you and I are the most fortunate of people . Everything goes just as we want it to go  --  does n't it now , father ? ( Treg. sighs . ) Why , what 's the matter with you ? What 's going wrong ? What , do n't you rejoice as I do , father ? ( Sits on a stool and leans her head on his knee . ) Come , now , something 's gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  you do n't seem happy  --  tell me the reason why ? Treg . I 've been much annoyed to-day , Kitty  --  but , psha ! do n't let me bring the business of the office home with me ! Kitty . Oh , father  --  since poor mother 's death , you let any little mishap trouble you ! If you give way to them , your health will give way too ! Now , do try , if it 's only for my sake , to be more cheerful ! Treg . Yes , I will , Kitty . Truly , as you say , the loss of your dear mother leads me to forget the remaining tie which I ought most to estimate . I 'll endeavour to be firmer  --  but a husband 's feelings will have sway . ( Sighs . ) Kitty . A sigh again ! I 'll go to the piano and sing , that always puts you in better spirits . Treg . Presently , Kitty , presently . I have forgotten a letter which I have to write for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shall I take it for you , father ? Treg . No , Kitty , I will post it myself  --  besides , a walk may dispel this , I almost fear , settled melancholy . Exit , D. C. Kitty . ' T is very strange that father should seem so ill at ease lately . There are times too , when the glare of his eyes really frightens me  --  I am afraid he has some trouble on his mind ; if so , I think it is very unkind that he do n't take me into his confidence . ( A knock . ) Eh ! a rat-tat  --  who can it be ? ( About to go out when she meets CLISSOLD entering at the door , C. ) Clis . Beg pardon , but as I found your door on the latch , I took the liberty of walking in . Eh ! yes ! I knew I was right . Kitty . What do you want here , sir ? I must request you to leave the house instantly . Clis . What , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much patience , hope , and perseverance , to say nothing of knocking for you at every door in this street . Kitty . Sir , how dare you enter a private dwelling ? In the street , a poor girl ca n't prevent your staring at her  --  but in this place I am at home . This abode is my father 's , and I am at liberty to tell you that you ought to be ashamed of yourself . Clis . Ashamed of myself for thinking you charming ? Kitty . Reserve your compliments , sir , for those who value them . They are lost upon me ! I neither know , nor wish to know you ! Clis . ( Placing his arms around her waist . ) This coyness adds to your other attractions  --  pouting becomes your lips amazingly , and anger adds fire to your sparkling eyes . By Jove ! you are irresistable !  --  I must have one kiss ! Kitty . My father shall resent this affront ! Clis . Your father ! By the bye , I should like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Attempts to seize Kitty when Tregarthen confronts him . ) Tregarthen ! Clis . ( Starts . ) Tregarthen ! Treg . Mr. Clissold here ? What do you mean by this insult ? Clis . No insult , I assure you ! If you wish to know why I called here ? you shall ! It was love ! Nay , do n't laugh  --  truth ! I swear ! Could I gaze on that lovely form unmoved ? no , I should have an adamantine heart to do so . I met the possessor of this beauty  --  your daughter , I believe  --  I told her of my passion  --  and  --  Treg . You have quite mistaken your party Mr. Clissold , therefore you will be good enough to leave the house , nor enter it again . Clis . Eh ! literally and figuratively a kick out , I presume . Surely , old boy , you 're not going to serve a fellow clerk in this way , after finding you out , or rather at home ? Ah ! by the bye , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason . Frightened of your little treasure that you keep moping here  --  but bless me  --  you have forgotten to introduce me ! Treg . You will see the necessity of my speaking plainly , at once , Mr. Clissold . In a word , I have no desire to introduce my daughter to one whom I consider but the fair type of a prodigal and libertine  --  you understand me ? Clis . Oh , perfectly ! but I must be allowed to observe that your sarcasm falls short of its mark . I mean your daughter well ! Treg . No doubt ; but meaning well and doing well , are sometimes two different things ! When a man once flies to strong waters and dissipation , he forfeits all respect from society at large . You are not free from such vices  --  and I feel that to listen to any proposal that might come from you would assuredly hasten my steps and my child 's to the churchyard . Clis . I see you are speaking figuratively and literally . Have you done ? Treg . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that having now found that Kitty has a protector , you will , as her previous persecutor , be probably more guarded in your conduct  --  and not only to her , but to others  --  lest you receive that chastisement which you have deserved , but fortunately hitherto have escaped ! Clis . ( To himself . ) I am decidedly getting the worst of this  --  I must go to Dingworth and Co. , at once  --  I will be even with my fellow clerk here . I have persevered for a whole week , and to no purpose , it appears . Perhaps the brandy I have taken may have fired my blood , and carried me a little too far  --  I must now strive to pluck out the sting of my defeat ! He goes out door , C. Kitty . And so this Mr. Clissold is what we call a gentleman in this great city ? Treg . You must n't always judge goods by their sample , Kitty ! We have worthy and wise men , thank goodness , in our metropolis  --  men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this world are the destitute better cared for than in London . I 've long wished , Kitty , to communicate my thoughts to you , and this late circumstance has determined me . You must know that for some time doubts and fears have perplexed my employers concerning their property , and their suspicions are now  --  I am at a loss to imagine why  --  directed at me ! Kitty . Suspicions , you said , father ! and pray , of what ? Treg . Listen ! This letter I have just written is a resignation on my part , as I have no desire to remain with those who , forgetting a long period of service , now for the first time choose to mistrust me . Kitty . Father , you pain me to hear you talk in this vague way . I am sure the firm can never intend to blur the good name you have laboured for . Think no more of the matter ; depend upon it it 's but a passing cloud on your spirits , and it will soon blow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Kitty  --  my mind 's made up . I shall settle in Devonshire , your dear mother 's native place ; I have no fear of getting employment there . The little money  --  the savings of years  --  I have drawn out of the bank . It will enable us to live comfortably till I shall procure a situation . Ah ! there is a tear in your eye , Kitty . Do n't cry , girl ; you will unnerve me . Be resolute , under a firm conviction that everything happens for the best . Kitty . Yes , dear father ; we are taught to believe so . ( A knock . ) Treg . A knock ! See who it is , Kitty . ( She goes out . ) It 's very strange ; I am usually not disturbed at a knock at the door . But I ca n't help thinking this one is the harbinger of bad news . Zounds ! what am I talking about ? Nonsense ! The occurrence of the last half-hour is almost making a coward of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and others . Door C. Mr. Dingworth here at this unexpected hour ! To what am I indebted for this visit ? Ding . This assurance surpasses belief . Your own conscience , I should think , will inform you why I am come to your residence . Sirrah ! from my recent information , I have strong reasons to believe you are implicated in a serious fraud on our house ! Treg . What do you mean , Mr. Dingworth ? Do you dare accuse me  --  Ding . Stay , sir ; you need not speak quite so loud or frown with such a grace in a matter like this . Proof is preferable to words and looks . Cast your eye over this entry , which was made , as you say it was , and tell me how came the figures to differ with your assertion ? Treg . Under the present circumstances , Mr. Dingworth , it is impossible for me to answer the question ; but this I can swear , that I neither touched nor even saw the ledger from the time I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a court of justice . Kitty . Oh , sir ! you can not mean this ? Ding . He has robbed me ! Kitty . I 'd not believe it , though fifty witnesses appeared to prove the charge . Father , deny this falsehood ! Treg . I can not , girl ; I am ensnared . ( In his excitement he lets fall a notebook containing some notes and gold . ) Ding . Ah ! notes and gold to a large amount ! How came a clerk , upon a salary like yours , to have so large a sum upon you ? Treg . I will answer the magistrate , Mr. Dingworth , and not the accuser . Ding . Call in the police ! ( They enter . ) Arrest that man on the charge of forgery ! ( Music till drop . Kitty screams , and falls heavily and senseless on the ground . Tregarthen rushes to raise her , but the police interpose . ) Clis . On with the handcuffs , or he 'll give you trouble . Ha , ha ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Picture , and the drop falls rapidly . ) END OF ACT I. ACT II . SCENE I.  --  The Deck of the Peruvian . Ocean , and distant view of the shore of Truxillo , on the Western Coast of South America . The drop rises to music , and discovers CAPTAIN MORTON , FIRST MATE , and some Sailors employed in coiling ropes . Mor . Is the anchor up , and all ready to go when Clissold and the watering party return on board ? Mate . All ready , sir . Mor . Take the glass , and look if you can make them out . By Jove ! I wo n't wait for Raybrock if once I get the supercargo on board . Mate . Aye , aye , sir ! There 's a fine breeze , and we shall round the Horn in no time . Mor . By the bye , what did the surgeon say about our second mate ? Mate . Mr. Raybrock is reported as cured and able-bodied . When last spoken to , was ordered to sheer off on board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ malignant . Mr. Hugh Raybrock must consider himself lucky to get well so soon . Mate . The supercargo and the watering party pulling off , sir . Mor . Get the ship , then , under sail the moment they are on board . Mate . Aye , aye , sir ! Hugh . ( Below , at side of vessel . ) Throw out a rope there , men . ( This is done amidst noise and shouting . ) Mate . Here is the supercargo , sir . Mor . Mr. Lawrence Clissold , I suppose , at last . ( Music .  --  Morton looks over a paper .  --  HUGH RAYBROCK ascends from side , followed by LAWRENCE CLISSOLD , and sailors with water-casks . The panorama begins to move . ) Mor . Eh ! Mr. Raybrock recovered ? Glad to see you . Look rather like the capital of China ! Hugh . Indeed , Captain Morton ! how so ? Mor . Why you look Pekin , to be sure ! ( The crew laugh . ) Hush , there , men ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peruvian ! Lately employed as foreign agent to the firm of Dingworth and Co. , America Square , London , I believe ? Clis . Right , sir ! Voyage out most prosperous . Hope to have the same back . Mor . Not knowing , ca n't say . The fever has made rare havoc this season , I believe , along the coast , Mr. Raybrock . Our second mate almost fell a victim to it . Clis . Mr. Raybrock ! Is he at all related to Hugh Raybrock , of Devonshire ? Mor . Again I must answer , not knowing , ca n't say ; but I can state , with assurance , no better seaman can be found ! Clis . Are you sure you do not overrate his services , Captain Morton ? Mor . Not at all . Truth , veritable truth ! But here is the party in question ; let him speak for himself . ( Hugh is advancing R. Captain retires L. ) Clis . ( Crossing to Hugh . ) Good morning , sir ; I 've been asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hear . Are you any relation to the late Hugh Raybrock , of Barnstaple , Devonshire ? Hugh . Rather a near relation . I am the late Hugh Raybrock 's eldest son . Clis . Your father ended by failing in business , did n't he ? Hugh . ( Sharply . ) Who told you he failed ? Clis . ( Smiling . ) Oh , I heard it ! Hugh . Whoever told you my father failed in business , told you a lie . His business fell off towards the last years of his life ; I do n't deny it . But every creditor he had was paid at his death , without so much as touching the provision left for his widow and children . Please to mention that next time you hear it reported that my father failed in business . Clis . ( Grinning . ) I am afraid , young man , that you are losing your temper ? Hugh . I tell you what  --  I do n't like your laughing to yourself when I ask you to do justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more , I did n't like the way you mentioned that report of his failing in business just now . You looked as if you hoped it was true ! Clis . Perhaps I did . ( Coolly . ) Shall I tell you why ? When I was a young man I was unlucky enough to owe your father some money . Hugh . He was a merciless creditor , I suppose ? Clis . Yes ; and he threatened me with a prison if the debt remained unpaid on the day when it was due . I have never forgotten that circumstance , and I should certainly not be sorry if your father 's creditors had given him a lesson in forbearance , by treating him as harshly as he once treated me . Hugh . My father had a right to ask for his own , if you owed him the money , and did n't pay it . Clis . ( Very coolly . ) I never told you I did n't pay it . Hugh . Well , if you did pay it , then you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause of complaint now . My father wronged nobody , and I wo n't believe he ever wronged you . He was a just man in all his dealings , and whoever tells me to the contrary  --  Clis . ( Backing towards cabin . ) That will do . You seem to have not quite got over your fever yet . I 'll leave you to air yourself in the seabreezes , Mr. Second Mate ; and I 'll receive your excuses when you are cool enough to make them . Hugh . It is a son 's duty to defend his father 's character ; and cool or hot , I 'll leave the ship sooner than ask your pardon for doing my duty . Clis . You will leave the ship . You will leave at the next port if I have any interest with the captain . ( Retires . ) Hugh . So , Mr. Lawrence Clissold , this is a strange way of scraping acquaintance on the first day we meet together . If ever I get home safe , I 'll go to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and letters for us , and see what information they may give on this subject . I , myself , have never heard the supercargo 's name mentioned at home ; but father was always close about business matters , and mother never troubled him with idle questions about his affairs . But still it 's likely enough that he and Clissold might have been concerned in money matters in years past , and that the supercargo might have tried to cheat him , and failed . In fact , I rather hope it may prove to be so , for the swab has provoked me past all endurance , and I fancy he hates me as heartily as I hate him . Exit R.  --  Lights gradually down . Thunder . Mor . ( Coming forward . ) Better go down to your cabin , sir . I hear a roll of thunder . We shall have a storm . Clis . A storm , Captain Morton ! ( Music . ) Mor . Aye , a bit of a squall ; and not long first , I reckon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your top-gallant sail there ! ( Two boys go up . The bo'sen 's cry of " The mark four ! " creates alarm . The following words are spoken with effect by the characters during the raging of the tempest . ) Mor . All hands to reef topsails ! Crew . Hoy , hoy , sir ! Mor . Stow the mainsail ! Crew . Aye , aye , sir ! Mor . Haul in the sheet ! 1st Mate . It 's gone , Captain Morton ! Mor . Then the men must brail up the driver ! ( The storm increases . Lightning and thunder ; the sea rolling mountains high . The men work the pumps , some raise sails , &c.; Passengers enter and run about in great excitement . Hugh and Moron . Music . Screams . Men bawling . Some of the female passengers make an appeal to Hugh , who gently leads them to the cabin . ) Hugh . ( Through trumpet . ) Try the bearings ! Mor . No , my lads ; this is no time to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  much of my life has been passed on it . If I know anything of seamanship , we 're driving right ahead for the Reef of Truxillo . I can see the rock from the quarter-deck as clear as I can see you . We must trust to the light sails . With the aid of this ebb tide we may be able to keep from the rocks ; if not , we 're lost  --  there 's no hope ! Hugh . No hope ? Do n't say so , Captain Morton . While life exists there 's always hope . Remember , messmates , the awful responsibility we hold  --  the lives of the passengers are in our keeping . Think of home . Let the images of your wives and children inspire fortitude and courage . ( A loud crash and scream . One of the sails carried away by the wind . The horizon is illuminated by perpetual flashes of lightning . As the mainsail falls it kills a man . Hugh bears him away . Another is wounded , and shows his forehead covered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vessel can make no head against this sea ! Mor . Haul up more canvas then , and let us feel the wind . Stand by your braces , men , and heave away the lead ! Sailor . ( Heaving the lead . ) By the deep , four ! ( Break . ( The ship strikes on a rock . Three large crashes work to show her bottom is damaged . The female passengers , with their hair loose , pale and aghast , rush on deck . A mast breaks , and again occasions a scene of terror . The women scream . Two sisters embrace in one corner , several fall senseless on the deck , some kneel . ) Hugh . ( Aside . ) Dear wife ! home ! friends ! I shall never see you more ! I do not murmur in this terrible calamity ; but ' t is hard to be thus cruelly torn from hearts we love ! ( Brushing away a tear . ) Passengers . ( Grouping wildly round Hugh . ) Save us ! Oh , save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold ! Our efforts are useless to stay incoming current ! We must be lost ! Leave the pumps ! ( Sailors leave pumps , cordage , &c.); Mor . For Heaven 's sake , boys , be calm ! Never despair ! Try to run her close to the shore ! Sailors . ( Gloomily . ) The thing is impossible ! Lady . ( Wildly . ) No ! My children !  --  save them ! We can not die ! Hugh . Men , be firm , and once more exert yourselves ! Think of those helpless beings whom your fears alone may render fatherless ! There is still one of the lifeboats left ! She will take you and the passengers to shore ! Mor . Hugh is right ; get into the yawl , boys ! Sailors . But you  --  Hugh . I and the captain will be the last to quit the vessel , and He who rules the tempest , I feel , will not desert us in these perilous moments ! ( The boat is rapidly provisioned , and the crew and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Before I follow , I must go to my locker  --  not to save money or clothes , for with death staring me in the face , they are of no account ; but to get a little writing-case which a dear mother gave me at parting ; a curl of my wife 's hair is in the pocket inside it , with all her letters . If I save anything , I am resolved to save this  --  and if I die , I would die with them about me !

Enter HUGH .  --  Hurriedly he examines and tries to open the side-door . Hugh . Could anything be more unfortunate ? my locker is jammed with the wrenching of the ship . I must endeavour to break it open ! But how ? Every moment is life or death !

( Hastily places the case in his wallet , which he now carries by his side . ) Now for the boat ! ( An appalling and general cry is heard without . ) Ah ! what was that ? ( He stands aghast . ) The terrible cry tells its own tale  --  the frail bark has sunk in the deep trough of the sea , and I am here alone ! Madness ! No , I hear a sound ! There is some one left in the vessel besides myself , and with that sound a kind of hope seems to start within me . ( The knocking which has been heard is repeated . ) Who 's there ? Clis . ( Within . ) Hiccup ! Supercargo , ahoy ! All right ! What 's the matter ? ( Hugh opens another door , R. , in the cabin , and Clissold falls out , drunk . ) Hugh . Lawrence Clissold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but there is not a man in the vessel I would sooner have found alive than him . Of all the ship 's company we two are least friendly together ; and we are the only two saved ! ( Clissold rises with difficulty , and on seeing Hugh looks fiercely and speaks thickly . ) Clis . Hiccup ! What 's the matter with the ship ? Hugh . She is wrecked ! Clis . Wrecked ! And the crew ? Hugh . Every mother 's son of them drowned . Clis . And we  --  Hugh . Are doomed men ! The waters are now breaking upon the decks , and leave us no hope ! Clis . No hope ! do n't say that ! Are we to die ? No hope ! Ha ! ha ! ha ! ( Falling on his knees , speechless . ) Hugh . He seems insensible . Shall I endeavour to save him ? Yes ! enemy of mine as he is , I will perform a Christian 's part , and heaven , in its mercy , may aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself . ( He takes Clissold up in his arms . Clissold is fainting , and Hugh carries him off L.  --  Music and Storm . ) SCENE III .  --  Stormy horizon .  --  Music expressive , but not loud .  --  The whole Theatre as dark as possible .  --  The hulk of the Peruvian dismasted and jammed on a rock .  --  The wings removed quite back .  --  The whole of the stage covered with an angry sea .  --  On the opening of the scene several sailors , half-naked , are seen struggling with the mighty waters .  --  Some swim out of sight .  --  Others are lost .  --  The melancholy signal-gun is heard to send its note of distress across the waves .  --  A part of the mast floats on , to which is seen clinging a mother and her infant  --  overcome by terror , the child is lost . The distracted mother turns up her eyes to heaven and quits the mast . She sinks , and the mast floats off .  --  The lifeboat of the Peruvian , heavily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from R. to L. , but eventually ships a heavy sea and goes down .  --  A faint distant chorus of " Heaven have mercy on us ! " issues as from the deep .  --  The Music becomes pianissimo.  --  HUGH , bearing CLISSOLD , appears on the deck of the Peruvian , and then disappears at back .  --  A kind of raft passes from the vessel , with provisions and boxes lashed together .  --  Clissold lying still insensible on the raft .  --  The raft , guided by Hugh , proceeds onward .  --  A flash of lightning causes Hugh to cry out , " Land ! " Hugh . Yes ; in the dazzling light of the last flash of lightning I distinctly saw a low , green , rocky little island , lying away beyond the reef , and not a mile distant . Once in a smooth channel , and the wind in our favour , it will be easy enough to reach it . Courage  --  a desperate effort , and we may yet see old England again ! ( The music plays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sits smiling aloft , " and Hugh works at the raft as the scene is closed in . ) SCENE IV .  --  The Sea and Rocky Coast .  --  On one side is painted a sort of natural cavernous shelter  --  Tempest going down  --  Day breaking  --  Ship in the distance  --  HUGH enters R. , after a pause , supporting CLISSOLD  --  He places him on the ground , C. Hugh . Thank Heaven we have landed at last on this island ; but as yet I have noted nothing in the way of food but a few wild roots and vegetables growing in ragged patches amidst the thick scrub which covers the place . But I will not , now I have so far succeeded , blindly yield to despair ! This apparently deserted spot is no doubt inhabited . I will hope for the best , and if I have only changed the chance of death by drowning for the chance of death by starvation , let me as a sailor never mutiny against decrees which come from a wise and good commander ! ( Points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and stares vacantly around him . ) Clis . Where am I ? Safe ! On shore ! Yes . ( Gazing at Hugh with a dreamy expression . ) But not alone ! Who ?  --  what are you ? Hugh . A man with a heart to feel for another , or I should not have assisted you ! Clis . ( To himself , partially recovering consciousness . ) Hugh Raybrock living ! He has escaped then ! Well , let him live . What do I care ? He is but one , and here , hand to hand and man to man , I fear him not ! ( Turning to Hugh . ) So you 're alive ! Hugh . Aye , alive ; but how long to live I know not ! We are on a desolate island ! Clis . ( To himself . ) Fate , then , has done its work , and terribly avenged him ! Oh , what a hell is within me ! There is no deeper one than the consciousness of guilt ! Oh , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the time be brought back ? The tide that has ebbed reflows . The sun that sets returns , and are the works of a wicked man , like time , irrevocable ? ( Wildly . ) Why should I stay longer on earth ? I , to whom life is a burthen  --  whose heart is now a prey to torments worse than death ! But still I can not repent the deed ! ( Vehemently . ) No , were it again to do , I 'd do it ! ( Stamping fiercely . ) Old Raybrock was the criminal , not Lawrence Clissold ; and as to the 500  --  Ha ! ha ! that only balanced the account between us ! Hugh . My father and 500 ! And how do you come to couple them together , I should like to know ? Clis . I could n't have coupled them . What do I know about it ? I do n't believe a man like your father ever had such a sum of money as that in all his life ! Hugh . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had such a sum when he was no older a man than I am , and saved it , and left it for a provision in his will to my mother , who has got it now ; and I say again , how came a stranger like you to be talking of such a fact ? Clis . Was that all your father left , after his debts were paid ? Hugh . Are you very curious to know ? Clis . Was it just 500  --  no more , no less ? Hugh . Suppose it was  --  what then ? Clis . Oh , nothing ! Hugh . You are drunk ! Clis . ( Chuckles . ) Yes , stick to that . I 'm drunk . Hugh . I tell you what it is , Mr. Lawrence Clissold . If us two keep company any longer , we sha' n't get on smoothly together . You 're the older man , and you stop here , where we know there is shelter . We will divide the stores fairly , and I 'll go and shift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you agree to that ? Clis . Yes , and the sooner the better ! It 's a pity you were not drowned . I should then have had a double allowance to live upon here ! Hugh . Yes ; and die in your turn when you had got through it . Clis . I tell you again , I wish you had been drowned ! Hugh . Thank you ; but as I 'm not , you wo n't get your double allowance . Clis . How much shall I get ? Hugh . Your fair half share ! Clis . And now long will that last me ? Hugh . The food ( if you have sense enough to eke it out ) , with what we may find in this miserable place , barely three weeks ; and the water ( if ever you drink any ) about a fortnight . ( He eyes Clissold as he sees him take a bottle out of his pocket . ) I 'm cold to the bones ! Clis . ( Drinking . ) Ah , and I warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he turns down to show that it is empty , to Hugh . ) Hugh . This is no time to jest with a man 's miseries !  --  the bottle is empty . Clis . I know the bottle is empty , or I should n't have offered it . Hugh . I am tempted to break it over your unfeeling head ; but no  --  ( placing the bottle in his wallet )  --  I forgive your paltry malice . Shake hands before parting . Clis . No , I do n't like you . Hugh , Please yourself . How I have incurred your dislike I can not guess , but this I know , I have not deserved it ! Exit , L. Clis . Soh ! I 'm rid of him  --  alone  --  without the spawn of him I hate . His father drove me to crime  --  through him the curse of crime is stamped in burning letters on my brow , which seem to sear my very brain . I am wrecked ! All its accompanying horrors now seem to conspire to execrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fury of the tempest , the decrees even of fate itself , while I have brandy .

I have it in my heart to strike him , but my hand shakes like a dead leaf in the wind . Bad men are always cowards ! See how I tremble ; but who made me bad ?  --  his father ! Hugh . ( Murmuring in sleep . ) Wife , son ! How happy  --  Clis . He is dreaming of home , wife , and child . Ha ! ha ! he 'll soon wake to misery and death ! What feeling is this which passes over me ? A cold , deadly thrill . I think I am dying . All my brandy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Ah , I will try his pocket ! I have mere need of it than he  --  an ague convulses me , and unless I have some brandy I am a dead man ! ( Clissold cautiously advances to Hugh , puts his hands on Hugh breast , and feels for a bottle . ) Hugh . ( Starts up suddenly . ) Eh ? What ? Who 's there ? I felt a hot breath on my cheek , a hand on my breast . Clis . It 's only I. Hugh . Who 's I ? Clis . Lawrance Clissold . Have you forgotten ? Hugh . Yes , happily , in my dreams , all , and you too , and be hanged to you ! What are you doing here ? Why do n't you keep on your own side of the island ? You want something , I suppose ? Clis . Yes , Hugh . What is it ? Clis . Brandy . Hugh . I thought so . Clis . Have you any left ? Hugh . About two mouthfuls . Clis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Do n't say no , and I will tell you what I know about the five hundred pounds . ( Hugh pulls out his flask , and pours a drop of liquor from it into the cup .  --  Clissold most eagerly goes to drink it , but is stopped by Hugh . ) Hugh . Wait a moment , if you please . Tell me first , and drink afterwards . ( Clissold looks all round him as if he thought there were people on the island to hear him . ) Clis . Hush ! let 's whisper about it ! Hugh . What do you know about the five hundred pounds ? Clis . It 's stolen money . ( Music . ) ( Hugh , petrified , releases his hold .  --  Clissold drinks with avidity , and drops on his knees . ) Clis . Do n't kill me ! I 'm dying ! I 'll think of my poor soul  --  I 'll repent while there 's time ! Hugh . Speak ! Tell me ! Clis . Come near me ! ( He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and ask among the old men for Tregarthen ; when you have found him , say to him , I , his fellow-clerk , was the culprit . You have something else to say to Tregarthen . Tell him to look among the books at the leaf he knows of , and see for himself . It 's not the right leaf  --  the right leaf is hidden , not burnt . I had time for everything else , but not time to burn it . Tregarthen came in as I was getting a light  --  I had to drop the paper from under my hand into the great crack in the desk , and then I was ordered abroad by the house , and there was no chance of doing more . Stay ! you had better say none of these things to Tregarthen ! Hugh . No ! Clis . No ; say this instead , Look in Clissold 's desk , and if you blame anybody blame Miser Raybrock for driving me to it . And , oh ! another drop  --  for Heaven 's sake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Get back to your own side of the island , or I may do you a mischief , in spite of my own self . Clis . Give me the other drop of brandy you have , and I will  --  Hugh . Scoundrel !  --  There ! ( He throws Clissold the flask , who pounces upon it with a howl , and drinks greedily . ) Clis . ( To himself . ) Ha ! ha ! It has given me courage  --  I am a new man . What a fool I was to confess ! If he escapes from here it will tell against me . A ship may come . ( Aloud to Hugh . ) What did I say to you just now ? Hugh . Words which are treasured here  --  ( Pointing to his head. )  --  and words which I will put to the proof , if ever I get back to England ! Clis . I thank you for the information .

Such a threat can issue from none but a madman ! Go , and provoke me no further , or I may do you an injury ! Clis . I will go , and take care that you do n't require all your strength to support a keener trial . ( Slinks away . ) Mark me  --  a ship shall never find you ! Ha ! ha ! ha ! Exit wildly , R. Hugh . I 'm afraid there is more truth than falsehood in his threat , and I wish it were the only danger to be dreaded . With only a tumbler full of fresh water , and my strength wasted by living on half rations , two days more will see me out . It is hard for a man at my age , with all that I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a death as that which is now before me . It is harder still to have the sting of death sharpened by what I have just heard . The secret Clissold has let out , is plainly true enough , and serious enough to have scared him into attempting my life . It maddens me to know , too , that that secret has father 's good name mixed up with it ; and here I am , instead of clearing the villainous darkness from off it , carrying the hidden crime , black as ever , into my grave ! What if I set down and commit to the surrounding waters ? Drowning men , they say , catch at straws ; and that I catch at is the one chance in ten thousand  --  that it may float till picked up , and that it may reach home . If wrong has been done father , I 'll clear the matter up . Mother 's writing-case is handy , and this bottle  --  ( Taking it out of his wallet. )  --  which was the instrument of Clissold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Sea . " ( There is a pause of a few second , while Hugh through music writes rapidly on a slip of paper . ) Hugh . Soh ! I am rid of the secret ! and , if it please heaven , I trust this record will reach them ! ( Still writing and speaking through the music . ) " Whoever finds this , is solemnly entreated by the dead , to convey it , unread , to Alfred Raybrock , Steepways , North Devon , England . Before meeting death , I put the within in a bottle , and set it floating . Loved brother Alfred , if ever it comes to hand , do as I would have done . Last love and thoughts to wife , mother , and you , Alfred . " Hugh Raybrock .

It was but this moment a blush in the sky  --  it is now as if some quick-tongued flame was leaping out . Hark ! What was that ? The sound goes to my very heart ! A horrid thought flashes on me  --  but , no , no ! he could not be so inhuman ! And yet I can not be mistaken  --  the seas on all sides change colour , and turn red . Black shadows , as from low flying clouds , sweep after each other . The air grows hot  --  the sound I heard comes nearer , and like the rush of wind , and the roar of waters ! There is no longer doubt , the island is on fire ! ( At this point of the speech , the low brushwood appears on fire . ) Hugh . Ah ! the flame has nothing to feed on but the dry scrub , and sweeps forward with a frightful swiftness . Only one hand can have kindled this terrible flame  --  Clissold 's ! but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to escape yet left ! ( Hugh goes to left , flames appear there  --  he seeks other paths , but the burning mass always prevents his exit . ) Hugh . The sea then is my only chance ! ( Hugh climbs a rock with difficulty , but only to encounter Clissold lurking at the top . ) Clis . There is no escape this way ! ( Grins maliciously . ) Hugh . Would you dare to stop me ? Clis . Yes . If you attempt to mount another step , you shall have a hundredweight or two of the loose rock on you ! Hugh . Let me pass ! Clis . No ! ( Hugh draws his pistol , fires , and Clis. falls dead .  --  Hugh ascends the rock and precipitates himself into the sea , as the land appears one sheet of fire . ) END OF ACT II . ACT III . SCENE I.  --  The Village of Steepways , North Devon . It is formed from the sea beach to the cliff top by two irregular rows of white houses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house on which is painted , " Mrs. Raybrook , Draper , " and also the words , " Post-office . " As the Curtain rises , CAPTAIN JORGAN is discovered sitting balancing himself on the pier wall , and striking his leg with his hand , as some men do when they are pleased . He is dressed in a long-skirted blue coat , and blue trousers , and wears the hat peculiar to the New Englander . Jor . And a mighty sing'lar and pretty place it is , I guess , as ever I saw in all the days of my life . I 'd bet three dollars to " tew " that there ai n't a level yard in it , and that no tew houses are alike in chimney , door , or fixins ' . ( Observing Alfred Raybrock , who has been engaged , with some fishermen , bearing baskets , nets , &c.); Wal I do declare ! that 's a smart boy yonder . He 's a modest eye under his sou'wester , and a frank and simple manner about him that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I make another bet of three dollars to tew  --  and that 's giving odds , you know , that your father was an honest man . Alf . Well , for the matter of that , there may be some as honest as he was , but  --  Jor . But what ? Alf . I 'll take my solemn davey that among them all together there ar n't one more honest than my old dad . Jor . ( Slapping his thigh . ) Wal , I do like that ! Chip o ' the old block in you , I see , as they say in the old country . Might you be married now ? Alf . Not yet . Jor . Going to be , I calculate ? Alf . Well , stranger , I hope so ! I said stranger  --  you are one , I suppose ? Jor . Jerusalem ! I 'm an American born  --  a New Englander  --  but yet a citizen of the world , and endeavour to combine in myself most of the best qualities of most of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He runs to platform before the house , on which has appeared KITTY . ) Jor . ( Slapping his thigh . ) Never knew such a good thing in all my life . There 's his sweetheart a-looking out for him over the wall . She 's a tarnation pretty girl , and I reckon that the presence of that young fisherman does n't make this here picturesque landscape any the less sunny and hopeful for her . But perhaps they may like to be a little private like , so I 'll sheer off for a few moments , not to interupt their tte -- tte . ( Alfred and Kitty at this point enter the house . ) Gad ! they are weighing anchor before I am , so I must come and have another look at ' em afore I leave this afternoon . Tom Pettifer , ho ! Enter TOM , in an elaborately nautical jacket and shoes , and all things corresponding . Jor . ( Eyeing Tom . ) Eh ! Tom , afraid of sunstroke in England in November , that you wear your tropical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is inside ? Tom . You 'll excuse me , Captain Jawbone  --  I mean Jorgan  --  but I think you must allow that it 's as well always to be on the safe side ! Jor . Safe side ! Why , darned then , I guess you 'd be after guarding against a sunstroke in an ice with that tarnal hat of yourn ? Wa'al , what have you made out at the post-office ? Tom . It is the post-office , Captain Jorgan ! Jor . What 's the post-office ? Tom . The name ! The name keeps the post-office ! Jor . A co-in-ci-dence ! Make tracks sharp ! Show me where it is ! Tom . There it is ! Do n't you see P-o-s-t-office , and " Mrs. Raybrock , Draper , " over the door ? ( Points to house . ) Jor . Raybrock ! That 's the name , sure enough ! and sure enough , here comes some one as can steer us into clear waters . Enter MRS . RAYBROCK , from the house . How do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you  --  fact , I reckon , but I 've come a long way to see you . Mrs. R. Have you , sir ? Then I am sure I 'm very glad to see you , though I do n't know you from Adam . Jor . You see , ma'am , I 'm a sailor . Mrs. R. I do see it , sir , and for that reason you are heartily welcome . Jor . Thank'ee , ma'am . I ca n't opine what it is , I 'm sure , that brings the salt out of me , but everybody seems to see it on the crown of my hat and the collar of my coat , Yes , ma'am , I 'm in that way of life . Mrs. R. ( Indicating Tom . ) And the other gentleman too ? Jor . Wal , ma'am , I calculate you are that nigh right that he goes to sea , if that makes him a sailor . He 's my steward  --  Tom Pettifer he is . He 's been a'most all trades you could " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tables once if you had wished to sell ' em , but now he 's my steward . My name 's Jorgan ; I 'm a shipowner , I am , and sail my own ships , and have done so this five-and twenty years . According to custom I 'm called Captain Jorgan , but I guess I am no more a captain than you are , ma'am . Enter ALFRED and KITTY , from house . Never knew such a thing in all my life ! Here they are again ! ( Slaps his thigh . ) And how air you ? ( Shakes Alfred by the hand . ) And how air you , miss ? ( To Kitty . ) I should opine that , in my country , we should call Devonshire beauty first-rate . I say , you young Britisher , I see how it is , and nothing could be better . I was jist a going to say to your mother that my name is Silas Jorgan , and that the sea is my occupation ; and I was a going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like her ) that it did n't signify where I was born , except that I was raised on question-asking ground , where babies , as soon as they come intew the world , inquire of their mother , " Neow , how old may you be , and wa'at air you a going to name me ? "  --  which is a fact ! ( Slaps his thigh . ) Such being the case , I may be excused for asking you if your name 's Alfred ? Alf . It is ; but  --  Jor . Stay ! I 'm not a conjuror , and do n't think me so , or I guess I shall right slick undeceive you . Likewise , do n't think , if you please , though I dew come from that country where babies ax questions as soon as they 're born , I 'm doing so for question-axing 's sake , ' cos I ai n't  --  and that 's a fact ! Somebody belonging to you went to sea ? Alf . My elder brother , Hugh . Mrs. R. Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost son , it will ease a mother 's heart ; but  --  ( pointing to window )  --  break the intelligence lightly , for there sits his widowed wife and poor little child . Jor . How long is it since it happened ? Alf . He shipped for his last voyage better than three years ago . Jor . Ship struck upon some reef , I reckon , and all hands lost ? Alf . Yes . Jor . Wa'al , here I stand , who may come to the same end , like enough . " He holds the seas in the hollow of His hand , " and we must all strike somewhere and go down . Our comfort , then , for ourselves and one another is to have done our duty ; and I 'll wager tew dollars to three your brother did his . Alf . Aye , Captain Jorgan , that he did . Jor . Consarning the manner of his death , it may be that I have some information to give you . ( Observing that the women are weeping . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone . The poor critturs are crying . Alf . Yes ; Kitty and mother dear , go and keep Margaret company a little while . Captain Jorgan wishes to have a little private conversation with me . Kitty . You wo n't be long , for we 've a thousand questions to ask the gentleman about poor Hugh . Exit into house with Mrs. R. Tom . Well , Captain Jorgan , I suppose your hint applied to me as well as the ladies ? so I may as well afford them a little comfort in their affliction  --  ( takes a bottle of spirit out of his pocket )  --  and then sheer off . Exit . Jor . In my last voyage , homeward bound from South America , I say to you , my young friend , it blew whole measures , not half measures , nor making believe to blow  --  it blew . It behoves a man who takes charge of his fellow-critturs ' lives never to rest from making himself master of his calling . I never did rest , and consequently I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an island . I made it out myself , I calculate , from the masthead , and ordered a boat to be lowered to explore . There was a reef outside the island , and entangled in a heap of seaweed I found , Jerusalem !  --  what do you think I found ? Alf . I really ca n't imagine . Jor . A bottle . Alf . A bottle ! Jor . ( Producing one . ) Yes ; and here it is . It was encased in oilskin , and I opened it , as you see . Inside was this little crumpled folded paper , and outside was written these words . ( Music . ) " Whoever finds this is solemnly entreated by the dead to convey it , unread , to Alfred Raybrock , Steepways , North Devon , England . " A sacred charge : and , Alfred Raybrock , there it is ! Alf . ( Taking it . ) This is poor Hugh 's writing ; but the ragged paper is so stained , and so many of the words are destroyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make the letter out . " Mem. for self .  --  H. Raybrock , cast away  --  very unhappy in mind through L  --  telling me that poor father 's 500 is ' stolen money ! ' Likewise for reasons here noted . If proof , go to Lanrean , and among the old men there  --  believe nothing against father  --  discover and restore , please Heaven , if ever  --  " I can read no further . ( Lays his face in his hands . The music ceases . ) Jor . Wa'al , I guess you 're not going to give in ? Be up and doing , like a man ! Alf . It 's selfish , I know . But doing what ?  --  doing what ? You 've seen how beautiful she is , Captain Jorgan . Jor . Did anyone ever say she war n't ? If so , I guess I 'd lick the crittur . Alf . It 's not that . Jor . Wa'al , then , what is it ? Alf . We were to have been married . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , eh ? Alf . That 500 in the written paper poor father had expressly laid aside for mother . She has never touched the money till now ; and now it was to have been laid out this very week in buying me a fishery here , to settle me in life with Kitty . But after this solemn warning from my brother 's grave in the sea , that the money is " stolen money ! " can I touch it ? Jor . Mayhap you ca n't , and mayhap you can ! Alf . Impossible ! Jor . There ai n't no such word in the Yankee 's dictionary . Lookee here , my young friend , if you will kinder have some reliability on me , I reckon I shall put you right slick ahead comfortable on this affair in considerable less than no time . I have knocked about harder than you , and have gone along further nor you recollect , and recollect I have had all my sea-going life long , to keep my wits polished bright with acid and friction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alf . But  --  Jor . No buts , but just clench that hand of yours in this hand of mine , and join me in the expedition of which I am about to take command . ( He takes Alfred 's hand with a hearty shake . ) Alf . Then what do you propose ? Jor . First and foremost , let me have that bit o ' paper that you air a crumpling with such earnestness , and let me see what I can do as to tracing . ( Alfred gives it , and Jorgan seems to carefully puzzle out the whole of the writing . ) Jor . I make out that this would stand if all the writing were here . Inquire among the old men living there for  --  some one ; most like you 'll go to this village named here . ( Musing with his finger on the name mentioned on the paper . ) Alf . ( Looking at paper . ) Yes , and Mr. Tregarthen is a Cornishman , and , to be sure , comes from Lanrean . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't acquainted with the crittur , who may he be ? Alf . Mr. Tregarthen is Kitty 's father . Jor . Aye , aye , I 'm spry neow . Tregarthen knows this village of Lanrean , then , I guess ? Alf . Beyond all doubt he does , it being his native place . Jor . Stop half a moment ; we want a name here , L blank . You could ask Tregarthen if he remembers a name beginning with the darned letter in those diggings . Eh ! Here comes the family . I take it mum 's the word just yet . Enter MRS . RAYBROCK , KITTY , MARGARET , and TOM PETTIFER , carrying a child from the house . Kitty . Is anything the matter ? That gentleman detaining you so long has made us all uneasy , Alfred . Mrs. R. Gracious ! What have you done to my son to change him like this all in a minute . Jor . Guess I ca n't clear . I say , my young friend , as I am being held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come to my rescue slick . Alf . Kitty , darling , I must go away to Lanrean , and I do n't know where else , or how much farther , this very day . Worse than that , our marriage , Kitty , must be put off , and I do n't know for how long . ( Kitty stares at Alfred in anger , and pushes him from her with her hand . ) Mrs. R. Put off ? The marriage put off ? And you going to Lanrean ? Why , pray ? Alf . Mother , dear , I ca n't say why  --  I must not say why . It would be dishonourable and undutiful . Mrs. R. Dishonourable and undutiful ! ( To Jorgan . ) And is there nothing dishonourable and undutiful in the boy 's breaking the heart of his own plighted love , and his mother 's heart , too , for the sake of the dark secrets and counsels of a wicked stranger ? ( Still addressing Jorgan . ) Why did you ever come here ? Who wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you rest in your own bad place , wherever it is , instead of disturbing the peace of quiet , unoffending folk like us ? Kitty . ( Sobbing , to Jordan also . ) And what have I ever done to you , you hard and cruel captain , that you should come and serve me so ? Jor . Wa'al , I guess I can look only from one to t' other , and grip on to myself by the coat-collar ! ( Is suiting the action to the word .  --  Kitty , on observing Alfred at her feet on his knees , keeps her hands before her tearful face , as if to shut out Alfred from her view ; but she keeps her fingers wide asunder , so as to look at him all the time . ) Alf . ( Appealing to Margaret . ) Margaret , you who have suffered so much so uncomplainingly , and are always so careful and considerate !  --  do take my part for poor Hugh 's sake ! Mar . I will , Alfred ; and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us ; but I take your part , for all that ! Jor . I calculate I 've a notion that I oughter lay hold of myself tighter than ever ! Mar . I 'm sure that you have some strong reason , and some sufficient reason , for what you do , strange as it is ; and even for not saying why you do it , strange as that is . And , Kitty darling , you are bound to think so more than anyone , for true love believes everything , bears everything , and trusts everything ! Mrs. R. But do you think those words can be applied in my case ? Mar . Yes , mother , dear ; you are bound to think so , too , for you know you have been blest with good sons , whose word was always as good as their oath , and who were brought up in as true a sense of honour as any gentleman in this land . And I am sure you have no more call , mother , to doubt your living son than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the dear dead , I stand up for the dear living ! Jor . Wa'al , neow , this I say , I do  --  that whether your opinion flatters me or not , you air a young woman of sense , and spirit , and feelin ' , and I guess I 'd sooner ' ave you by my side in the hour of danger than a good hafe of the men I have ever fallen in with , or fallen out with ayther . Alf . Kitty , dearest , I must go to your father , to entreat him still to trust me in spite of this wretched change and mystery , and to ask him for some directions concerning Lanrean . Jor . Yes ; and I can not but imaginate that the sooner we begin the sooner we shall end ; so I 'll bid you good-bye , ladies , and I trust when I squat here again , I shall be able to show I 'm not the pretty considerable ' tarnal ogre you take me to be ! Alf . Good-bye , Kitty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kitty rushes into his arms , and a picture is formed as the scene closes in . ) SCENE II .  --  A Room in a Little Hotel , " The King Arthur 's Arms " at Lanrean , in Cornwall . Enter POLREATH , the Landlord , and DAVID , the Waiter , R. Pol . Now , David , as club  --  " the Gentlemen King Arthurs "  --  has broken up for the evening , I think , as we shall have no more travellers , we may venture to put out all the fires , shut all the shutters , and go to bed . David . Very good , sir ; but how about Mr. Parvis ? Pol . The chairman ? David . He 's fast asleep in his chair , and has disquieted the minds of all the company for some time by snoring with strong symptoms of apolexy ! Pol . Which , in a mild form , David , is his normal state of health . Perhaps it will be as well if we go and wake him , and request him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . David . Bless you , sir , I 've done that over and over again , and his reply to my friendly suggestions ca n't be placed on record without the aid of several dashes . Pol . Then , David , there 's no help for it but to let the excellent gentleman alone , and I have no doubt he will remain in a defiant slumber till tomorrow morning . David . Very good , sir . Follows Polreath out , L. Enter JORGAN and ALFRED , R. Jor . Now , wait a bit ; they might be full here , or they might offer us cold quarters ; consequently , I reckon we oughter take an observation , and when we 've found the warmest room , walk slick into it . Alfred . I have no doubt that will be the better plan , Captain Jorgan . If we can only manage to stop here for the night , in the morning we may gain some information in the village . Jor . Eh ! Here 's the boss  --  mum 's the word , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , L.  --  Jorgan shakes him heartily by the hand . How do yew do ?  --  glad of the opportunity of making your acquaintance ; but I wo n't detain you by making any lengthened observations . How air you  --  how air the family ?  --  how air  --  but , speaking to you , I 've forgotten to introduce myself . I guess that 's not right , I do ! I have the honour of being a dear cousin of yours  --  do n't start , it 's on the Uncle Sam 's side  --  and this friend of mine is a near relation of yours , too , on the Devonshire side . Now , boss , look smart ; we are both nigh used up , and much in want of supper . Pol . ( Staggered . ) Well , I never  --  here are two near and dear relations , that till now I never saw or heard of ! Jor .

Pol . ( Still puzzled . ) Well , really , sir , I 'm at a loss what to make of or do with you . You see the club have  --  Jor . ( Interrupting him . ) Wa'al , now , that is curious . Did n't I say , only coming along , if we could only light on a club  --  Pol . Well , gentlemen , it is not usual for me to have strangers so late at night . I suppose you will put up with the scanty accommodation I can afford you ? Jor . Do n't apologize ; we have the appetite of a Mississippi alligator , and can eat anything you 've got . Mind , boss , we do n't ask you to give it us , but will gladly pay for the contents of your larder , I reckon ; and mayhap , while it 's being got , you can give us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear a liberal gentleman , I will do so if I can . ( To David , who enters , L. ) David , some boiled fowl , and a rasher or two of bacon for these gentlemen . Exit David , L. Jor . Now , lookee here , boss , I want you to help my young friend out in a little matter of business which is of a neither here nor there to you  --  and towards that end I guess I must ax you jist to favour me with the names of two or three old residents in the village of Lanrean . ( Taking out his pocket-book . ) You may observe at the top of the first page my name and address  --  " Silas Jonas Jorgan , Salem , Massachusetts , U. S. " Neow , what may be the spelling of these old critturs ' names ? Pol . Well , there 's an elderly man named John Tredgear ; but he may be dead by this , as he 's lying sick . Jor . Wa'al , if he 's dead and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I guess he wo n't object to us digging him up . Tredgear down , anyhow . ( Writes in his book . ) Pol . There 's another named Penrewen  --  I do n't know his Christian name . Jor . Never mind his Christian name  --  Penrewen for short . ( Writes in his book . ) Pol . There 's a third , named Simon Polkinghorne . Jor . And a pleasant sounding name , too . Simon Polkinghorne 's booked . ( Writes in his book again ) Pol . I can recall no other , except old Parvis . Jor . One of old Parvis 's family , I reckon , kept a dry goods store in New York , City , and realized a handsome competency by burning his house to ashes . Same name , anyhow . ( Speaking as he enters it in his book . ) Pol . I can not think of any others at the moment . Jor . Thankee , boss ; and so hoping for your good opinion , I give you my hand , I dew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causes Polreath to wince . ) To-morrow morning , then , I guess you must find out the lawyer and the parson here ; they air proper people to consult , and I 'll ax questions of everyone I see , and by so doing propagate that proud privilege and institution of my native country ! ( Slaps his thigh , and puts away his book . ) Pol . Your room will be at the top of the house  --  an excellent bed , but you 'll hear the wind . Jor . I have heerd it afore . Pol . It 's considered to blow here . Jor . I see ; the weather get its strength in these parts  --  kinder goes into training for the Atlantic Ocean . Yours are little baby winds  --  jist beginning to feel their way and crawl . Mak ' a voyage with me , and I 'll show you a tall grown-up wind on business . But you have n't told my friend , boss , where he lies . Pol . It 's the room at the head of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall . You ca n't mistake it , because its a double-bedded room , and there 's no other ; besides there 's a seafaring man sleeping in one of the beds  --  the bed that 's nearest the door . I 've been to look at him once , and he 's sound enough off ; but come , gentlemen , your supper must be ready  --  follow me , if you please . Jor . Well , go on ahead right smart . Exit Pol . L. I say , my young friend , I ai n't kinder like generally superstitious , but at this moment I feels a some one whispering in my ear , and telling on me that your marriage with Miss Kitty Tregarthen ai n't put off for long , and that , in this very house even , we shall light upon what we want . Alf . I hope so . And when do you think ? Jor . Waal , I ca n't jist reckon when , but I calculate it will be soon . But come , let 's shove along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm as hungry as a Mississippi alligator . Exit with Alfred , L. Enter DAVID , R. David . No one has ever dared yet to wake the mighty Parvis when asleep , but I have done so by accidentally falling against him . I had to withdraw to a safe distance after the unfortunate occurrence ; but fortunately the old gentleman started to his feet on the best terms with himself , as a light sleeper , and rallied me , who all the world knows is a wide-awake customer , as a member of the sleepy-headed fraternity . ( Bell . ) There it is again ! From morning till night the same sad sound  --  tinkle , tinkle , tinkle ! I suppose they now either want supper , are about supper , or have finished supper , ( Bell . ) Oh , la ! I wish , as someone says , in one of Shakespeare 's plays , they 'd " silence that dreadful bell ! " Coming !  --  coming ! Runs out , L. SCENE III .  --  The Double-bedded Room .  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed .  --  A large window , C. , with curtains ; near it another bed .  --  The seafaring man on the bed nearest the door asleep , his face and part of his body is hid by the sea-coat that partially covers him . As the scene opens CAPTAIN JORGAN opens the door , peeps in , and then enters , followed by ALFRED .  --  Each have a lighted candle . Jor . Here 's your room , and here 's the berth of the seafaring man . I wonder what like he is ? He breathes deep I guess  --  do n't he ? Alf . Sleeping like a child , to judge from the sound . Jor . Dreaming of home , may be ! Ca n't see his face , sleeps a deal more wholesomely than Arson Parvis , but a'most as sound , do n't he ? Good night , fellow-traveller . Alf . Good night , Captain Jorgan , and many  --  many thanks . Jor . ( Clapping Alfred cheerfully on the back . ) I 'll wait till I ' arn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pleasant dreams of you know who ! ( Waits for any stir on the part of the seafaring man , and then retires . ) Alf . ( Musing . ) Captain Jorgan has spoken brave words to me , and they shall not be spoken in vain . I have got to do something . What I have got to do , before all other things , is to trace out the meaning of this paper ( taking it from the pocket of his jacket ) , for the sake of the good name that has no one else to put it right , or keep it right . And still , for the sake of the good name , and my father 's memory , not a word of this writing must be breathed to mother , or Kitty , or any human creature . ( Pauses . ) I must think no more , I must sleep , for to-morrow brings its more than usual labour . So anxious am I for the morning , that lest I lose one single moment I shall follow the example of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bed till daybreak . ( Music .  --  Alfred takes off jacket and neckerchief . He takes the paper from the jacket , and rolling it up in the neckerchief , places it under his pillow . Alfred then throws himself on the bed , and gradually falls asleep . The seafaring man now rises slowly up in his bed , he wears a long beard , his hair is grey , and as he looks mysteriously around discovers to the audience the face of Hugh Raybrock . ) Hugh . Where am I ? Oh , I remember now ! I arrived here last night ! Eh , what 's that ? surely I heard some-one breathing ! some-one is in the other bed near the window . They must have come up into the room , of course , after I had fallen asleep , and tumbled into bed quietly without disturbing me . There 's nothing wonderful in that , and nothing wonderful in the landlord letting the empty bed if he could find a customer for it . The heavens seem brightening into daylight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , and on passing the other bed , stops to look at Alfred in it  --  he starts . ) I ca n't make out his figure-head , because his sea coat is drawn up over the lower half of his face , but something seems to strike me on a sudden in his hair , and his forehead . I 'm not an inquisitive man by nature , but in spite of myself I must remove his coverlet . ( Starts again as he does so , and exclaims " Alfred ! " Steadies himself with his hand on the rail of a chair , and stands looking at his brother . ) Three years ago I said good-bye to my wife , to my little child , to my old mother , and to you , brother Alfred , here asleep under my eyes . For all those three years no news from me had reached you , and the underwriters must , I know , have long since reported that ship I sailed in was lost , and that all hands on board had perished . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , and of the weary time they must have waited and sorrowed before they gave me up for dead . ( Alfred has become restless , starts up , and on beholding Hugh he seems to pass on a sudden from fast asleep to broad awake , he utters an exclamation , on which Hugh again speaks . ) Hugh . Alfred ! do n't you know me ? ( He is still aghast . ) Alfred ! Alf . Alive ! ( He starts from the bed , rushes to embrace Hugh , but falls in his arms , weeping and hysterical . ) Hugh . Poor lad , do n't cry ; see , wait a bit before I speak again , so that you may recover yourself ; that 's right , you are getting over your troubles , mine have roughened and hardened me , but heaven knows I feel this keenly  --  mayhap all the more keenly , because I am slow to show it . Now come , that 's better , and I see you are able to tell me if they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yes , after long , long hoping , one by one they had given you up , Hugh ! Hugh . And my wife ? God bless her ! Margaret ! I can not speak the word . Alf . Living  --  yes , she is living  --  at home , and in her widow 's weeds ! Hugh . Poor soul ! Her widow 's weeds ! And the child  --  was it born alive ? Alf . Yes . Hugh . Boy or girl ? Alf . Girl ; and living now , and much grown . Hugh . And mother ? Alf . Well ! She is a trifle fallen away , and more silent within herself than she used to be  --  fretting at times , like Margaret , on nights when the sea rises , and the windows shake and shiver in the wind . Hugh . Oh ! how I thank Providence with all my heart and soul that I am brought back living to my wife and kindred  --  while wife and kindred are living too ! ( Alfred brushes his tearful eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something ; he steals his hand in hurry under the pillow of his bed , and taking out his black neckerchief , unfolds it , slowly looking at Hugh all the while in a strange manner . ) Hugh . What are you doing , Alfred ? What are you looking at me like that for ? ( Alfred holds up the scrap of paper he has taken out of the neckerchief . ) Heaven ! my own writing  --  the morsel of paper I committed long , long ago to the mercy of the deep  --  thousands and thousands of miles away ! I trusted that message to the waters , and here it is in my brother 's hand ! A chilly fear seems to come over me at seeing it again ! Scrap of paper as it is , it looks to my eyes like the ghost of my own past self , gone home before me invisibly over the great wastes of the sea ! Alf . ( Pointing down solemnly to the paper . ) Hugh , were you in your right mind when you wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how and when the message came to you . I ca n't quiet myself fit to talk till I know that . Alf . It was picked up and brought to us by a kind American captain of the name of Jorgan , who , strange to say , arrived only yesterday , and is now stopping with me in this very house . Hugh . Your information has eased me in my mind , and I will now do my best to quiet you , Alfred , in my turn . I was in my right senses , though sorely troubled , when I wrote those words . Where the writing is rubbed out I can tell you , for your necessary guidance and mine , what once stood in the empty places . I know no more what may be the real truth than you do till inquiry is made , and the slander on father 's good name is dragged boldly into daylight to show itself for what it is worth . All the voyage home there was but one hope , one determination uppermost in my mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and find my wife and kindred alive , to take me back among them again . The determination that I would put the doubt about father 's five hundred pounds to the proof . Give me the paper , Alfred . ( CAPTAIN JORGAN opens the door , and walks into the room , without for the moment observing Hugh and Alfred , who have retired up to examine the paper at the window . ) Jor . Well , I guess I was up and out betimes this morning , and put the whole village of Lanrean under a kinder amicable cross-examination ; but may I be double darned with a nip-o ' - a- frizzle to the innermost grit if I am any wiser for my trouble . ( Hugh and Alfred come down . Hugh grasps Jorgan 's right hand , and Alfred gets hold of his left . ) Well , I dew declare ! ( Bewildered . ) Why , what on airth is all this ? Yew two are alike ! I imaginate yew two are very much alike ! Alf . Yes , Captain Jorgan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who  --  Jor . Jerusalem ! Yew do n't say so ! Waal , I oughter ha ' seen most things , for I hail from the onlimited side of the Atlantic , and have travelled right slick over the limited head , on through the East , and likewise France and Italy  --  Africy  --  whole world , and am now upon the track to the chief European capital  --  but sich a fixin ' as this I never did see yet . And how dew you dew ? ( Shakes Hugh 's hand heartily for several moments . ) I guess if ever I have had my fill of hand-shaking from my bairth to this hour , I have had it now . Alf . Now , Hugh , let us speak of your deliverance , for I have much to ask . Hugh . The particulars shall be told you shortly , and when we are surrounded by the loved ones at home . Suffice for the present that , after suffering all the horrors of shipwreck , I was taken by savages friendly disposed to me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to touch on their territory for fresh water . Alf . Then , with regard to the name of the person referred to in this half-obliterated paper , it is no other than Tregarthen himself , you think ? Hugh . Most certainly , for he was formerly father 's fellow clerk in the house of Dingworth and Co. , America Square , London . Alf . Yes , now you call it to mind I remember . And both Kitty and her father did not come to live at Steepways until after you shipped on your last voyage . Jor . Ay , ay ! I guess you have me in tow , and steer clean ahead in this little matter of ours . Your brother here , it appears , do n't know his sister-in-law even so much as by name ? Alf . Never saw her  --  never heard of her ! Jor . Ay , ay , ay ! Why , then , we every one of us three critters go back together , paper , writer , and all , and take Tregarthen into the secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to go through our duty ! Jor . There ai n't no doubt about that , I reckon , so we must do all what we can to set this ship-shape . But , in settling our course of action , we must use a little caution , any way  --  great joys air as dangerous as great griefs ; and , as I ai n't in love , and have made many a smart run across the ocean , I should like to take command , and go slick ahead in the affair on hand . Shall I try ? Will you hand it over to me ? Alf . Willingly , and  --  Hugh . With pleasure ! Jor . Then give me an arm apiece , and we 'll absquatulate at once to Steepways . Hugh . Let me carry your baggage , if you have any , Captain Jorgan . I can easily take it with mine . Jor . Thankee . I guess I always carry it myself  --  it 's on'y a comb ! ( They are going out , arm-in-arm , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IV . SCENE I.  --  A Room in Tregarthen 's House . Enter TOM PETTIFER , R. Tom . Miss Kitty has just ordered me to get some tea for her father ; but I 've a notion at the present time the thing is impossible . In the first place I must have boiling water , and in the next I must have room to put the kettle on the fire , which is now occupied entirely by my soup ; besides , there 's nothing in the house but ship 's biscuits for dried toast , and the milkman has not yet favoured us with his afternoon call . Enter KITTY , L. Kitty . Well , Tom , have you got some tea for papa ? I fancy he will be getting terribly cross if you keep him much longer without it . Tom . It would have been ready long ago , Miss Kitty , only you see I 've been engaged in preparing some cooking at the fire . I was a born steward , you see , and , as Captain Jorgan often observes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life . Kitty . Speaking of Captain Jorgan , when do you expect him again ? Do you know , I begin to think better of him than I did , and I think he will bring us some good news in the end , and I hope also that he will bring my Alfred safe home again . Tom . But touching again upon tea , Miss Kitty . You see just at this moment the fire is occupied by my soup . If removed , the soup will be spoiled , and my reputation for making it seriously damaged . Do n't you think I can persuade the old gentleman to try a little out of my copper ? There 's little difference between tea and pea soup , and a bowl of the pea soup , with some nuts and a flourish of pepper , will do him more good , I know , than the tea soup . You have tasted my soup , Miss Kitty ? Kitty . ( Pointedly . ) Yes , I have tasted your soup , Tom . Tom . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed ! But is it usual to thicken it with nails ? Tom . Nails ? Kitty . Yes  --  nails ! I found several small tacks at the bottom of my plate . Tom . You do n't say so ? Then depend upon it that it 's the grocer 's fault , and not mine . He was complaining when he served me of some tax he had to pay , so I presume he considered it requisite to adulterate his spice with a similar article . Treg . ( Off , L. ) Kitty , where 's my other slipper ? Tom . Not a word , miss , to your ' pa about the tacks ; he might be induced to decline taking any more of my soup , and a slight of that culinary preparation would be too much for me to bear . Kitty . I believe you have not always been a cook ? Tom . No ; but I 've a firm clinging to that creed which holds by the altar of the dinner-table , and I hope as long as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inheritance of every Englishman . Enter TREGARTHEN , L. Treg . Kitty , there is some one , I fancy , at the front-door ; go and see who it is . Exit Kitty , R. Well , Mr. Tom Pettifer , this is the day your friend , Captain Jorgan promised to call and bring me some good news ; it is late in the afternoon , and yet he has not made his appearance . I must confess , like my daughter , that I must survey this American with a look of disfavour . Tom . That seems to be the case in general about these parts ; but do n't be hasty ; you may think better of the captain by-and-by . Treg . I hope so ! Tom . And I hope so !  --  more than that , I believe so , though you do n't . You and I , Mr. Tregarthen , are both old enough to know better than to judge against experience from surfaces and appearances , and if you have n't lived to find out the evil and injustice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all ! Treg . ( Seeming to shrink under the remark . ) Sir , I have lived to feel it , and to feel it deeply ! Tom . Then , as I have made a good cast without knowing it , the question resolves itself into how about tea ? I think , Mr. Tregarthen , your daughter said you 'd like to have some ? Treg . Well , I in general indulge in a cup of the grateful beverage an hour or so after dinner ; but as we are likely to have visitors , and they are not yet arrived , I think we had better delay the tea for a little while . Tom . I 'm glad to hear you say that , Mr. Tregarthen , for I am now engaged in preparing a dish of ambrosial essence , known as mariners ' soup . Treg . So called , I presume , because the hardy sons of the ocean love to prepare it in the simple retirement of their forecastle . But , hush ! I hear footsteps on the stair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have no doubt it is the captain ! Enter JORGAN , followed by KITTY , HUGH , and ALFRED , R. Jor . Yes , it is Silas Jorgan , sure enough , hailing from Salem , Massachusetts , United States , sir . ( Shaking hands with Tregarthen . ) I 'm glad to see you , sir , I am ! How do you do , sir ? I told you you 'd alter your opinion consarning me , and I congratulate you on going to do it . Tom . Bless me ! bless me ! What am I thinking about ? Here I am standing stock-still , when I ought to be in the kitchen ! If I do n't lift the pot from the fire at once , the soup will be spoiled ! Hurries out , L. Jor . Now , friend Tregarthen , I guess you and I must have a word or two together . This young member of the Raybrock family you know ? ( Indicating Alfred . ) Treg . Certainly , I do ! Jor . But this air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ )  --  I am pretty considerable certain sure you do n't know ! Treg . ( Looking at Hugh . ) As far as I am able to judge , Captain Jorgan , we have never met before . Jor . Wa'al these two are brothers , they are  --  Alfred and Hugh Raybrock , and it 's a fact . Treg . Hugh come to life again ? Jor . Yes , and there he stands afore you . Now , see here , my friend , you do n't want to be told as how he was cast away , but I reckon you do want to be told  --  for there 's a purpose in it  --  as how he was cast away with another man  --  that man by name was Lawrence Clissold . Treg . ( Changing colour . ) Lawrence Clissold ? Jor . What 's the matter ? Treg . He was a fellow clerk of mine  --  thirty  --  five-and-thirty  --  years ago . Jor . I calculate that 's true , Dingworth Brothers , America-square , London City . Treg . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jor . Now between those two men cast away there arose a mystery consarning the round sum of 500 . ( Tregarthen starts once more . ) Eh ! what 's the matter ? Treg . ( After a pause . ) Please go on . Hugh . It would be better perhaps as I am the more interested party in the matter in question , that I myself tell my own tale . Jor . Wa'al , as the run 's begun with a fair wind , you take the helm , and go ahead . Hugh . The sum of 500 of which Captain Jorgan has spoken appears to have been stolen money , Mr. Tregarthen . Lawrence Clissold made this confession to me when we were thrown together upon a desolate island in the Pacific , and as my father 's name , together with your own , were coupled in the sad transaction , I felt in duty bound , as there were no other means of communication , to entrust the guilty wretch 's words to sea . Treg . Pardon me , Hugh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who ruined me  --  I have always suspected him , and it turns out that my suspicions were correct . Jor . And how may you make it out ? Treg . When we were fellow clerks in that London House it was one of my duties to enter daily , in a certain book , an account of the sums received that day by the firm , and afterwards paid into the bankers . One memorable day , a Wednesday , the black day of my life , among the sums I so entered was one of 500 . Jor . I guess I can clear . Treg . It was one of Clissold 's duties to copy from this entry  --  it was my duty to hand the money to him , and his again to hand to the clerk employed to go to the bankers . A sum of 500 was afterwards found by the house to have been wanting that day from the bag . Clissold being questioned stood upon his perfect clearness in the matter , and asked no better than to be tested by my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 500 was not there ! Jor . How ! not there , when I guess you made it yourself ? Treg . I could not deny the book , and I could not deny my own writing . I knew there must be a forgery by some one , but the writing was wonderfully like mine , and I could impeach no one if the house could not . Hugh . You were required , I presume , to pay the money back . Treg . I did so , and left the firm almost broken-hearted ; I returned , with a dark shadow of suspicion always on me , to my native place , Lanrean , and there remained clerk to a mine until I was appointed to my little post here . Hugh . But your innocence must have been your comfort as well as your trial . Treg . Yes , but for my daughter 's sake and my own I have always carried this subject in my heart as the only secret of my life , and long have believed that it would die with me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend , that of Clissold you have always had suspicions almost amounting to sartinty . Treg . Indubitably , but they have never been confirmed until now . Hugh . We now come to the point , Mr. Tregarthen , upon which I and my brother Alfred , here , are fully determined , and it is , that we will never use the stolen money , and the restitution of it must be made to you . Alfred . For the sake of the right , and of our father 's memory , we will have it ready for you tomorrow . Treg . No , my good fellows ( taking the hands of Hugh and Alfred in his own ) , you are merely trusting to my word  --  there is no proof , so the money must remain as it is . Jor . Oh , we come to mere proof , do we  --  must have it , eh ? Hugh . But how ? Jor . I rayther calculate I 'm gwine to show ye , from what I can make out of the wanderings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart forgery . Treg . There is no doubt but that he substituted a forged leaf in my book for a real and true leaf torn out . Jor . Waal , so far so good , but was that real and true leaf then and there destroyed ? Hugh . No , for the scoundrel admitted that , being surprised , he slipped it into a crack in his own desk . Jor . So far , so good , again ! And now let 's see whether we ca n't overhaul that air article of official furniture . Tom Pettifer , ho ! Enter TOM , L. Tom . Coming , captain  --  coming ; but it wo n't be ready for another five minutes . Jor . What wo n't be ready ? Tom . The soup ! ( Going . ) Jor . Darn the ' tarnal soup ! Stay here , I tell you ; I want to make you useful . Tom . But the sublime preparation will boil over ! Jor . Then you 'll find all the fat in the fire . Never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , look'ee here , Tom , I guess you know something about the house of Dingworth Brothers , America Square , London City . Tom . Yes ; but that was once when I was in the broking line , Captain Jorgan . Jor . You attended , I guess , a sale of fixings when the house was moved ? Tom . Yes ; but I could n't do any business with them . Inkstands and desks ar n't much good in St. George's-in-the-East . Yet , stay , I think I did buy one of the desks . I remember now , there was a crack in it , and  --  Alf . ( Impatiently . ) Where is that desk now ? Tom . Well , I could n't say for certain where it is now , but when I saw it last it was at Wapping , in the shop of a very nice old lady of the Hebrew persuasion . Jor . Neow , Tom , I calculate I must speak to you respecting and consarning your constitutional weakness . Tom . You mean on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's it , exactually . Now , Tom , on your oath as a steward , did you not on one very fine morning take the desk you bought at Dingworth Brothers , America Square , London City , to pieces , to make a better one of it , and put it together fresh , or some darned fixin ' of the sort ? Tom . On my oath as a steward , Captain Jorgan , I did ! Jor . Then , by the blessing of Heaven , and of that Heaven that put it into Tom Pettifer 's head to take care of his head against the bright sun , he lined his hat with the original leaf in Tregarthen 's writing , an ' here it is ! ( Jorgan snatches off Tom 's favourite hat , and , to its almost utter destruction , produces the leaf from under the lining .  --  Jorgan hands the paper , much worn , to Tregarthen . ) Treg . Yes ; it is indeed the real leaf  --  it is much worn , and the writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then the money , dear papa , will be restored to you ? Jor . To be sure , it will be restored to my friend Tregarthen ; and I guess , when it is , he will then and there give it all to his daughter . There , do n't all on you be overpowered with delight , but I 'm gwine to go to Dingworth Brothers . Kitty . For what purpose ? Jor . For what purpose ? I calculate I mean to re-establish the reputation of their forgotten old clerk . Kitty . Oh , how good you are , Captain Jorgan ! I really think I ca n't refrain from kissing you ! Jor . Waal , do n't tear me to pieces , or I sha n't be able to reappoint your marriage  --  which , I guess , as you now see , I was compelled to delay . Now , go with Alfred , and prepare the way for tea . And papa , brother , and I will follow in the wake . Jerusalem ! yeo ! Go ahead ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most remarkable coincidence ! I may say a most extraordinary coincidence ! A man 's reputation re-established , and  --  ( looking at it )  --  another man 's hat destroyed . I am bewildered  --  dumbfoundered ! Eh ! what 's that being borne in to me ? A rich reeking steam , and not unaccompanied by hissing sounds . Ah ! a horrible thought assails me ! The fierce commotion denotes that my soup is transferring itself bodily from the copper saucepan to the fire under it . I must save the precious delicacy , or perish in the attempt ! Hurries out , L. SCENE II .  --  The Little Back Parlour at the Post Office at Steepways . The room is neatly furnished , and over the fireplace there is a picture of Hugh . Door and window ; under the window a stand , with divers plants in garden pots . A Cabinet , with tea-tray , china teapot , punch bowl , R. MRS . RAYBROCK discovered seated in an armchair by the fire , and MARGARET seated near a table , at work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a toy ship . Mar . Four years ago this very day , dear mother since I and poor Hugh were married . Mrs. R. Yes , and at the little church we can see from the window . Oh ! little did I then think he would so soon be taken from us . Mar . That poor Hugh is lost to us for ever I have every reason to believe . Mrs. R. I know , Margaret , you did not feel satisfied with the written information you received from the owners , and determined to see them yourself . Mar . Unhappily , they could but confirm my poor husband 's fate . Many a weary mile has been travelled , and all the intelligence I have ever been able to obtain is that neither the vessel , the crew , nor the cargo have been heard of since they stranded on the homeward voyage . Mrs. R. Margaret , I have forgotten to tell you of the dream I had last night  --  a strange dream  --  and it was all about poor Hugh . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a good dream , and seemed to be all about that American captain , who has taken Alfred away , But you are dull , let us change the conversation , and tell me what Kitty says about her marriage being put off . Mar . But little , and her father less . Do you know that I have often thought that Mr. Tregarthen has some secret weighing on his mind , mother . I always call you mother , for you are poor Hugh 's mother , and a kind one to me . Yes , indeed ! what should I or the dear child have done without you . Enter ALFRED and KITTY , C. D. Kitty . Oh , Margaret , mother dear , we have such news for you ! Mrs. R. News ? Kitty . Yes , and good news that will make both your hearts leap with joy . But I must n't tell you  --  no , I promised the captain not to mention a word , but to leave it all to him ! Oh ! he 's a dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made Alfred very jealous , because I said I 'm quite in love with him . Mrs. R. Alfred , my dear boy , you seemed a totally different man from what you was when you left us , and a much more cheerful one . What has happened ? What is the meaning of this sudden change ? Alf . The meaning , mother ! Why , that this will turn out to be one of the happiest days of our lives , and that my marriage will not be put off any longer . I can not tell you now how it is to come about , but I may tell you that before an hour has passed , both you and Margaret will be as joyful as I and Kitty are at this moment . ( Kisses Kitty . ) Mrs. R. With such an assurance as this , then , I suppose I must rest contented , and ask you no more questions . Enter TOM , at door , C. Tom . Eh ! you 've got here first !

But , however , he has sent me here to announce that Captain Jorgan will be alongside in the turning of a handspike  --  that 's nautical lingo for you , if you like , though some envious people will make the remark that I look no more like a seaman than I look like a sea serpent . Kitty . I suppose the captain , in his usual good-natured way , has sent you forward , Mr. Pettifer , to cheer us up ? Tom . Yes , mum ; he considers something of the sort 's in my line , though what I can find to tell you except that it will soon be over , or that most people is so at first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good , I can not , as my worthy commander observes , imaginate . Alf . I think , Kitty , my dear , that when the captain arrives he will express a wish to be left alone with mother and Margaret . Let us anticipate his wish . The night 's fine , and by no means cold ; a stroll on the beach will do us no harm , and our friend , Mr. Pettifer , can accompany us in our ramble . Tom . I shall be very happy , but I consider I am intruding . Kitty . Why do you consider so ? Tom . Because , when you folks are courting , two are company and three are none . Alfred . But such is not the case with I and Kitty , so come along . Kitty . Yes , Mr. Pettifer , you can go with us . Tom . Can I ! Then while you are making yourselves agreeable to each other I try to make myself agreeable  --  to both . Exit with Alfred and Kitty , D. C. Mar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can not evade mine ; I have had a singular impression on me all day that something strange was going to happen ? Mrs. R. No doubt the appearance of this American captain has caused some anxiety , and the excitement of miserable recollections is too much for you . Mar . No , his honest words were not thrown away upon me , since he spoke them I have more than ever given up my thoughts to my fatherless child , to your home and your happiness . JORGAN appearing at the door . Jor . Aye , that 's right , my good young woman . May the blessed sun see you all happy together , and in the possession of a good name , long after Silas Jorgan has done ploughing the great salt field that is never sown . May I come in ? Mrs. R. To be sure you may , Captain Jorgan , for you have good reason to be free of the house , though you have n't been well used in it by some who ought to have known better . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No you do n't , ma'am , ' cos I guess I wo n't let you . I dare say you did kinder think when I was a conveying off your son from that tender little thing , Kitty Tregarthen , who loves , relies , and hopes in him , that I was no better nor that snarling critter in the picter shops  --  you know the coon I mean  --  him with the tight legs , and a feather in his cap , and wears mustachios , which , as they get up nearer to his eyes , the more wickeder he gets ; I reckon they call him Mephistopheles , or some other Greek name of the sort . ( Turning to Margaret , and shaking hands with her fervently . ) And how do you do , ma'am ? Hope you 're quite well , ma'am  --  how air you , ma'am ? and air the little boy well ? ( Takes a chair , and then sits the child on his knee . ) Not a bit afraid of me ? ' Cute child , ma'am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've a babby at home , ma'am , an ' she 's a gal I guess  --  an ' I sometimes sing to her . Boy . What do you sing ? Jor . Not a long song , my lad . Boy . A short one ? Jor . Yes . Boy . Sing it to me . Jorgan . ( Singing . ) Silas Jorgan Played the organ All the night and day ; But Silas Jorgan Broke his organ , Then he could n't play . There ! that 's about all . An ' sometimes I guess I tell my little gal stories  --  stories of sailors supposed to be lost and recovered after all hope was abandoned . ( Sings again . ) Silas Jorgan Played the organ  --  Yes , I make up stories , an ' tell ' em to that little gal o ' mine  --  stories of shipwreck on desert islands , an ' long delay in getting back to civilized lands ! Yes , it is to stories the like of that  --  mostly that . ( Sings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make ' em . I make up stories of brothers brought together by the good Providence of Heaven ; of sons brought back to mothers ; husbands brought back to wives ; fathers raised from the deep , for little children like herself  --  eh ? what 's the matter . ( Margaret 's touch is on Jorgan 's arm  --  he looks round .  --  The next moment Margaret 's hand moves imploringly to Jorgan 's breast , and she , with Mrs. Raybrock are on their knees before him . ) Eh ! what 's the matter ? Silas Jorgan Played the  --  Tarnal death ! these poor critters ' looks and tears are getting too much for me , and I ca n't finish the song , short as it is . Mistress Margaret , you have borne ill-fortune well ; could you bear good fortune equally well if it were to come ? Mar . I hope so  --  I thankfully , and humbly , and earnestly hope so ! Jor . Wa'al , my dear , perhaps it has come . He 's  --  Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Alive ? Jor . Yes ! Mar . ( With eagerness . ) Oh , sir ! if your words be indeed true , tell me , oh , tell me where he is  --  Jor . Wa'al then , Hugh Raybrock 's no further off than my country . In fact , he 's no further off than his own native country ; to tell you the truth , he 's no further off than Falmouth , and mayhap may be he ai n't quite so fur as that ; and mayhap if you was sure you could bear it nicely , and I was to do no more than whistle for him . ( He blows a whistle , the door is thrown open , and HUGH , followed by the rest of the characters , appears , momentary pause , and picture . ) Hugh . Margaret ! Mar . Hugh ! ( Margaret and Hugh rush into each others arms . ) Jor . ( Regarding them . ) Jerusalem ! that 's a pictur , I imaginate , that does n't require any frame , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be sure . ( To audience . ) Never felt such an evil spirit in the whole course of my life  --  there , I tell you , I brought it about ; if I had n't I should a'most have cut my own connexion . Like the dealer in my country away west who , when he found he had let himself be outdone in a bargain , said to himself , these identical words , " Now I tell you what it is , Seth "  --  Seth was his name you know  --  " I tell you what it is , Seth , I calculate I 'll never speak to you agin "  --  he never did , for he jined a settlement o ' oysters , an ' translated the multiplication table in their language . Perhaps you do n't believe it , but it 's a fact that can be proved , cos if you mention the circumstance to any oyster you come across , he wo n't have the face to contradict it . CURTAIN .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
