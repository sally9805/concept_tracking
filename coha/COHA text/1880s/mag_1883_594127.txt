MARGARET LUTHER , the mother of Martin , told Melanchthon that she recollected the day of the month and the hour when her son was horn , hut not the year . But James Luther , his brother , whom Melanchthon pronounces an honest and upright man , told him that it was 1483 . This brother was conversant with the family history . His testimony , not to speak of other evidence , establishes the fact that the " modern Hercules , " whose heroic qualities , as well as his achievements in the reform of religion , were on a level with the fabled labors and spirit of the son of Zeus , drew his first breath on the night of the ioth of November ,  --  it was after the hour of eleven ,  --  four hundred years ago . No man ever showed himself to the world more unreservedly than this mighty leader of the Teutonic revolt against Rome . He abhorred concealment . He was really incapable of disguise . He could not do otherwise than lay bare his heart and mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his friends , not less than of wrath to his enemies . If , on very rare occasions , he made the attempt to be shrewd and diplomatic , the effort was sure to be clumsy and abortive , and he was *himself disgusted with the experiment . The secret fears and misgivings , from which even his clear and bold mind was not free , he had no inclination to hide . For example , we read in the Table Talk " : " A man must be plunged in bitter affliction when in his heart he means good and yet is not regarded . I can never get rid of these cogitations , wishing that I had never begun this business with the Pope . * * * But t is the frailty of our nature to be thus discouraged . " Is he for the moment struck with weariness at being misunderstood MARTIN LUTHER . ( FRUSI A WOOD-CUT BY LUCAS CRANACH , ENGRAVED IN 1546. ) // and rejected ? Like a child , he expresses the transient regret that he ever undertook to set the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he does not hesitate , in the most simple way , to refer to . Witness his letters from the Wartburg , which depict his bodily infirmities and the evil thoughts that at times tormented him in his solitary hours . His unguarded freedom of speech respecting himself was connected with an equal freedom and candor in speaking of others . His writings are not only multitudinous ; they were composed so rapidly , in quick response to emergencies , that they are a transparent mirror of his thought and feeling . His personality is in them all to an extent that is , perhaps , true of no other writer on religion since the Apostle Paul . His correspondence , stretching through many volumes , is an endless source of information respecting him and his ways . The object of boundless interest in his own time , attracting the intense admiration of a part of mankind , and provoking the violent antipathy of another part , it was inevitable that numberless reports of his sayings and doings should become current . Devoted companions treasured up fragments of his spontaneous talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their notes were subsequently compiled in a volume , one of the most suggestive and entertaining in this species of literature . By this time we ought to know Luther well . It demonstrates the richness and depth of his nature that men do not grow tired of him . They may dislike the fierce dogmatism , which became more boisterous in the battles which he waged and in the days of ill health and advancing age . The coarseness and occasional indelicacy of his language may repel readers who are not over-fastidious . But the originality of thought and the virility of expression , the insight into the deep things of the spirit , the vein of humor that mingles itself unbidden with the most profound and serious reflection , the play of imagination ,  --  these qualities that belong to the utterances of Luther constitute an unfailing charm . A poet , and no less a poet than Coleridge , has said of him : " He was a poet , indeed , as great a poet as ever lived in any age or country ; but his poetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own mind . He was possessed with them as with substances distinct from himself : Luther did not write , he acted , poems . " As the world has ample means of acquainting itself with the personal traits of Luther , so is it with the circumstances of his career . A few errors or apocryphal incidents still cling to the story . His parents were not at Eisleben to attend a fair on the occasion of his birth . VOL . XXVJ. - 8i . They had previously removed to that place from M6hra , a village in the Thuringian forest , not far from the spot where the English monk , Boniface , the apostle of Germany , first planted the Gospel among the Germanic tribes . Luther 's progenitors , as he himself says , were all plain working people . His parents were quite poor ; but they were selfrespecting and religious , and set a proper value on intellectual and Christian training . John Luther , his father , became a magistrate in Mansfeld , the place to which he removed shortly after the Reformer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , John Luther passed his last days in comfort , and left behind him , for a man in his station , considerable property . It is characteristic of Luther that , in framing the form of marriage ceremony to be used by the clergy , he used the names of his father and mother , Hans and Gretha , to fill the blanks : " You , Hans , take Gretha , " etc . There is no proof that , as commonly related , one of his friends was struck dead by lightning at his side . Melanchthon speaks of the sudden death of one of his intimate friends by some accident , the nature of which was not known to the narrator . He was probably murdered , or killed in a duel . Luther , however , had a terrific experience of some sort in a thunder-storm , when the lightning struck near him . Incidents of this character were not without an influence in determining him to take the vows of a monk ; but the main causes , of course , lay deeper , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious anxieties which were independent in their origin of any casual occurrence . Fervent admirers of Luther , or zealous Protestants , have occasionally suppressed remarks , or passed silently over events , which they have imagined to reflect some discredit on their hero . One instance is a phrase in the description which was given of his person and manners by Petrus Mosellanus , who was Professor of Greek at Leipsic when Luther was there at the public disputation with Eck ,  --  a description which it is worth while to notice , as haying an interest apart from the point referred to . This was in 1519 , two years after the posting of the Theses , when Luther was thirty-four years old . Mosellanus writes to Julius Pflug : " Martin is of middle stature , thin and worn with anxiety and study , so that one may count almost all his bones , but of manly and fresh age , and with a clear and loud voice . His knowledge of Scripture is so great that he has all at his fingers ' ends . He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fidelity of interpretations . He possesses , too , a great abundance and command of words and facts , but somewhat // lacks , perhaps , judgment and discretion in the use of them . " These last words have been omitted by several of the Lutheran authorities . Mosellanus proceeds : " In his manners he is courteous and friendly , and has nothing stoical or supercilious about him ; he can accommodate himself to all occasions . In society he is a lively and pleasant jester , " - this word " nugator " ( trifler ) has likewise been sometimes left out in citations of the passage , - " always of bright and joyous aspect , let his opponent threaten him never so fiercely ; so that one can scarcely imagine this man to have undertaken such weighty matters without the aid of God . But the fault which almost all find with him is that he is somewhat imprudent in reprehension , and more biting than is safe in an innovator in religious matters , or decorous in a theologian . " This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A year before , Cardinal Cajetan had bluntly said of him : " I will converse no more with this beast , for he has deep-set eyes and wonderful speculations in his head . " Those who are familiar with Cranach 's portraits know that as Luther grew older he became stout . On his stern and rugged , yet not ungenial face , were stamped the mingled determination and sincerity that were native to his character . It is vain to seek to account for a personality like that of Luther by his environment . There is a mysterious personal force which has an origin independent of circumstances ,  - -  a vast force brought into the current of human affairs to modify its direction . Yet the conditions of the emerging of this personal power are furnished by the contemporary and previous situation . A man , however great , must mold himself on his times . It would be impossible for such a man to be transferred from one age to another . Luther owed much to his family , lowly as was their condition of life . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its varied and mighty influences , active during more than a thousand years for the shaping of mind and character . He advanced beyond the experience of a priest and a monk , but without that experience he would not have been Luther . There was a development of conscience under the medheval system of religion in which Luther partook to the full . The blood of the German race flowed in his veins . It is more than a fancy to suppose that he may have sprung from the tall warriors and stalwart chieftains who coiifronted the legions of old Rome and remained unconquered . Luther was a German of the Germans ,  - -  the " Ur-Deutscher , " the typical German , as he has been called . He knew his people thoroughly , and they recognized themselves in him . Foe as well as friend allows that no man ever did more for an entire nation or left a stronger mark upon it . The very language in which Germans have spoken and written since Luther is an indestructible monument of his influence . He created the language anew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the " Fatherland . " He has molded the minds of uncounted millions of his countrymen , on whom his image has been consciously or unconsciously impressed . His words have had a greater and more lasting effect on his countrymen than the words of any other man . When we look at the influence which has gone forth from his manuals of religious instruction , and from the hymns which have been sung in churches and households , and by armies on the march to battle , now for four centuries , the measure of his power is felt to be indeed incalculable . All this has been eloquently expressed by the ablest of the modern Roman Catholic theologians , D*illinger , who had spent a long life largely in withstanding Luther 's doctrine . The failure , it may be here remarked , of the " Old Catholic movement , " supported though it was by many scholars and by princes , brings out in stronger relief the gigantic power of the Reformer , who carried through what might appear to be an infinitely more formidable task . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his translation of the Bible is , no doubt , the most valuable . In nothing are the resources of his intellect and the vigor of his character more manifest than in his ability , in the midst of a literary warfare with a hundred antagonists , to undertake most important works of a positive character , involving a great amount of thought and toil , for the upbuilding of the church . The translation of the Bible cost him a world of labor . He recognized the necessity of taking counsel in such a work . Besides the regularhelp of Melanchthon , Jonas , and his other coadjutors , he would discuss words and phrases at his own table with the friends and guests who happened to be with him . Imbued himself with the vernacular of the people , he still did not neglect to inquire of common men in cases where he was doubtful as to the right term to be chosen , or as to the , precise significance of a popular phrase . For he meant to make a translation which should come home to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a Ger , ; *ctn Bible that he would give to the people . Not that he undervalued accuracy : he claimed that , in cases where precision was necessary , he had secured it , sparing no outlay of thought and inquiry to achieve this // end . Still , he was determined to issue , not a colorless version , or a version enervated by idiomatic peculiarities of the Hebrew and the Greek , or a pedantic version , intelligible and interesting only to the cultivated , but rather a translation which should make the Bible appear to have been written in German . He gives amusing accounts of the struggles it cost him to make the sacred writers " speak German . " In dealing with Job , especially , his patience was well-nigh exhausted . No one could understand what it had cost him to make Job " reden Deutsch . " But he succeeded . In his version , the apostles and prophets * reden Deutsc/i , " - the Deutsch of the shop , the market , and the hearthstone . Luther 's Bible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the authorized version , admirable in various particulars , fails at any point , it is just here . There is a lack of freedom in the incorporation of English idioms ; in a word , there is an undue servility . So far as a translation fails to give the force and beauty of the original , it is incorrect . Close adhesion to grammar and lexicon , in many instances , may be the cause of greater loss than gain . We must have the spirit as well as the letter of the text . If we can not have both , then better the spirit than the letter . Our recent revisers make the frightened disciples who saw Jesus walkin.g on the sea cry out , " It is an apparition " ( Matt. xiv . 26 ) . Would such a company of fishermen , in a state of alarm , use this word ? If not , some other should have been substituted for it . The juicy language of Luther 's version , its sinewy vigor , its racy idioms , and the rhythmical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ version , are literary merits which it is impossible to estimate too highly . Full of patriotic feeling , Luther shared in the national aversion to the Italian spirit and to Italian domination . There is a lively dramatic interest in certain memorable interviews in which he was brought face to face with Italian prelates . One of these was the conference with Cardinal Cajetan at Augsburg , to which we have referred . Luther found him , he wrote , " a complete Italian . " The wary and accomplished Italian , liberalminded , too , as he proved himself in his subsequent career , found the monk whom he expected to convert much more ready to debate than to be instructed . In reply to the question where he would stand if the Elector failed to protect him , Luther answered , " Sub ado " ( " Under heaven " ) Many years later , when the state of things had greatly altered , and Rome had learned that the Saxon insurrection was not easy to be suppressed* Vergerio , another trained and refined prelate , was sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the matter of a projected council . He arrived at Wittenberg on Saturday , November 6 , 1535 . On Sunday morning Luther summoned his barber , and jocosely informed him that , being about to meet the Pope 's nuncio , he wished to make his best appearance ; " that I may , " he added , " be taken for a younger man than I am , and so terrify my enemies with the threat of a long life . " Clad in his best apparel , with an ornament of gold hung upon his neck , he stepped into the carriage , with his companion , Pomeranus , exclaiming , " Here go the German Pope and Cardinal Pomeranus ! " Luther frankly declared to Vergerio his disbelief in the sincerity of the Pope , his jubilant confidence in the soundness of his doctrine , his readiness to go to a council anywhere , adding that he would bring his " neck along with him . " His hilarity , his cheerful tone of defiance , as well as his barbarous colloquial Latin made a somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , that Vergerio himself afterward joined the Protestants . The checkered career of this man *s a remarkable illustration of the changes of opinion and of fortune that were not unfrequent in that revolutionary age . Luther might have limited himself to the work of a national reformer , and have put himself at the head of a movement having no other end than to emancipate the German church from subservience to Rome . The connection of Germany and Italy in the middle ages , after the Roman Empire was established in the German line , was attended with perpetual jealousy and conflict . One might be tempted to judge that it would have been better if the Empire , with the long investiture struggle and all the contests and suffering which the imperial idea involved , had not existed , and Germany and Italy had been kept apart . But , as Ranke has sagaciously remarked , the course of history is not marked out-it is well that it is not-after these preconceived notions . Without the union of Germany and Italy , prolific of evil though it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have taken place . The loss from isolation would have been greater Than the gain . It is true , however , that a national antipathy , which had been the growth of ages , had been developed through the abuses of papal administration in relation to Germany , until the German nation at the beginning of the sixteenth century was ripe for a united movement that should lay an effectual curb upon papal domination , and redress the grievances which had so long been a theme of loud complaint . In the councils of Constance and of // Basel , in the fifteenth century , Germany had nearly succeeded in organizing a national movement to secure a fair measure of ecclesiastical autonomy . The failure , and the continuance of abuses , only made the discontent deeper . The Emperor Maximilian thought of getting himself chosen Pope in order to remedy the evils complained of . He had never known a Pope , he said , who had dealt truly and faithfully with him . " Eternal God ! " he once exclaimed , " if it were not that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world which we rule ,  --  I a miserable hunter , and that drunken and rascally Pope Julius . " In the classification of his writings which Luther made at the Diet of Worms , in response to the comprehensive demand that he should retract what he had written , he made emphatic mention of the wrongs of Germany . " The sufferings and complaints of all mankind , " he said , " are my witnesses that , through the laws of the Pope and the doctrines of men , the consciences of the faithful have been ensnared , tortured , and torn in pieces , while at the same time their property and substance have been devoured by an incredible tyranny , and are still devoured without end and by degrading means , and that , too , most of all in this noble nation of Germany . " The extortion of money from the poor , by such emissaries as Tetzel , was only one item in a long catalogue of measures adapted to rouse the indignation of the German people . If Luther had confined himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the part of Rome , and , for the most part , had let doctrine alone , there is little doubt that all Germany might have been rallied to his cause . It is not given to man to forecast the future ; but , as we imagine this course to have been taken , the vision arises of a united Germany gradually *shaking off ecclesiastical tyranny and advancing in a peaceful career on the upward path of culture and civilization . Instead of this result , what do we behold ? The nation divided , and ultimately torn in twain : first the war of Smalcald , then the Thirty Years ' War , with its pitiless barkarities , destroying arts and industry , liberty and independence , and making Germany for generations a prey to implacable factions and merciless foreign invaders . The wisdom which reasons thus is plausible but shallow . Like remarks might be made respecting Christianity in its beginnings , and in its relation to the religion of the Jews and the gentile philosophy and worship . The Prince of Peace came " not to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Luther that he was more than a German patriot ; he was more than a reformer of ecclesiastical and civil polity . The perceptions and convictions that possessed his soul were of a more universal character . Religion , and the truth of religion , were to his mind the supreme concern . Hence , he laid the axe at the root of the tree . He went back to the fundamental truth of Christianity , which lay at the fundation of the Church in the intention of its Founder . He planted himself on principles which have to do with man 's essential relations to God and to the invisible world . The Christianity which Luther , after prolonged struggle for light and peace , learned from the New Testament , brought him into mortal conflict with the Scholastic Theology , which had been elaborated , on the basis of the Fathers , by the medieval doctors , notably Thomas Aquinas , and had been sealed and sanctioned by the Church and the Popes . The principle of faith ; the idea of the immediate connection of the receptive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human priest to intervene ; the doctrine of gratuitous foigiveness without works or merits in man ,  --  were as clear to Luther as if they had been written in letters of fire on the sky . Thomas Aquinas was the oracle of the Dominican order . It was this order which had in charge the sale of iFidulgences , the scandal which first provoked the indignation of Luther . Against the theology of Aquinas and of his followers , and the doctrine of salvation which Rome required him to preach , he prosecuted an unrelenting crusade . It was a part of Luther 's endeavor to break down the overweening authority of Aristotle . This philosopher had ruled in the schools for several centuries . First , his logical method had been adopted with eager enthusiasm by the Schoolmen . At length his other writings , including his " Ethics , " gained an almost equal sway . He was considered to have exhausted the powers of unassisted human reason in the quest for moral and religious truth . To disparage Aristotle was little short of heresy . Luther , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supremacy of the Stagirite . But what inflamed Luther 's antagonism was the ethical doctrine that good works make the habit or principle . That the work derives all its worth from the principle out of which it springs , this principle being faith , was Luther 's cardinal maxim . The scholastic doctrine of works had really not been drawn from Aristotle . It had arisen independently , and then welcome corroboration had been sought and found in the master of heathen wisdom . Luther 's exasperation against the obnoxious doctrine included in it , however , an antagonism to the philosopher // who was thought to stand as its sponsor . Every student of Luther knows , or ought to know , how to make a proper discount from his vituperative language , which , by utterances in some other connection , is often neutralized or at least qualified . But certainly he is unsparing in the . denunciation which , in various passages , he pours out on the head of the heretical philosopher . " It grieves me to the heart , " he says , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ false words has seduced and befooled so many of the best Christians . " * He reproaches his adversaries with having chosen for their master " a dead and damned heathen . " ( As the word " damned " is , in these places , a past participle and is literally meant , we give it a literal rendering . ) This " dead heathen , " he avers , " has well-nigh suppressed God 's books . " In the excess of his vehemence he asserts that even a potter knows more even of natural things than stands written in Aristotle 's books . All this is sufficiently extravagant . It is merely one mode of indicating his extreme repugnance to a Pelagian theory of character , which makes a man merit his own salvation , and dispenses with God 's help and grace in the building up of character , and with faith as the fountain of right conduct . Luther could not make a distinct issue on doctrine with the Church without a direct collision with the Latin hierarchy , and with the Pope , their chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been glad to avoid it . For a long time he had no idea that matters would be pushed to an extremity . He hoped that he would be allowed to believe and to preach what he read in St. John and St. Paul . More than once he refers to the long , anxious conflict in his own mind through which he passed before he could arrive at the resolve to take a stand against the Pope and the authoritative , traditional teaching of the Church . It was in no temper of foolhardiness , no spirit of bravado , from no impatience of just authority , from no conceit of his own wisdom , but from the deepest conviction that no other course was open to him , that he finally determined to throw off the yoke which it was impossible to wear longer with a good conscience . Long after the " Theses " were published , looking back to that time , he wrote : " What was I then ! a poor , miserable little monk , more like a corpse than a man ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him whose nod was terrible not only to the princes of the earth , but , if I may so say , to heaven and hell ! In what straits my soul was confined during the first and following year ; to what * " Works , " Waich 's ed. , xxi. 345. submissions , by no means feigned or false , 1 descended ; nay , in what despair I was all but involved , can be little conceived , " etc . To whatever he might think or say , the reply was at hand , " Hear the Church ! " " Here was my severest struggle , here my greatest difficulties ; but at length I did , notwithstanding , overcome the obstacle through the grace of Christ . Indeed , at that time I had a much stronger reverence for the pontifical Church , and a much deeper conviction that it was the true Church , than those perverse men wh@ are now so loudly extolling it in opposition to me . " He believed that the Pope taught , and required others to teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says , in the " Table Talk , " " assailed the immoral conduct of papists ; but I chiefly oppose and resist their doctrine ; I affirm roundly and plainly that they preach not the truth . To this I am called ; I take the goose by the neck and set the knife to its throat . " " Well , on in God 's name ; seeing I am come into the lists , I will fight it out . I know my quarrel and cause are upright and just . " Luther has done more than any other man ever did to emancipate the human mind from usurped authority . But this was not his proximate aim . It was the indirect consequence of the movement which he originated . It was the second step which he took ,  --  a step which he was compelled to take , which he took reluctantly but resolutely when the right moment came , although at first it had been far from his thoughts . The fact that the religious interest was nearest Luther 's heart determined his position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renowned leader in the world of letters , Erasmus . Luther was in cordial sympathy with the great literary movement which had already done so much to break down the sway of Scholasticism and the monkish type of* piety . He was fond of the ancient classics ; he was a student and admirer of . Cicero ; he took Virgil and Plautus into the cloister with him . Melanchthon , in the preface to the Wittenberg edition of Luther 's writings , remarks that , if he had found at Erfurt competent teachers , he would have experienced more the softening influence of the philosophers and other authors of antiquity . As it was , he took a good rank among the Humanists , and partly on this account was made by the Elector professor at Wittenberg . He understood the great service which Erasmus had done in exposing superstition and in bringing forward the classical authors and the New Testament writings , as well as the fathers . But when it came to an open rupture with Rome , their ways parted . Not to dwell on the circum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the church door and braved the Pope 's bull , Erasmus had passed middle life , his temperament and taste were all at variance with everything that involved a direct conflict with ecclesiastical authority . He would do for reform what could be done by diffusing literature , by fostering the study of the Scriptures , and by clever satires on the vices of the clergy and the follies , of monks . He dreaded a commotion . He dreaded theological war and division . This would interfere with the quiet pursuit of literary studies and the progress of intellectual enlightenment from which he hoped so much . He was right in this vaticination . The first effect of the Lutheran debate was to turn men 's minds to distinctively religious and theological themes . The immediate consequence was not favorable to the literary culture which had gained so promising a start . No one can doubt that the cause of literature and science , in the long run , profited incalculably by the Saxon reform . No one can believe that Germany would have accomplished in this field what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But we are now adverting to the effect of the theological strife which immediately followed . The issue between Luther and Erasmus is a plain one . Here were abuses , like the hawking of indulgences . Erasmus would ridicule them ; he would seriously argue against them ; but he would go no further . If he were bidden to keep silent on pain of excommunication , he would obey , thinking it better to wait for the gradual effect of better influences . To Luther such practices were a damnable imposture . The victims appeared to him like lambs who were given up to be torn in pieces by wolves . He would not keep silent . He would speak out , be the consequences what they might . Luther believed in his inmost heart that the interpretation of the Gospel which he and the rest of the clergy were required to give to the people was false . Christ and the apostles had taught otherwise . The current teaching robbed Christian people of the comfort which Christ came to give , and to a large extent paralyzed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Erasmus partially , though not wholly , agreed with him . Could Erasmus have regulated the teaching of the Church , it would have been essentially altered , and in the same direction in which Luther altered it ,  --  although Luther , he judged , made extravagant assertions relative to the bondage of the will under evil . Butin doctrine Erasmus wouldhave no rupture of Church ties , no division , no revolt against the councils and popes . On the other hand , Luther , filled to the center of his being with the conviction that religion is the supreme interest of man , and that it is a base wickedness to conceal the truth on the subject , could not do otherwise than declare war against the ecclesiastical authorities which commanded him to retract and enjoined on him silence . The verdict of history is on the side of Luther . Erasmus , with all his gifts and virtues , lacked the heroic element . We can not deny him sincerity ; but his beliefs did not take so strong a hold on him that it appeared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a mortal conflict and a division of the Church . There was truth in the saying that Erasmus laid the egg which Luther hatched . The answer of Erasmus was that the egg laid was the egg of a hen , and the product something quite different . Luther and Erasmus always interest us from the contrast which they present . The fine , sharply-cut features of Erasmus , as seen in Holbein 's portrait , show us the face of the critic and keen iconoclast . He is the leader of the sappers and miners . The rougher outline of Luther 's bold countenance shows us the pioneer whose vigorous arm breaks through the path from which a less courageous spirit would recoil in dismay . In the combat into which the two fell , it is doubtful which is the more effective weapon , the sledge-hammer of Luther or the rapier of Erasmus . Luther 's advice to the chief of the literary school , that he should remain a spectator of a conflict in which he was evidently not fitted to be an actor , must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Erasmus was a master in retort . In answer to Luther 's remark that some of his interpretations might fairly be thought to countenance Arianism , coming , as they did , from a " suspected person , " Erasmus replied that it was diverting to hear Dr. Martin , who was denounced throughout Europe as a heretic , talk about suspected persons. ** Among the statues which surround that of Luther in the great monument at Worms , is that of another eminent Humanist , Reuchlin . Reuchlin was an older man than Erasmus . Born in 1455 , he was fifty-two years old when Luther attacked the sale of indulgences . The long war from which this noble and venerable scholar had emerged successfullythe war with Pfefferkorn and Hoogstraten and their followers , who were incensed at his unwillingness to have all the writings of the Jews except the Bible burned-made him value repose . It was a satisfaction to him that the monks would be kept so busy with Luther as to let him alone . He never separated from the Catholic Church ; but he gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ulrich von Hutten , and the // band who , by the Epistolce Obscurorum Viroru ; n , and by the dread of the carnal weapons which the knights were ready to wield in Reuchlin 's defense , had helped on his cause , enlisted in behalf of Luther . Reuchlin died in 1522 , having done a great service in the promotion of good learning , and in weakening the prestige of the Dominican inquisitors against whom Luther had to wage his battle . Melanchthon was only twenty-one years old when he joined Luther as teacher of Greek in the Saxon university . For many years the relation of the two was like that of father and son . But in theology , as in ecclesiastical reform , Melanchthon 's caution and moderation naturally inclined him to a middle path . In signing the Smalcald Articles , in 1531 , he had the courage to append to his signature the statement that , if the Pope would allow the Gospel , he would , for the sake of peace and unity , concede to him , as a matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bishops of those Christians who might choose to live under his jurisdiction . This statement , occasioned by Luther 's unstinted denunciations of the Papacy , indicates the leaning of Melanchthon to a more conciliatory course . In matters of ceremony , he would go far in his toleration of the old rites . In truth , at a later day , he was ready to carry his concessions to a dangerous extreme . In theology , he recoiled more and more from the assertions which he had himself made of the absolute control of the human will by the divine power . The arguments of Erasmus impressed him strongly . On the Lord 's Supper , he could not sympathize with Luther 's violence against the Zwinglians , and himself adopted a middle view closely akin to that of Calvin . As Luther grew old , his physical infirmities increased ; he was tortured with ailments which heightened the natural vehemence and obstinacy of his temper . To live near him was like dxvelling close to the crater of a volcano , which at any moment might burst forth in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by fanatical admirers , who copied his faults without even appreciating his virtues . Consequently , the closeness of the tie between him and the younger associate whom he had so loved and cherished was in a degree loosened ; yet not in such a degree that he ceased to love Melanchthon , or that Melanchthon ceased to hold in the highest esteem the noble qualities which had cast a spell over him in his youth . The wonder is that two men , so unlike each other in their mental and moral traits , could live together and cooperate in such a work as that in which they were engaged , with no greater disturbance of mutual confidence and esteem . Melanchthon was the " Preceptor of Germany . " It was he who cemented the alliance of the religious reform and the new learning . His inaugural address , in his early youth , foreshadowed the work in behalf of learning which he so effectually performed . Luther and Calvin never met . Calvin and Melanchthon had passed days together , and stood in relations of intimacy . Calvin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Papacy . He appreciated the greatness of the Saxon leader , different as Luther was from him in the cast of his mind and in some of his theological opinions . Luther , to the generality of men who have no special interest in the controversies of theology , is much more engaging and attractive than the Genevan reformer . Luther 's vocabulary of condemnation and abuse is more copious , and is stored with coarser material , than that of Calvin . But it is somehow felt that , in the case of Luther , to use a homely adage , " his bark is worse than his bite . " In Luther , the deep wells of tenderness , the versatility of genius , the sympathy with all sorts and conditions of men constitute an inexhaustible charm . I have in my hand an old German book called " Dr. Martin Luther 's Pastimes , " or " Zeitverkilrzungen . " It is arranged methodically in fifteen chapters . Among them the quaint writer includes one bearing the title , " Luther burns the papal bulls and books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by which the reformer drove away dull care . Under the head of Luther 's fondness for literature , including ballads and fables , mention is made of his translation of Aesop , made in the midst of pressing cares , at Coburg , while the Diet of Augsburg was in session . Luther himself composed fables . For " Reynard the Fox , " and stories of that class , he had a cordial relish . Erasmus 's " Praise of Folly " delighted him . He was eager to get a copy of More 's " Utopia " when he heard of its appearance . On his journeys , he made up humorous poems and riddles . Many of his letters are in a vein of pleasantry . In music Luther had an unfailing source of pleasure . " Music , " he says , " is a gift and present of God , and not of man . It drives away the devil and makes people joyous . Through it one forgets all wrath , impurity , superciliousness , and other vices . After theology , I give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When weary with work , he would sing after supper or during the meal , and thus banish anxious thought . At times he would busy himself with joiners ' tools . He writes for a lathe and other things of the sort to N uremberg , where they were best made . Still more did he make his garden a refuge from the worry and vexation of brain-toil. // He liked to till the ground and watch the coming out of the blossoms . His favorite game was chess . This predilection he had in common with his contemporaries Leo X. and Charles V. John Frederic , the Elector of Saxony , was playing chess when the messenger brought him the sentence of death which the Emperor had pronounced ; but the noble prince did not suffer the announcement to interrupt the game . Fortunately , the sentence was never carried out . In social and domestic life , Luther was an entertaining companion , mingling mirth and wisdom in a stream of talk of which no one ever grew weary . His marriage to a runaway nun was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bull . He followed his own judgment , letting his friends recover from their consternation as they might , and disregarding the invectives and scoffs of his enemies , which he considered to be inspired by the devil . To the German people he gave an example of domestic life which they could ill spare . His letters to his " Katy " - his " Doctress Katy , " as he was apt to style her-form a diverting portion of his correspondence . When he was bereaved of a child , his heart was broken with sorrow . He could endure public calamities , he said , better than Philip , but not private afflictions of this sort . One of his letters to his children is of special interest ,  --  that in which he pictures heaven as " a lovely and smiling garden , full of children dressed in robes of gold , who play under the trees with beautiful apples , pears , cherries , nuts , and prunes . " There , he adds , are beautiful ponies , with golden bridles ; musical instruments ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is all for good boys who pray and learn well . He has been told that his little son , John Luther , may come into this garden , and bring his sister Madeline . Such a picture , addressed to the imagination of a child , it is doubtful whether another divine of that age , trained to the study of Occam and Gerson , would have thought of painting . To many who have never looked at the Commentary on the Galatians and the other writings in which the doctrine of Luther is presented in a continuous discussion , he is known through the " Table Talk . " This compilation contains some things that Luther never said . Like nearly all similar publications , it requires to be critically sifted . Fexv Boswells are possessed of the accuracy of the biographer of Johnson . But , as it stands , the " Table Talk " of Luther discovers his peculiar genius on almost every page . His greatness and his limitations , his strong faith , and the superstitions , connected especially with demoniac agency , which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are fully and artlessly disclosed . There is a wonderful religious power in his expressions* In one place he says : " If I thoroughly appreciated the first words of the Lord 's Prayer , Our Ta/her which art in Heaven , and really believed that God , who made heaven and earth and all creatures , and has all things in his hand , was my Father , then should I certainly conclude with myself that I also am a lord of heaven and earth , that Christ is my brother , Gabriel my servant , Raphael my coachman , and all the angels my attendants at need , , given unto me by my heavenly Father , to keep me in the path , that unawares I knock not my foot against a stone . " Luther 's egotism is seldom offensive . He speaks of himself as if he were a third person . There is so much in him that , when he touches on himself , the subject is always interesting . " Daniel and Isaiah , " he said , " are most excellent prophets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the advancement of God 's honor , whose work alone it is , and to spite the devil . Philip Melanchthon is Jeremiah : that prophet stood always in fear ; even so it is with Melanchthon . " As Goethe could claim to be a better poet than Tieck without any lack of modesty , seeing that he did not make himself , so Luther did not hesitate to rate himself at something like his proper value . Of the wholesome effect of anger , he remarked , in a familiar passage : " I never work better than when I am inspired by anger ; when I am angry I can write , pray , and preach well , for then my whole temperament is quickened , my understanding sharpened , and all mundane vexations and temp-* tations depart . " No man ever felt more deeply the power of the Bible . " In it , " he says , " thou findest the swaddling clothes and the manger whither the angels directed the poor simple shepherds ; they seem poor and mean , but dear and precious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simplicity , he indulged the hope that , with the completion and diffusion of his version of the Bible , there would be very little need or call for other books , and was quite willing to have his own writings cast aside . Wherever Luther deals with his great doctrine of justification by faith , he is at his best . " But here one may say : The sins which we daily commit offend and anger God ; how then can we be holy ? ' Answer : A mother 's love to her child is much stronger than the distaste of the scurf upon the child 's head . Even so God 's love toward us is far stronger than our uncleanness . Therefore , though we be sinners , yet we lose not thereby our childhood , neither do we fall from grace by reason of our sins . " The prayers of Luther are the spontaneous outpouring // of his heart . Their familiarity of language has been censured ; but , in this respect , they are on the level of the Psalms ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Popedom , " he exclaims , " is mere tongue-threshing ; not prayer , but a work of obedience . Thence a confused din of Horce Canonicce , the howling and babbling in cells and monasteries , where they read and sing the psalms and oollects , without any spiritual devotion , understanding neither the words , sentences , nor meaning . " When he was a monk , he tells us , he used to lock himself up in his cell on Saturdays and make up the omitted prayers for the week . Luther confesses that he could not moderate his language . He had not the gift of Melanchthon . The impetuous flood of thought and emotion broke through all barriers . So his native bluntness and roughness he could not , and , it must be allowed , he did not much seek to , soften down . " Some one sent to know whether it was permissible to use warm water in baptism . The doctor replied : Tell the blockhead that water , warm or cold , is water . " ' For moving eloquence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only knew how to preach , but he could tell the secret to others . One defect , he observes , may eclipse numerous gifts in a preacher . " Dr. J ustus Jonas has all the good virtues and qualities a man may have ; yet merely because he hums and spits , the people can not bear that good and honest man . " Let a preacher stick to his text , and not ramble : " A preacher that will speak everything that comes in his mind is like a maid that goes to market , and , meeting another maid , makes a stand , and they hold a goose-market . " He despised the hunger for applaus&amp; : " 4mbition is the rankest poison to the Church , when it possesses preachers . " " Cursed are all preachers that iii the Church aim at high and loud things , and , neglecting the saving health of the poor , unlearned people , seek their own honor and praise , and therewith to please one or two ambitious persons . When I preach , I sink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of whom are here in this church above forty ; but I have an eye to the multitude of young people , children , and servants , of whom are more than two thousand . I preach to these , directing myself to them that have need thereof . Will not the rest hear me ? The door stands open unto them ; they may begone . " " An upright , godly , and true preacher should direct his preaching to the poor , simple sort of people , like a mother that stills her child , dandles , and plays with it , " etc . " When they come to me , to Melanchthon , to Dr. Pommer , etc . , let them show their cunning , how learned they be ; they shall be well put to their trumps . But to sprinkle out Hebrew , Greek , and Latin in their public sermons , savors merely of show , " etc . It is needless to say how large a place Satan filled in Luther 's thoughts . On his last journey to Eisleben @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke in a letter of the delight it would give the Pope and the devil-two personages whom he often coupled together-if he and Dr. Jonas were to be drowned in the Saale . The tradition connected with the ink-spot at the Wartburg is in keeping with Luther 's habitual ideas of Satanic interference and of the proper way to meet it . It is remarkable that Luther did not share with Melanchthon his faith in astrology . He ridiculed the pretensions of the star-gazers . The large and comprehensive genius of Luther is more manifest as time goes on . His profound and absorbing reverence for the Word of God did not make him a slave to the letter . The freedom of his comments and criticisms has given rise to the imputation of " Rationalism . " Against this aspersion , which was rashly sanctioned by Sir William Hamilton , Luther was triumphantly defended by Julius Hare . If Rationalism signifies a usurpation of the understanding , with disregard of the moral and spiritual function of our being , or if it implies incredulity as regards the Supernatural and Revelation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rationalistic temper than Luther . But his insight into the treasure of truth in the Scriptures gave him a certain liberty and sense of safety in the treatment of incidental and less material elements in them . We even read in the " Table Talk " : " Forsheim said that the first of the five books of Moses was not written by Moses himself . Dr. Luther replied : What matters it , even though Moses did not write it ? It is , nevertheless , Moses 's book , wherein is exactly related the creation of the world . " ' Now that the period of Protestant Scholasticism that followed the first age of the Reformation is passing away , the spirit of Luther , even as a Biblical critic , whatever may be thought of the soundness of particular utterances of his , is more justly appreciated . He stands in closer sympathy with the Church of to-day , in its effort to recognize and define the human as well as the divine factor in the books of the Bible , than do the array of Protestant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose orthodoxy was largely molded by the polemical interest , especially by antagonism to the creed of Trent .
