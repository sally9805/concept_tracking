txt When daylight broke this morning , the high wind of yesterday had subsided and the water was in capital condition for paddling . The races were announced for 3 o'clock in the afternoon and at 10 o'clock Commodore Alden gave the signal to start for Crosbyside , four miles from the islands where the course had been laid out . About 60 sailing canoes and 10 or 15 paddling canoes formed the fleet . There never was a more beautiful sight seen on Lake George than this fleet of canoes gliding up the lake under a gentle breeze . The five Canadian canoes started in advance so that their occupants might stop by the way and pay a visit to Secretary Bishop . Mr. Whitlock , of the New-York Canoe Club , who started out in grand style , carrying a great spread of sail , met with a little mishap on the way to the starting-point , his canoe going over . He soon had the little ship righted , and rejoined tile fleet . When Crosbyside was reached , a meeting of the association was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual business meeting , at which new officers are to be elected , was postponed until this evening , when it is to be held in the log cabin on the island at 8 o'clock . The four races to-day were all paddling races , the last being an upset race . There was a great deal of interest in the first race , the four entries including three of the Canadian visitors in their swift canoes and one American . The course was half a mile down the lake from the Crosbyside lock , around a stakeboat and return . The three Canadians entered were N. D. Beck , E. B. Edwards , and W. P. Shaw , and the American was Capt . Kendall , the veteran sailor and canoe man . The four men all used the single-bladed paddle , and for a few hundred yards they kept well together . Then Edwards forged ahead , with Shaw second , Beck third , and Kendall , the American , last . In this position they rounded the stake-boat , and there was no change throughout the race . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being a bad last , several hundred yards in the rear . In the second race there were nine entries  --  S. Loewenthal , P. B. Snyder , F. C. Cook , J. D. Wilson , W. P. Stevens , H. P. Jones , Dr. Archibald E. Heighway , of the Cincinnati Club ; L. D. Rallston , and F. F. Pruyn . The race was in the hands of Dr. Heighway from the start , much to the delight of the Cincinnatians . He won very easily , Mr. Loewenthal being an excellent second and Stevens third . In the third race , also for paddled canoes , there were nine entries  --  W. P. Stevens , H. T. Keyser , G. L. Morse , W. Whitlock , G. W. Gardiner , Arthur Brentano , E. A. Grenough , Dr. C. A. Neide , and Grant Vandeusen . Dr. Neide won the race in very pretty style . Mr. Vandeusen was second , Mr. Stevens third , and Mr. Morse fourth . Time-5:30 . The upset race was won by Dr. Heighway . Among the canoe men here are Capt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Dr. Charles A. Neide , who are about to start on a cruise of several thousand miles . Secretary Bishop having skirted the north shore of the Gulf of Mexico , these gentlemen intend to go through the lakes and canals to the Mississippi , clown the Mississippi to the Gulf , along the east coast of Mexico and the south shore of the Gulf , across the Caribbean Sea , and to the west end of Cuba , thence to Key West , and up the Atlantic coast . They expect to be gone , for a year or more , and their friends are trying to persuade them to postpone the trip for another year , until more elaborate preparations can be made . All the canoemen here look with admiration at the beautiful open canoes brought from Peterborough . Ontario . They are considered the most perfect models of canoe architecture ever put afloat for open canoes . They are built exactly after the pattern of the Indian birch-bark canoes , and are made of birch wood , each containing about 300 separate pieces .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
