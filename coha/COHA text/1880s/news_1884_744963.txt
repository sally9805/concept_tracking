txt A remedy for deafness has been discovered by an aged resident of Newport . Mr. Edward Smith , of that place , ' has been deaf for many years , the infirmity being the result of extreme old age . Of course , the doctors were - enable to restore the hearing of an octogenarian , and Mr. Smith expected to end his days in deafness. it so happens that Mr. Smith has a son , and that this son has a shop , of some unspecified nature , in Newport . The other day Mr. Smith visited his son 's shop , and fell down the front steps , whether by accident or design is not yet known . The result of the fall was that Mr. Smith struck the frozen ground with his head and immediately recovered ' his hearing . The son is about to apply for a patent covering his new front-steps specific for deafness , and expects to make a rapid fortune by curing his deaf fellow-men . There is a very important question in connection with the cure of Mr. Smith 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striking his head , or was the fact that his fall took place in connection with his son 's front steps the immediate cause of his cure . In other words , does the essence of the new remedy for deafness lie in young Mr. Smith 's front steps or in the operation of falling and knocking one 's head . It is safe to say that in order to cure deafness by a fall , the patient must fall down the front steps of young Mr. Smith 's shop . Falling down other steps will not benefit him , for of the many hundreds of deaf men who have fallen down all sorts of steps Mr. Smith is the , only one who has been cured . Deaf persons who desire to be cured must , then , go to Newport and fall down the front steps of Mr. Smith 's shop . This . wi.11 , of course , render it necessary for Mr. Smith to erect a hotel where his patients can remain while under treatment . Many of them may have to use the remedy for deafness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rule , will require careful nursing in consequence of the shock to the system which the front-steps cure will involve . Thus young Mr. Smith will soon be at the head of a large and profitable front-steps cure institution , and he will make money as rapidly as those ingenious persons who , by taking boarders whom they induce to live chiefly on cold water ; not only achieve fame as " hydropathic " physicians , but reap enormous profits on their table . Mr. Smith , as the sole possessor of the only front steps that will cure deafness , will of course have a monopoly of his remedy , and it is to be hoped that , with a view of increasing his business , he will not adulterate his front steps by enlarging them with new material . The scientific explanation of the way in which Mr. Smith 's steps cure deafness is based upon the theory that , owing to the atmospheric ' conditions of the exact locality where the ' steps are situated , the bacteria that pro-. duce deafness are in such an exceptionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elder Mr. Smith tried instantly kills them . If either of the two ' conditions  --  the peculiar state of the at- ? mosphere or the precise height and slope of the Smith steps  --  were wanting it would probably do a deaf person no sort of good ? to fall down the steps in question . On the contrary , ' it might irritate the bacteria of deafness and lead them to an increased activity . Ibis obvious , from these considerations , that it will be quite impossible for Mr. Smith . to put up in bottles any tincture of his front steps that will be of the slightest medicinal value . The ' front-steps remedy must be used in situ , ( a medical term , meaning " in the front yard , " ) and there ' is no danger that : any designing druggist will ' try to corm-. terfeit and sell it . It seems a lack of judgment that the front-steps remedy should have been discovered in a large and flourishing town like Newport , which needs no help . It ought to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need of a powerful attraction . This is , however , . hypercritical . Let us be thankful that a remedy for deafness has been found , even if a rich and thriving place like Newport is to be benefited by it .
