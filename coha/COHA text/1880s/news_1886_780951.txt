txt A Butte ( Montana ) dispatch to the Pioneer Press says ; " No little anxiety is felt here on account of the state of copper operations in this camp . The Anaconda and St. Lawrence Mines , both owned by the Anaconda. have been shut down . All the ores on hand at the big smelter at Anaconda Town have been cleared up , and the entire works stopped . The ore trains between Butte and Anaconda were taken off yesterday morning . The only men - working at the mines are a few who are operating the pumps . About all that is openly stated is that at the present price of copper the mines can not be worked except at a loss . It is generally believed that another gen. , eral movement to force up the price of copper is contemplated . The recent purchase of the Calumet and Hecla 's output for some time ahead is thought to have been arranged by Marcus Daly , General Manager of the Anaconda Company , and that the present shut-down is in furtherance of the project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England have been already sufficiently shortened to soon result in forcing the prices up consider-ably , so coppermen think . The immediate effect on Butte is to throw about 800 men out of work . It is thought the Parrott Mine will follow suit in a few days . " An Anaconda special adds that the concentrator of the Anaconda Company at that place has also been shut down . The mill of the company will be closed to-day . These suspensions are said to be of indefinite character . Work is con- ' tinned on the new concentrator at Anaconda , on which 300 men are employed . A rumor is also current that the Anaconda Copper Company has sold out to a strong English syndicate organized to control the market .
