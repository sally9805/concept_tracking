txt The annual gathering at Gettysburg , which steadily grows in. interest , ' derives unusual importance this year from the combined circumstances that the present is the twenty-fifth anniversary of the great battle , that the Society of the Army of the Potomac is holding its annual meeting there , and . that many monuments are dedicated on the field . But greater significance is added to the celebration by its having been made the occasion of a reunion both of Southern and Northern veterans . Such reunions , it is true , are . no longer - novelties . During the last half a dozen years , and . particularly since the Spring , of 1885 , they have frequently been . held , though on a much smaller scale than now . A writer in the current number of the Cent-ury magazine has been at the pains to collect the records of these meetings . It is rather noticeable that he finds the first occurring in July . 1881 , on Virginia soil at Luray , between Confederate soldiers of that valley and members of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virginians paid a return visit to Carlisle , where Gov . HOYT , Gen. BEAVER , and others welcomed them . The following month a Trenton post visited . Richmond and was entertained . by Confederates , who , in April , paid a return visit to Trenton . Both the Luray and . Richmond . meetings were brought about by Northern overtures . In October of 1882 there was a three days ' meeting at Gettysburg , something like the present , and . a year later a Newark Grand Army post visited Lee Camp of Confederates at Richmond , receiving a return visit the following year . In 1884 there was another joint gathering of veterans at Gettysburg . In 1885 there were no fewer than six such interchanges of fraternal meetings at Baltimore , Richmond , Annapolis , Auburn , and Owenshorough , and at the latter point an " ex-Federal and ex-Confederate " Soldiers ' Association of Davis County took part . The following year , at the Gettysburg anniversary , there was a cavalry union of both sides , among the participants being Gen. J. B. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were eight reunions at Staunton , Boston , Lynn . Gettysburg , Mexico , Mo . ; Antietam , Evansville , and Kenosaw . The one at Gettysburg , in which PICKETT 'S division and the Philadelphia Brigade took part , was the forerunner of the present far more extensive meeting . This interesting record shows that twenty-four such exchanges of friendly courtesies have occurred during the last seven years and that they are increasing in number . The impulse of these movements may be traced back to Appomattox , - where Gen. GRANT 'S kindly thought for the needs of the vanquished and instinctive consideration of them as from that moment fellowcountrymen. in our common Union produced a profound impression ? and set the keynote for the Government , and above all for Union veterans everywhere . It is but just also to recall that at the meeting of the Army of the Potomac at Saratoga last Summer even those members who had taken strong ground . on the battle-flag question " were among the most eager to arrange for the present fraternal gathering at Gettysburg . It has sometimes been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  whether they do not tend . to dull the keen sense of the righteousness of the cause involved in the war and to belittle instead of increasing the obligation of allegiance to the Union . The reply is that more and . more , as the years roll on , those who lost become convinced . that it is well that they lost , and certainly those that won are not likely to underrate the importance of their victory . The hearty ' acceptance of the results of the war and . the unreserved pledg ? of fidelity to the Government and . renunciation of the right of secession , after its submission to the arbitrament of the sword , wore noticeable among Confederate veterans at the outset ; but of late years equally noticeable has been the growth of a desire to give utterance to the conviction that the whole question was not only settled , but settled . in the better way . Surely among influences tending to foster such convictions are the fraternal reunions of the blue and the gray .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
