txt There will be no question among honorable men of any country that the application made to Mr. LowELL by certain Scotch holders of the bonds of the Oregon Railway is highly indecent .. The grievance of the Scotch bondholders is that , . having subscribed the money , or part of it , with which the road was built , and having by their agents , the Directors , leased the road to the Oregon Navigation Company , that corporation has disregarded the lease and thrown the road , in a damaged condition , back upon the hands of the Scotch bondholders . It appears that this statement of fact is traversed in various particulars . It is alleged that the road in which the Scotch bondholders put their money does not pay its operating expenses ; that the lease , instead-of being rejected by the lessees , was void from the beginning , and that the road is in as goOd condition now as it ever was . These allegations would be relevant . if they were made in a suit brought by the Scotch bondholders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case have nothing to do with the indecency of the application to the Minister of the United States . The Government of the United States has no relation to the matter . It is not concerned with the securities either as debtor or guarantor . It has never undertaken that individual Scotchmen should get the better of all bargains that they might make with individual Americans , nor even that individual Americans should pay what they owed individual Scotch7. men . It has provided tribunals in which the claims of Scotchmen against Americans could be tried . It is not alleged that these tribunals are witrustworty . If they were , it was the business of a Scotch investor to know that fact , and to take it into account as one of the risks of an American investment instead of trotting to the Government of the United States when he found he had made a bad bargain . The attitude of a man who has invested in a certain . security , say at 80 per cent . discount , and when he ascertains that it is not worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " is never heroic or inspiring . Most men under these circumstances have the sense to remember the maxim caveat emptor , or its English equivalent , and to reflect  --  that " good interest means bad security . " The application of these Scotchmen to a foreign Government to protect them from the consequences of their own improvidence in dealing with its citizens is , so far as we know , unprecedented . It will scarcely be pretended that Scotchmen are in a peculiar sense the wards of all nations , and that hurahnity requires all Governments to see that they make money on all occasions out of all other people . The Scotchmen themselves can usually be trusted to look out for that . Nevertheless the appearance of these Scotchmen petitioning the American Government to " do something " for them , as for instance to appropriate from the Treasury the money they have lost , together with the profits they think they ought to have made , is not unaccountable . It is one of the consequences which we might expect to follow the Egyptian policy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the benefit of individual Britons who had bought Egyptian bonds very cheap and who subsequently discovered that they might . have bought them still cheaper if they had waited . It is true that the case was not quite the same as that presented by the Scotch bondholders , seeing that in . Egypt it was the Government itself which was t in default , and that money could not be collected of ' the Government by suits in its own courts , whereas here the debtor is merely a private corporation , the debts of which its Government is apparently asked to guarantee . Still , the principle being admitted that a Government may properly constitute itself a receiver of the property of another Government for the benefit of its creditors , the Scotchmen may be par ; cloned , in their anxiety to get their money back , for not seeing exactly where the line is to be drawn . Perhaps they will , apply to Mr. GLADSTONE , setting forth that they desire their investment and its profits , and that the United States , though perfectly solvent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'S answer to this application ought to be ' one of the greatest efforts of his life .
