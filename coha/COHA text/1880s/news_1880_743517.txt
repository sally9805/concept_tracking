txt It is a somewhat singular circumstance that what is known in England as industrial insurance has made very little headway in this country . Several of our life insurance companies have incorporated it into their systems of business , but we have yet to hear of a single instance in which it has netted to a company even a moderate return for the time and money expended in bringing the method to the attention of the public . It is hard to reconcile this failure to succeed on any ground that is creditable to the working classes of this country . One does not like to believe that men in humble circumstances in America are less provident than are those similarly situated in England , and the large number of small deposits made in our savings banks would indicate an active desire to provide for future contingencies . Still , a full knowledge of the uncertainty of life , and the necessity of securing those who are dependent upon one from absolute penury , is a theory of man 's duty that has not yet taken a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is confined pretty closely to those who belong to what might be termed the well-to-do class , and the same comment holds true when one takes into account the mutual benefit societies which have in recent years become so common in the large cities of the country . It may be said that improvidence with us is-not attended with the bitter consequences that a similar disregard for the future entails in older and more densely settled countries . The chances for the old and young to earn enough to support themselves are much more plentiful here than elsewhere , and the knowledge of this begets an indifference to the future and a hand-to-mouth style of living among those whose weekly income is contracted to the point where the surplus which may be spent in amusements and enjoyments is exceedingly small . A mechanic may argue : Why should I insure my life for the benefit of my son , when before I die he may be a. wealthy merchant ? and although the chances of such a change may be slight , they are certainly many times greater here than they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it is usually carried out in Great Britain consists in having the payments of premium made weekly , instead of annually , and in allowing these to range from a penny.a week upward . It is obvious that the cost of carrying on such a system is one drawback to its success , since the man who pays each Monday to a company a shilling , puts the corporation to a much greater amount of expense in clerical labor ? than a policy-holder - who annually makes a payment of ? 100 , and hence the ratio of expense in companies that transact this class of business must be considerably larger than . with those that confine themselves to ' the ordinary forms of life underwriting . But , in spite of this qualification , the method seems to be uncommonly popular in England , and one company receives each year more than $7,000,000 in premiums from those holding policies of this kind , an amount which exceeds the entire premium receipts of all but one or two of our largest companies . If the English exercised the same State supervision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of expense incurred in carrying on this business might be determined , for it can not decrease with the accretion of premium receipts at the same rate that the cost of insurance does when annual payments are made . But the data needed for a comparative estimate are not obtainable , though , in their absence , it is safe to say that the outgo in office expenses must be relatively two or three times greater in industrial than in common insurance . Encouraged by the hold that this method has taken upon the English working classes , a company has just been organized in London for the purpose of carrying on the business of fire insurance on a similar basis . Before the plan has been put to a trial it may be rash to condemn it , but we are as confident as we well can be that a scheme of this kind would never succeed in America , and as it seems to us that the conditions of success are more favorable in this country than in England , it is difficult to understand what inducements capitalists there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such an undertaking . The assumption is that the working and industrial classes have household goods , furniture , and the like , which they would insure if the payment of a single annual premium did not constitute a seemingly insurmountable barrier . Now , it is well known that the insurance rates in most of the English towns and cities are much lower than those obtained in this country , for the very good reason that the fires there are not as numerous , and the losses by them are much smaller ; and , hence , if we take the current rates of premium in this City as a test , we should be understating rather than overstating the difficulties such a company would have to contend with . A mechanic has , let us say , household effects which he values at $250 , or ? 50 , and this , taking the class whose business the company aims to do , in its entirety , would be a high average . In this City the annual premium upon this would be in the neighborhood of a dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulty in determining its exact worth in case of a loss . In other words , the rate would be about four times as great as the occupant of a dwelling on Murray Hill would pay for insuring his household furniture . But , in spite of this high percentage , the amount asked is so small that any one who has been able to save the money needed to purchase the property upon which insurance is desired could certainly raise it for the payment of a lump sum . If the company was to receive this premium in weekly installments it would have to increase the rate two or three fold to pay the expense of receiving and accounting f &; the money ; and it hardly needs to be pointed out that the man who went fifty-two times a year to the company 's office to pay his weekly premium of four or six cents would have to put a very low valuation on the worth of his time in order to make the plan " at all profitable to him . We should fancy that a very little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Era Industrial Fire Insurance Company ( Limited ) " that the friction in their proposed machinery was more than sufficient to neutralize its probable momentum .
