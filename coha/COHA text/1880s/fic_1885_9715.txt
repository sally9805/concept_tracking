( ABDAL about to go into store , stops when CHAPMAN speaks , bows very graciously to CHAPMAN . CHAPMAN crosses to C. , to ABDAL ) Ah , Calvin , you are just in time . Brother Blurton informed me that Lem Ransom has been let out of prison . ( Retaining a mild manner ) ABDAL . That horrid man is certainly a disgrace to this community . CHAPMAN . ( Soothingly , to hoodwink characters ) Do n't be too severe with the poor fellow . HO'TEN . That 's a bluff ! ( Seated on bench R. ) CHAPMAN . But I was just asking Mr. Startle  --  ( Bus. , impressing upon STARTLE 'S mind what is wanted ) who is our sworn and paid protector ( STARTLE swells with pride ) if he did n't think it would be a good idea to try and persuade him to leave this place . BLURTON . ( L. ) It 's easier tew keep the devil out , than put him out . ABDAL . You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between CHAPMAN and ABDAL ) Had n't yew orter giv ' a man a chance ? ABDAL .

( To HO'TEN ) There is no use making any fuss about it ; what has been said is simply for Mr. Ransom 's good . HO'TEN . Waal , he 's the best jedge o ' thet , I guess . When the fox preaches take keer o ' the lambs . ( Nods to DARIUS , " Thet 's the way to talk to ' em " ) ( BLURTON sits on steps , L. , listening . ) DARIUS . Thet 's right , Curtis . ( Sits on bench L. platform ) CHAPMAN . ( Going to ABDAL ) What have you found out about our new Minister ? ABDAL . ( R. ) From what I learn , he is one of those ministers who try to make religion attractive . CHAPMAN . ( L. of ABDAL , D. R. ) Ah , that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never ; never ! ABDAL . ( Read lively , sermonizing . With energy ) I am sorry to say that it is the tendency today , for a number of churches to go into the amusement business . The services are turned into musical displays , and sermons into political harangues ; the church must draw , so they give semi-dramatic performances , ( BLURTON sitting steps , L. , groans ) the preacher must be famous for his racy style , eccentric manner , and flashes of wit , he must venture a tear now and then , and wipe them away with a ripple of smiles , and some times a round of applause ( BLURTON groans ) Just the same as some favorite play actor , the bare old gospel fails . ( BLURTON groans loudly . DARIUS threatens BLURTON with handcuffs . BLURTON agrees with ABDAL . HO'TEN and DARIUS do not . ) CHAPMAN . Is that the kind of minister this Thaddeus Strong is ?

Calvin , as you do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter part of September , I should like to have the benefit of your wise council in ( Patting ABDAL on the arm ) this most important proceeding . As they would n't give me any voice in the matter , I should let them take what they get ; but , this Mr. Strong may find some opposition . ( BLURTON groans , " Yes , yes " ) The world and Satan may have the monopoly of fun and sin ; it does n't belong to the church . BLURTON . ( Groans ) No , no , no . DARIUS . ( To HO'TEN ) Say , if he do n't quit buttin ' in , I 'll jug him , sure 's Jehosifat . CHAPMAN . What 's getting into the people that they are trying to find out so much ? Our grandathers did n't ask the whys and wherefores of things . HO'TEN . ( Interrupting , rising ) No wonder they did n't ask questions , ( CHAPMAN and ABDAL look at HO'TEN with surprise ) w'en they wur answered by the stocks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dummer than death . CHAPMAN . It 's a pity you did n't live in those days . HO'TEN . ( R. on bench , platform . Drily ) I guess I 'd er died young . CHAPMAN . ( To ABDAL ) Ah , they were grand old days . ( ABDAL and CHAPMAN to steps . ABDAL and BLURTON shake heads " Yes . " CHAPMAN takes ABDAL 'S arm and both go up steps to door ) BLURTON . ( DARIUS seated on bench L. Groans ) Yes ; yes ; yes ! ( DARIUS imitates groans . ) CHAPMAN . But , now it 's nothing but a mixture of millinery and gossip . ( To HO'TEN ) HO'TEN . ( Quietly ) Which is quite an improvement . CHAPMAN . Yes , for such people as you , it is . ( ABDAL moves to doorway C. , turns . ) HO'TEN . ( With force ) Yaas , an ' I hope it 'll keep on improvin ' , ' til we git rid ov all the old spinnin ' wheels  --  ( Tapping on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no matter who they b'long tew . CHAPMAN .

( Modestly ) Besides , it would look very hasty to these people . STRONG . Which is just the way I would have it look to them . ( With force ) The time for a man to marry the girl he loves is when she needs his care . As Mrs. Strong , you can hold up your head and look them straight in the eye , and if they do not care to recognize my wife , I can at least make them respect her . NANCE . But a wife should not be a burden to her husband , and my love shall cast no shadows on you . STRONG . I should like to share them with you , as a part of a husband 's duty . ( Offers hand ) NANCE . I am not willing you should . And that is my only reason for asking you to wait . Perhaps father will speak some day , and lift the great cloud hanging over us . ( NANCE turns , going towards door L.

" ( Dejectedly ) LEM . ( Surprised ) You told him no ? NANCE . Yes , I told him I could not marry him until the truth was told about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to LEM ) Why do n't you tell about it ? Why should you let the innocent suffer ? Did the great pattern you go by do that ? LEM . To see you married to a man like Mr. Strong , I would do most anything , but would it make my crime any less ? No ? it would only grow greater by betrayal , and silence so far , has served my purpose best . NANCE . But at what a cost to me . LEM . ( Patting her hand . NANCE goes to him ) You would n't like to see him driven away from here , would you ? NANCE . But , if you will not speak , how can we prevent it ? LEM . ( Sits , works ) I can not tell you now , as what I shall do , depends on what others may do . NANCE . ( Eagerly ) But , will it be soon ? LEM . Yes , if it 's your wish and his , I promise it shall be very soon .

And he will like you all the better for it . NANCE . I confess I have been impatient . ( Turns to LEM ) But when we were sinking , he was the first one who stretched forth a hand to save us , and is it any wonder I should cling to it ? LEM . ( On bench ) No , but if Thaddeus Strong is the man I take him to be , he will not let you sink . NANCE . I have done you both a great wrong . ( Enter STRONG L. F. , from L. ) STRONG . Good-morning , Nancy .

( Turning , goes up to table , puts hat on table ) What is it all about ? STRONG . ( Going towards NANCE  --  LEM watching STRONG , reaches out hand to speak to him , which STRONG does n't see ) It seems that Foss ' store at the East end of town was broken into during the night , and a wild man has escaped from some neighboring asylum and the whole population seems to be running about like mad . ( To NANCE carelessly ) Tell me , was your brother at home early last night ? NANCE . ( U. L. ) Yes . ( Alarmed ) But why do you ask ? ( Looking at LEM and STRONG ) What is it ? ( To STRONG ) Why father asked me the same question . STRONG . ( Glances at LEM , sees the mistake he has made , smoothes it over ) I did n't suppose it amounted to anything , just a little idle gossip , that is all . NANCE . ( Going to STRONG in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ STRONG . They say some boys did it . Joe is not the only boy in town . Mr. Startle is suspicious of everyone .

F. in haste  --  seeing STRONG , goes to him nervously ) ESTHER . I am glad I have found you . Did you hear about the wild man ? STRONG . Why , yes ; but I hardly believed it . ESTHER . I did n't at first , but when it began to grow , I got frightened . ( Goes to NANCE L. , places arm around her ) STRONG . ( Takes chair , sits by LEM . Turns to ESTHER , pleasantly ) You will soon become one of them . ( Turns to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LEM . ( On bench ) Yes , I found the Wilburs getting along all right . Mr. Ho'ten sent them a lot of things , but I forgot , I was n't to say anything about it . STRONG . That is like him . ESTHER . ( U. L. C. ) Is your new dress finished ? NANCE . ( U. R. C. ) Almost . Would you like to see it ? ( Crossing to D. R. ) ESTHER . Well , I suppose I would n't be a woman if I did n't . ( Exits with NANCE , D. R. ) STRONG . ( Seated near bench . To LEM ) How about Mrs. Smiley 's two boys ? Are they at school ? LEM . Why , yes  --  the poor little fellows were ashamed of their rags . STRONG . And the better dressed laughed at them . LEM . But the suits you sent has set them right , and they go willingly now . STRONG . ( A short pause , seated ) Mr. Ransom , I have asked your daughters to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will perhaps explain to you she refuses me . LEM . She has already explained it to me . STRONG . Then we can speak plainly to each other . My haste in this step is caused by my desire to relieve her distress and yours . LEM . ( R. C. ) Why , I never felt happier in all my life . STRONG . ( R. C. ) Oh , I do not mean the distress of poverty , but the distress of disrespect . I wish to lift you both out of it . LEM . And I suppose you think that I do n't do much to help you by not confessing . ( Looks at STRONG , as if he was mistaking him ) STRONG . Well , now that you 've opened that subject , let us finish it right here . ( LEM shows surprise ) I have been thinking of what you said to Mr. Chapman last Sunday at my house , and I gathered from it that you have something of importance to tell . LEM . Yes , I have . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would compromise your honor . LEM . Yes . STRONG . ( Emphatically ) Then I do not wish you to tell it . ( Shouts in distance off . LEM drops head in shame ) There is no greater disrespect than loss of honor , even in a dishonest transaction . ( Rising , taking back chair . Shouts outside ) LEM . Is the meeting to be private ? STRONG . No , it is open to the public , as I understand it . LEM . Then I must be there , or they will turn you out . ( In a loud tone of voice ) STRONG . ( Going R. , towards door ) No , not even at that price . ( Music TREMOLO . From this point until final curtain there must be no hesitation or wait for applause .

( Down to LEM ) I escaped three days ago , and they 've been hunting me like a wild beast , but I managed to double on them , and you must help me out . LEM . In wot way ? FRAZIER . ( Very rapid ) Hide me until they get off my track . Give me an old suit and a few dollars . Did you hear that shot in the woods a while ago ? ( Indicating direction off L. ) LEM . Yaas . FRAZIER . That was meant for me ? STRONG . The wild man . ( Shouts loud outside as JACK rushes up to the window R. ) FRAZIER . ( Coming down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must hide me somewhere ? ( To window L.

If I hide ye an ' you 're found people will never b'lieve me agin . ( Coming R. STRONG advances , listens . ) FRAZIER . And you 're the man I 'd bet my life on . ( Bus. , savagely , advancing on LEM C. ) You 'd would n't give me up , would you ? LEM . Oh , no . I wo n't go back on ye , but I do n't wanter go back on myself . FRAZIER .

We must see each other before she goes , then I 'll be willing to go back and serve a lifetime . ( Up to window . Shouts very low during this speech , gradually rising up to loud ) LEM . And my wife died while I was in prison . ( To STRONG ) Tell me what tew dew . STRONG . ( Goes quickly to trap , lifts it and turns to FRAZIER ) Go down there . ( To LEM ) I will go to Nancy for she must not know . ( Going to door C. JACK crosses to steps ) And you join me as soon as you can . ( Exits hastily , D. R. ) Note : 1Kb LEM .

I have handled them to such advantage that they are now worth four times as much as they were . LEM . Then the Widder will be just four times as well to do . CHAPMAN .
