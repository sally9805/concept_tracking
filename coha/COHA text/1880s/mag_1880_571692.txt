WASHINGTON IRVING . IT is twenty years since the death of Washington Irving removed that personal presence which is always a powerful and sometimes the sole stimulus to the sale of an author 's books , and which strongly affects the contemporary judgment of their merits . It is almost a century since his birth , which was nearly coeval with that of the republic . For fifty years Irving charmed and instructed the American people , and was the author who held on the whole the first place in their affections . As he was the first to lift American literature into the popular respect of Europe , so for a long tinib he was the chief representative of the American name in the world of letters . During this period , probably no citizen of the republic , except the Father of his Country , had so wide a reputation as his namesake , Washington Irving . It is time to inquire what basis this great reputation had in enduring qualities , and whether it was largely a social product , and ephemeral . To enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this essay . Within the necessary limits prescribed for it , I can not critically examine his various works , nor even outline the manner of their production , nor sketch in any detail the triumphs of his literary career . I shall attempt only a study of one period , - the formative period of his life as a man of letters , - and pass from that to some observations upon his rank and the character of his literary work . Washington Irving was born in the city of New York , April 3 , 1785 , and was the eighth son in a fa*nily of eleven children . his father , William Irving , was a sailor from Shafiaska , one of the Orkney Islands , who traced his descent from William de Irwyn , the armorbearer and secretary of Robert Bruce . In 1761 he married Sarah Sanders , a beautiful girl , whose acquaintance he made at the seaport of Falmouth , England , and two years later settled in New York as a trader . He was a successful merchant until the outbreak of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staunch whig . and his wife was distinguished for her merciful ministrations to the patriot prisoners confined in the city . Our author was born in William Street , and spent his boyhood there in an old-time house about half-way between Fulton and John , that was not pulled down till 1849 , within ten years of his death . New York at the time of his birth was a rural city , clustered about the Battery , of about twenty-three thousand inhabitants . It did not extend northward quite to the site of the present City Hall Park , and beyond that , then and for several years afterwards , were only country residences , orchards , and corn-fields . The city was half burned down during the war , and had emerged from it in a dilapidated condition . There was still a marked separation between the Dutch and the English residents , though the Irvin gs seem to have been on terms of intimacy with the best of both nationalities . The habits of living were primitive ; the manners were agreeably free ; conviviality at the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of use in conversation . Society was the reverse of intellectual : the aristocracy were the merchants and traders ; what literary culture found expression was formed on English models , dignified and plentifully garnished with Latin and Greek allusions ; the commercial spirit ruled , and the relaxations and amusements partook of its hurry and excitement . In their gay , hospitable , and mercurial character , the inhabitants were // true progenitors of the present metropoils . A newspaper had been established in 1732 , and a theatre had existed since 1750 . Although the town had a rural aspect , with its quaint dormer-window houses , its straggling lanes and roads , and the water-pumps in the middle of the streets , it had the character of a city , and already much of the metropolitan air . These were the surroundings in which the boy 's literary talent was to develop . His father was a deacon in the Presbyteriari church , - a sedate , God-fearing man , with the strict severity of the Scotch Covenanter , serious in his intercourse with his family , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not without tenderness in his nature , but the exhibition of it was repressed on principle , - a man of high character and probity , greatly esteemed by his associates . He endeavored to bring up his children in sound religious principles , and to leave no room in their lives for triviality . One of the two weekly half-holidays was required for the catechism , and the only relaxation from the three church services on Sunday was the reading of the Pilgrim 's Progress . This cold and severe discipline at home would have been intolerable but for the more lovingly demonstrative and impulsive character of the mother , whose gentle nature and fine intellect won the tender veneration of her children . Of the father they stood in awe ; his conscientious piety failed to waken any religious sensibility in them , and they revolted from a teaching which seemed to regard everything that was pleasant as wicked . The mother , brought up an Episcopalian , conformed to the religious forms and worship of her husband , but she was never in sympathy with his rigid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their father , and subsequently all of them except one became attached to the Episcopal church . Washington , in order to make sure of his escape , and feel safe while he was still constrained to attend his father 's church , went stealthily to Trinity church at an early age , and received the rite of confirmation . The boy was full of vivacity , drollery , and innocent mischief . He had a love of music , which became later in life a passion , and great fondness for the theatre . This latter stolen delight he first tasted in company with a boy who was somewhat his senior , but destined to be his literary comrade , James K. Paulding , whose sister was the wife of Irving 's brother William . Whenever he could afford this indulgence , he stole away early to the theatre in John Street , and remained until it was time to return to family prayers at nine , after which he would retire to his room , slip through his window and down the roof to a back alley , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education was desultory , pursued under several more or less incompetent masters , and was over at the age of sixteen . The teaching does not seem to have had much discipline or solidity ; he studied Latin a few months , but made no other incursion into the classics . The handsome , tender-hearted , truthful , susceptible boy was no doubt a dawdler in routine studies , but he assimilated what suited him . He found his food in such pieces of English literature as were floating about , in Robinson Crusoe and Sinbad . At ten he was inspired by a translation of Orlando Furioso . He devoured books of voyages and travel ; he could turn a neat verse , and his scribbling propensities were exercised in the composition of childish plays . The fact was that the boy was a dreamer and saunterer ; he himself says that he used to wander about the pier heads in fine weather , watch the ships departing on long voyages , and dream of going to the ends of the earth . His brothers Peter and John had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington would have had the same advan // tage if he had not shown a disinclination to methodical study . At the age of sixteen he entered a law office , but he was a heedless student , and never acquired either a taste for the profession or much knowledge of law . While he sat in the law office he read literature , and made considerable progress in his self-culture ; but he liked rambling and society quite as well as books . In 1798 we find him passing a summer holiday in Westchester County , and exploring with his gun the Sleepy Hollow region , which he was afterwards to make an enchanted realm ; and in 1800 he made his first voyage up the Hudson , the beauties of which he was the first to celebrate , on a visit to a married sister who lived in the Mohawk Valley . In 1802 he became a law clerk in the office of Josiah Ogden Hoffman , and began that enduring intimacy with the refined and charming Hoffman family which was so deeply to influence all his life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were now alarmed by symptoms of pulmonary weakness . This physical disability no doubt had much to do with his disinclination to severe study . For the next two or three years much time was consumed in excursions up the Hudson and the Mohawk , and in adventurous journeys as far as the wilds of Ogdensburg and to Montreal , to the great improvement of his physical condition , and in the enjoyment of the gay society of Albany , Schenectady , Ballston , and Saratoga Springs . These explorations and visits gave him material for future use , and exercised his pen in agreeable correspondence ; but his tendency at this time , and for several years afterwards , was to the idle life of a man of society . Whether the literary impulse which was born in him would have ever insisted upon any but an occasional and fitful expression , except for the necessities of his subsequent condition , is doubtful . Irving 's first literary publication was a series of letters , signed Jonathan Oldstyle , contributed in 1802 to the Morning Chronicle , a newspaper recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audacious satires of the theatre , the actors , and their audience attracted is evidence of the literary poverty of the period . The letters are open imitations of the Spectator and the Tatler , and although sharp upon local follies are of no consequence at present except as foreshadowing the sensibility and quiet humor of the future author , and his chivalrous devotion to woman . What is worthy of note is that a boy of nineteen should turn aside from his caustic satire to protest against the cruel and unmanly habit of jesting at ancient maidens . It was enough for him that they were women , and possessed the strongest claim upon our admiration , tenderness , and protection . Irving 's health continued so much impaired when he came of age , in 1804 , that his brothers determined to scud him to Europe ; and he took passage in May in a sailing vessel for Bordeaux , his consumptive appearance impressing the captain with the foreboding that he would not live to cross the Atlantic . His absence was prolonged till January , 1806 . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disturbed condition , passed into Italy , visited Sicily , sojourned in Paris , and reached London by way of Belgium . His journey , although interesting in itself and made at a period of feverish political excitement and transition , was not immediately fruitful in a literary way , and need not detain us . It was the irresolute pilgrimage of a man who had not yet received his vocation . Everywhere he was received in the best society , and the charm of his manner and his ingenuous nature made him everywhere a favorite . He carried that indefinable passport which society recognizes , and which needs no vis*i . He saw the people who were famous , the women whose recognition is a social reputation ; he made // many valuable friends , - not the least valuable of whom were Americans sojourning abroad ( some of whom , like Washington Allston and Newton , were to have a career ) ; he dabbled in art , and was seriously tempted by Allston to remain in Rome and become a painter ; lie frequented the theatre ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dine and to appreciate the delights of a brilliant salon ; he was picking up languages ; he was observing nature and men , and especially women . His excuse for writing little from Paris , whose gayety and brightness fascinated him , was , " I am a young man , and in Paris . " That he profited by his loitering experience is plain enough afterwards , but thus far there was little to prophesy that Irving would be anything more in life than a charming fidneur. iNor on his return to America , with r&amp;stablished health , did his life at first take on more serious purpose . He was admitted to the bar , but he still halted . Society more than ever attracted him and devoured his time . He willingly accepted the office of " champion at the tea-parties . " He was one of a knot of young fellows of literary tastes and convivial habits who delighted to be known as " the nine worthies , " or " the lads of Kilkenny . " They had jolly suppers at the humble taverns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country house on the Passaic , which is celebrated in the Salmagundi papers as Cockloft Hall . There was some affectation of roistering in all this , but it was a time of social good fellowship and easy freedom of manners in both sexes . At the dinners there was much sentimental and bacchanalian singing ; it was scarcely good manners not to get a little tipsy , and to be laid under the table by the compulsory bumper was not to the discredit of the guest . These young gentlemen liked to be thought " sad dogs . " That they were less abandoned than they pretended to be the sequel shows ; among Irving 's associates at this period who attained honorable consideration were John and Gouverneur Kemble , Henry Brevoort , Henry Ogden , James K. Paulding , and Washington 's brother Peter . The saving influence for all of them was the refined households they frequented , and the association with women who were high-spirited without prudery , and who united purity and simplicity with wit , vivacity , and charm of manner . There is some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belle of the time , who married the tragedian , Thomas A. Cooper , - the " fascinating Farlie , " as Irving calls her , and the " Sophie Sparkle " of the Salmagundi . Irving 's susceptibility to the charms and graces of women - a susceptibility which continued always fresh - was tempered and ennobled by the most chivalrous admiration for the sex as a whole . He placed them on an almost romantic pinnacle , but his actions always conformed to his romantic ideal . In a letter to Miss Farlie , written from Richmond , where he was attending the trial of Aaron Burr , he expresses his exalted opinion of the sex . It was said , in acconnting for the open sympathy of the ladies with the prisoner , that Burr had always been a favorite with the sex ; " but I am not inclined , " writes Irving , " to account for it in so ilhiberal a manner ; it results from that merciful , that heavenly disposition implanted in the female bosom , which ever inclines in favor of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high strain in which I have indulged ; believe me , it is because I feel it ; and I love your sex ten times better than ever. ** Personally , Irving must have awakened a reciprocal admiration . A drawing by Yanderlyn in Paris in 1805 , and a portrait by Jarvis in 1809 , present him to us in the fresh bloom of manly beauty . The face has an air of distinction and gentle breeding ; the refined lines , the poetic chin , the sensitive mouth , the // shapely nose , the large , dreamy eyes , the intellectual forehead , and the clustering brown locks are our ideal of the writer of the Sketch Book and the Pilgrim in Spain . A relation , who saw much of our author in his latter years , writes me , " He had dark gray eyes , a handsome straight nose , which might perhaps be called large , a broad , high , full forehead , and a small mouth . I should call him of medium height , about five feet eight and one half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stout . There was no peculiarity about his voice ; but it was pleasant , and had a good intonation . His smile was exceedingly genial , lightening up his whole face , and rendering it very attractive ; while if he were about to say anything humorous , it would beam forth from his eyes even before the words were spoken . As a young man his face was exceedingly handsome , and his head was well covered with dark hair ; but from my earliest recollection of him , he wore neither whiskers nor mustache , but a dark brown wig , which , although it made him look younger , concealed a beautifully shaped head . " We can understand why he was a favorite in the society of Baltimore , Washington , Philadelphia , and Albany , as well as of New York , and why he liked to linger here and there , sipping the social sweets , like a man born only to leisure and seemingly idle observation of life . It was in the midst of these social successes , and just after his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided evidence of the choice of a career . This was his association with Paulding and his eldest brother William in the publication of Salmagundi , a semimonthly periodical , which ran with tolerable regularity through twenty numbers , and stopped in the full tide of success , with the whimsical indifference to the public which had characterized its every number . Its declared purpose was " simply to instruct the young , re form the old , correct the town , and castigate the age . " In form and manner it was an imitation of the Spectator and the Citizen of the World . Its wit , and to some extent its humor , were original ; but so perfectly was it adapted to local conditions that it may be profitably read to-day as a not untrue reflection of the manners and spirit of the time and city . Its amusing audacity and complaisant superiority , the mystery hanging about its writers , its pretense of indifference to praise or profit , its caustic wit , contagious humor , and pungent criticism , piqued , puzzled , and delighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success . It had a circulation in other cities , and many imitations of it sprung up . Notwithstanding some affectations and puerilities , it is still readable . Of course , if it were offered now to the complex and sophisticated society of New York , it would fail to attract anything like the attention it received in the days of simplicity ; but the same wit , insight , and literary art , informed with the modern spirit and turned upon the follies and " whim-whams " of the metropolis , would undoubtedly have a great measure of success . In Irving 's contributions to it may be traced the germs of nearly everything he did afterwards : in it he tried the various stops of his genius ; he discovered his own power ; his career was determined ; thereafter it was only a question of energy or necessity . Irving did not , however , immediately devote himself to literature , nor seem to regard his achievements in it as anything more than aids to social distinction . Like many young lawyers with little law and less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could not adapt himself to the unseemly association and nauseous work demanded ( at that time ) of a ward politician , and was soon disgusted with it . He unsuccessfully solicited some appointment at Albany ; a very modest solicitation , which // was never repeated . Although a federalist , and , as he described himself , " an admirer of General Hamilton , and a partisan with him in politics , " he accepted a retainer from Burr 's friends in 1807 , and attended his trial in Richmond , more in the capacity of an observer of the scene than as a lawyer . He did not share the prevalent opinion of Burr 's treason , and regarded him as a man so fallen as to be shorn of the power to injure the country , for whom he could feel nothing but compassion . Not long after the discontinuance of Salmagundi , Irving , in connection with his brother Peter , projected the work which was to make him famous . At first nothing more was intended than a satire upon Dr. Samuel Mitchell 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was begun as a mere burlesque upon pedantry and erudition , and was well advanced , when Peter was called by his business to Europe , and its completion was left to Washington . In his mind the idea expanded into a different conception . He condensed the mass of affected learning into five introductory chapters , - as Irving afterwards said , it would have been improved if it had been reduced to one , - and finished the History of New York , by Diedrick Knickerbocker , substantially as we now have it . This was in 1809 , when Irving was twenty-six years old . But before this humorous creation was completed , the author endured the terrible bereavement which was to color his whole life . He had formed a deep and t6nder passion for Matilda Hoffman , the second daughter of Josiah Ogden Hoffman , in whose family he had long been on a footing of the most perfect intimacy ; and his ardent love was fully reciprocated . Irving was restlessly casting about for some assured means of livelihood , which would enable him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was connected with this desire , - when , almost without warn ing , Miss Hoffman died , in the eighteenth year of her age . Without being a dazzling beauty , she was lovely in person and mind , with most engaging manners , a refined sensibility , and a delicate and playful humor . The loss was a crushing blow to Irving , from the effects of which he never recovered , although time softened the bitterness of his grief into a tender and sacred memory . He could never bear any allusion to her , even from his most intimate friends . After his death , in a private repository , of which he always kept the key , was found a lovely miniature , a braid of fair hair , and a strip of paper , on which was written , in his own hand , " Matilda Hoffman ; " . and with these treasures were several pages of a memorandum , in ink long since faded . He kept through life her Bible and her Prayer Book ; they were placed nightly under his pillow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and ever after they were the inseparable companions of all his wanderings . This memorandum , it subsequently appeared , was a copy of a letter addressed to Mrs. Foster , a married lady , in which the story of his early love was related as a reason why he had never married . It was in 1823 , while he sojourned in Dresden , that he became intimate with an English family residing there , named Foster , and conceived for the daughter , Miss Emily Foster , a deep attachment . That this would have resulted in marriage if the lady 's affection had not been preoccupied the Fosters believed . Irving 's biographer thinks otherwise , and gives reasons for believing that he could not at that time have entertained a project of matrimony . It is not for us to question his judgment , with his full knowledge of the circumstances ; yet it is evident that Irving was very seriously impressed , and very much unsettled until he drove away the impression by hard work with his pen ; and it would be nothing new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the time , yielded to the attractions of loveliness and a most congenial companionship , and had returned again to an exclusive devotion to the image of the early loved and lost . The reception of the History of New York is too well known to need description . Its success was far beyond Irving 's expectation . It met almost universal acclaim . It is true that some of the old Dutch inhabitants , who sat down to its perusal expecting to read a veritable account of the exploits of their ancestors , were puzzled by the indirection of its commendation ; several excellent ladies of New York and Albany were minded to ostracize the innocent author from all social recognition ; and as late as 1818 Mr. Gulian C. Verplauck , Irving 's friend , in an address before the Historical Society , showed the deep irritation the book had caused by severe strictures on it as a " coarse caricature . " But the author 's winning ways soon dissipated the social cloud , and even the Dutch critics were disarmed by the absence of all malice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first foreigners to recognize its power and originality was Walter Scott . The book is indeed an original creation , and one of the very few masterpieces of humor . In spontaneity , freshness , breadth of conception , and joyous vigor it has the character of the production of the spring-time in literature . It has entered into the popular mind as no other American book ever has , and it may be said to have created a social realm which , with all its whimsical conceit , has almost historical solidity . The Knickerbocker Pantheon is at least as real as that of Olympus . The introductory chapters are of that elephantine facetiousness which pleased our greatgrandfathers , but which is exceedingly tedious to modern taste ; and the humor of the book occasionally has a breadth that is indelicate to our apprehension , although it perhaps did not shock our great-grandmothers . But notwithstanding these blemishes , I think the book has more enduring qualities than even the generation which it first delighted gave it credit for . It is strange that after this success Irving should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But for two years , and with leisure , he did nothing . He had even hope of political preferment in a small way ; and he entered into a mercantile partnership with his brothers , which was to involve little work for him and such share of the profits as should assure him support and leave him free to follow his literary bent . Yet he seems to have been mainly intent upon society and the amusement of the passing hour , and , without the spur of necessity to his literary capacity , he yielded to the temptations of indolence , and settled into the unpromising position of a gentleman of leisure . The peril to trade involved in the war of 1812 gave him forebodings , and aroused him to some effort . He accepted the editorship of a periodical called Select Reviews , afterwards changed to the Analectic Magazine , for which he wrote several sketches , some of which were introduced into the Sketch Book , and several reviews and novel biographies . But the slight editorial care required was irksome to a man who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his firm and of other New York importing merchants sent him often to Washington , to look after their int*rests . These visits greatly extended his acquaintance with the leading men of the country , and , as usual , brought him into the thick of gayety and fashion . His political leanings did not prevent an intimacy with the president 's family , and Mrs. Madison and he were sworn friends . Although a federalist and an admirer of England , his sympathies were all with his country in the war of 1812 , and he took active service on the military staff // of Governor Tompkins . The sudden ending of the war defeated his intention of entering the regular army ; and in 1815 he made a visit to his brother Peter , his business partner , in England , intending only a brief sojourn . He remained abroad seventeen years . A portion of this period was consumed in annoying business cares , in failure , and in the experience of bankruptcy . When this was over he addressed himself resolutely to the profession of letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although he was from time to time and for long intervals incapacitated by a tormenting ailment , he labored heroically for the support and comfort of those who were dependent on him . During these seventeen years he became famous wherever the English language was read , and in 1832 , when he returned to New York , America greeted her most famous literary man with a spontaneous outburst of love and admiration . The enthusiasm manifested for him was equaled by his own for the land and the people he supremely loved . His first care was by extended travel to make himself thoroughly acquainted with that land , and his next to provide at Sunnyside on the Hudson a modest and retired home for himself and his relatives . Irving was now past middle life , having returned to New York in his fiftieth year ; but he was in the full flow of literary productiveness . His development was somewhat tardy compared with that of many of his contemporaries ; but he had the " staying " qualities . The first crop of his mind was of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down his humor ; but the spring of his fancy was as free , his vigor was not abated , and his art was more subtle and refined . Some of his best work was yet to be done . It is worthy of passing mention that his admirable sense of literary proportion , which is wanting in many great writers , characterized his work to the very end . High as his position was as a man of letters , the consideration in which he was held was much broader than that , it was that of one of the first citizens of the republic . his friends , readers , and admirers were not merely the literary class , but included nearly all the prominent statesmen of the time . Almost any career was open to him if he had lent an ear to their solicitations . But political life was not to his taste , and it would have been fatal to his sensitive spirit . It did not require much self-denial , perhaps , to decline the candidacy for mayor of New York , nor the honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distinction of a seat in Van Buren 's cabinet as secretary of the navy . His acceptance of the mission to Spain , an appointment which plunged him into profound astonishment , was doubtless influenced by the intended honor to his profession , the gratifying manner in which it came to him , his desire to please his friends , and the belief , which was a delusion , that diplomatic life in Madrid would offer no serious interruption to his Life of Washington , in which he had just become engaged . The nomination , the suggestion of Daniel Webster , Tyler 's secretary of state , was cordially approved by the president and cabinet , and confirmed almost by acclamation in the senate . " Ah , " said Mr. Clay , who was opposing nearly all the president 's appointments , " this is a nomination everybody will concur in ! " " If a person of more merit and higher qualification , " wrote Mr. Webster in his official notification , " had presented himself , great as is my personal regard for you , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other appointment could have been made so complimentary to Spain , and it remains to this day one of the most honorable to his own country . His third visit abroad was the occasion of the renewal of hospitable honors wherever he went , and of a recogni // tion from the highest personages of the fitness of his appointment . He remained at Madrid four years , discharging with much tact and diplomatic wisdom the duties of minister in a perplexing time , when the Spanish government was changing its character and its personnel with the rapidity of shifting scenes in a pantomime . " This consumption of ministers , " wrote Irving to Mr. Webster , " is appalling . To carry on a negotiation with such transient functionaries is like bargaining at the window of a railroad car : before you can get a reply to a proposition , the other party is out of sight . " I shall not dwell upon the ten years of literary activity which preceded this appointment . One incident of it , however , can not he passed in silence : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the history of the conquest of Mexico to Mr. William H. Prescott . It had been a scheme of his boyhood ; he had made collections of materials for it during his first residence in Spain ; and he was actually and absorbedly engaged in the composition of the first chapters , when he was sounded by Mr. Cogswell , of the Astor Library , in behalf of Mr. Prescott . Some conversation showed that Mr. Prescott was contemplating the subject upon which Mr. Irving was engaged , and the latter instantly authorized Mr. Cogswell to say that he abandoned it . Although our author was somewhat far advanced and Mr. Prescott had not yet collected his materials , Irving renounced the glorious theme in such a manner that Prescott never suspected the pain and loss it cost him , nor the full extent of his own obligation . Some years afterwards Irving wrote to his nephew that in giving it up he in a manner gave up his bread , as he had no other subject to supply its place ; " I was , " he wrote , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been completely mounted since . " But he added that he was not sorry for the warm impulse that induced him to abandon the subject , and that Mr. Prescott 's treatment of it had jus%ified his opinion of him . Notwithstanding Prescott 's very brilliant work , we can not but feel some regret that Irving did not write a Conquest of Mexico . His method , as he outlined it , would have been the natural one . Instead of partially satisfying the reader 's curiosity in a preliminary essay in which the Aztec civilization was exposed , Irving would have begun with the entry of the conquerors , and carried his reader step by step onward , letting him share all the excitement and surprise of discovery which the invaders experienced , and learn of the wonders of the country in the manner most likely to impress both the imagination and the memory ; and with his artistic sense of the value of the picturesque he would have brought into strong relief the dramatis pereonce of the story . The service that Irving rendered to American letters no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national indebtedness to him for investing a crude and new land with the enduring charms of romance and tradition . In this respect our obligation to him is that of Scotland to Scott and Burns ; and it is an obligation due only , in all history , * to here and there a fortunate creator to whose genius opportunity is kind . The Knickerbocker Legend and the romance with which Irving has invested the Hudson are a priceless legacy ; and this would remain an imperishable possession in popular tradition if the literature creating it were destroyed . His position in American literature , or in that of the English tongue , will be determined only by the slow settling of opinion , which no critic can foretell , and the operation of which no criticism seems able to explain . I venture to believe , however , that the verdict will not be in accord with much of the present prevalent criticism . Irving was always the literary man ; // he had the habits , the idiosyncrasies , of the literary man . I mean that he regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political , the philosophic , the metaphysic , the , scientific , or the theologic , but purely from the literary point of view . He belongs to that small class of which Johnson and Goldsmith are perhaps as good types as any , and to which America has added very few . The literary point of view is taken by few in any generation ; it may seem to the world of very little consequence in the pressure of all the complex interests of life , and it may even seem trivial amid the tremendous energies applied to immediate affairs ; but it is the point of view that endures ; if its creations do not mold human life , like the Roman law , they remain to charm and civilize , like the poems of Horace . You must not ask more of them than that . Irving had the defects of his peculiar genius , and these have no doubt helped to fix upon him the complimentary disparagement of " genial . " He was not aggressive ; in his nature he was wholly unpartisan and full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world , although returned with kindly liking , cost him something of that respect for sturdiness and force which men feel for writers who flout them as fools in the main . Like Scott , he belonged to the idealists , and not to the realists whom our generation affects . Both writers stimulate the longing for something better . Their creed was short : " Love God and honor the king . " It is a very good one for a literary man , and might do for a Christian . The supernatural was still a reality in the age in which they wrote . Irving 's faith in God and his love of humanity were very simple ; I do not suppose he was much disturbed by the deep problems that have set us all afloat . In every age , whatever is astir , literature , theology , all intellectual activity , takes one and the same drift , and approximates in color . The bent of Irving 's spirit was fixed in his youth , and he escaped the desperate realism of this generation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little that is noble . I do not know how to account , on principles of culture which we recognize , for our author 's style . His education was exceedingly defective , nor was his want of discipline supplied by subsequent desultory application . He seems to have been born with a rare sense of literary proportion and form ; into this , as into a mold , were run his apparently lazy and really acute observations of life . That he thoroughly mastered such literature as he fancied , there is abundant evidence ; that his style was influenced by the purest English models is also evident . But there remains a large margin for wonder how , with his want of training , he could have elaborated a style which is distinctively his own , and is as copious , felicitous in the choice of words , flowing , spontaneous , flexible , engaging , clear , and as little wearisome when read continuously in quantity as any in the English tongue . This is saying a great deal , though it is not claiming for him the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thought , ofmanyothermastersinit . It is much to have deserved the eulogy of Campbell that he had " added clarity to the English tongue . " This elegance and finish of style ( which seems to have been as natural to the man as his amiable manner ) is sometimes made his reproach , as if it were his sole merit , and as if he had concealed under this charming form a want of substance . In literature form is vital . But his case does not rest upon that . As an illustration , his Life of Washington may be put in evidence . It is impossible for any biography to be less pretentious in style , or less ambitious in proclamation . The only pretension of matter is in the early chapters , in which a more than doubtful genealogy is elaborated , and in which // it is thought necessary to Washington 's dignity to give a fictitious importance to his family and his childhood , and to accept the Southern estimate of the hut in which he was born as a " mansion . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misled by the fables of Weems . But while he has given us a dignilThd portrait of Washington , it is as far as possible removed from that of the smileless prig which has begun to weary even the popular fancy . The man he paints is flesh and blood , presented , I believe , with substantial faithfulness to his character ; with a recognition of the defects of his education and the deliberation of his mental operations ; with at least a hint of that want of breadth of culture and knowledge of the past , the possession of which characterized many of his great associates ; and with no concealment that he had a dower of passions and a temper which only vigorous selfwatchfulness kept under . But he portrays with an admiration not too highly colored the magnificent patience , the courage to bear misconstruction , the unfailing patriotism , the practical saga city , the level balance of judgment combined with the wisest toleration , the dignity of mind , and the lofty moral nature which made him the great man of his epoch . Irving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scattered , often wearisome and uninteresting details of our dragging , unpicturesque Revolutionary War ; his just judgment of men ; his even , almost judicial moderation of tone ; and his admirable proportion of space to events , render the discussion of style in reference to this work superfluous . Another writer might have made a more brilliant performance , descriptions sparkling with antithises , characters projected into startling *sttitudes by the use of epithets ; a work more excitiug and more piquant , that would have started a thousand controversies , and engaged the attention by daring conjectures and attempts to make a dra matic spectacle ; a book interesting and notable , but false in philosophy and untrue in fact . When the Sketch Book appeared , an English critic said it should have been first published in England , for Irving was an English writer . The idea has been more than once echoed here . The truth is that while Irving was intensely American in feeling he was first of all a man of letters , and in that capacity he was cosmopolitan ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tone to his theme . Of England , whose traditions kindled his susceptible fancy , he wrote as Englishmen would like to write about it . In Spain he was saturated with the romantic story of the people and the fascination of the clime ; and he was so true an interpreter of both as to earn from the Spaniards the title of " the poet Irving . " I chanced once , in an inn at Frascati , to take up The Tales of a Traveler , which I had not seen for many years . I expected to revive the somewhat faded humor and fancy of the past generation . But I found not only a sprightly humor and vivacity which are modern , but a truth to Italian local color that is very rare in any writer foreign to the soil . As to America , I do not know what can be more characteristically American than the Knickerbocker , the Hudson River tales , the sketches of life and adventure in the far West . But underneath all this diversity there is one constant quality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and read almost anywhere in his score of books , - it may be the Tour on the Prab ries , the familiar dream of the Alhambra , or the narratives of the brilliant exploits of New World explorers ; surrender yourself to the flowing current of his transparent style , and you are conscious of a beguilement which is the crowning excellence of all lighter literature , for which we have no word but * The consensus of opinion about 1kving // in England and America for thirty years was very remarkable . He had a universal popularity rarely enjoyed by any writer . England returned him to America medaled by the king , honored by the university which is chary of its favors , followed by the applause of the whole English people . In English households , in drawing-rooms of the metropolis , in political circles no less than among the literary coteries , in the best reviews , and in the popular newspapers the opinion of him was pretty much the same . And even in the lapse of time and the change of literary fashion authors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admiration of him . To the English indorsement America added her own enthusiasm , which was as universal . His readers were the million , and all his readers were admirers . Even American statesmen , who feed their minds on food we know not of , read Irving . It is true that the uncritical opinion of New York was never exactly r&amp;choed in the cool recesses of Boston culture ; but the magnates of the North American Review gave him their meed of cordial praise . The country at large put him on a pinnacle . If you attempt to account for the position he occupied by his character , which won the love of all men , it must be remembered that the quality which won this , whatever its value , pervades his books also . And yet it must be said that the total impression left upon the mind by the man and his works is not that of the greatest intellectual force . I have no doubt that this was the impression he made upon his ablest contemporaries . And this fact , when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him all the more interesting . As an intellectual personality , he makes no such effect , for instance , as Carlyle , or a dozen other living writers who could be named . The incisive critical faculty was almost entirely wanting in him . He had neither the power nor the disposition to cut his way transversely across popular opinion and prejudice that Ruskin has , nor to draw around him disciples equally well pleased to see him fiercely demolish to-day what they had delighted to see him set up yesterday as eternal . He evoked neither violent partisanship nor violent opposition . He was an extremely sensitive man , and if he had been capable of creating a conflict he would only have been miserable in it . The play of his mind depended upon the sunshine of approval . And all this shows a certain want of intellectual virility . A recent anonymous writer has said that most of the writing of our day is characterized by an intellectual strain . I have no doubt that this will appear to be the case to the next generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the risk of paradox , or to say something in a new way at the risk of obscurity . From this Irving was entirely free . There is no visible straining to attract attention . His mood is calm and unexaggerated . Even in some of his pathos , which is open to the suspicion of being " literary , " there is no literary exaggeration . He seems always writing from an internal calm , which is the necessary condition of his production . If he wins at all by his style , by his humor , by his portraiture of success or of character , it is by a gentle force , like that of the sun in spring . There are many men now living , or recently dead , intellectual prodigies , who have stimulated thought , upset opinions , created mental eras , to whom Irving stands hardly in as fair a relation as Goldsmith to Johnson . What verdict the next generation will put upon their achievements I do not know ; but it is safe to say that their position and that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reversal of their views of life and their judgments of character . I think the calm work of Irving will stand when // much of the more startling and perhaps more b*rilliant intellectual achievement of this age has passed away . And this leads me to speak of Irving 's moral quality , which I can not bring myself to exclude from a literary estimate , even in the face of the current gospel of art for art 's sake . There is something that made Scott and Irving personally loved by the millions of their readers , who had only the dimmest ideas of their personality . This was some quality perceived in what they wrote . Each one can define it for himself ; there it is , and I do not see why it is not as integral a part of the authors - an element in the estimate of their future position - as what we term their intellect , their knowledge , their skill , or their art . However you rate it , you can not account for Irving 's influence in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great-hearted Thackeray , who saw as clearly as anybody the place of mere literary art in the sum total of life , quoted the dying words of Scott to Lockhart , " Be a good man , my dear . " We know well enough that the great author of The Newcomes and the great author of The Heart of Midlothian recognized the abiding value in literature of integrity , sincerity , purity , charity , faith . These are beneficences ; and Irving 's literature , walk round it and measure it by whatever critical instruments you will , is a beneficent literature . The author loved good women and little children and a pure life ; he had faith in his fellow-men , a kindly sympathy with the lowest , without any subservience to the highest ; he retained a belief in the possibility of chivalrous actions , and did not care to envelop them in a cynical suspicion ; he was an author still capable of an enthusiasm . His books are wholesome , full of sweetness and charm , of humor without any sting , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are marred by neither pedantry nor pretension .
