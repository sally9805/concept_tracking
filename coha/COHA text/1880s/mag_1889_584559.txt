By George P. Fisher . ERE are laws of war . These do not continue unaltered . Even in the distant past , the person of a herald was sacred , and treaties confirmed with an oath could not be broken without provoking the wrath of gods and men . With the progress of civilization , one savage custom after another has been discarded from warfare . To drop poison into the wells about an enemy 's camp , to shoot arrows tipped with venom , would shock the moral sense of all warriors advanced above the grade of barbarism . Luckily , hostilities are not now carried forward as in the days when " the god-like Achilles " dragged the corpse of " the noble Hector " at the tail of his chariot around the walls of " windy Troy , " nor as when that consummate general and typical " filibuster , " Alexander of Macedon , with the exaggeration of a copyist , pierced the ankles of Batis , and with leathern thongs tied his body , while he was yet alive , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full speed before the eyes of his applauding troops . Prisoners taken in battle are no more slaughtered , nor are they consigned to hopeless slavery . The international code has been improved so far that the lives of non-combatants , and their property-if only it be on the land ! - are protected . In how many particulars has the brutality that formerly prevailed in war disappeared through the progress of humane sentiment ! It is worth while to take a glance at another species of warfare , where the encounter is bloodless , but which has often kindled not less passion than contests in which the field resounds with the thunder of artillery . What shall be said of the spirit in which intellectual conflicts are waged ? Has there been a like ethical progress here ? What more remains to be done in order to get rid VOL . V.-14 of the displays of injustice and ferocity that still characterize them ? About matters concerning which opinions vary , there has been , as all know , a " strife of tongues " since the world began . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has served as a new instrument of combat . Now that the printer 's art scatters broadcast copies of whatever is written ; now that , besides books , we have an enormous multiplying of magazines and newspapers ; now that the arena of debate spreads over all the provinces of science and aesthetic art , of politics , theology , and letters , the aggregate amount of intellectual contention has immeasurably increased . It is not probable , as it was once believed by some , that the devil invented movable types ; but it is only too apparent that the devil mingles his influence in the use of them . The importance of finding ' out the rules of civilized and Christian conduct in the struggles of " wordwarriors , " - to borrow a phrase of Rich*-ard Baxter-of adhering to these rules , , and of trying to realize a higher ideal in this occupation than the fashion of the day exhibits , will not be denied . It may be that some good will be done by calling attention to the subject . Certainly it is one sphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even though little that is novel in the way of ethical suggestion be brought forward , it can do no harm to insist on familiar obligations . The theme is the proper temper , and the proper method and means , of controversial discussion . We may stop to say that there are many people who deprecate controversy altogether . Especially when the truths . of religion are the subject , there is a , strong aversion in many minds to everything of the sort . But where there is much intellectual activity on any subject , controversies are sure to arise , for the simple reason that men will not think alike . Most of the Apostle Paul 's writings are controversiaL They were // called out by errors which it was necessary for him to oppose . There has never been any great religious revival which has not been connected with active controversy . If evils attend it , at least it furnishes a sign of life ; and almost anything is better than stagnation . The period of religious earnestness in the ancient Church , the Protestant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were fruitful in theological debates . The thing to be desired is not the complete avoidance of controversy , which is not to be expected , but the regulation of it according to Christian principles . We will begin with one plain rule of the pioral code , yet one that is very often violated . The controversialist is bound to state with entire fairness the position and the arguments of his opponent . This rule is broken in other ways than by a wilful distortion of an adversary 's doctrine or a mis-statement of his proofs . When these gross offences are not committed , there may still be a choice of phraseology with an intent , more or less conscious , by the very manner of stating the opinion to be controverted , to stir up a prejudice against it . There is a large opportunity for a want of candor in " the way of putting things , " in cases where no distinct error is expressed . Many writers , not reckoned among the polemics , are guilty in this particular . One principal fault of Gibbon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian religion , lies just here . Language is adroitly chosen to suggest something beyond what is actually said . This remark applies to other passages in Gibbon besides those evidently meant to be ironicaL It takes very slight touches of the pencil to turn a portrait into a caricature . Nothing is more common than to incorporate a sneer into the description of views which one intends to confute . Words or phrases are worked in that involve disparagement . It is like the raising of the eyebrows , or a curl of the lip , in speaking . It is equivalent in its impression to interrupting an opponent , who is seeking to explain himself , by ejaculations of disapproval or contempt . He receives a stab while he is in the act of telling what he wishes to establish . " Mr. A. asserts with a confident air ; " " Mr. A. does not scruple to affirm , " etc. ; " Mr. A. superficially argues , " or " flippantly claims , " or " with plausible sophistry would fain persuade us , " etc.  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression , to the offensive insinuations , the store of wounding adjectives and adverbs , at the command of an expert disputant , whereby a dislike is awakened at the start for the cause which he is anxious to overthrow . Not that it is wrong to call a spade a spade . Not that no occasions are conceivable when such forms of depreciation , even at the threshold , are justifiable . But in all ordinary cases they are indefensible , because they preclude that candid hearing of the other side which is requisite for an intelligent and sound verdict . Sometimes a controversialist will contrive by the use of a single word , not fairly applicable , to create an impression unfavorable to the doctrine which he is undertaking to state . Hume defines a miracle as a " transgression " of a law of nature . There may have been no sinister purpose in the choice of this term . Perhaps there was not . From the point of view of etymology , it is a correct use . But " transgression " properly denotes a departure from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleaving to it . Apply it to a deviation from the ordinary course of nature , and you at once awaken in the hearer 's mind a certain feeling of objection to its occurrence-a certain presumption against it . Respecting the general rule on which we are commenting , the best idea of its import , and , at the same time , of its worth , may be gained by looking at examples of its honorable observance . They excite always an involuntary admiration . They impress us in the way that instances of magnanimity , when there is a temptation in the opposite direction , naturally strike the mind . One such illustration is afforded , I think , in the controversial writings of John Stuart Mill . I do not forget that Dean Mansel complained of Mill that he had misinterpreted Hamilton 's and Mansd 's own doctrines , in important particulars ; but I feel sure that if this was the fact it was the result of an honest mistake . Mill wrote much controver // sially , and no one can fail to mark his custom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is about to examine and to confute . His statement is often made more strongly in the interest of his opponent than the latter could make it for himself . I am not among those who adopt the theory of the " associational school " ( of which Hume was the founder ) , and I find occasion to dissent from Mill as often as to agree with him . But I thankfully recognize the benefit derived from noticing the manly and even generous spirit in which he sets forth antagonistic opinions . There is no insidious belittling of the doctrines to be opposed - no slurs artfuJly introduced with the description of them . The spokesman on the other side is attentively , even respectfully , heard . It hardly need be said that there is a great advantage in this procedure ; for here , as elsewhere , " honesty is the best policy . " When a polemical writer takes this course , he shows , at the outset , that he has no misgivings as to the strength of his cause . He has full confidence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not trying to trip him up before they have had time to grapple . A client of Mr. Lincoln relates that , in a suit of much consequence , he spoke to the jury for several hours in such a strain that he seemed to be giving away the case-so clearly and forcibly did he describe the grounds which the adverse party might adduce in behalf of his cause . But then the sagacious lawyer turned , and with complete success proceeded to pull down the structure which he had built up . He had left no room for charges of misrepresentation ; he had gained the advantage of acquainting the jury beforehand with what could be said on the other side that was likely to be effective . Honesty in quotation is another law binding on disputants . To present false or mangled extracts is an offence akin to forgery . Few men are bad enough to invent outright what they pretend to quote , and if they were , the detection of the crime would be too easy . Yet the records of controversy show how seductive the temptation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cite a fragment of a sentence , a portion of a paragraph , and leave out the other portion which qualifies the import of it . Tear a passage from its connection , and place it in a different setting , when the impression caught by it will be materially changed . These are familiar devices ; often they are not so much the product of conscious , deliberate knavery as they are the well-nigh unconscious offspring of partisan heat . There have been few theological polemics who have struck harder blows than Bossuet . An old mystical writer says of him that if he had happened to be born in England , he would have been as zealous a champion of the Anglican church as he was of the church of Rome ; and this because he was by nature belligerent . His genius was that of a warrior ; he was predestined to take up arms for that body , whatever its name , in which his lot should be cast . lJnfortunately , Bossuet was an offender against the canon which we are now considering . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortifies his assertions by garbled quotations from the writings of the Reformers . Sir William Hamilton , whose information was generally derived at first hand , unwarily copied Bossuet 's citations from Luther , and was convicted of the mistake by Archdeacon Hare . Luther 's unguarded style makes him an easy prey to dexterous polemics , and great is the number who have paraded isolated expressions torn from his writings , and made to bear a sense not intended by their author . Not that they are worse offenders than sundry Protestant divines in their conflicts with Rome and in their disputes with one another . Old Dr. Routh , of Magdalen College , said to a student who asked for some precept to guide him through life : " Always verify your references . " If he had extended the precept and enjoined on him to verify the references of other people , the pupil would have had occasion to discover an amount of moral obliquity which he probably did not imagine to exist . Let it not be supposed that the sin of misquotation lies at the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party writers on topics literary , political , or scientific . In general , it // must be remembered that the besetting sins of the controversialist are such as spring from human nature when it is under the influence of strong personal or partisan feeling . No contests have been more venomous than those between philologians . Grammar is accounted a dry subject , but the contention that it has caused would seem to justify a different opinion . We need go no farther back than the days of Bentley , and the battles in which he took part , to see what an amount of bitterness can be infused into the warfare of linguists . An account , though imperfect , of the combat of Boyle and Bentley , is given by the elder D'Jsraeli , in his rambling book on the Quarrels of Authors . In truth , it matters not what the particular question in controversy may be , it in always possible for wrath to be kindled , and for the contest to degenerate into a mere strife for victory . Then the inducement to resort to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the odium theologicum , as some have said , contains ingredients of peculiar malignity-derived , one might fancy , from infra-mundane abodes-it can not be said to surpass in intensity the hatred which has been kindled among disputants in other departments . A chronic and seemingly incurable vice among controversialists is one that will be recognized as familiar , as soon as it is mentioned . It is the imputation to another of opinions which it is assumed , whether truly or falsely , are logically inferred from those which he professes . " He must believe so and so , because it is implied in the assertion - and so forth . " He virtually teaches *-it is a mercy if " undoubtedly holds " is not added- " the noxious error , " etc . In some way , the unhappy opponent is saddled with the burden of whatever inferences may be drawn by wit or malice from his utterances . What is worse , it is not unusual for his disavowal of these consequences either to pass unnoticed , or , in case the controversial temper burns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Theological debates , from the most ancient to the most recent times , have abounded in this sort of injustice . Now as there are not many persons into the circle of whose opinions there has not crept , unperceived , some erroneous idea which , if followed out in its ramifications , would be fatal to all sound doctrine , it is quite easy for logical fanaticism or malignant partisanship to convict anyone of damnable heresies . Speaking of logical fanaticism , it is worth while for us distinctly to call attention to this particular malady-partly intellectual , whatever share moral infirmities may have in it . There are those who are afflicted with this peculiar form of narrowness . With the logical instinct overgrown , deficient in sympathy , and incapable of any width of view , they appear incompetent to dissociate from an opinion professed by another anything that can be linked with it in a chain of syllogisms . It will be a great gain to the cause of morality if the day shall come when to attribute to another doctrines disavowed or not professed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of argument , shall be universally seen to be-what it really is-untruthful and unchristian . Another controversial sin is quibbling . This consists in avoiding the essential issue , and in shifting the debate to some incidental , subordinate point on which its decision does not at all depend . This is the resort of that class of disputants who approach an opponent in the hope " to catch him in his talk . " He has used inexact phraseology , it may be . He has plainly meant to say one thing , but can be interpreted , without a violation of grammatical rules , as saying another . An honorable debater , conscious of the validity of his cause , will scorn to avail himself of such a resource . A chivalrous debater will state the case for him better than he has stated it for himself . He will , moreover , abstain from pointing his guns to a statement that is merely incidental or subordinate . He will choose rather to march up boldly in the face of the adversary . Here aga4 the captious habit does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a class of minds that cavil because it is their nature to . They have no just perspective . Small things and large things are in their eyes of the same size . They do not address themselves to the main point , because to // their vision there is no main point . Some there are to whom a verbal slip is treated as a mortal sin . But all that quibbling which is voluntary is culpable . To raise a dust over an insignificant error , and thereby to hinder bystanders from seeing the real thing contended for , is one of the common tricks of controversy . It is an old artifice for wasting time and drawing off attention from the merits of the question . All fallacious modes of arguing , or of evading arguments , if these modes are discerned to be sophistical , are morally unworthy . It is impertinent to object to a reasoner 's style , as if the validity of his proofs depended on that . It is no answer , for example , to say of another that his arguments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debate in the Senate of the United States , by way of objection to propositions of Calhoun , Benton said that they were " abstractions . " To this the South Carolina statesman rejoined , with much spirit , that right is an abstraction , and that to say of a doctrine or of a course of reasoning that it is " abstract , " is to say nothing pertinent against it . That sort of objection was irrelevant to the issue . Jonathan Edwards , in his day , had to encounter the objection that his arguments were " metaphysicaL " He pronounces the objection to be " vague and impertinent . " " The question is not , " he remarks , " whether what is said be metaphysics , physics , logic , or mathematics , Latin , English , French or Mohawk , but whether the reasoning be good and the arguments truly conclusive . " His idea is that one might as rationally object to the validity of a course of reasoning that it is presented in one language rather than another , as to object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an ethical axiom that one ought never to use arguments that are not , in his own judgment , valid . A man is convinced of the truth of a proposition for certain definite rei*sons . Other grounds are frequently alleged , and they may be adapted to impress many other minds . There is a temptation , especially when one is bent on carrying a point against opposers , to lay hold of such considerations , even although one 's own conviction does not rest upon them , and they are really perceived to be invalid . They answer a temporary purpose , and the end is practically held to sanctify the means . The Church of iRome has produced no more astute and formidable apologist than the great Cardinal and Jesuit , Bellarmine . In his work against heresies , he provides an arsenal of weapons to be used in defence of the creed against Protestant and other impugners of it . He states the objection to be met , or the difficulty to be solved . Then he presents in numerical array the various answers , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are often incompatible with one another . His own preference , his own opinion , is frequently indicated ; yet there stand in a row all the different modes of rebuttal to which one may resort . One is left to choose out of the catalogue whichever accords with one 's individual taste , or is suited to the exigency . In this place , too , we may find an illustration of the general truth that the path of honesty is also that of expediency . Ordinarily a man will succeed best in convincing others by bringing forward the reasons which have convinced himself , and on which his own faith reposes . When he fetches arguments from afar , which take no hold upon his own mind and heart , even if he do not , in some way , betray the fact , he is incapable of urging them with the living power that springs from sincerity . Some controversialists are prone to express " grief that those who differ from them should think as they do . Expressions of this kind are especially common in religious debates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissenter from his opinions professes what seems to him hurtful error . But this intrusion of personal feeling has no proper place in an argument . The party opposed can balance it by a corresponding expression of mental pain on account of the opinions of his antagonist . Or he can meet it with a more cutting response . Dr. Emmons , of Franklin , was one of the sturdiest of the old ministers of New England . Professor Park , in his Reminiscences of him , states that on sending out from his rural parish a printed sermon on the Atonem ? nt , he // received from a magisterial metropolitan divine the following note : " May 1st . My dear brother , I have read your sermon on the Atonement , and have wept over it ; " to which the following answer , equally laconic , was immediately returned : " May 3d . Dear sir , I have read your letter , and laughed at it . Yours , Nath'l Emmons . " It is generally admitted that " personalities " are forbidden in debate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms of personal disparagement by which controversialists attempt to weaken the influence of their foes ? The motive , to be sure , may not be to blunt the edge of an argument . Conflict breeds irritation , offensive words provoke retaliation . The assailant is paid in his own coin and with usurious interest . There is no more eloquent prose writer in English than John Milton . There are parts of the Speech for the Liberty of Unlicensed Printing which in elevation and spirit surpass the splendor of Burke in his finest passages . In other essays of Milton , the lofty , sustained fervor of the diction is well matched to the nobleness of the thought . Yet there is intermingled not only a grandeur of invective , but almost diverting interludes of fierce and even coarse abuse , which strikingly illustrate the controversial style of that age . In the Second Defence of the People of England , there occur the magnificent paragraphs in which , in response to the railing of Salmasius , the Poet describes his own person , how he lost his eyesight " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his youth , and his travels abroad , from which he hurried home to take part in the contest of Parliament for freedom in England . Salmasius had taunted him with being blind , comparing him to the one-eyed monster of heathen fable . " I certainly never supposed , " remarks Milton , with a kind of pathetic humor , " that I should have been obliged to enter into a competition for beauty with Cyclops . " Salmasius had qualified the comparison by adding of Milton 's person that " there could not be a more spare , shrivelled , and bloodless form . " In dignified and touching sentences , Milton is thus led to speak of his own looks , saying of his eyes : " So little do they betray any external appearance of injury , that they are as unclouded and bright as the eyes of those who most distinctly see . In this instance alone I am a dissembler against my will . " Shortly after , he refers to the poets , heroes , and sages of old who , like himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consciousness of divine favor , and of a light within , which had attended him . It was the " overshadowing of heavenly wings " that had darkened his vision . Yet he turns from these pathetic , glowing , and beautiful observations , called out by ribald remarks respecting his appearance , to say to Salmasius : " Respecting yours , though I have been informed that it is most insignificant and contemptible , a perfect mirror of the worthlessness of your character and the malevolence of your heart , " etc . Of one who had applauded Salmasius in verse , Milton says that he " must have been a miserable judge , and without any feeling of propriety , to lavish such a prodigality of praise on a grammarian ; a race of men who have been always thought to act a sort of subordinate and menial part to the bard . " A few pages before , he had styled Salmasius a " a grammatical louse , whose only treasure of merit , and hope of fame , consisted in a glossary . " With sneers at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the unfortunate verse-maker who had praised him : " Take away , 0 ass ! those panniers of airy nothingness ; and speak , if you can , three words that have an affinity to common sense ; if it be possible for the tumid pumpkin of your skull to discover anything like the reality of intellect . In the meantime , I abandon the pedagogue to the rods of his scholars . " These extracts indicate what an adept Milton was in the rhetoric of abuse . They are interesting chiefly as occurring , like coarse weeds in a bed of roses , in the midst of passages inspired by tender and lofty sentiment . It is not simply the looks and occupations of their opponents on which angry polemics have delighted to dwell . Even their names have furnished many an occasion for malicious puns and other sorts of disrespect and contempt . Their relatives have not been spared , when there was anything in their family or national // pedigree to be laid hold of and converted into a missile . It awakens encouragement for the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merciless are the diatribes of authors . Luther has few rivals in the line of unsparing personal denunciation . But the Italian literati of the Renaissance age are excelled by none in the fierce virulence which they carry into quarrels that relate to nothing higher than literary themes . The merciless , filthy tirades of Poggio and his enemies , Filelfo and Valla , are probably unmatched in the voluminous record of literary squabbles . Yet Poggio was an ardent student and explorer for lost manuscripts-so ardent that he bribed monks to steal them . What course shall be adopted respecting the imputation of unworthy motives in controversial discussion ' ? There is no other rule than that of the Sermon on the Mount ; but , as in other relations , it must be interpreted and applied aright . The most pithy comment on the precept , " Judge not , " is that of the fine old critic , Bengel : " Sine scientia , amore , necessitate . " That is to say , do not judge another unfavorably except from knowledge , good-will , and a call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a reference to the precept that follows : " give not that which is holy unto dogs , neither cast ye your pearls before swine " ) , " canis pro cane , et porcus pro porco est habendus . " That is , a dog is to be held to be a dog , and a swine a swine . He might have referred also , against a sweeping literalism of interpretation , to the declaration , " By their fruits , ye shall know them . " Still there remains as a great law of conduct , applicable in all human intercourse , the rule to abstain from accusations not supported by evidence , and not required by some paramount obligation . It need not be said to any reader of the public journals-not to speak of other vehicles of thought and speechto what extent controversies are degraded by the imputation , on insufficient grounds or occasions , of sinister designs and selfish motives . To justify charges or insinuations of this nature , something more is requisite than suspicion . It is not enough to show that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That may be , and yet his opinion may be an honest one . It may be that he would hold it if his interests were on the other side . There must be other proofs , circumstances of a more convincing nature , that point to one conclusion , before he can fairly be charged with insincerity . Take , for example , the political debate between Protection and Free-trade . The bare fact that an advocate of Protection is a manufacturer who is personally profited by the tariff , does not excuse the accusation of hypocrisy , or even of unconscious self-deception from the bias of self-interest . He might , perhaps , be a Protectionist if his purse did not plead on that side . An advocate of Free-trade is not to be accused of feeling a stronger sympathy with Great Britain than with his own country , or with not caring for the condition of the laboring class . For it is quite conceivable that his economical theory is held in connection with a cordial patriotism , and that he believes that the laborers would not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgetting , as Bengel says , that " canis pro cane , et porcus pro porco est habendus , " we can still affirm that if offensive allegations of a personal sort were eliminated from our current political debates , and attention were concentrated on the arguments pro and con , we should not only be much nearer a solution of vexed questions , but there would , also , be at the same time an immense gain for good manners and for morality . To limit denunciation to corrupt character or to the actions that spring from it , would be a restriction without warrant . No doubt the habit of looking on an intellectual error as a moral offence is one of the principal sources of acrimony in discussions . Some men speak and write as if they considered any dissent from their views , which ventures to express itself , as a personal affront , to be visited with signs of resentment . Strong , however , as the temptation is unlawfully. to substitute invective for reasoning , in battle with obnoxious doctrine , it must be allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be manifestly // connected with their immoral quality . In such cases , wholesome severity may be a duty . The combatant must take a scourge in his hand . There is plenty of scriptural authority for the infliction of this sort of merited chastisement . Here we have a case where no definite lines can be drawn . Circumstances must decide whether justice calls for , and charity permits , the use of caustic speech . Burke was alarmed at the spread of political doctrine in England which he believed to be false in its foundations and fatal in the consequences which it threatened . Hence he published ( in 1790 ) his " Reflections on the Revolution in France . " His attack on the sermon of Dr. Price before the Revolution Society may have been sharpened a little by prior political differences . There can be no question , however , of the sincere abhorrence with which the English orator regarded the doctrines and tendencies of the discourse , which he described as containing " some good moral and religious sentiments , and not illexpressed , mixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reflections . " Price 's comparison of the benefits and the evils of the occurrences in France struck him as inhuman , so acute was his sense of the atrocity of the transactions in Paris . " No theatric audience in Athens , " he exclaims , " would bear to see a principal actor , as it were , weighing in scales hung in a shop of horrors , so much actual crime against so much contingent advantage , and after putting in and out weights , declaring that the balance was on the side of the advantages . " Burke 's disdain of the persons against whom he writes could not be more emphatically set forth than in the following passage : " The vanity , restlessness , petulance , and spirit of intrigue of several petty cabals , who attempt to hide their total want of consequence in bustle and noise , and puffing , and mutual quotation of each other , makes you imagine that our contemptuous neglect of their abilities is a mark of general acquiescence in their opinions . No such thing , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fern make the field ring with their importunate chink , while thousands of great cattle , reposed beneath the shadow of the British oak , chew the cud and are silent , pray do not imagine that those who make the noise are the only inhabitants of the field ; that , of course , they are many in number ; or that , after all , they are other than the little shrivelled , meagre , hopping , though loud and troublesome insects of the hour . " One who approves of Burke 's estimate of the revolutionary doctrines will regard with sympathy the condemnation that is heaped on them and the propagators of them . Whoever dissents from this verdict will think his invectives and sarcasms unrighteous . One thing to be remembered is that a philippic , especially if it is overdone , is liable to awaken sympathy with the person against whom it is levelled . It may even serve to advertise writings and to give them an importance not before possessed . Hume , in his autobiography , after speaking of the neglect with which his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were attracting notice . " Answers " - he humorously remarks- " by reverends and right reverends came out two or three in a year ; and I found , by Warburton 's railing , that the books were beginning to be esteemed in good company . " Of Hurd 's attack upon his book on Natural Religion , which had , he tells us , all the bad traits of " the Warbur-. tonian school " of fierce polemics , Hume says : " This pamphlet gave me some consolation for the otherwise indifferent reception of my performance . " Hume was a writer who always reasoned , and never railed , whatever may be thought of the soundness of his arguments . The only proper way to meet him was with the weapons of logic , handled in a cool , dispassionate spirit . It is not wandering too far from our subject to enter a protest against the disposition of zealous people to set up an outcry of anger and displeasure when ideas at variance , in a marked degree , with their traditional opinions are broached for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men engaged in scientific investigation . The effect of such passionate demonstrations , if they have any effect , is to place temporary barriers in the way of the progress of science , and to alienate some minds from religion . It is not pleasing // to remember the general screech that was raised by the publications of Darwin , followed as it has been by the public declaration of such orthodox divines as Canon Liddon , that his theory of evolution is not incompatible with the essential principles of the Christian system . As to the right to use ridicule in controversy , there was a curious discussion in which the affirmative was maintained by Shaftesbury and his school , Akenside and Lord Kaimes being on the same side , and Warburton , the most furious critic of his time , taking the opposite . Warburton , who , to be sure , was more at home in coarse defamation than in any exercise of genuine wit or humor , nevertheless tries to make fun of his antagonists while arguing at the same time against the propriety of ridicule . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side was the baleful result of the comedies of Aristophanes in tending to procure the death of Socrates . If the question is to be gravely considered , the decision will have to be that no law can be laid down upon the use of satire , burlesque , and other forms of witty or humorous writing , provided they are really directed against something intrinsically absurd , and most effectively shown to be absurd by such methods of exposure . The occasions when ridicule is appropriate , and the bounds within which it ought to be confined , admit of no exact definition . He who is possessed of the capacity to forge and wield a weapon of this character is responsible for the righteous and temperate use of it , as he is for the exercise of other talents . Certainly , to banish it altogether would be to strike out from literature productions that could ill be spared . He must be a rigorous moralist indeed who would commit to the flames the " Provincial Letters* ' of Pascal , that exquisite satire upon a finical , demoralizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effects have been produced , and legitimately produced , by the apposite use of ridicule . In Webster 's famous reply to Hayne , the picture of that statesman , marching at the head of the local militia , to levy war against the IJuited States , was one of the most telling passages in the speech . The spectacle there depicted , to be sure , does not seem so ridiculous in the light of more recent events ; but at that day it seemed ludicrous , and answered its end . It had the merit , moreover , of including in itself a sound argument against an untenable theory of State Rights . While a place rightfully belongs to ridicule in the exposure and overthrow of absurd or sophistical doctrine , it must be , at the same time , remembered that in current debates of all sorts , perhaps no instrument of warfare is more abused by being employed on every occasion , and to excess . Angry people , like people who are in love , often afford diversion to spectators who do not share in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case may be , draw a smile from the indifferent bystander . One can hardly avoid mingling with regret an amused feeling in witnessing the displays of overheated disputants , from whom we are too far removed to be affected with any profounder sentiment . In the last century , a violent debate sprung up between the Rev. Augustus Toplady , and the renowned Methodist leader , John Wesley . Both were in orders in the Church of England . Toplady wrote the hymn which is sung in all the churches : " Rock of ages , cleft for me , Let me hide myself in thee . " His diary , not to speak of other evidences , shows that he was sincerely religious , and believed himself , even in his theological combats , to be doing God service . He was a much younger man than Wesley . Wesley , to do him justice , was far less intemperate in his expressions than his opponent . The rancor was chiefly on the side of Toplady . The subject of their long , intermittent conflict was the tenet of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a subject which is of universal interest to ingenious minds , and which , if we may credit Milton , was the question discussed in a debatingclub of fallen angels in Pandemonium . Toplady printed a Calvinistic treatise of Zanchius in favor of this tenet . Wesley printed an " abridgment " of it , in // which the most obnoxious features were made to stand out , and which ended thus : " The sum of all is this : one in twenty ( suppose ) of mankind are elected ; nineteen in twenty are reprobated . The elect shall be saved , do what they will ; the reprobate shall be damned , do what they can . Reader , believe this , or be damned . Witness my hand . " A. T Wesley had said nothing directly of Toplady more severe than to style him " a bold young man . " Of course , neither party would absolve the other from the consequences which were conceived to flow from his system . The holy rage of Toplady found a vent in a printed " Letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says , " Mr. Wesley , if you are capable of blushing . For once , publicly acknowledge yourself to have acted criminally ; unless , ' to use your own words on another occasion , shame and you have shook hands and parted . " ' Alluding to Wesley 's closing paragraph , the irate author remarks : " In almost any other case , a similar forgery would transmit the criminal to Virginia or Maryland , if not to Tyburn . If such an opponent can be deemed an honest man , where shall we find a knave ? " It is curious to find Toplady , in close connection with his red-hot anathemas , dilating at some length on the evils of bigotry ! Wesley 's Reply was met with a Rejoinder : " More Work for Mr. John Wesley , " etc . In the Preface , Toplady tells us that he does not " bear the least ill-will to his person , " and that he has kept the following sheets for some weeks " merely with a view of striking out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asperity and intemperate warmth . " How far he succeeded in this laudable effort at selfrestraint may be judged from what he says of " the impudent cavil that predestination makes God the author of sin , " and that he ( Toplady ) ascribes the sin of Judas to God . " Without the least heat or emotion , I plainly say , Mr. Wesley lies . " Wesley gave to his old antagonist an occasion for an attack on a different matter . When Dr. Johnson published his tract against the American colonies , " Taxation no Tyranny , " Wesley , who had now come to favor the home government , published a brief pamphlet which , though nothing but an abstract of Johnson 's , contained no reference to it . It was a strange proceeding , but may have been the result of an understanding with Johnson , who liked Wesley , and found , it would appear , no fault with what he had done . Toplady now appeared with a pamphlet entitled , " An Old Fox Tarred and Feathered , occasioned by what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Colonies . " Toplady , opening with the motto , " Another Face of Things was seen , And I became a Tory , " adopts the style of Scripture : " Whereunto shall I liken Mr. John Wesley ? and with what shall I compare him ? " I will liken him to a low and puny tadpole in divinity , which proudly seeks to disembowel an high and mighty whale in politics . " For it came to pass , some months since , that Dr. Samuel Johnson set forth an eighteen-penny pamphlet , entitled , Taxation no Tyranny . " And , some days ago , a Methodist weathercock saluted the public with a two-penny paper ( extracted by whole paragraphs together from the aforesaid doctor ) , ycleped , A calm Address to our American Colonies . The occasion whereof was this : " There dwelleth , about 99 miles , one furlong , and thfrteen inches , from a place called the Foundery - this was the place where Wesley preached-in Moorfields ( next door to a noted mad-house ) a priest , named Vulposo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violent controversy , outside of the province of theology , we might recall the , protracted war of Hobbes with the scientific professors at Oxford . Hobbes , in his old age , ventured into the field of mathematical discussion . I*IIe indulged the belief that he could square the circle . He roused against him Waffis and Ward , the Oxford authorities in this branch , who , besides their hostility to Hobbes 's theology // and ethics , snatched the opportunity to avenge an attack which he had made on the system of study pursued in the universities . The contest went on , with several long vacations , for a score of years . The adversaries of Hobbes carried too many guns for the old philosopher , and he was worsted in the combat . The titles of some of the publications indicate its character . Hobbes published , in 1656 , his " Six Lessons to the Professors of Mathematics , one of Geometry , the other of Astronomy , in the University of Oxford . " The reply bore the title : " Due Correction for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lessons right . " A wrangle between them about the sense of a Greek word dictated the title of another book by Hobbes . This title , or the closing part of it was : " Marks of the Absurd Geometry , Rural Language , Scottish Church Politics , and Barbarisms of John Warns , Professor of Geometry and Doctor of Divinity . " A dispute on abstruse questions in mathematics flowed out into torrents of mutual accusations relating to the part which each had taken in the political changes of the age  --  a matter where Wallis was more vulnerable than on topics of pure science . " T is no argument of your contempt , " wrote Hobbes , referring to himself , " to spend upon him so many angry lines as would have furnished you with a dozen of sermons . " Hobbes , able man as he was , had waded beyond his depth . At a later day , Warns humorously wrote : " I am now employed upon another work , as hard almost as to make Mr. Hobbes understand mathematics . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to understand a language . " These two controversies , one of them theologic and the other scientific , in one of which Wesley , and in the other Hobbes was the conspicuous figure , are presented as specimens from an herbarium , the volumes of which would make a vast library . The way in which , at the present day , we regard such manifestations of polemical spite , may indicate the impression which many current debates will be apt to make in future times , in case the record of them should survive , and curious readers should be found to peruse it . @
