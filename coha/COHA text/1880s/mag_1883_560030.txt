A PROCESS is always going on among the various branches of Physics not very different from that which obtains among the various tribes of men . Just as the latter are gradually becoming civilized and passing under the yoke of law , so the former are , in their way , gradually submitting to discipline and passing under the yoke of rigid mathematics . Acoustics , light , and heat were long ago brought in , and quite recently electricity has been forced into submission by the united labors of Faraday , Maxwell , Thomson , and others . There are , however , two formidable tribes of scientific verities which have hitherto persistently hung around the borders of scientific civilization , not submitting to anything like proper restraint , and these are the inhabitants of the very big and the very little . The former concern themselves with the movables of the earth , which they drive about in a capricious and inexplicable manner , putting us often to much inconvenience and very great loss . The latter have to do with the almost infinitely smallwith molecules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that defies our powers of mathematical analysis . Meteorology and chemistry are the names by which we designate these two classes of phenomena ; and , however important and interesting may be the preliminary advances that have been made toward their subjugation , it certainly can not be said that either has been content to pass under the yoke . Now the statement may sound strange , but yet there is reason to think that both of these will yield most readily if approached from the side of solar inquiry . The sun 's surface is a platform on which gigantic meteorological displays are continually taking place , and it is likewise a laboratory in which chemical changes are brought about of a nature which we , on this earth , are utterly unable to imitate , perhaps even to comprehend . Nor is it merely as distant specta-44*7 // tors that we must regard the sun , beholding through appropriate instruments these gigantic processes and deriving instruction from the sight . We must look to him as the heart and soul of our system , believing that what takes place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that solar inquiry is not merely a branch of speculative physics tending to throw light on certain outstanding problems , but likewise a deeply interesting subject of great practical importance . Our readers will thus perceive that there are two sides to solar physics . There is first what may be called the elder branch , treating of the large or molar motions which take place on the sun 's surface , and there is next the younger branch , which concerns itself with the sun 's chemical changes , a brauch which has recently been greatly advanced through the labors of Kirchhoff , Jaussen , Lockyer , and others . We will confine our remarks to solar physics on the large scale , giving our readers an account of the greater visible phenomena of the sun 's surface and of the variations of these ; and concluding with some remarks on the effects which solar changes appear to produce upon the earth 's surface and upon ourselves . Soon after the invention of the telescope , the existence of black spots on the sun 's surface was rendered certain through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their behavior was speedily made use of in order to prove the rotation of the sun around his axis in a period of about twenty-six days . But the first methodical observer of these phenomena was the late Hofrath Schwabe , of Dessan . Fifty-five years ago he set himself to the task of obtaining , every clear day , sketches of the sun which might approximately record the positions and sizes of the various groups of spots . For more than forty years he continued to labor at this task with true Teutonic perseverance , until at length his exertions were rewarded by the discovery of the unmistakable periodicity of these phenomena . During some years he found the sun to be almost free from spots , while on other occasions the disk was marked with very frequent groups , the period from maximum to maximum , or from minimum to minimum , being nearly eleven years . From the observations of Schwabe and others , it would appear that 1828 , 1837 , 1848 , 1860 , and 1870 were years of maximum outbreaks ; while 1833 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a nearly total absence of spots . We are probably now approaching , // or about to pass through , a period of maximum , after emerging from one of minimum frequency ( 1877 ) of a contiuuance quite unprecedented . Carringtou followed iu the steps of Schwabe , and his observations give us a very accurate record of the spots which appeared from 1854 to 1860 inclusive . To Rutherfurd and De La Rue the credit is due of introduciug solar photography , by means of which observations of unimpeachable accuracy cau now easily be made . Already a very large number of solar photographs has been obtained in various places , as may be seen from a catalogue published by the English Government in the Report of a Committee on Solar Physics . This scattered information should be gathered together and utilized as speedily as possible . But it is now time to tell our readers what a sun spot really is . Professor Wilson , of Glasgow , made in 1774 an observation which at the time greatly startled the scientific world . He found that sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides dug into the body of the sun . To enable the reader to appreciate this argument , we ought to state that a typical sun spot consists of an intensely black inner nucleus surrounded by a less black border . Now , the sun revolves on his axis in about twenty-six days , the motion being from east to west . A spot therefore will take about thirteen days to travel across the visible disk or hemisphere of our luminary , and will come on at the left-hand border or limb and disappear at the right , provided always it continues to exist so long . Now Wilson noticed that , when a spot is near the limb , the penumbra on the side nearest the sun 's visual center is hidden from the view , on the same principle , he contended , which makes us , when looking into a silver jug , for instance , from one side of it , see only that side which is furthest from the eye , the side which is nearest being hidden from the view . In fine , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ umbra formed the bottom and the penumbra the sloping sides . We may add that they are certainly cloud-pits and not caverns in solid matter . The conclusions of Wilson have been abundantly verified by Mr. Dc La Rue and his colleagues , who have likewise shown that the bottom of a sun spot is blacker than the general solar surface because it is colder , and that it is colder because it is caused by a down-rush of comparatively cold matter from the more elevated regions of the solar atmosphere , just as a terrestrial hailstorm // coming down from above would appear black because it was cold , if the earth were to shine by its own light . Now , a down-rush implies an up-rush , and a down-rush of comparatively cold matter from above implies an up-rush of comparatively hot from matter beneath . We might therefore expect that sun spots would be supplemented by complementary phenomena presenting a peculiarly bright appearance . Such are found in the faculin ( torches ) which almost invariably accompany spots , at least when they are of considerable size . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patches are high up in the solar atmosphere , and that they have made their way upward from beneath . They form , in fact , the up-rushes of hot matter of which we have been theoretically in search . Sun spots are , as we have stated , only occasionally present on the surface of the sun , and we have now to add that they confine themselves to definite solar localities , being grouped more or less strictly round the equatorial regions and never by any chance appearing at the poles . There are , nevertheless , analogous phenomena on a smaller scale which are quite generally distributed over the whole surface . This , when viewed through a powerful telescope , is far front uniform in luster , and is seen to be made up of very numerous and small black and bright patches , which cause it to present a mottled appearance . Sif William Herschel was the first to remark this , and he further believed the pores , as he called them , to be of the nature of small spots , a conjecture which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus appears that the solar disk presents us with two scales or orders of similar phenomena . We have , in the first place , the minute black and white patches generally distributed over the surface , while , on the other hand , at selected times , and in selected regions , we have spots and facuhe on a scale frequently gigantic . But whether small or large , we can not err in regarding the black patches as representing downrushes of comparatively cold matter from above , and the bright patches as representing up-rushes of comparatively hot matter from beneath . Here it is evident that we have been hitherto describing phenomena as they appear projected upon the luminous disk of the sun ; and although we know that the umbra of a spot is low down and the facula high up , how low down and how high up we shall find it difficult to decide . Suppose , however , that we now // turn from the disk itself to the region round about it , might we not expect the tops of the ascending currents to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the sun 's visible limb ? In this region , however , we are at first sight prevented from observing anything on account of the glare of light which surrounds it , this glare being caused by reflection from the earth 's atmosphere . Now , there are two ways of getting rid of this glare . One is by means of a total solar eclipse , during which the sun 's light is withdrawn from the earth 's atmosphere ; the other is by using the spectroscope , which has the power of diluting the glare while it can not so dilute the light of the solar up-rushes . By such means we see the up-rushes standing out like red flames from the limb or border of the sun , often with fantastic shapes like columns or trees of fire , extending also on rare occasions to the height of a hundred thousand miles above the sun 's border , and moving at the enormous rate of a hundred and fifty miles per second . If we add that a large sun spot is capacious enough to swallow up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our readers will have some faint conception of the scale of these phenomena . It would thus appear that a minute study of the sun 's surface increases , at first sight , rather than diminishes the astonishment and perplexity with which we regard the doings of our luminary . We are presented with two wonders instead of one . It has of course been long a standing puzzle , by what means the sun has been able for many millions of years to pour out continuously an amount of light and heat so vast that the imagination can hardly grasp its measure . And now , in addition to this , we have to account for these gigantic up and down rushes which observation reveals in the solar atmosphere . It is ' however , a hopeful sign when such wonders go in couples , for then we may use the one to explain the other ; let us , therefore , see what we have got before us in the present instance . We are first induced to ask , by means of what wonderful machinery is the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlay of light and heat ? Then , secondly , what can be the meaning of those gigantic up and down currents which take place in the solar atmosphere ? The reply is , these gigantic currents form the very machinery of which we are in search , and enable the sun to do his duty . For , let us reflect what is necessary in order that our luminary // should continue to give out light and heat . In the first place , if the sun were merely a hot solid , like incandescent carbon , it has been calculated by Sir William Thomson that his surface would grow cool in a few minutes . It is quite clear that the state of things must be very different from this . The sun is a citadel of light and heat , and has an incessant warfare to wage with the deadly cold of space , and the conditions of this celestial warfare are not very different from these with which we , on this earth , are only too well acquainted . Now , a fortified position may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muskets ; but they may be so crammed together that , when the front row have fired their shots , they can not move backward , while the row behind can not move forward to take their place . In such a case the result is not difficult to foresee  --  a total collapse will very speedily be brought about , because the conditions essential to success have not been attended to . There are , in fact , too many men . It is the same with the solid sun ; the front row of particles give out their light and heat , and there they remain , being unable to do anything more themselves , but preventing , at the same time , the row behind them from doing anything . Now this will never do . The front particles , when they have fired their light and heat shots , must have the means of promptly retiring to recruit themselves from the inexhaustible magazine within , while the row behind them must promptly take their place , and when they have done their duty retire in their turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The more vigorous this transport service , the more effective will be the result . Now in the up and down rushes , we have this transport service visibly represented , and the astonishing activity of the sun in giving out light and heat is only equaled by the astonishing activity of this service in fact , the one necessarily implies the other . Our readers are , however , not quite satisfied . They see well enough that these gigantic currents are quite essential to the sun 's well-being , but they would like to know how they are brought about ; the bellows blows up the fire , but who or what works the bellows ? Does the fire work it ? Now , before explaining this , it will be necessary to define what we mean by a con'vectioiv current . Were we to try , by boiling oil or by other means , to heat a vessel of water from the top , we should find that the heat would penetrate with extreme slowness beneath the surface , because the heated particles , being expanded and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , namely , at the top , and would not give place to others . But when we heat such a vessel from beneath , the ease is quite different , for the heated particles , getting specifically lighter , ascend and give place to others which descend ; there is thus a continuous supply of cold particles constantly ready to take away the heat . Now , these upward currents of hot and downward currents of cold particles are called convection currents . The same thing takes place in a furnace fire : the hot air , becoming specifically lighter , mounts up the chimney , while its place is supplied by cold air , which pours itself into the ifre . Stop up the chimney , destroy the circulation , and the fire will cease to burn . Let us now examine on what this process called convection really depends . In the first place it depends upon the forc* of gravity , for it is in virtue of this force that light air ascends and heavy air moves downward . If , therefore , wewere suddenly and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth 's interior , we should find that our chimneys would not draw so well . Secondly , connection depends on the amount of expansion cansed by an increase of temperature ; thus , for in stance , convection currents would be more violent in air than in mercury , because mercury expands comparatively little and air a great deal . Thirdly , it depends upon the magnitude of the temperature differences which are taking place ; and , lastly , it depends upon the scale of the arrangement , so that a short chimney would not draw so well as a long one . Now , all these requisites come together in the sun . For in the first place , the force of gravity is there very great , being about twenty-eight times greater than it is at the earth 's surface . Secondly , the substance there present is gas , which has a high expansive faculty . Thirdly , the temperature differences are enormous ; and lastly , the scale of the whole is very great . There is thus much reason for believing that convection currents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; such currents , too , would be necessarily up and down ones . We can not , therefore , go wrong in assuming that the gigantic up and down currents which we there behold are due to convection . To conclude , the 5Ufl*5 radiating power is in a sense due to convection currents , and these currents are in a sense due to the sun 's radiation ; in fine , these two things support one another , and so the arrangement goes on briskly , and the sun continues to // pour out light and heat . It will be noticed that we have said nothing whatever about the cause of the sun 's heat , nor do we intend to do so sufficient for our purpose that there exists in the interior of the sun a vast store-house of heat , which can be drawn upon as required , and brought to the surface . It is thus sufficiently obvious that the sun 's heat and lightgiving power is intimately associated with the gigantic solar currents which observation reveals . Now this association is no doubt of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is to say , if , from some cause , no matter what , these currents are at any time particularly powerful , we may expect the solar radiation to be particularly powerful likewise . There is , in fact , a strong analogy between the sun and an ordinary steam-engine . In both , heat is conveyed from a source of high to a source of low temperature , and this carriage is in both accompanied by a great display of visible energy . In both , too , no doubt the more rapid the carriage of heat the greater the visible energy . The difference between the two is rather one of object than of machinery . In an ordinary steam-engine , the object is the production of visible energy , while the means are the carriage of heat ; in the sun , however ( we trust metaphysicians will pardon us ) , the object is the carriage of heat , and the means are the production of visible energy . Be this as it may , we think it may safely be assumed that , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most powerful likewise . Now , all observations , whether telescopic or spectroscopic , go to convince us that the currents of the sun are most powerful during times of maximum sun spots , when the outbursts of visible energy on and around the disk are of a scale and intensity absolutely overwhelming , and we are therefore inclined to believe that on such occasions the intensity of solar radiation will be found to be most powerful likewise . But here , at length , we conic to the mysterious part of our subject . We can fancy it acknowledged that the sun 's heatgiving power depends upon the intensity of these visible currents ; but then it will naturally be asked , why should this vary from year to year ? - why should it exhibit an eleven-yearly period , or , indeed , any period at all ? The reply to this question is still obscure . In the first place , we may be sure that this periodicity of sun spots , whether true or only apparent , must be caused either by something within the sun or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy within the sun to account // for any manifestation , however tremendous ; but we can form no conception of any agent present there capable of causing penodicity . Besides , we never can expect to know much about the sun 's interior ; so that as signing the cause of sun-spot periodicity to these regions appears to be only a way of giving up the question altogether . If we go now to the regions without the sun , we find there planets and certain comets which are strictly subject to periodical laws . On this ground , therefore , we might appropriately look to them as the causes of solar variability , were it not that we have great difficulty in imagining how such comparatively small bodies , so far off , can account for those enormous manifestations of energy exhibited in solar phenomena . It is possible that this objection may be got rid of by our defining more strictly what we mean by a cause . If we mean that planetary action causes sun spots , after the manner in which a blacksmith causes his hammer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our statement . But if we mean that planetary action causes sun spots , after the manner in which a man who pulls a delicate hair-trigger causes the explosion of a cannon , there is no a priori reason why this may not be true . Our limits forbid any lengthened discussion of this interesting but mysterious subject ; we may , however , state that several observers have obtained preliminary evidence of some kind of connection between planetary positions and sun-spot frequency . It must , however , be borne in mind that if we are to resort to planetary action as a complete explanation of solar peniodicity , we must assume the existence of intra-mercunial planets or matter , inasmuch as the configurations of the well-known planets are not enough to account for the various solar periods . We have thus come to the conclusion that , waiving all speculations as to the cause of these periodical phenomena , there is reason to believe that , both with respect of currents and of heat-giving power , the sun is most energetic at times of maximum sun spots . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indirect inference ? Why not determine this by some direct measurement of solar radiation ? With great regret and not a little shame , we have to confess that no trustworthy information on this point has hitherto been obtained ; indeed , it is only quite recently that suitable attempts have been made to determine this essential point by means of direct observation . Indirectly , however , we may // examine certain terrestrial processes depending on the sun , and endeavor to find out whether these are more or less energetic at times of maximum sun spots . The phenomena most snitable for this purpose are those of terrestrial magnetism and meteorology ; let us now , therefore , commence with the former , and endeavor to ascertain whether the sun 's action on the magnetism of the earth is strongest or weakest at times of maximnm sun spots . The sun may be said to affect the earth 's magnetism in two ways . First , by causing magnetic disturbances or storms , accompanied by auroral displays and earth-currents ; and , secondly , by producing daily oscillations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what these affections really mean . For this purpose we may imagine a delicately suspended magnetic needle to be swung in a vault removed from all currents of air or changes of temperature due to the sun ; or , better still , let us imagine a dozen such magnets to be so swung in various quarters of the globe . Now , on certain occasions it will be found that all these dozen magnets are in a state of tremor or oscillation , not extremely violent , but yet sufficiently marked to be easily perceptible . If the place of observation be in a high latitude , and if the sky be cloudless , and it be night , the aurora borealis will at the same time manifest itself , and the various telegraphic systems of the earth will be disturbed by spontaneous earth-currents . Such , then , are magnetic storms or disturbances , with their auroral and earth-current concomitants . Now , these storms are most frequent during years of maximum , and least frequent during years of minimum sun spots . In the next place , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the needle , in virtue of which it attains , in this hemisphere , its extreme easterly position about eight in the morning and its extreme westerly about two in the afternoon . This affection of the needle is not , of course , simultaneous at the various magnetic stations , since it depends upon the hour of the day . In this respect , therefore , it is quite different from magnetic disturbances or storms . Now , it is well known that the range of this diurnal oscillation is greatest during years of maximum and least during years of minimum sun spots . It thus appears that , both as regards magnetic storms and diurnal magnetic ranges , the sun is most powerful at times of maximum sun spots . // We come next to the meteorology of the earth . Here it might naturally be supposed that the evidence of solar variability should be more distinctly visible in the meteorology than in the maguetism of our globe ; the reverse is , however , the case . We can , indeed , hardly doubt that the meteorological facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledge that the former are at present more cogent than the latter . For the purpose of reviewing the meteorological evidence , let ns very shortly consider in order the four following elements : barometric pressure , rain-fall , wind force , and temperature . We may probably regard it as a sufficiently well ascertained meteorological fact that , during the summer , the pressure is particularly low in the interiors of large continents and comparatively high at sea ; while , during winter , we have the reverse of this , the pressure being particularly high in continental interiors and particularly low at sea . Now , it is natural to suppose that this peculiar distribution of pressure should be more pronounced when the sun 's radiation is powerful than when it is weak ; and , as far as our present evidence goes , it appears to show that this barometric seesaw ( as it has been called by Blanford ) is stronger during years of maximum than during years of minimum sunspot frequency . So far , then , the meteorological evidence supports the magnetical . The same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Mauritius Observatory , has shown that at a great number of stations the annual rain-fall is larger at times of maximum than at times of miuimum sun spots , a result which has been confirmed by observations of rivers and lakes . He has likewise shown that there are most cyclones in the Indian Ocean in years when there are most sun spots , and fewest cyclones when there are fewest sun spots ; and M. Po*y has pointed out a similar connection between the hurricanes of the West Indies and solar phenomena . On the whole , the meteorological elements of pressure , rain-fall , and wind agree with those of magnetism in representing the sun as most powerful at times of maximum sun spots , although the meteorological is not so strong as the maguetical evidence . Observations of temperature would , however , appear at first sight to tend in the opposite direction , and to show that the sun is least powerful at times of maximum spots , inasmuch as temperature is , generally speaking , lowest on such occasions . But Smyth and Blanford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a heavy rain-fall and a large amount of clouds . If , then , the rain-fall be greatest at times of maximum sun spots , it would seem to follow that the temperature might then be lowest . On the whole , we may conclude , with much probability , that the magnetical and meteorological processes of the earth are most pronounced when there are most sun spots , and this would seem to indicate that the sun 's radiation is strongest on such occasions  --  a conclusion quite in conformity with the results of direct solar observation . We have thus endeavored to establish the truth of our opening remark , that terrestrial meteorology has much to gain from the pursuit of solar inquiry . We can not justly say that meteor*ology is receiving very little support . Meteorology is like an intelligent youth who is being generously nourished in order that he may run errands and make himself useful about the house . Meanwhile , however , his education is being almost entirely neglected , and his future prospects are in great danger of being sacrificed to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done to prevent this , and on these grounds we venture to think the Report of the Solar Physics Committee wil be welcome to all true lovers of meteorological progress . This Report advises that joint action should be taken by the disciples of the three cognate sciences of magnetism , meteorology , and solar physics , and concludes with the following words , which we can not do better than repeat : " We have no hesitation in expressing our belief that the continued careful study of solar phenomena will prove to be of the greatest scientific value , and that there is no reason for doubting that the advance of true knowledge in this direction will , in some form or other , and sooner or later , prove to be of real practical value also , as all experience has shown that it has been in other branches of human knowledge .
