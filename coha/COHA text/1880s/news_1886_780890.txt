txt The Michigan Central Railroad , it is now asserted , will build a gigantic ferry , intended to run across the Straits of Mackinac at all seasons . It will carry 30 cars and will put that line in a position to compete , to some extent at least , for the Eastern traffic from the great Northwest . The new ferry will be of peculiar construction , designed especially to overcome the hitherto quite insurmountable obstaclesthat have been encountered in the Straits of Mackinac in midwinter . At times the ice is piled very high , and it has been found that the ferryboat would run one-third of her length into and on top of a deep floe of ice , and that her engines were unable to pull her off or send her further through . In such cases it became necessary to blaSt the ice from under the boat , in order to free her , which often required days to accomplish . At length a novel expedient was suggested . When a floe of ice was met which was impassable by ordinary means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some distance ahead . The ferryboat was then turned around , stern on , to the floe , and a hawser got out over the stern , carried over the floe and hitched to the stake or anchor . It must be understood that these ice floes are composed of great chunks and cakes of ice , stuck , but not frozen , together . When the ferryboat was in position her engines were started and the boat moved away a few inches from the floe , but as the hawser tightened came to a standstill . The engines , however , still worked and the screws revolved , hurling circling currents of water back against the floe . These currents loosened the cakes and pushed them away from the bow or the boat , leaving a comparatively clear passage in front . The ferryboat then went ahead , the slack of the hawser was taken in , and another push made . The new ferryboat is to put this idea into operation after a new and original fashion . The boat will be a large double-ender , with a screw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-third . greater power than the bow wheel . When running through comparatively clear water or smooth ice the bow wheel will pull and the stern wheel will push . Its crushing power will be immense , and its projectors say it will walk through ice two or two and a half feet thick with perfect ease . When it meets the great floes , so common in the straits , it is expected that the front screw will push the boat back and the rear screw will push her ahead . The greater strength of the rear screw will push the boat up against the floe , while the powerful currents circling ahead from the front screw will wash a passage in the floe and allow the ferryboat to run through . Such is the theory on which the boat is to be built . It is estimated that under the most adverse circumstances the boat will be able to make the passage in one day , where a trip of nine days has been not uncommon in bad times heretofore.          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
