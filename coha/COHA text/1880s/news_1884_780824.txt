txt An accident occurred about noon to-day in the Enterprise Coal Company 's Enterprise Colliery , near Sha-mokin , by which two miners were instantly killed and one or two others injured . On ac-count of a general suspension of mining next week , the miners were getting down all the coal they could as rapidly as possible . In one of the large breasts were Theobald Galling , John Mizo-vinsky , and two other Polanders , who worked together . The two former had been engaged for some time in trying to pry down a hUge mass of top rock and coal , but were unable to make any headway , Gallius called the other two men to his assistance . The four men , with heavy bars , soon succeeded in starting the coal to run , but not as rapidly as they wanted , and they went back again . Their bars had scarcely touched the coal when a terrible crash came , the sound of which was heard throughout every chamber in the mine . The miners all rushed to the spot where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met their gaze . At least 200 tons of top rock and coal had completely buried three of the miners , who are still under the mass , and fatally injured the fourth . A rescuing party was at once organized , and they began immediately to shovel away the debris under which the unfortunate men were buried . It is probable that the bodies will not be recovered until Monday , owing to the huge rocks which must be blasted before they can be moved . The circumstances surrounding the death of Gallius are particularly sad . He had been in this country only six months . and only two weeks ago sent money enough to his native country to bring his wife and five children to America . who are now probably on the broad Atlantic . He was 50 years of age and possessed more than ordinary intelligence . Mizoviusky was 42 years of age , and leaves a widow and four children . The other two , whose names could not be ascertained , are unmarried men , and have been in this country about 18 months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
