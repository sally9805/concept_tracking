txt This village and the communities of the adjoining towns of Suffolk County are greatly excited over a shocking double tragedy . The victims were Philip Scheidweiler , 75 years of age , and his third . wife , Christina , aged 23 . They had been married . about two years , and lived in a new two-story frame house on Wellford-avenue , about one and a half miles from the station , on the Montauk Division of the Long Island Railroad . The spot is an isolated one , and the nearest house to that of the Scheidweilers is that of Jacob Oberist , the stepfather of the dead woman . This is a quarter of a mile away . The country around is lonely and bleak , with a thick growth of scrub oak on both sides of the road . The inhabitants of the settlement are mainly Germans . About 9 o'clock this morning a son of Arthur Parthe , who married a daughter by a former wife of the old man , Scheidweiler , went to the house to deliver some mail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response to his repeated knocks . Ha summoned ' his father and the latter looked through a window in the rear of the house . Lying on the floor of the kitchen was the mut , lated body of Scheidewiler , and the household articles were turned toPsy tansy about it . Parthe hastened away and notified Justice Of finger . Together they summoned Constable Pfinger , and on the way to the scene of the tragedy several residents were called , including Frederick Schneider and William Walter . The party reached the premises , and the:son-in-law climbed in by a back window and admitted . the others . An examination of the house and grounds was made , and resulted in the finding of young Mrs. Scheidweiler 's body at the foot of the cellar stairs . It was even more terribly mutilated . than that of her aged husband , though the face and portions of the body of the latter had been eaten away by a half-starved dog and cat found . locked in the house . There were evidences of a double murder for robbery and also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the , correct one may possibly be determined only by the Coroner 's inquest . A butcher knife 15 inches long stained with human blood to which pieces of the brain adhered . was found . On the table was an open pocketbook belonging to Mr. Scheidweiler , containing nothing but unimportant papers . There was also picked up a broken stove lifter , which had evidently been used in the bloody affair . The household effects were only disturbed on the first floor . Up stairs everything was in order and tidy . An . ordinary hatchet was found in the snow outside , but it din not show signs of any blood stains . No strange footprints were noticed about the house , but the tracks of a buggy or light wagon were found in front of the house running into the scrub oak along the roadside . There were a good . many blood stains on the carpet and walls of the kitchen . To all appear . minces the woman had been killed and thrown down stairs . Neither Mr. or Mrs. Scheidweiler have been seen alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butcher 's shop , in the village . It was clear that both had been dead several days , but there was no means of knowing precisely how long . On the table , however , and in kitchen utensils on the stove were the remains of a partially prepared supper . As the couple were known to be alive on Saturday , and as the house was closed and no response was made when young Parthe and his wife called at the house to make a visit on Sunday , it is supposed that the couple were killed on Saturday afternoon about 5 or G o'clock . This theory is further borne out by the fact that decomposition had set in . That the murder was for purposes of robbery seems to be amply proved by the discovery of the empty pocketbook on the table , the fact that the old man 's pockets had been turned inside out and emptied , and no money was to be found anywhere in the house . though the old man was known to have several hundred dollars in the house , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for thoroughly is further proved by the fact that the tick or the bed the couple occupied was cut or torn open in the search for the money of the old . tinsmith . The principal clue , which it is thought may lead to the discovery of the murcierers , is a story told by a farmer named Merrill , who lives about three miles north of the scene of the murder and on the same road . He says that somewhere between midnight of Saturday and 1 o'clock Sunday morning last ho was awakened by the noise of a rapidly driven wagon rattling over the frozen road in front of his house . Wondering who could be passing at such an hour on such an unfrequented road ho got up and looked out of the front door and saw a wagon with two men in it directly in front of him . The horse attached to the wagon had fallen and the men were endeavoring to make it get up . As soon as they saw Merrill the two men jumped from the wagon and ran off . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men as being residents of Melville , a village a short distance beyond his place , who do not bear the most enviable reputations . He declined to give their names except to the Justice . Merrill believes these men murdered the Scheidweilers , and his theory is confirmed to some extent by circumstances alleged to have occurred , and which were told by Constable Wood , of Babylon , who is here in readiness to work on the case . This official says that the two men whom Merrill says he recognized were in the village Saturday , but hail little , if any , money in their possession . Sunday and Monday the same two men were there again , and spent money freely in several saloons . Thls clue will receive due consideration from the prosecuting attorney and detectives who will be put on the case . In order to stimulate the search for the murderers , a large reward will probably be offered by the village and town authorities as soon as they can meet to take action in the matter . Very little else that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-night . Dr. Woudend , the Coroner for this district , who lives 25 miles from here , at Huntington , was summoned by Justice ? flinger. and arrived . here at 7 o'clock this evening . He summoned a jury at once , but as it was so late the work of taking testimony was adjourned until noon to-morrow . District Attorney Wilmot Smith has Lo been summoned , and will take charge of the case to-morrow and do what he can to run down the murderers .
