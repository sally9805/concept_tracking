txt The tour of county fairs by aspiring American statesmen has its parallel in English politics , where also decorum seems to require that the orator shall abstain from party questions when ho is considering agriculture . Lord . RANDOLPH CHURCHILL has been addressing a meeting of farmers at York , and lie has told them what is none the less useful for being both obvious and familiar . He points out to them that the agricultural depression is not a matter of " bad seasons " nor likely to be at all relieved by an improvement in the Summer weather of England , even . if there were reason to expect such an improvement . The truth is , he says , that England from the force of competition has ceased to be a wheat-growing country . Its climate , no doubt , is one among its disadvantages , but these disadvantages , taken together , are such that a Cheshire farmer can buy American wheat for the use of his own family cheaper than he can grow it . This is a very gloomy outlook for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commiseration . It may turn out to be a still gloomier outlook for the British landlord , whose case Lord RANDOLPII does not consider . The most obvious palliative for this state of affairs is a revival of the corn laws . Divers bold Tories , among whom we believe that Lord RANnoLrll himself was at one time numbered , have advocated that measure as tending to create a better demand for homegrown products of agriculture . Perhaps none of its advocates had much faith in it , but they believed that the agricultural laborers and the small farmers did have faith , and that the proposal to tax imported food would bring to their party a larger share of the votes conferred by the last Reform bill than they were likely to win in any other manner . As a piece of sharp and unscrupulous politics , the roposal seemed likely at one time to commend . itself to the Tory leaders . But there has at no time been any chance that the corn laws would in fact be revived , or that a proposition in any form artificially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law . The American competition in breadstuffs has spoiled the British market for the British farmer . Lord RANDOLPH intimates that there are other forum of production open to the British farmer , though he wisely abstains front specifying them . " The era of the cultivation of large tracts of arable land , " he says , " is rapidly passing away , and there is approaching an era in which the holdings will be much smaller . " But what are the small holders to do with these holdings ? Ireland is a country of hold- ings ' quite as small as anybody could reasonably ask , and the Irish agriculturist does not excite the envy of his British brother , except perhaps for . his good fortune in having to pay no rent . The British farmer is sometimes exhorted to restrict his exertions to root crops and cattle . But grazing is an industry that can not be profitably carried on in " small holdings . " It is more than doubtful if it can be carried on in England at all . American and Australian competition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of grain . The British Privy Council , which is composed of landholders , has repeatedly attempted to exclude American cattle for reasons ostensibly sanitary , but really protective . This can not be managed for very long , and when it fails the . British cattle raiser will be no better off than the British wheat grower now is . What Lord RANDOLPH had in mind when he spoke of small holdings was probably what we call truck farms . But the island of Great Britain , though not large enough to grow food for all its population , is too large to be available merely as a market garden for the supply . of such products as are too perishable to be imported . The main difference between the growing of wheat in Minnesota and the growing of wheat in Oxfordshire is that the owner of the farm is in Minnesota the farmer , and in England a landlord who receives an annual rent that in the West would very nearly buy the fee of the farm . The land will no longer yield the landlord 's rent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is aggregated in largo holdings or divided in small . Ireland is a poorer country than England , and its farmers are less careful and provident . For that reason the impossibility of paying the rent heretofore customary has been made manifest in Ireland earlier than in England . But it will surely be manifested in England also , and the Irish question , in so far as it is merely an economic question , will be presented for solution as the English question . It can not be solved except by an admission that agricultural land iu England , as in this country , can not support its owner in idleness and support also a small capitalist of a farmer who holds of him and who in turn hires the manual labor he needs . The ultimate outcome of tile difficulty must be the disappearance of the landed gentry , including the nobility , whose incomes are derived from the rental of agricultural land . This is a view which the son of a Duke is naturally loth to take , but it is the view that will enforce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older .
