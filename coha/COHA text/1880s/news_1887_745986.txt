txt A very fair and full presentation has been made to the Judiciary Committee of the State Senate of the conditions affecting the passage of the bill incorporating the Tilden Trust . Mr. JAMES C. CARTER and ex-Judge COMSTOCK have statdd the nature of the responsibility accepted . by Mr. TILDEN 'S Executors . Mr. FRANCIS M. Scow has formulated the claim of the city of New York , and Mr. F. W. WHITRIDGE has appeared on behalf of the free libraries of this city , with a statement of the benefits to be derived from the absolute acceptance of the bequest by the reading public . The case as presented to the Senate is simply between the contestants of Mr. TILDEN 's will and . the people who have an interest in carrying out the expressed intention of the testator . And the difference between these two parties is reduced , so far as the Legislature is concerned , to the question of accepting or rejecting an amendment to the act of incorporation designed to render it of no effect . If it be argued . that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herein contained shall affect the rights of any parties to any action now pending or of anyheir at law of said SAMUEL J. TILDEN , deceased , " the question must be answered . why is its adoption asked . for ? If it be pure surplusage , why retain it 7 If it have any possible effect or purpose adverse to the rights of the people , - why not throw it out ? As Judge Coms.rocx puts the case , " The rights of the heirs were settled and fixed the moment the breath left the body of Mr. TILDEN . There they stand , and . no act of the Legislature can impair them . " It is for the representatives of the dissatisfied heirs to explain to the Senate committee when they get a hearing this week why they insist on the passage of the amendment . They can only be " protected " at the expense of the people of New-Yorkthat is , they can only acquire new rights under the division of Mr. TILDEN 'S property by the will being broken and a state of intestacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entitled to the money which the testator evidently intended , to go for other purposes . If the will is not good the courts can be trusted to see that the heirs enjoy all the rights which the law allows them . But the Legislature is bound to accept the presumption that the will is legally valid and to place no artificial obstacles in the way of the people whom they represent securing their rights under it . It has been asked by Senators and others if this corporation is created . what is there to prevent the Trustees from going on and buying the property , erecting the buildings , investing in books , and putting the remainder of the estate into the library , where the heirs , should the decision of the courts be in their favor , could not easily reach it . The obvious answer to that is that , pending a legal contest over the will , the Trustees would take such a step at their personal risk . They must give an account of the estate which is now in their hands , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a corporation whose validity is matter of legal contest they will be held . to a very strict reckoning to the full extent of their individual responsibility . They might , very properly , execute a formal conveyance in order to vest the corporation with a title , and make it , on behalf of the people of the city ; a party to any contest in the courts .. But they certainly will not divest themselves of the control of the property - until it is decided that the corporation is legally competent to take it . If they were capable of the folly of a premature transfer an injunction could very easily be secured to restrain them . There remains only the question of why the corporation should be created now instead of waiting till the litigation is over . The answer is that the act of incorporation must be granted within the compass of two lives named in the body of the will . These lives are subject to the ordinary risks of mortality , and if they were to be terminated to-morrow the will , to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one shuck . " In short , every proposal of delay like every proposal to " amend " the act of incorporationtendsto imperil the chances of the people ever enjoying the magnificent bequest made to them by Mr. TILDEN . No considerations of fairness or generosity can be pleaded in defense of legislative action calculated simply and solely to defeat the plain intent of Mr. TILDEN 'S will and to substitute for it a theory of the division of his estate equally opposed to the interests of the public and the purpose of the testator . No act of incorporation can abridge any rights which , the heirs possess under the will ; but the passage of such an act must affect their position by making the gift to the people effectual . If the Legislature insists on saying that nothing contained in the act shall be held to affect the heirs at law , it may be held that this is equivalent to saying that no valid act of incorporation has been passed at all . It ought to be clear that the Legislature would betray its duty to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be equally certain that when the matter is thoroughly understood such a proposal will be most emphatically negatived.
