THE second volume of the " Battles and Leaders " is , in my judgment , even more interesting than the first volume . It introduces us to the period when General McClellan transformed the armed masses which had fought at the first battle of Bull Run , together with the vast numbers of recruits who subsequently joined them , into the Army of the Potomac . It takes us through the Peninsular Campaign and dwells upon the deeply-interesting questions involved in its conduct , as well as in its conception as illustrated by later events . It tells us of those two brilliant champions of a lost cause whose leadership is full of military suggestion and military lessons . No matter how doubtful at every point and for all time may have been the legality or advisability of the War , that two such men had fought on any one side would , of itself , throw a halo round the cause they fought for . Their character can never fail to excite general admiration . Even those who were most bitterly opposed to Stonewall Jackson and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be utterly wrong in their conception of national duty , will readily admit their excellence as soldiers , their sincerity as patriots . There is so much to be said on the campaigns in the Shenandoah Valley , on the seven days ' fighting near Richmond , on the campaign against Pope , and on Lee 's invasion of Maryland , that I must pass over somewhat lightly the most important operations of Admiral Farragut , which led to the capture of New Orleans . Nevertheless , for us of the old country these " am*phibious ' operations , as Mr. Kinglake would call them , have a quite peculiar importance . The coi*peration of the United States navy // with their army , in producing a decisive effect upon the whole character of the military operations , is akin to what happens with us in nearly every war in which we engage . A German , a French , or a Russian general may frequently , perhaps usually , carry on a campaign without considering what assistance he may expect to derive from the coi*peration of his own navy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations of the naval forces of his enemy . An English general has almost always to make his calculations strictly in accordance with what the navy can do for him . The operations by which the Federal navy , in conjunction with the army , split the Confederacy in two and severed the East from the West , must always , therefore , have for him a profound interest and importance . The great strategical results obtained by this concentration of military and naval power , which were as remarkabla as the circumstances under which the successes were gained , deserve our closest study . I shall not attempt to discuss from a naval point of view the much-debated question whether Admiral Porter 's mortar-schooners were or were not largely instrumental in determining the success of Farragut 's passage between Fort Jackson and Fort St. Philip . The point is , however , one in which the effect on the forts is as much involved as the action of the navy . I may , therefore , venture the opinion , based on the evidence of the Confederate side , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually exploded within Fort Jackson , had comparatively little effect in preventing that fort from contributing its share toward the result of the operation . Captain Robertson 's evidence ( p. 100 , Vol . II. ) is distinct that at the time of Admiral Farragut 's passage , in the water-battery at least , " every gun in the battery was loaded and pointed toward the river , and the men were kept at their posts** and again : " No guns were silenced in either Fort Jackson or the water-battery at any time during this engagement . Not a man was driven from his post at the guns in the water-battery , much less from the battery itself . " It is , mutatis mutandis , almost the same story that General Sheridan tells of the effect of the Prussian artillery at Gravelotte . There the Prussian officers believed they had absolutely silenced the Freiich artillery and crushed out the resistance of the French infantry . From his experience during the Civil War , General Sheridan told them that when they made their attack they would // find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Germans throughout the war soon afterwards verified the correctness of his inference . Had it been necessary to silence by mortar fire the guns of Fort Jackson and the water-battery before the ships ran the gauntlet between Fort Jackson and Fort St. Philip , Farragut would never have achieved his splendid success . No ! as always in war , Farragut 's success was almost purely the result of the moral effect which his movement produced , and of defects 6ther than material in the force opposed to him . It is clear that there was a complete want of unity of command over the combined naval and military defences for the protection of New Orleans . No doubt the Southern fleet was not properly ready for action , and for this unreadiness it would seem that Captain Mitchell , who commanded it , was not responsible . I do not think , however , it is possible to read the correspondence which passed between Captain Mitchell and General Duncan without feeling that Captain Mitchell was one of those men , common enough in every service , who can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own particular calling is other than a stupid fool . Such men usually conceive it to be their first duty to ignore , as an impertinent interference , any suggestion which comes from outside their own charmed circle . It is clear that the officers in the forts were in a position to observe the movements and to forecast the intentions of the Federals , and that the officers in the ships were not . As it turned out , the " Louisiana** proved absolutely useless to the defence . General Duncan saw through the intentions of Admiral Farragut , but his correct anticipation that the attempt would be made the night it was actually made was an absurd landsman 's guess about matters he was not calculated to express any useful opinion upon . His views were , therefore , contemptuously ignored . Had Captain Mitchell been a man large-minded enough to rise above paltry professional prejudices , he would not have continued to expend all his energies on preparing the " Louisiana* ' for a service she was never called upon to perform . But he would , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lit up with fire-rafts , " as he was again and again urged to do . The temper shown in this proceeding is one so dangerous that , whenever it appears , it deserves to be castigated by those who review the facts afterwards , // whether the lash falls on naval or military shoulders . The same temper , it would seem , crops out in Commodore Mitchell 's present defence . " Naval officers , " he says , " ought surely to be considered better judges of how the forces and appliances at their command should be managed than army officers . " Certainly no one will dispute that statement , but both naval and army officers must be judged by a reasonable examination of the results of their action and of the alternatives open to them . On the question whether certain naval officers properly cooperated with and paid proper attention to the representations of the soldiers , a Naval Court of Inquiry is not likely to be the most impartial of tribunals . It would have been interesting if , in appealing to the final judgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a naval verdict , which , as he admits , was given without any reception of the evidence on the other side . It would have been well for him to explain why no fire-ships were sent down the river ; why the forts were left to fight in the dark during the actual night of attack . Granting that he is correct in urging that by the evening of the 24th April he would have had his ships ready , it would be interesting to know what service he considered he was rendering the Confederacy by preparations which , it was pointed out to him , could not be completed in time for the attack that others believed would be made on the night it actually occurred . To weigh fairly the evidence and to estimate justly the soundness or unsoundness of the reasons and motives which determined Commodore Mitchell 's action at the time , it is not necessary to be either a soldier or a sailor . When that officer alleged that he did not take steps to meet the attack on the night between April 23 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for service by the evening of . the 24th , any man of ordinary common-sense will understand that he disbelieved the evidence supplied to him . The evidence went to show that the attack would be made twenty-four hours before the evening of the 24th . Yet surely those reasons for expecting the attack to be made when it did actually come off were absolutely sound . Such , I think , will be the verdict of independent naval officers , who examine the facts without prejudice . I would sooner have exposed such a line of conduct on the part of a soldier , because my views upon it would then have been more manifestly impartial . But I feel it is important , in the interest of all naval // and military states , that these miserable little professional prejudices should be exposed wherever and whenever they occnr , for the encouragement of the large-minded men of both services . To do so frankly at all times will , I think , chock one of the most fatal tendencies by which the success of any joint naval and military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the interests of the Confederacy were seriously injured in this instance . To me it seems clear that Admiral Farragut 's splendid achievement was made possible , first , by the inadequate previous prepa*ration of the naval part of the New Orleans defences ; secondly , by the want of harmonious working between the Confederate naval and military forces ; and , lastly , by his own clear appreciation of the moral effect he would produce by forcing his way past the defences of Fort Jackson and Fort St. Philip and by his appearance before New Orleans . For , after all , the forts were never captured by actual attack . They fell because the Confederate soldiers in Fort Jackson mutinied against the continuance of the defence when New Orleans had been captured . It is a curious fact to note that , at that very time , New Orleanswhich , however , could not itself be defended-was surrendering avowedly because those forts had fallen ! This brilliant result is a striking instance of the due appreciation by a commander of the effect which daring achievements exert on men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those daring acts do not actually , directly , or materially make certain the end or the surrender they may have secured . In other words , Admiral Farragut 's attack was based on a knowledge of the superior importance in war of moral over material force . One can hardly offer a higher compliment to any naval or military commander . I pass now to the appointment of General McClellan to the command of the Army of the Potomac , and his subsequent accession , for a time at least , to the general command of the armies of the United States . I entertain the strongest possible belief , which has been confirmed by all the evidence supplied by the Cenlury papers , that for the failure of the Peninsular Campaign the Administration at Washington was far more to blame than Gene*ral McClellan . It is , therefore , only fair that I should turn first to the defence of the Administration which has been attempted by Lieutenant-Colonel IR . B. Irwin ( p. 435 , Vol . II. ) , and examine it in the light of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July 25 , 1861 , to the command of the army in the department of the Potomac , and on November 1 following " to command the whole army " of the United States . He had to create out of purely raw materials an army of which the part he proposed to employ in the Peninsula alone was 156,000 strong . The more one studies the nature of this force as it manieuvred and fought in the Peninsula , and as , despite all its subsequent disasters , it substantially remained throi*ghout the War , the more marvellous does the ability , as well as the rapidity , with which General McClellan organized it appear to soldiers who understand the magnitude and difficulty of the task he undertook . Throughout his whole army , with few exceptions , this appears to have been the view taken by all , from the most senior general td the youngest recruit . But outside the army this was different , although in newspaper articles he was commonly referred to , with more effusion than sense , as the young American Napoleon . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have advertised the talents of some rising dentist . As time wore on without bringing any decisive action , there arose throughout the mass of the people an impatience at the delay of preparation , which became daily more apparent . That most cruel tyrant , the " public , " had no means of realizing the difficulties to be overcome . It did not understand what organization meant , but it shared with all peoples the very common article of faith that you have only to gather together hundreds of thousands of men , and to arm them , in order to form an army . As the months of 1862 went by , the universal feeling was one of impatience and restlessness at what was deemed the waste of time and the useless delay which were taking place . Under that impression , and under the force which this so formed Public Opinion was exerting , the Administration at Washington found itself compelled to act . That is evident enough from the most interesting and striking letters which Colonel Irwin quotes as written by Mr. Lincoln to McClellan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President felt he was being driven by a power superior to his own , and by one to which McClellan , like himself , must yield . " Once more let us tell you , " he writes , " it is indispensable to yom&amp; that you strike a blow ! I am powerless to help this . " The Administration was merely giving expression to the decrees of an // entirely ignorant public opinion . If all those who wield the pen would only kindly wait until commanders have quite accomplished the mission entrusted to them before they decide that soldiers , " with their guns and drums and fuss and fury , " are to pass away and leave the glory to others , it might matter little to the state . But when in the middle of a war they take it upon themselves to drive or to force those whom they influence to decide what the naval or military commander should do , the result will certainly be , as it was in this instance , to protract , perhaps for years , the duration of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could settle off-hand at once . If these Century articles could be as widely read among us as they have been in America , we might possibly be saved in the future from disasters such as were entailed on us in the Crimea by very similar action . In particular , I should like those articles by Mr. Warren Lee Goss , the " Recollections of a Private , " duly studied . For , after all , questions of strategy , of tactics , and of the importance of organization of all kinds turn upon the effect which is ultimately produced on the spirit and well-being and fighting efficiency of the private soldier . Whilst the organs of public opinion and their humble servant , the public Administration , were grumbling at the slow movements which only carried General McClellan 's army forward fifty-two miles in sixteen days ( Colonel Irwin , p. 437 ) , Private Lee Goss and his companions were learning " in time that marching on paper and the actual march made two very different impressions , " and though they could " easily understand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our battles at home over comfortable breakfast-tables , without impediments of any kind to circumscribe their fancied operations , " they found out also that it is " much easier to mancmvre and fight large armies around the corner grocery than to fight , march , and manc*uvre in wind and rain , in the face of a brave and vigilant enemy . " There are , however , matters beyond the immediate view of the private which must be considered . From the moment when , thanks to those mistakes of Mr. Jefferson Davis of which I spoke in the last article , the Federal navy had asserted its absolute supremacy at sea , it is clear that the shortest and safest , as well as the most decisive , route to Richmond was by a movement based on the James River . To carry this out arrangements for the ade // quate protection of Washington were essential . But whilst McClellan with the main army marched upon Richmond , it was necessary to protect the force allotted for the defence of Washington from a counter-stroke by Lee or by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was desirable to keep it close to Washington , and thus as far away from Richmond as was possible with due regard to the safety of the former city . In order that the army on the James River , intended for offensive operations , should be made as strong as possible , the force detailed for the protection of Washington should have been as small as was consistent with the accomplishment of its object , and should have had a strictly defensive role allotted to it . This concentration of energy on a single aim at a time is such a commonplace of ordinary business life that it is passing strange why it should be so difficult to persuade men who have not had the experience of war that in all military operations it is the one thing most needful . Military history , had it been known to Mr. Lincoln and his ministers , would have taught them that , under the then existing circumstances , the Confederate army could not venture far away from Richmond . That threatened capital was not only the seat of the Confederate government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Confederate armies between Richmond and Washington drew their supplies . Whenever attacked , those armies must have returned to defend it . I think General McClellan ought not to have left Washington without convincing himself that Mr. Lincoln and the Secretary of War were satisfied with the arrrangements he had made for the defence of the capital . That those arrangements were in them . selves adequate is beyond doubt . In omitting to come to this understanding with the President , he evinced , it would seem , a want of knowledge of the working of popular governments in times of great national danger . He thus exposed himself to , or , at least , he gave an excuse for , the very thing which happened that which ruined his chances in the campaign ; namely , the withdrawal from his command of at least 63,000 men . Nor was this mere withdrawal of McDowell 's corps , of Blenker 's division , and of the 10,000 men of General Wool 's command , the only disastrous consequence which was entailed on McClellan by the exaggerated fears of the Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by this first interference // with McClellan 's plans to take upon himself the general directiofl of the whole campaign . It was he who thrust forward the force under McDowell , and so entailed upon McClellan the necessity of placing himself in that false position astride of the Chickahominy which led to all the misfortunes of this campaign . It is scarcely possible to imagine any military arrangements more futile than those which were devised by this civilian Minister of War , Mr. Stanton . His scattering of the Federal forces throughout the Shenandoah Valley gave Jackson the opportunity for carrying out his brilliant campaign in that region . The necessity of maintaining connection with the armies which were to come to his support from the North obliged McClellan so to divide his force that , had General J. E. Johnston 's orders been properly carried out , the Federal army ought to have had its left wing annihilated at the battle of Seven Pines , as it actually had its right wing crushed at Gaines 's Mill . As already stated , I think General McClellan should have satisfied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the defence of Washington , because that was a subject on which the President had fairly every right to be satisfied ; but I can not admit that this omission on the General 's part was any adequate excuse for the complete upsetting of his whole plan of campaign . Mr. Lincoln , though doubtless one of the greatest men who have ruled the United States , was entirely ignorant of war . Able and wise as he was in all matters of civil government , he failed here most disastrously . By the course lie pursued he wrecked an ablydevised plan for the advance upon Richmond of all the available Federal forces by one single line , whilst the troops intended for the defence of Washington were kept as passive as possible . Instead of that plan , a divided command was inaugurated and a disjointed series of movements were ordered , which ended in the transfer of the initiative to Lee . The change ordered by Mr. Lincoln in McClellan 's plans gave the Confederates an opportunity for throwing their united forces , at pleasure , upon any part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as Colonel Irwin appears to expect we should all at once do , that McClellan was wrong in refusing to explain publicly to the Cabinet the details of his proposed scheme . At that time it was notorious that what was said to the Cabinet in Washington leaked out at once into the streets , and was thence conveyed promptly to the Confederate authorities . I know , from // what I learned at Richmond in the autumn of 1862 , how well Lee was kept informed of everything done or intended by , the Northern army . Let us hear Stonewall Jackson on this subject , and compare his methods and principles of action in each particular with those that were pressed on McClellan by the Washington Administration , or , rather , by their master , public opinion . We have to thank General Imboden for those golden sentences of Jackson 's which comprise some of the most essential of all the principles of war : " Always mystify , mislead , and surprise the enemy , if possible ; and when you strike and overcome him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men have strength to follow ; for an army routed , if hotly pursued , becomes panic-stricken , and can then be destroyed by half their number . The other rule is , never fight against heavy odds , if by any possible manceuvring you can hurl your own force on only a part , and that the weakest part , of your enemy and crush it . Such tactics will win every time , and a small army may thus destroy a large one in detail , and repented victory will make it invincible . " Compare those principles , and the mode iii which Jackson carried them out , with the ideas current at Washington , and you will see that they are direct inversions . The orders which emanated from there may be described thus : " Go straight at the enemy at the very point where he expects you , and where he has long been expecting to receive you . Let every one know what you are going to do , so that we may announce it in the public press , and chuckle and crow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many directions as possible , so that the enemy may always be able to bring superior forces against you . Arrange your force so that it is rigidly tied to one particular point , and that the enemy can not doubt where you will be . Go ahead without preparation , forethought , or care ; only let us hear that you are moving , so that the newspapers may brag . " These-I declare I have nothing exaggerated and naught set down in malice-these are the principles and practice which Colonel Irwin has undertaken the task of defending . It is a difficult one . I frankly admit that , when dealing with this fatuous folly , General McClellan did not behave with the meekness of an amiable schoolboy under discipline . I think he was unjust to Mr. Stanton in supposing that he ( Mr. Stanton ) had any personal hostility to him . Mr. Stanton really believed that the orders he gave were transparently sound and wise , and that any one who differed from him must be wrong . I do not know , however , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could possibly have realized this . In order to understand Mr. Stanton it is necessary to read General Pope 's account of his interview with // that gentleman , given on page 449 . One of my friends assures me that in reading it he literally " laughed till he cried , " and never fully understood what the expression meant before doing so . I can quite understand it . Laughter is said to be due to our being impelled by two contradictory feelings at the same time . That certainly is the condition under which one reads those pages . There is scarcely any folly possible in relation to the command of an army which Mr. Stanton does not propose with the gravest face to General McDowell . At the same time , the man is evidently sincere , and convinced that , being a clever politician and holding the position of War Minister , every principle of war-as he understood war-which he enunciated must be right , and therefore ought to be obeyed without question . It is difficult to pronounce whether the image that rises before us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his legs are decked with military boots , thinks himself every inch a soldier , or that of a grave Minister who is charged with the solemn responsibility of a great Nation 's destiny and with the lives and fortunes of thousands of his fellow-citizens . Let me put a few of the points together . If there be one thing more important than another in* the command of any army , but more especially of one recently gathered together in a hurry from civil life , it is that officers and men should have confidence in their leader . It is essential that they should know and understand him , and , from their previous experience , should feel sure he is going to lead them to victory . " Therefore , " says Mr. Stanton , " I can not be wrong in withdrawing General Pope from the Army of the Mississippi , where he is known and liked and has been d6ing very well , to take command of the army of Virginia , where no one knows much more than his name , his previous military operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Promotion of a junior over the heads of men very senior to him in the service is often very wise and necessary ; but unless it is done for reasons which are known and appreciated by the army as a whole , such as tend to inspire the army with confidence , it is pretty sure to lead to serious friction . " Therefore , " says Mr. Stanton , " let us proceed as follows : There are those three corps , which have been chiefly formed under McClellan and are extremely proud of themselves as forming part of the old Army of the Potomac . They have already begun to acquire a certain // spirit of their own ; disasters have overtaken them for the moment ( in consequence , as they believed , of their having been withdrawn from McClellan and foolishly scattered ) . Let us , therefore , select an officer from a far-off region , belonging to a force of which the Army of the Potomac has a certain amount of soldierly jealousy . The deeds of that distant hero will certainly not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McClellan . But never mind ; let us put this unknown leader over the heads of the three men now holding high command in that army , each well known to his own corps , and each senior to the man we select to command them . " With disadvantages of such a nature against him , it may still be necessary sometimes to put an able junior over his seniors , in order that he should undertake some special task , provided he clearly sees his way to accomplish it , and feels confidence in himself . " Therefore , " said Mr. Stanton , " let us select General Pope to undertake a task which he himself regards as a forlorn hope . ' Despite his imploring remonstrances that he may be sent back to his old army , we will order him to submit cheerfully , ' which will , of course , inspire him with all the confidence he needs . " Surely , surely , so far at least every man who manages a large business concern will follow me in seeing that all these propositions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not , in such a matter , so terribly criminal . Upon General Pope , not a strong commander , was now forced the monstrous scheme of moving forward his already hopelesslyscattered army to " demonstrate " within striking distance of Richmond just at the time when McClellan , deprived of that very force , was about to be reduced to inaction by the battle of Gaines 's Mill and the retreat to the James River at this junction . General Pope showed his appreciation of the position by urging the appointment of some one general to command the two armies , who could then combine their action for a common purpose . It was a necessity entailed by the attempts to operate at once with both armies , instead of keeping one of them on the defensive and weakened so as to make the other very strong for rapid , offensive operations along the most telling line for an advance . It is obvious that the retreat of McClellan to the James River did make General Pope 's position , to the north of Richmond , exceptionally dangerous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armies , and greatly increased the distance between // them . It is not , however , I think , the fact , as General Pope assumes , that the Confederates were " ready to exchange Richmond for Washington . " For Jackson 's movement to oppose Pope was not made till Lee was convinced that McClellan 's army was not in a condition to carry out any further offensive movement . The wide turning movement of Jackson on Manassas Junction , and the movement northwards of Longstreet 's corps , did not take place till McClellan had begun to evacuate the Peninsula . Whatever mistakes General Pope may have made , it is clear that the disasters of this campaign were due to the order from Washington which required him to maintain an advanced position on the Rappahanuock , and which gave him reason to suppose that his communications with Manassas would be guarded by troops independent of his own army , but which were nowhere within reach when they were wanted . For that failure General Halleck was no doubt directly responsible ; but the great mistake lay in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better described than in Mr. Lincoln 's words applied later in the War : they " swopped horses whilst they were crossing the stream . " They allowed McClellan to go off with his army to the Peninsula whilst he was at least nominally in command of the armies of the United States , and as soon as he was fully committed to the enterprise , they so completely upset all his arrangements as to bring about the condition of things which made it necessary to have with the Government in Washington a " General-in-Chief " of all the National forces . General Halleck was selected for the post  --  a most unhappy , most unfortunate selection . I do not much appreciate any part of General ilalleck 's conduct in the War , either when he was in the West or after he arrived at Washington . He appears to have chiefly distinguished himself in the West by snubbing the two ablest soldiers he had under him , Generals Grant and Sherman . He appears to have chiefly distinguished himself at Washington by first snubbing General McClellan , then by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after , by giving a positive assurance that Pope was in no danger , to be followed quickly by a complete loss of heart when that General 's army came hurrying back in confusion to the Potomac . Then we find him , when panic-stricken for the safety of Washington , throw all responsibility on McClellan , the man he had previously snubbed . As soon as McClellan 's presence // had restored confidence and morale to Pope 's demoralized army , he does his best to prevent McClellan from striking effective blows against the very much weaker and , for the time , necessarily dispersed army of General Lee , and we see him , ignorantly and stupidly , incidentally throwing away the forces which were compelled to surrender at Harper 's Ferry . It is not , therefore , from any special sympathy with General Halleck that I am induced to think he was , from the first , placed in a false position . He had to take up and accept for better or worse the fatuous plan devised by Secretary Stanton , against which both McClellan and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emergencies before he could possibly have made himself really acquainted with all the circumstances of the new field of war into which he had been suddenly pitchforked . Hence my own conviction that for this , as for most of the other misfortnnes experienced by the Federal troops , the verdict of history will ultimately hold responsible the Administration at Washington rather than the generals who commanded in the field . And yet it is both striking and interesting to see how much the personal character of Lincoln himself rose superior to his surroundings . His very modesty unfortunately left him , as regards all military operations , too much in the hands of his Secretary for War . But compare Mr. Stanton , with " large eye-glasses , " " dishevelled appearance , " " presence not imposing , " " abrupt manner , " " speech shQrt and rather dictatorial , " employed in dictating orders which were rank nonsense , with the quiet , modest manner , the simple , natural dignity , the genial humor , the shrewd common-sense , which appear in every story told of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General McClellan was probably wrong as to the cause which he assigned for Mr. Stanton 's opposition to him , he was right enough in attributing his difficulties to the Secretary for War , and not to the President . Mr. Lincoln was , from a military point of view , clearly mistaken in believing that the one way to get at Richmond was by making straight there from Washington . It is impossible , however , if one puts one 's self at all in his place , not to see how nobly he faced the difficulties of his position , and how anxiously he endeavored to do his duty to his country . WOLSELEY . To BE CONTINUED.
