txt Governor-elect Cleveland has been for some days hard at work on his first annual Message , and has seen very few people . For an hour or so nearly every day ho is in his law office attending to some necessary duties , and while there he sees those who call . But he seems bored by callers , and , though always in good temper , he lets it be seen that he has his hands and his head full and had rather not be interrupted . The applications for offices continue to pour in and are filed away in order by the clerks in his law office , for he has no private secretary yet . These applications represent all sorts of people , but are most numerous from those who seem unable to get a living at any business employment , and so resort to politics . This sort will , however , worry the appointing power very little . There is the best authority for saying that he will start off with the determination to make fitness the real , and , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While at work on his Message the Governorelect is in his living rooms in the second story of the building where his law office is situated . These rooms are handsomely fitteel up , and he makes himself secure from interruption by locking his doors and giving orders that he can not be seen unless the caller has business of very exceptional importance . In these rooms he wrote his letter accepting the Democratic nomination for Governor , making the first draft of it one Sunday morning immediately on rising and before putting on his clothes . There , also , he wrote his letter on civil service reform . . Both letters were entirely his own work , and were completed and ready for the press before they were read by any one but himself . " I thought I would show the civil service letter to Mr. Sherman S. Rogers , " said he , one day . " Mr. Rogers is President of the Buffalo Civil Service Reform Association , and I wanted to see what he would think of it . But , then , I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did not like to do that , so I let it go . But Mr. Rogers came in one day and I told him I had completed it , and road it to him . I am glad to say he expressed entire satisfaction with it . " Though working very steadily , Gov . Cleveland does occasionally relax and talk matters over in a very frank and easy way . As is very well known , he is a bachelor  --  a confirmed bachelor , I think  --  and does not " go in society " at all . Ho has never seemed to have the slightest social ambition . He has always been very popular and always been a strong candidate for local office . The Young Men 's Association , which supports a large library here , and includes all the better class of young men in the city in its membership , affords a good test of local popularity . Its annual elections are always hotly contested , and it is deemed a social distinction to be chosen an officer of it . Mr. Cleveland was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he seemed to care nothing . Any family in the city would be glad to welcome him as a guest , but he never calls on them . When he relaxes , therefore , he goes to the club . He is a member of both the principal clubs here  --  the Buffalo Club and the City Club . The former is more aristocratic , consequently Gov . Cleveland has always preferred the latter . Then ho likes to go and sit down with a few friends of mixed politics and either play whist or talk  --  he is too good a whist-player and tee ) good a talker to attempt to do both at the same time . He can , however , smoke a cigar to great advantage , whether playing whist or talking . In the conversations there his friends say he shows the best part of his nature . He is genial , easy , not doing a large part of the talking himself , but often suggesting themes on which his friends talk to him . It was after spending an evening of this kind with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day if I knew that Ralph Waldo Emerson bad described Gov . Cleveland in one of his letters . Of course , I did not know it . My friend then took up Conway 's " Emerson at Home and Abroad " andpointed to the following passage in a letter which he had marked : " The few superior persons in each community are so by their steadiness to reaiitv and their neglect of appearances . This is the eupbrasy and rue that purge the intellect and insure insight . Its full rewards are slow but sure , and yet I think it has its reward on the instant , inasmuch as simplicity and grandeur are always better than dapperness . " My friend insisted than Emerson could not have told the kind of man Gov . Cleveland is better if he had known him always . Though he talks very little politics at the club , Mr. Cleveland has become too much interested in the work before him as Governor to let it alone entirely . He was gratified at the favor with which his staff appointments were received , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than any others . There was very little grumbling , though many were disappointed . This seems to have been due to the fact that the men chosen are unexceptionable in character , and they are generally well suited to the positions they are to occupy . The way he insisted on fitness was well shown by his appointment of Engineer . There were several applicants for the place , among them a prominent and wealthy local Democrat , who contributed liberally to Mr. Cleveland 's campaign , and who was unanimously indorsed by the Central Democratic Club of the ' city for the appoint . ment . But he was quietly set aside in favor of Mr. George S. Field , who was not a candidate , but whom Mr. Cleveland knew to be a competent engineer . " I did not like the idea , " ho said . " of appointing a man Engineer who knew nothing of engineering ; so I invented Field . " I am satisfied that the some principle was acted on in all the appointments . There is no doubt that he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , and should any of his official acts call forth general censure from the press he would certainly regard it very seriously . When some of the newspapers said the other day that his appointment of Military Secretary at $1,200 a year was a bad beginning and an unnecessary expense , as was shown by the fact that Gov . Cornell had no such officer , he noticed it very quickly . He said the papers should know that the law gives the Governor a specified sum to pay his personal assistants . Gov . Cornell had no Military Secretary , but spent the ** in another way . He had decided to have the Secretary . That was all there was to that criticism . A good many attempts have been made to size up Mr. Cleveland and tell what kind of a Governor he will be , but none of them has told much . There is but little in his public acts to base predictions upon . It is safe to say , however , that he will be aavery painstaking Governor . He will endeavor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then deal with it independently . His habits as a lawyer make that quite certain , and his record as Mayor confirms that view . He never tries a suit without carefully studying every point . In every important case in which he has addressed a jury he has prepared himself very fully . He always writes down the points he expects to make and goes over teem most thoroughly to make sure that nothing important is omitted . He is often up the entire night before making an argument preparing himself . In law he trusts nothing at ail to luck or to inspiration . He expects to work for every point . It is this habit of thoroughness that now renders his task of preparing a Message difficult and wearing . He has struck what I suppose to he one of his weak points . Questions of State have not , I think , occupied very much of his attention . When it comes to dealing with them , therefore , and making recommendations , ho finds that it requires a tremendous amount of reading and reviewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his friends in that it will show whether he has a grasp of public questions . I think it safe to say that he will make few if any unsound recommendations ; but I think it extremely doubtful if he shows a master nand in dealing with all the questions upon which he must write . He has never been in any position that required knowledge of the sort he now wants , and I do not think he has it . He has always read the newspapers . to be sure , and has taken a reasonably lively interest in pub ; lie affairs ; but I doubt if he has been in the habit of reading Governors ' Messages . and am quite sure he has not read them critically . I1 will be singular , therefore , if he shows the fa . miharity with public questions , and freedom in dealing with them which the Governor 01 New-York ought to show . What he says , how . ever , will undoubtedly be said understanding ly and will be his own . The Message will be his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cleveland expects to go to Albany Dec. 27 , after which he will occupy the Executive Mansion . He will take with him the wel wishes of all his townsmen , many of whom am confident he will be the next President . Bui he does not talk of that himself , and does not like his friends to talk of it . He knows that many things may happen before 1884.
