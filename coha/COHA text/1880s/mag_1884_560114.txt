1w discussing the relation of the State to popular education certain points are generally assumed . Though their recognition is comparatively modern , nobody who really belongs to the modern world will care to question them . Among these first principles are the following : That education is desirable for all ; that the opportunity for education should be open to the poor as well as to the rich ; that the success of free institutions depends upon an educated citizenship ; and that , therefore , the State has a right , as a matter of self-defense , to compel all candidates for citizenship to become educated . However much of the mediaeval condition of things may remain , no one now would defend the medi√¶val ideal . The time when the world was divided between a few educated clerics on the one hand , whose right it was to lead , and the great mass of uneducated people on the other hand , whose duty it was to be led , is , as most of us believe , fortunately gone by . The printing-press has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pope tells us , " A little knowledge is a dangerous thing , Drink deep , or taste not the Pierian spring . " Yet what popularly passes for the Pierian spring has , in these days , overflowed all its banks . In more or less muddy conduits its irrigating waters are carried all over the land . Cheap books , cheap magazines , cheap newspapers , doing duty as ladies , are dipping up the overflow and bringing the " knowledge ' * to the lips of all who have mastered the alphabet . Perhaps it is too early as yet to pass final judgment on the results . But it is quite certain that so far they are not what the sanguine founders of our common school system hoped they would be . Many that our schools have " educated " are found 178 // not to be practicaliy fitted for the kind of life they must lead . Many , instead of being educated into honesty , have only learned to be sharper villains . Instead of being educated into good citizenship , many of them are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worser side of public questions : they buy others ' votes and sell their own . Many of them show little knowledge of any method by which the true can be sifted from the false in dealing with the great problems of commercial , social , political , and religious duty . Few have learned how to get the best out of life for themselves , or how to put the best into life for others . And multitudes , both of boys and girls , have only been " educated " into a restless distaste for the common life that most of us must lead , instead of having learned how to make that common life the plastic material for the production of healthful , helpful , and happy results . Thousands have gained a smattering of many things , while they really know nothing thor oughly and well . Not knowing even their own ignorance , they are not ready to learn ; and they fret against circumstances , when the trouble is that they have not been trained to understand and control them . It would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common schools . They are , in the main , intelligent and faithful men and women . Out of our present system , in its present stage of development , they are doubtless getting all it is capable of producing . The only question is whether the system is the best one , and whether it ought to be any further developed along its present lines . Before we are more completely committed to it , may it not be well to examine its foundations ? It is still time to modify its methods and aims , if in any direction they be found to need it . And it will be easier to do this soon than after it has hardened into more definite form . Myself a pupil of the common school , and now having child-. ren in what are regarded as equal to the best in the world , I have naturally given the matter some thought . And not all of this thought is by any means in accord with what seems to be the popular and current opinion of the day . Certain ideas have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A few of these I propose to set up on the public debating field of the NORTH AMERICAN REvIEw . If it is worth anybody 's while , and it can be done , they will perhaps be demolished . If it should be worth anybody 's while to try to demolish them , and if the de // molition should not be complete , perhaps what remains may serve as suggestions for some needed changes and improvements . In the first place , it seems to me that we are still very much " at sea " as to what ought to be the meaning of the word , education . And if we are not agreed as to our goal , it can hardly be thought strange that we have no common conception of a method for reaching it . Most certainly education must mean something deeper and more essential than merely " knowing " things , or than having passed through a certain school curriculum . It can be nothing less than the leading out , the developing , and then the training into a fitness for coping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacities of the pupil . When this is done , through whatever process , the bQy or girl is educated . So long as this is not done , whatever may have been studied or whatever may be known , the work of education is not accomplished . It seems to be a matter of course , then , that the practical meaning of the word should be determined by the nature of the being to be educated , and by the answer to the question as to what he is being educated for . The St. Bernard dog , who should understand the art of the setter , but know nothing of the Alps or how to lead the lost traveler in a storm , would be but poorly " educated** for his life-work . Is it any better for a man to be trained into a taste and fitness for some other path than that his feet must follow ? It should be the aim of the common school , then , to fit the average boy and girl for a successful solution of the practical problems of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is either not to comprehend , or else to be false to , the very object of its existence . To see whether or how far it is attempting this , let us try to outline what is needed . The accumulated wealth of the world is so small that , were production to stop , mankind would be in a starving condition in two or three years . It is clear , then , that very few persons can continue to eat unless at the same time they work . And it is also clear that those who do eat and do not work , since they take out of the world 's stock and do not put in , are occupying the position either of paupers or thieves . Work here is used , of course , in the sense of whatever the world needs to have done and is willing to pay for . It is true also that the civilized world is already somewhat crowded ; so that new // applicants for paying position do not find it easy to get standing room . Witness the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowds ready to besiege the door of any vacant place . However much room there may always be " at the top , " only a very few can ever get there . Society is a pyramid , broadest at at the base . And so long as man lives on a material planet and in a material body the far larger part of the world 's practical work must concern itself with the production and distribntion of material things . The first thing , then , that any boy or girl needs , on coming into this world , is to be trained into an ability to earn an honest living . This is the prime condition of anything further or better . This , therefore , ought to be the first concern of any scheme for common education . And since it is determined by nature and circumstances that the great majority of men and women must do some kind of manual labor , it would seem to be self-evident that any wise scheme of common education should train the hand as well as the brain . In some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the old days of the country life of New England , for the boys and girls went to school perhaps six months of the year , and worked with their hands the other six months . But now , in the graded ten months ' schooling of our cities , even so much as that is not attained . In this country , where property is not entailed , any rich man may become poor , and any woman , however wealthy her father or husband , may , through misfortune or death , be brought face to face with the necessity for earning her bread . A part of every education , then , should be the learning how to do something by which honest standing room in the world could be earned . An added self-respect would go with such knowledge , as well as a broader human sympathy with the real life of the world . Next to this capacity for earning an honest living is the need of being trained into an ability to distinguish the true from the false in the great practical problems of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces , in society , in politics , in morals , in religion . Every man and every woman must practically take sides , and so help or hurt mankind . How many are competent to make up an intelligent opinion in any of these directions ? The most are not trained into even the rudiments of a method for collecting and weighing evidence on any important subject . // Next , and close of kin to this , should come a thorough training in the fundamental principles of right and wrong . What is right and wrong 6 ? What is right , and why it is right , and why he owes allegiance to the right , is what every person ought and can be trained to know . And in practical importance this takes precedence of nearly all those things which are usually regarded as making up the essentials of education . Beyond these things the ideally educated man is he who knows how to use the keys that can unlock for him the histories , the literatures , the sciences of the world ; and who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge in these directions can be widened . Such a one can get ont of life its best , and , at the same time , make the world richer for his having been in it . Such as these must always be few . And yet nearly all men and women , if they learn how , and care for it , can find leisure for at least something of that manly and womanly life which consists in living , over and above the occupations by which they earn the means to live . They should be taught that such a thing is possible , and have the way to it pointed out . So much can be done in the commonest education . All this , of course , is only hinting at the outlines of what ought to be included iu any approximately complete ideal of education . A man trained to solve the practical problems of life , to care for and find truth , to know the right and prefer it , to do something to make the world , as a place to live in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  such a man is educated . If he fall in these things , however much he may know , he is not educated . Because , to do these things is what a man , in this kind of a world , is for . We are now ready to raise the question as to the right and duty of the State in this matter . It has come to be a generally accepted principle , both in State Legislatures and in the National Congress , that public legislation for personal or private ends is unjust and inadmissible . This is the basis of all equitable taxation . If , for example , the General Court of Massachusetts should levy a tax on all the inhabitants of the Commonwealth , and then use the money for the exclusive benefit of Berkshire County , or of some private corporation in the City of Worcester , it would be properly regarded as practical theft . Nor would * judgments be reversed by any plea of worthiness , or even need . Highway robbery is not justified by appropriating the // proceeds to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whenever public money is expended in the construction of local works , as , for example , on the Hoosac Tunnel or in dredging a harbor the State must justify the act by demonstrating that the public is benefited to the full extent of the money so expended . This , then , is the principle-public mouey to be expended only for public ends . Let us now see how this principle applies itself to the matter of common schools . The plea is made , on the one hand , that the parents have the exciusive right to decide as to whether or not the child shall be educated at all ; and , if at all , to what extent and in what direction . But this plea is ruled out by the consideration that the child is a unit of society , and that society has an interest in both his intelligence and character . On the other hand , it is held that the State ought to furnish every child with the means of knowing whatever is to be known . This theory implies the kindergarten at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. gether with all the several grades between ; and all paid for out of the public money . To justify this enormous outlay of the public funds , one of two positions needs to be established : First , that at least the majority of the children of those who pay taxes both will and can avail themselves of this whole long course of study ; or , secondly , that the general public is sufficiently benefited by those who do to make the expenditure pay . To make this latter point clear , it must be shown that the few who go through with what is called " the higher education " could not obtain it in some way less expensive to the general public ; and also that the common education of the majority does not suffer in the interest of this higher education for the few . It is well known that only a very small percentage of the school children of the country ever go beyond , or even through , the grammar schools . I am persuaded that those who do could be both better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fc*r , when too much is attempted , nothing is thoroughly done . And I am also persuaded that the education of the majority suffers , being practically sacrificed to the " higher education " of the few . Let us see if the truth of these positions can be made out . To this end , let us first outline what the State , as such , has a right to demand in the way of education on the part of each child . In the light of this we can , perhaps , see the defects in our present system . // If any boy or girl is not so educated as to be able to earn an honest living , he or she is liable to become , directly or indirectly , a public charge . The State , then , has a manifest right in this matter . It is clearly her right and duty to see that , so far as possible , this is done . To secure this , the hand needs to be trained as well as the brain . Thus the opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of our common school system . Indeed , so long as a majority of the children must be hand-workers in some department of life , the common interest , and so the common right , calls much more loudly for this than for many things that now are liberally provided for . It needs not that all trades be taught , or attempted to be taught , to all . For , as training the brain in one departmeut of study gives aptness in all , so also is it in the training of the hand . To the end of being prepared to live an honest and independent life , it is also needful that the child be well grounded in what are known as the rudiments of a good English education . It is not needful to this , though often personally desirable , that he should know other languages than his own . A good , practical knowledge of arithmetic , and of how to read , write , and speak English , together with a knowledge of the structure of his own body and the laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . Very few among the graduates of even our high schools possess these to-day , while the smattering of a hundred things to which these are sacrificed is a very poor compensation for their lack . Enough of general knowledge to enable him to cast an intelligent vote ; this also the State , as a matter of self-defense , has a right to demand of all candidates for the rank of citizenship . In giving each child this amount of fundamental knowledge the State has opened the door for all who care to enter , and are able do so , into all the higher thought and life of the world . But , beyond these things , it is the right and duty of the State to do one thing more . So far as possible , it should educate each child into the knowledge and practice of the essential principles of morality . On this , much more than on literary , or scientific , or historical culture , does the welfare of the State depend . That next to nothing has been even attempted in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we need not go far to seek an explanation . Our training has been such that most men find it // very difficult to attain clear ideas as to the necessary relation between moral eondnct in this world , and what they regard as a religious preparation for the next . So they can not agree on any definite plan for moral education in the schools . That it is needed is plain ; for thousands of children get very little that ever passes for it anywhere else . The gordian knot of confusion on the subject can be easily cut by a statement of one simple principle . It is none of the State 's business whether or not my soul is saved in the next world ; but it is emphatically its business how I behave in this . As I do not wish my boy taught the Catholic or Buddhist faith in the school , so I have no right to insist that the child of the Catholic or Buddhist shall be taught ? he Protestant or Christian faith . But it is for the common interest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and practice of such conduct as that on which the public welfare depends . These principles have been learned as the result of human experience , just as men have found out , what is good to eat and what is not . Text books and training , then , in these directions are just as practicable as in mathematics . It is , then , the right and duty of the State to see to it that all it embryo citizens are educated , so far as is possible , into fitness for independent , honest , and intelligent citizenship . It owes it to all to make so much even compulsory on the part of each . But beyond this I am unable to see what right the State has to go . I have never been able to understand why I should tax my neighbor to teach my boy Latin , or the higher mathematics , or chemistry , any more than to help me buy him a bicycle . His owning a bicycle , and the outdoor exercise so gained , might be the means , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved might prove a great public blessing . But on that chance I should hardly have the face to make the demand . On a chance as slender , why , then , should I make the other demands , which are quite as personal in their nature * ? Whal ; is clearly for the public good , in the way of his education , I may ask public assistance to carry through . So far as his personal and private success or pleasure is concerned , I have a right to ask only " a free field and no favor . " In departing from this principle I put myself in the position of a pauper taking public charity , as really as though I took soup instead of geometry . But , asks some one , is it not the glory of our republic that the poor are to be allowed an equal chance with the rich ? // This , in view of the fact that the rich can avail themselves of private teachers . On this point two things are to be said : First , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses , pictures , horses , and all the " good things " of life ? Indeed , no State can carry out this idea completely until it learns some way by which to make all people equally handsome , equally good , and equally clever . But , secondly , an equal chance for what is it the duty of the State to provide ? If it be , so far as is possible , an equal chance for a successful , contented , useful , and happy life , it is just that which is here contended for . It is that which the public school is now not doing , but which it ought to do . What is called the " higher education " neither is nor can be pursued except by a very small minority . A few , possessing the money and the leisure , always will pursue special lines of study through mere personal love of investigation . Great good has thus come to the world . But they neither ask nor need public support . But most of those who go beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purely personal and private ends in view as another man has in learning a trade . The student of law or medicine is , first and foremost , learning a business by which he hopes to win some of the personal prizes of life . Incidentally , he may be of great service to the world . But so is the engineer on a railroad train , and the carpenter at his work-bench . Why should the one be a public beneficiary any more than the other ? If the need of either is greater , it is not generally that of the one seeking the so-called higher position . If the professions were places of danger or difficulty , so that students shunned them , and if , at the same time , the public good demanded that they be filled , then , indeed , public aid might rightly be offered , and public premiums be held out . But so long as they are regarded as personal prizes , and are eagerly sought , being ever crowded by those who can barely live in them , it seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people 's money to help on such private ends . Most of those with a natural fitness for special studies , those who have the thirst which is a prophecy of success , will always find a way . Private beneficence will , in the future as in the past , found and endow academies , colleges , and schools for professional and technical study . And they need be by no means confined to the rich . Indeed they neither have been , nor are // they now . Among the university graduates of the country there are to-day probably quite as many of the sons of the poor as of the rich . And it is doubtful whether either public or private welfare is subserved by making it too easy for either the lazy or the inefficient to go where their native taste and vigor are not able to open a way . The public schools , then , supported by the public money , . should confine themselves to giving a good , thorough , common education to that great mass of the children that , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They should be well trained in the few essentials of good citizenship , those things that will fit them to lead self-sustaining , honest , and honorable lives ; and that , for that reason , are of public concern , and for which the public has an interest in paying . To neglect or slight this for the further education of a very few , and that few in such studies as are chiefly of private concern , is a plain and manifest perversion of public funds ; as well as negligence in the performance of a public duty . I propose now to reinforce the opinions so far expressed by a few definite specifications and statistics . The defects of only present common school system may be summed up under two heads : First , it attempts to do too much , and so goes beyond its legitimate province . Secondly , while trying to do what properly lies beyond its borders , it fails to produce satisfactory fruits within its own field . Let us now see if we can find substantial reasons for these statements . First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , supported by the public money , should have for its aim the fitting the mass of the children for self-supporting and intelligent citizenship . This is the proper interest of the State , as a State ; and for these public ends only has it a right to appropriate public funds . But now it attempts much more than this . Those who claim that it may rightly do more , at least admit that it ought to attempt this . It will be shown , a little later , that , while trying to do so much , it does not even accomplish that which , in any case , should be its primary aim . Second . Instead of being now a common school , devoting the common funds to securing the largest good for the greatest number , it has developed into an institution essentially aristocratic . The best buildings , the best appliances , the best and // most liighly paid teachers are devoted to the service of the few . And the service it is rendering to this very few is in teaching them not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that so come within the limits of the public interest , but mainly such courses of instruction as fall within the limits of private culture and are pursued chiefly for personal ends . Look at a few figures . In the month of February , 1883 , there were in all the public schools of one of our cities 54,723 pupils . Only about one-half of these , or 28,360 , had gone through the primary schools and entered the grammar ; while only about two and three-fourths per cent. , or 1510 , had graduated at the grammar schools and entered the high . Of this small remnant , only 320 reached the third year ; and but 49 of these were in the fourth or advanced class . Here , then , is a " common " school system , paid for out of the common funds of the State , that devotes its best buildings , best apparatus , and best paid teachers to what is practically the private and personal training of two and three-fourths per cent . of its children . So much for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only about two and three-fourths per cent . ever enter the high schools , not more than a fraction of one per cent . ever graduate . And the Latin schools are supported for the benefit of a fraction of those who reach the high . To urge in reply that at least all have an equal opportunity is only a mockery . It is not true . Their circumstances are such that they simply can not use any such opportunity . Their life-work lies in other directions , and , in order to live at all , they must follow it . But this is not all . In trying to do too much , the system practically fails in doing what it might , and at least ought to attempt , on behalf of the great and overwhelming majority . First . It does not give them the best instruction and training for the real life which they must lead . As already shown , their success in life depends on a practical knowledge of their own bodies and on moral training , much more largely than on most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these two directions almost nothing is done . But besides this , it does not even give them a satisfactory education in what are confessed to be the simple fundamentals. // There is almost no education of the hand  --  the one instrument that most of them must use more than any other . Few are good penmen ; few can read well ; few can write a good letter , in good English , correctly spelled ; few learn the first principles of business , or are capable of keeping accounts . These things at least should be done , and done first of all . Many illustrative examples could be given , were the space at my disposal . Second . The superficial going over so much ground cheats the child into thinking he is already educated , and so really stands in the way of his learning some one thing thoroughly and well . Better good training in some one thing , with the bare information that there are a hundred other inviting fields for which there is no time . They may then be afterward tempted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea that they already know them , the curiosity that leads to investigation is dulled . Instead of cultivating a taste for the intellectual life , this sort of thing makes people talk of having " finished " their education . The man who knows his ignorance ; who learns how much there is to know ; who is taught the way to study , and where to find the materials for pursuing certain lines of investigation ,  --  he is the man who at least has the chance of becoming wise . But nibbling in all directions , and eating no one thing , spoils the appetite and ruins the digestion . Third . But , worst of all , the present system , while it fails to fit the great mass for real life , actually trains large numbers in*to a positive distaste for what must be their real life-work . Since the State can not , if it would , provide all its children with ideal careers , it should at least not unfit them for their actual ones . I could multiply instances of how this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the great cities , not willing to fill a position of honorable service in anybody 's family ; not willing even to marry an honest man and make a home for him , unless he can keep her in idleness and furnish her with servants choosing rather to jostle one another for a place behind a counter , though on starvation wages which must be eked out even at the price of womanhood and honor . Witness the crowds of young men surrendering the home that might be earned by the " labor** they think themselves educated * and in its place taking a garret , and amusements of which they had better be ignorant ; seeking for " positions " already too full ; while // most of them are not really educated into the ability to do anything in particular and do it well . Artemus Ward says , that on a certain occasion he " tried to do too much , and did it ! " This is just the weak point in our public school system . It is trying to do too much ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and well ; while the things that ought to be of chief importance are certainly not accomplished . M. J. SAVAGE .
