ALTHOUGH the words corporation and codperation do not spring from the same root , the things are closely related , for the object of corporations is in general codperation . Most of our modern enterprises would be impossible without them . The State is a body politic and corporate , the city is another , the county and the township others still . These are public corpora . tions ; the private ones are sometimes for religious rites or for charity , more commonly for profit . Every church spire is the sign of a corporate body . The chimes that ring out from the towers , the music that swells from the organ and rolls through the arches , are the voices of corporate service . The asylums that crown so many of our hills , proffering relief to the suffering , are endowed with the corporate faculty . The agencies that most affect modern society are the fruits of corporate action . The leviathans , no longer of oak , but of iron , that swim the seas , the railways that span the land , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next valley or beyond the seas , the machinery that plows and reaps the fields , and the mills that grind the harvests , are for the most part the outcome of corporate forces . As often as men need great wealth for great undertakings , they gather it together in a corporate name , and manage it with corporate faculties . The sands of Egypt have been pierced by a great canal , and the ridges of the Cordilleras are to be pierced by another , all by the agencies of corporations whose shareholders are scattered over the world . They who declaim against corporations as such know not what they do . The spirit of association is one of the principal forces of our time . Within two generations it has brought the East into closer communion with the West , introduced China and Japan within the international circle , and is now opening up the African continent , through its great central river . The " Association Internationale du Congo , " latest of international corporations , has 411 // brought the representatives of the great nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to decide the fate of half a continent . This is the national or international development of the spirit of association . In private affairs the same spirit is , if possible , still more manifest . Men are more and more united in sympathy and enterprise , and feel more and more in need of all the aids possible to united action . It is easy to see whence came the first outcry against corporations ; it came from the abuse of corporate power . It was the fear of abuse that so long limited the granting of the privilege to few persons and few occasions . There was a time when special charters only were given and they grudgingly , as much as to say , You ask for a favor , you seek advantage over your fellows , and while we yield to your importunity you must never forget how much you are beholden to our bounty . By and by the demands of business and the dread of corruption in the granting of favors led to the enactment of general statutes , under which all who choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that there are now in a State thousands upon thousands of corporations . But there is murmuring against them . Why ? Because in our thirst for the wealth that these institutions help to increase we have neglected to fence them about with all the restraints that prudence should have foreseen to be necessary . We have , in fact , created a new class of beings , incorporeal , and mortal or immortal , according to the will or caprice of their creator , as chance or reason may have it , great in riches and in power , and formidable by the number of their dependents . No wonder that individuals often find themselves powerless before these aggregations of wealth and people ; no wonder that the managers or governors of these institutions should sometimes forget their better nature in the consciousness of their power ; no wonder that confficts should arise frequently between the corporations and individuals , and sometimes between the corporations and the State . That there is danger in the situation , none can deny . The problem is , how to avoid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the abuses of corporate powers have crept into our system from careless and hap-hazard legislation . Let us for example take a look into the statute-book of New York for the past ten years ; a decade , be it remembered , when general statutes had come to be the rule and special charters the excep // tion . At the last session seventy-four statutes were passed relating to corporations , some general , some special , new laws or amendments of old ones . If this be considered the average , the number of statutes relating to corporations passed in the last ten years reaches to 740 . The cost of a session of the Legislature during these ten years , taking one year with another , has been about $450,000 , and as the number of statutes averages 550 a year , the cost of one statute , if we were to measure the benefits of a legislature by the statutes it enacts , would be a little more than $800 , and the cost of the laws relating to corporations passed last year would be about $60,000 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $600,000 . For so great an outlay there should be something great in return . But what have we ? Contradiction , confusion , uncertainty . The principal corporations formed for profit are banks , insurance companies , trust companies , railway , telegraph , and manufacturing companies . There is not the slightest reason why all these corporations should not hereafter be formed by the like number of persons and under one general law . As it is , they are formed under different laws , diverse in principle and diverse in details . A bank may be formed by one person or by many ; an ordinary insurance company , be it marine , life , or lire , by any number not less than thirteen ; but a town insurance company must have at least twenty-five ; a railway corporation , for a railway in this State , must have not less than twenty-five to bring it into being , while one formed here for another country need have but ten . A telegraph company may be established by any number of persons ; a manufacturing company must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monopolies . So far as the franchise of being a corporation is a privilege , it may be a monopoly or not , according as the privilege is exclusive or open to all . In New York it is open to ali , for certain kinds of business , though burdened in particular cases with unwise technicalities and unnecessary risks . In respect of other privileges , the possessor may or may not have a monopoly , according to their nature and extent . A railway company has a monopoly if it has an exclusive right to run between definite places , otherwise it has not a monopoly . The real cause of complaint is that the enormous aggregations of capital invested in corporations fall into few hands , // and , without adequate restraint , control great interests and great numbers of persons . We forget , however , that the same amount of capital in a single hand might be used more effectively and more oppressively than in the hands of several managers of a corporation . For this reason the restraint of corporate capital is easier than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporate action is really one of the easiest of the functions of modern government . The great guilds of former ages were more powerful and unmanageable than any corporations we are concerned with . For our times and our wants wise and comprehensive legislation is needed . What it should be , this is not the place to discuss . The subject is too large for a single paper . But one thing is certain : the State should keep and exercise control over every corporate franchise . A franchise is a privilege that the possessor enjoys beyond the rest of the citizens . For that reason it should never be irrevocable . Equality of rights is the foundation of republican government , and whenever , for any reason , some out of the body of citizens are invested with peculiar privileges , these should be revocable at all times , saving such guaranties as the inviolability of property requires . In other words , it should be a cardinal maxim that there can be no private property in privilege . It is enough here to say that I think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time the rights of the citizen who has received the grant of a franchise and under it has invested his property . There must be some feasible plan of reconciling the rights of the state with the rights of corporate proprietors , which , while it guarantees the former , will protect the latter as well . Meanwhile let us turn to another view of the corporate function . May we not prudently and wisely carry the principle of association a little further , and make it help bridge over the chasm , yawning wider and wider every day , between capital and labor ? The hostility to corporations has grown , as already mentioned , out of hostility to associated capital . Why not , then , enlarge these agencies so as to make them associations , not of capital only , nor of labor only , but of capital and labor united ? Can this be done ? If we are not able to solve the problem altogether , we may perhaps help solve it in part ; at least let us try . We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the different members of the social body . We are wont to boast , and the boast is // for the most part a just one , that in our country every man 's career is open before him , so that he is free to choose whichsoever he will . But while this is true , it is also true that the means of pursuing a particular career are not given to all alike . To bring these means within reach , so far as possible , is a problem that it would be well for us all to study . Though it be true that most of our successful men , the great preachers , lawyers , physicians , the principal manufacturers and merchants , the navigators of the lakes and rivers , the cultivators of the soil , began with nothing and worked their way up by sober and laborious thrift ; and that what these men have done , others in like circumstances may do ; yet not all are endowed with the same vigor of body or mind , the same power of endurance , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; health may fail ; an agent or a partner may prove faithless ; and so it may happen , as it does often happen without one 's own fault , that his foot slips , and he stumbles to the ground . A financial crisis may throw workmen out of employment . Of all the mishaps in the world , no inconsiderable number are due to accident or misfortune , or the evil contrivances of others . So it comes to pass that men willing to labor get nothing to do , and want comes to their homes . One of the saddest sights in the world is a strong and sober man , anxious for work , yet finding none . He goes out in the morning to earn what he can , he finds nothing , and returns to his wife and children by a cold hearth and an empty table . This man may not be in the least to blame . He may be industrious and careful . When business is prosperous he has enough to do , and he provides for the needs of himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as it sometimes will in any condition of an industrious community , and most of all where laws of the land are pitted against the laws of nature , then he suffers . The ideal commonwealth is that in which there is not only no inequality of rights , in which not only are all protected in life , liberty , and property , but in which all have food , raiment , and shelter , and equal opportunities of pursuing their own welfare Our aim , the aim of American republicanism , is this ideaL Hence arises one of the chief problems for the patriotic and the benevolent to study : what can be done to lessen the evil of poor wages , or no wages , and starving families I ' The problem assumes that the persons we are thinking of are deserving . The incurably vicious are of another class , and to be dealt with in a // different manner . What we are hoping for - dreaming of , possibly - is that all they who are able and willing to work may find work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The criminal should have another treatment , the tramp another , and the drunkard yet another . These all in their turn . For the present we are concerned only with those who are willing and ready to contribute their own labor to their own support and welfare . May it not be true that one means of affording them the opportunity of helping themselves is cooperation , and that cooperation is best obtained by private corporations * A division of property among all the people is the dream of madmen . To take from one against his will that which he owns and give it to another , would be a violation of that instinct of justice which God has implanted in the heart of every human being ; a violation , in short , of the supreme law of the Most High . But to persuade one who has much to cooperate with one who has little , for the ultimate benefit of both , is a different matter . In other words , to induce the capitalist to take the laborer into that kind of partnership to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support and enrichment of both , and to the solution of that problem which now , more perhaps than any other , confronts the world . What is cooperation * Acting together for a common end . Several families unite for the purchase of their supplies by a common agent at wholesale prices , and thus save a part at least of the profit of retail trade . This is the most common kind of cooperation . Codperative shops are in the same category . There is likewise a codperation to some extent of labor in the custom prevailing in some districts , of farmers assisting each other at harvests by uniting their hands and teams . There is no reason why two or more of them should not agree to work their farms together at certain seasons , and thus secure a concentration of labor and the use of more and better machinery than their separate means would warrant . This is , indeed , the only way in which they can compete with great estates , supplied with the best machinery and abundance of hands . See what ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us , they contrive by a union of forces to lessen their labors to such a degree that the women have finished their daily household tasks by ten o'clock in the morning . The men work more hours , but they are not overworked . They have shelter , // and enough to eat , drink , and wear , for moderate and combined labor . Whaling voyages from time immemorial have been fitted out and prosecuted upon the coiiperative theory , but without the aid of incorporation , as the persons employed are few and are cut off from the rest of the world during their voyages . There are establishments in France on a coöperative basis . C&amp;iperative shops are frequent in London for different branches of the public service , the diplomatic , colonial , army and navy , and the church . There are , however , two difficulties in the way of all cooperative schemes that are not endowed with the corporate faculty - the uncertainty of duration , and the personal liability of members . When half a dozen persons unite in a business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the death of one may impede if it does not put a stop to the enterprise . Few persons are willing to place their interests without reserve in the hands of others , or make themselves liable for their engagements . A corporation offers the means of obviating these difficulties . What is a corporation ? An artificial being ; a creature of the law , endowed with certain functions of a natural person , and such a term of life as the law in particular cases may prescribe . The corporate property alone , unless otherwise specially provided , is held for its debts , and it lives out its appointed time though its members one after another pass away . Stability , simplicity , and the exemption of the members from personal risks are its attributes . Is not this then the best machinery for the working of a c&amp;iperative scheme How can capital and labor be enlisted ? Is there any reason why corporations created for profit that heretofore have been aggregations of capital only should not be made also aggregations of capital and labor , or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Let us suppose a manufacturing corporation to be formed with the view of giving to all the persons employed an interest in the profits of the establishment . Divide the nominal capital into shares of small amount , some of them payable in labor to be contributed ; give to the workman credit for a part of his wages , and pay him the rest for his daily living . Is this a wild scheme ? Let us see . The plan supposes a cash capital sufficient to plant and stock the establishment , and a credit capital , payable in labor , sufficient to work it . The difference between such a plan and the // present is , that the latter requires a capital payable in cash or its equivalent in other property , whereas the plan suggested requires also a credit capital payable in labor . As the business goes on now , the laborer has no interest in the capital ; he works for wages fixed between him and his employer , upon a bargain in which there is no equality between the parties , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power of the other , or at least stands in such a relation of dependence as is incompatible with that sense of self-respect , that pride of manhood , which should be the patrimony of every American citizen . Why may not the two be made to stand in the relation of equal dependence and mutual respect ? Would not both be better off for the new relation ? The capitalist shareholder would know that every blow of the workman was given in the interest of both , and the workman would know that every good bargain of the capitalist tended to the increase of his daily bread and the advancement of his family . Let us picture in imagination such an establishment . Let us make a sketch that , if it amounts to nothing in itself , may at least suggest something better . Suppose a manufacturing corporation to be formed with a capital of half a million dollars , divided into shares of five dollars each , threefifths of them payable in cash and the other two-fifths in prospective labor ; the former to be invested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and supplies for the consumption of the working shareholders ; one hundred workmen to be received as members of the corporation , the skilled workmen to be allowed wages , say ( as often now ) three dollars a day , the others a dollar and a half , and each one to be inscribed in the books for four hundred shares . If the earnings were six per cent . on the capital , each skilled workman would be credited in twelve months with about $900 for wages and $120 for profit . Deducting $500 for his supplies ,  --  that is to say , food , clothing , and lodging ,  --  there would be left a net balance to his credit at the end of the year of $520 , which would pay for 104 shares of the stock . He would then have had his living and have become in the year the owner of 104 shares of marketable stock . Next year he would acquire 104 more shares , and in less than four years he would have paid for all the 400 . The fixing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the admission or dismissal of working members , and the discipline of the establishment should be vested // in the hands of all the members , whether actual or expectant shareholders ; but the financial department , the purchases and sales , should be in the hands of the actual shareholders . The great object is to bring capital and labor into closer communion , to make them lean on each other , strengthening the capitalist , and enabling the workman who has no capital to acquire an interest in an industrial establishment by becoming a co-worker and participant upon the pledge of his labor . To this end , the requirement of a cash or property capital must be in part dispensed with , and instead of it an engagement to labor accepted . The workman must have the means of living while he is earning the price of his shares . He must thus be enabled to live as cheaply as possible , by having all his supplies furnished at the lowest price . He must have fair wages , cheap living , the prospect of bettering his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and labor combined . But all concerned should have the power of superintending the conduct of the workmen , dismissing the idle or incompetent , and choosing between different applicants . An account would be kept with every member , charging him with his supplies and crediting him with his wages and proportion of profits . Among the provisions for the workmen a reading-room and library might well be included . How many persons would such a scheme benefit ? According to the census of 1880 the population of the United States was then a little over fifty millions , being about twenty-five and a half million males and twenty-four and a half million females . Of the males nearly ten millions were under fifteen years of age , leaving ftfteen and a half millions above it . Subtracting from these the criminals in confinement , the hopelessly infirm , and the paupers supported at public expense , there remain a little more than fifteen millions . Of these over seven millions are put down as occupied in agriculture , and over three millions in manufactures . A host , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and factories of the country , would thus be specially benefited by the scheme proposed . If we were asked what inducements capitalists would have to enter into such arrangements , we should answer that , apart from the fraternal motives that are supposed to influence all the members of the human family , there are such economic reasons as these , that the scheme , if successful , would bind employer and // employed closer together , lead the latter to strive more and more for the increase of the common product , advance his self-respect , do away with strikes , give security to capital , and heal the breach between capital and labor . These ends are surely worth striving for , and the suggestions here made , though there may be little new in them , and they may appear visionary to many persons , may lead others to study more closely the great social problem of our time .
