txt The rapid development and collapse of Democratic Presidential booms is somewhat baffling to the mind of the ordinary reader , and he who thinks that the mention " of temporarily prominent names is suggested by ordinary circumstances may well be puzzled . In a few brief weeks : MCDONALD , HOLMAN , FLOWER , CLEVELAND , and the Old Ticket have successively come and gone . Of these , possibly , the Flower boom yet retains the greatest vitality , while the Old Ticket has been most frequently on the lips of observers and managers . Indeed , it may be said that the renomination of TILDEN and HENDRICKS is an unfailing device when a boom for somebody else threatens to become unmanageable . The rank and file of the Democratic ParLy may have their vagrant and erratic preferences . The Old Ticket is at once their orthodoxy and their terror . They know that it is ugly , but they feel that it is great . Mr. TILDEN may be a physical wreck , and Mr. HENDRICKS is undoubtedly out of the question . But when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dangerous point the Old Ticket is brought forward , and the presumptuous boom shrivels like a tender plant before the parching breath of the sirocco . The mysterious , vague , and undefined candidacy of Mr. TILDEN has this extent , no more . The New-York Democratic politicians , aided by our esteemed contemporary , the Sun , have succeeding in maintaining a solid square , against which the undisciplined free lances of the remainder of the Republic have been fruitlessly dashed . But fine strategy , as well as mere brute force , has been needed to keep off the enemy and preserve the integrity of the New-York phalanx . When MCDONALD began to tower in the West HOLMAN was persistently boomed in the East . His picture , his biography , his sayings and doings , and his famous speech of " I object " were all paraded , until a wondering people began - to ask why this great statesman had been hidden so long in obscurity . In the course of time MCDoNALD 's star waned and ? his name was seldom mentioned . Then HOLMAN , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Indiana , also disappeared from the political sky , and his portrait , boom , and fictitious reputation were con- ' signed to the limbo of forgotten things . The Flower boom is now at its height , and what will be used to destroy it has not yet been made manifest . But every shrewd observer knows that the Flower movement will perish before its petals can be fully unfolded to the sun of prosperity . Mr. FLOWER has a barrel of money , the generous sum of $250,000 being the least , and $400,000 the most , which the political gossips- place to the credit of his contingent fund . This is an incentive to the industry of the Democratic campfollowers ; and they are cheering lustily for ROSWELL P. FLOWER . As yet , the stir in the direction of Senator-elect PAYNE , of Ohio , is too disorderly to attract attention . But Mr. PAYNE , as a representative of the Standard Oil Company , is presumed to have a barrel as big as FLOWER 'S , and his possibilities are great . It is tolerably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and again , to head off any movement in favor of any candidate other than that in favor with the Sage of Gramercy Park . The recent prominence given by Mr. TILDEN 'S newspaper organs to his possible candidacy simply means that the Flower boom has gone far enough . Who is behind this occasional and sporadic revival of TILDEN ? It is shrewdly suspected that CLEVELAND is the man . CLEVELAND is said to have a record as a political reformer , although that useful article of furniture has not yet been produced . If EDMUNDS is nominated by the Republicans , as it is feared that he may be . CLEVELAND , the ex-Mayor of Buffalo . is to be brought out against him . For CLEVELAND , then , the strength of the New-York Democracy is being carefully husbanded , each and every other candidate being killed off lay artful tactics as soon as his boom is fully ripe . If it is true , as reported , that the NewYork Democrats would sooner have the Mayoralty of this city under the Roosevelt bill than the Presidency of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is matured , will collapse like its predecessors .
