BY the famous bull of the infamous Pope Alexander VI . the whole of North America was given for evermore to Spain . But our forefathers in England in the days of Queen Elizabeth had little respect for popes , and still less respect for their bulls . England , though not esteemed in those days the equal in military strength of France or Spain , nevertheless occupied an impregnable position ; and when such a monarch as Philip II. , with the papal blessing on his enterprise , sent an Invincible Armada to her shores , with declared intent to enrich her polity with an Inquisition , and to enliven the monotony of her social life with periodical autos-da-fe , she possessed ample means of proving practically that the invincibleness of the royal armada was as much a matter of doubt as the infallibleness of the papal decree . Our doughty ancestors had a theory of their own about these things , and one of the ways in which they sought to carry their theory into practice was by hampering and forestalling the Pope and his lieutenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World . Of course they had no idea of the immensity of the victory their proceedings were destined one day to achieve . But they were guided by a very sound instinct , and they builded better than they knew . After the exploring voyages of the Cabots-which were not diligently followed up  --  the earliest expeditions of English mariners to the American coasts were undertaken in great part as measures of hostility to Spain . Here was an excellent poaching ground for them . Elizabeth 's valiant sea-kings , with swift and sudden attack invading the harbors of the West Indies and the Spanish Main , carried off many a richly laden galleon . Sometimes they were even bolder than this . In 1587 , Sir Francis Drake sailed with flying colors into the port of Cadiz itself , and burned , sank , or captured more than a hundred vessels designed for the service of the Invincible Armada of the following year . Such dangerous exploits used to be quaintly called " singeing the King of Spain 's beard . " But these great menthe fathers of the English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere privateers . A spirit of scientific curiosity and enthusiastic dreams of commercial empire were joined with their adventurous courage . In 1576 , Sir Martin Frobisher set sail for the Arctic Ocean in search of a northwestern passage to India . In a vessel of twenty-five tons burdennot much larger than the barge of a modern man-of-war-he penetrated as far as the entrance to Hudson Bay . In 1579 , Sii* Francis Drake , having singed the Most Catholic beard all along the coasts of Chili and Peru , struck across the equator , and sailed as far as the coast of Oregon , in the hope of finding a passage northeasterly into the Atlantic . Failing in this , he crossed the Pacific , after having named our western coast New Albion , and returned home in 1580 by way of the Cape of Good Hope . This was the second circumnavigation of the earth , sixty years after Magellan . In 1583 , Sir Humphrey Gilbert conducted a small company to Newfoundland , and took possession of the country in the name of Queen Elizabeth . As they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a favorable place for a settlement , their principal vessel crushed its bows against a sunken rock , and nearly all hands were lost . The other two vessels , which in size were hardly superior to modern pleasureyachts , set out to return to England ; but on the way they were overtaken by a terrible storm , and Gilbert 's tiny craft was swallowed up in the waves . The enterprise in which Gilbert thus unfortunately perished was prosecuted on a much wider scale by his half-brother the still more famous and still more unfortunate Sir Walter Raleigh . Gilbert 's colony was designed for little more than a station from which to worry the Spaniards . Raleigh 's plan included the founding of a state , the development of agriculture , and the acquisition of immense revenues . He obtained from Elizabeth a grant of a vast territory , to be called Virginia , extending vaguely from the Hudson River to the confines of what is now Georgia . Though he did not visit his new domains in person , his vessels explored the coast below Chesapeake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settlement in America . Raleigh had learned the art of war in France under Coligny , and it was the terrible story of Ribaut and Menendez and Dominique de Gourgues that first turned his attention to this part of // the world . He thought that he might succeed where Ribaut had failed ; and indeed he aroused such interest in England through his explorations and the descriptions of them by Hariot and Hakluyt , that it is hardly improper to regard him as the first founder of the colony of Virginia . Nevertheless , his immediate attempts at making a self-supporting settlement were so disastrous that , after five years of incessant labor , and having lost ? 40,000 in the enterprise , he made up his mind that such an undertaking was too great for the resources of a single individual , and in 1589 he assigned his rights and privileges to a joint-stock company of merchants and adventurers . Raleigh 's subsequent career shows of how little avail are the brightest talents and most faithful services to insure their possessor against ruin if he happen to have incurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1595 Raleigh conducted a voyage of exploration to the Orinoco . In 1596 he was rear-admiral in the fleet which captured Cadiz , and it was chiefly to his sagacity and bravery that the victory-such a humiliating blow to Philip 11. - was due . In 1597 lie commanded the fleet which captured Fayal . Yet , in spite of all this , one of the first things James I. did on succeeding to the English crown was to arrest Raleigh for high treason , on the charge that he ( of all men ! ) had been plotting with Spain . One of his friends , Lord Cobham , had , in fact , engaged in a conspiracy to dethrone James in favor of his cousin Arabella Stuart , and he had endeavored to obtain money from the Spanish king in aid of his undertaking . On the discovery of the plot , Raleigh was at once suspected , partly because of his acquaintance with Cobham , partly because his old rival the Earl of Essex had years before so poisoned James 's mind against him that the king now gladly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In seeking to clear himself , Raleigh made some statements which reflected upon Cobham ; and when Cobham , who was a selfish and cowardly creature , heard the report of what Raleigh had said , he flew into a rage , and accused Raleigh of having been the prime instigator of the plot . This accusation Cobham soon afterward retracted , and , besides this , the utmost diligence of the crown lawyers could discover no evidence whatever . against the great admiral . But in reading the state trials of the Stuart period , one often has occasion to feel that the common-law maxim , that a man must be presumed innocent until he is proved to be guilty , was read backward , as witches read the Lord 's Prayer when they wished to summon the devil . Too often the maxim practically in vogue was that the prisoner must be presumed to be guilty until proved to be innocent ; with the further proviso that no amount of evidence could possibly be held to establish his innocence . The bench in England was then as corrupt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tweed Rincr " Judges , and jurymen too , were quick to detect the bent of the royal mind and act in accordance therewith . The scenes at Raleigh 's trial were such as to disgrace the memory of the famous Attorney-General Coke , as well as of the time-serving judges who refused to confront Cobham with the prisoner , and without any further evidence , and in spite of the absurdity of the whole charge , condemned him to die the death of a traitor . But the wrath of the people was such that James did not venture to carry out the sentence . The grand old knight was kept shut up in the Tower for more than twelve years , and solaced himself by writing that delie , htful History of the World which has given him a foremost place among the worthies of English prose literature . In 1616 , on the intercession of Buckingham , he was at length set free , and placed in command of an expedition to Guiana for the purpose of opening a gold mine . Raleigh had some misgivings about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in set form . But Lord Bacon is said to have assured him that the king , having under his broad seal made him admiral of a fleet , with power of martial law over sailors and officers , had substantially condoned all offenses , real or alleged . But in this case I doubt if the worldly - wise and selfish Bacon came much nearer than the sincere and generous Raleigh toward sounding the unfathomable perfidy of the Stuart character . James always cherished a perverse fondness for Spain , and now in particular he had taken it into his head that his son Charles ought to marry the daughter of Philip III . So the Spanish ambassador , Gondomar , wormed out of him all the minutest details of the Guiana expedition , and sent the intelligence without delay to // Madrid . So when the English fleet reached the Orinoco , their exploring party was attacked by the Spaniards , and in the fight which ensued Raleigh 's son Walter was slain . Though the English were victorious , the approaches to the mines were too strongly guarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and in such wise was this expedition defeated through the treachery of its own sovereign . Nothing was left for the baffled and brokenhearted admiral but to make his way back to England . His friends the earls of Pembroke and Arundel had guaranteed his return in any event ; and he could not run the risk of getting them into trouble . After reaching England , his wife , keenly alive to the danger he was incurring , prevailed upon him to escape to France ; but just as the escape was successfullyachieved , his chivalrous scruples overcame him , and he returnJl with sweet serenity to meet the fate which was but too surely threatened . The Spanish court now clamored for Raleigh 's death , on the ground that he had undertaken a piratical excursion against a Spanish colony ; and now it is worth our while to observe the desperately complicated villainy of the king . It would never do for James to admit this claim of the Spaniards , because he regarded the country about the Orinoco as his own , on the strength of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's influence was now supreme , and Spain must be propitiated at whatever cost . So , in utter defiance of common decency , Sir Walter Raleigh was seized and beheaded on the old charge of complicity in the Cobham conspiracy - a charge of which he had already been virtually condoned , and of which , doubtless , neither the king nor any other man in England had ever really believed him to be guilty . Thus , at the hands of the treacherous and cowardly son of Elizabeth 's archenemy and rival , perished the last and greatest of the sea-kings who had made her reign illustrious  --  the statesman whose far-seeing genius first directed the efforts of England toward the colonization of the Western world . The enterprise which had proved too arduous for Raleigh 's unaided powers was nevertheless carried out during Raleigh 's lifetime nuder the leadership of a man who has immortalized the homeliest of names , not only by solid work which no one can fail to rate highly , but also by romantic adventures of the most astonishing sort , for which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life of Captain John Smith reads like a chapter from Gil Bias or The Cloister and the Hearth . If half of what he says is true , we may fairly call him the American Roland or Cid , albeit many critics , more shrewd than genial , have felt more like characterizing him as an American Munchausen . Perhaps it is well that it should be so . Perhaps it is well that , even in American history , which for the most part began under the blazing midday sun of historical testimony , there should be left at least one little trace of the twilight of heroic legend . At all events , the historic basis of Smith 's career is such that he can never in the remotest future run any serious risk of getting identified with Odysseus , or Indra , or Jack the Giant - Killer ; and his historical importance is great enough to justify us in recalling for a moment some of the scenes . of his autobiography . Born of a good family in Lincolnshire , he ran away from his studies at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three years in the Netherlands against the Spaniards . Returning to his native place , tired of the society of his fellow-creatures , he made himself a tent of boughs by a brook in the woods some distance from any town , and lived there awhile as an anchorite , not meditating on his sins , however , but on the political affairs of Europe and on the art of war . As the result of these meditations , he made up his mind to go and fight the Turks . In passing through France he was robbed of all he had about him , but his life wa saved by a peasant who found him lying , half starved and half frozen , in the forest . He made his way to Marseilles , and embarked with a company of pilgrims for the Levant ; but a violent storm arose , which they attributed to their having a heretic on board , and so , like Jonah , the young adventurer was thrown into the sea . He swam ashore , however , and made his way to the Austrian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turks were besieging .. Here lie invented a sort of fire-work , calle4 the " fiery dragon , " which so annoyed the barbarians that they withdrew . In single combat , for the amusement of the ladies , says the narrative , he slew and beheaded three Turkish champions , one after the other ; but in a bloody battle which ensued he was taken prisoner , carried to // Adrianople , and sold as a slave in the market-place , and finally carried off to the Crimea . Here he was dressed in the skin of a wild beast , had an iron collar fastened about his neck , and was cuffed and kicked about like a dog ; but one day he rose in rebellion , broke his master 's skull with a threshing-stick , dressed up in his clothes , mounted his horse , and fled through the Russian wilderness to Poland , whence he made his adventurous way , with various disguises , through Germany , France , and Spain , to Morocco , where he was at last picked up by an English manof-war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spanish galleons , made his way back to England just in time to start in the first squadron sent out in 1606 by the London Company for the colonization of Virginia . Through the incompetency of the first two governors , Wingfield and Ratcliffe , the management of the enterprise fell naturally into Smith 's hands , and it was only through his sagacity and energy that the colony was prevented from perishing within the first three years through privation and mutiny . In the course of an exploring journey up the Chickahominy , which it was thought might be a strait leading into the Pacific Ocean , an incident occurred which throws some light on our adventurer 's character for truthfulness . It is clear that he was captured by the Indians , and was set at liberty or escaped . But he has left two accounts of the affair , one published in the following year , 1C08 , the other published in 1624 . These two accounts are inconsistent with each other in many details , but in particular the first one makes no mention of any danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Qn the contrary , the Indians are described as having been extremely kind and courteous toward their prisoner . In 1613 , Pocahontas was married to an Englishman , and three years afterward she accompanied her husband to England , and at once became the principal object of interest to the fashionable world by reason of the absurd misconception which saw in her an Indian princess , daughter of the " mighty emperor " Powhatan . After a year of fashionable excitement she died ; and it is to be observed that in all the frequent contemporary allusions which refer to Pocahontas , down to the time of her death , , there is not a word which relates to her heroic rescue of the English explorer . But in Smith 's second account of his adventures in Virginia , published in 1624 , seven years after the death of the Indian girl , the full story of the rescue is to be found . The natural inference from all this is hardly favorable to the author 's credit as a historian . The story in itself , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in accordance with Indian usage , so much so that the romance with which it has always been invested is the outcome of a misconception no less complete than that which led the fair dames of London to make obeisance to the dusky squaw as to a princess of imperial lineage . Where a prisoner was about to be put to death , not fiom any feeling of personal hatred or revenge , or from considerations of savage policy , but merely from the spirit of wanton cruelty in which the Indians ' tiger-like nature delighted , it was no very uncommon thing for some one of the tawny gang , moved by pity or admiration , or some unaccountable freak , to interpose in behalf of the victim . Many a poor wretch , already tied to the fatal tree , while the firebrands were heating for his torment , has been rescued from the jaws of death , and adopted either as husband or as brother by some laughing young squaw , or as a son by some bereaved old wrinkled warrior . In such cases the new-coiner was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribe , and opportunities for escape were usually not difficult to find . Smith left the Jamestown settlement in 1608 , ascended Chesapeake Bay , and explored the Potomac , Patapsco , and the Susquehanna , travelling some two thousand miles in an open boat with half a dozen companions ; and , first of Englishmen , meeting in friendly parley the invincible Mohawks , whose fleet of bark canoes encountered him upon the Chesapeake . In the following year he was badly wounded by an accidental explosion of gunpowder , and obliged to return to England for surgical treatment . The colony which he left at Jamestown , numbering some five hundred souls , relapsed into anarchy after his departure . Famine and desertion thinned their ranks until scarcely a hundred were left . The fate which had overtaken Raleigh 's colony of Roanoke seemed to be awaiting them , and in their despair they were even about to abandon the country , when , in June , 1610 , Lord Delaware arrived with re-enforcements . In the // following year Sir Thomas Dale brought over more men and supplies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ band , and systematic cultivation of the soil was begun in earnest . It was not long before negro slaves were introduced . The land was laid qut in large plantations , and the tobacco crop became a prolific source of wealth . Emigrants began to come over at the rate of more than a thousand a year ; and so strong had the colony grown by 1622 that a terrible massacre , directed by the successor of Powhatan , in which nearly four hundred persons lost their lives , produced but a slight and temporary effect . By this time the prosperity of the colony had begun to excite the jealousy of the king . With his perverse friendship for Spain , James was not inclined to look favorably upon the attempts of his subjects to colonize America , but one consideration had prevailed upon him to allow such attempts to proceed . It was generally understood that colonies founded in America were to be under the direct control of the king , and that Parliament had no authority to meddle with their affairs ; and from this the king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time the crown might gain assistance from its loyal colo* nies in carrying on its perennial struggle with the representatives of the people at home . Accordingly James had consented to the formation of the Virginia Company with ample powers ; but by 1623 he had come to regard these powers as too extensive to be intrusted to any private company , and so he ordered the directors to give up their charter . On their refusal the king brought suit against the company on a writ of quo warranto , and at the same time illegally seized upon their papers , so that they might have no means of defending themselves . Commissioners were sent to Virginia to collect evidence against the good management of the company . No such evidence was procured . But in those evil days of Stuart tyranny one of the worst features was the subserviency of the courts , whereby the king could generally obtain almost any decision upon which he had set his heart . So the company was dissolved ; and henceforth the affairs of the colony were administered by a governor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in England . The governor and the members of both councils were all appointed by the king , and in the absence of a charter the colonists had no security whatever against arbitrary government . This suppression of the Virginia Company was the first high-handed act of tyranny perpetrated by the English crown in relation to American affairs ; but events turned in such a way that it probably favored , instead of checking , the independent spirit of the colony . For the next sixty years the Stuart kings had so much to occupy their attention at home , and found it such hard work to keep on the throne , that the Virginians were left pretty much to themselves , and probably enjoyed a greater share of liberty than they would have done under the continual supervision of a private company interested in making money out of the colony . Indeed , in 1639 they expressed themselves as unwilling to have the company revived . Unlike the settlers of New England , the Virginians were in the main loyal in their feelings toward the Stuart kings . But after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be governed by a Parliamentary commission . In fact , they cared very little by whom they were technically governed , so long as they were allowed practically to govern themselves . The internal political constitution of Virginia at that time was in some respects the most liberal the world had yet seen . As Mr. Bancroft observes , " Virginia was the first state in the world , composed of separate boroughs , diffused over an extensive surface , where representation was organized on the principle of universal suffrage . ' * The colony taxed itself , and enjoyed practical freedom of trade ; and under such conditions it flourished so that by the end of the seventeenth century it had become a really powerful state , as colonial states were then reckoned , with a white population of nearly 60,000 , and perhaps 2000 negroes . During the first half of the eighteenth century , however , the growth of the colony became still more conspicuous . At the time of the Seven Years ' War the population exceeded 400,000 souls , of whom more than half were negroes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost entirely English , and such it seems to have remained . A few Huguenots came over from France toward the close of the sev // enteenth century , and these were followed , within a few years , by a considerable number of Scotch Presbyterians froni the north of Ireland , who made for the frontier , and began to settle upon the eastern slope of the mountains . Some Germans , too , came in from Pennsylvania . But all these foreign elements taken together can hardly have amounted to two per cent . of the white population , and in no way produced any appreciable effect upon the character of the colony , which was thoroughly English in blood , as well as in manners and laws . The first colonists , who came over with Smith , were for the most part idle adventurers , like the Spaniards who in the preceding century had flocked to the standards of Cortez and Pizarro , drawn thither mainly by the belief that America was a sort of fairy-land , where great riches could be obtained without labor . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundations of the greatness of Virginia . As soon as it had become apparent that solid wealth was to be obtained from large plantations of tobacco , a very different class of people began to come in . The great planters of Virginia were for the most part men of high social positionyounger sons of noble and powerful families , such as England from that day to this has been continually sending forth to play a prominent part in all the outlying regions of the world . The smaller planters were mostly recruited from the ranks of that self-reliant , indomitable yeomanry which for so many ages was the pride and strength of the mother country . Many of these settlers were Puritans ; but after the overthrow of Charles I. the royalist party sent out an increasing number of emigrants , until the Cavaliers acquired the ascendency in the colony . In 1651 , the Governor , Sir William Berkeley , even suggested that Charles II . himself should seek a refuge among his loyal Virginians . The tendency toward an aristocratic type of society , thus already faintly manifested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic conditions under which the colony was established . Not only was the labor of Virginia purely agricultural , but the only agriculture worth speaking of was the raising of tobacco . In this pursuit the entire energies of the colony were absorbed to an extraordinary degree ; and from this fact have flowed many of the peculiarities by which Virginian society has always been characterized . The cultivation of tobacco on a great scale required immense plantations and an abundance of cheap labor ; and as among the white immigrants cheap labor was not forth - coming in sufficient quantity , recourse was at once had to the slave-trade . The first negro slaves were brought into the colony in 1619 . For some time their numbers increased but slowly , but toward the end of the seventeenth century the increase became very rapid , until in the middle of the eighteenth , as already observed , they had come to outnumber the white population . At this time the rapidity of the increase bad begun to awaken serious alarm , and it was felt that something must be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Revolutionary war projects of negro emancipation were freely discussed in Virginia ; but nothing came of the discussion , and after the abolition of the foreign slave-trade in 1808 had increased the demand for Virginia - bred slaves in the States further south , the very idea of emancipation faded out of memory . It is generally admitted that the treatment of the slaves by their masters was mild and humane . The cultivation of tobacco in Virginia did not work such a terrible drain on human life as the cultivation of sugar in the West Indies , or the raising of cotton in the Gulf States after the invention of the gin . It was more profitable to take care of the slave than to work him to death . At the same time the negro was not regarded as having any rights which the white man was bound to respect : he was regarded simply as a beast of burden . Slaves were not allowed to leave their plantations except with passports duly signed by the master . Absconding slaves were formally outlawed , and a price was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sheriff , they were to suffer death or nameless mutilation at his good pleasure . There was no penalty attached to the murder of a slave by his master , but if he were killed by any one else , the master could recover his value , just as in case of damage done to a dog or a horse . Viewed in connection with the generally mild treatment of slaves by their masters , the ferocious character of these legislative enactments bears witness to the alarm with which the rapid increase of the colored population was regarded . Until the end of the seventeenth century , // as already observed , there were but few negroes in Virginia , and cheap labor was obtained from other sottrces . Convicted criminals were sent over in great numbers from the mother conntry , as in later times they were sent to Botany Bay , until the system was made the subject of serious complaint on the part of the colony . On their arrival they were indented as servants for a term of years . Kidnapping was also at this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and girls , usually of the lowest class of society , were seized by press-gangs on the streets of London and Bristol and other English ports , hurried on board ship , and carried over to Virginia to work on the plantations or as house servants . These poor wretches were not , in deed , sold into slavery , but they passed into a state of servitude which might easily be prolonged almost indefinitely by avaricious or cruel masters . The p*riod of their indenture was short-usually not more than four years ; but the ordinary penalty for serious offenses , such as were very likely to be committed , was a lengthening of the time during which they were to serve . Among such offenses the most serious were insubordination or attempts to escape , while of a more venial character were thievery , or unchaste conduct , or attempts to make money on their own account . Their lives were in theory protected by law , but where an indented servant came to his death from prolonged illusage , or from excessive punishment , or even from sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the master . The lash was inflicted upon the indented servant with scarcely less compunction than upon the purchased slave ; and in general the condition of the former seems to have been nearly as miserable as that of the latter , save that the servitude of the negro was perpetual , while that of the white man was liable to come to an end . For him Pandora 's box had not quite spilled out the last of its contents . In the majoAty of cases , however , it may be questioned whether the release of the indented white servant brought with it any marked improvement in his fortunes . In England , indeed , there was an impression that the aristocracy of Virginia was recruited from the ranks of these kidnapped paupers and convicts , as is shown not only in the writings of Defoe and Mrs. Aphra Behn , but even in works of a more serious character , pretending to scholarly research . Malachi Postlethwayte , author of several works on commerce , wrote , in 1750 or thereabouts : " Even your transported felons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , if we are not misinformed , have , by turning their hands to industry and improvement , and , which is best of all , to honesty , become rich , substantial planters and merchants , settled large families , and been famous in the country ; nay , we have seen many of them made magistrates , officers of militia , captains of good ships , and masters of good estates . " * A few years ago , in the time of our great civil war , one used to meet with illustrations of the survival of this false impression in occasional statements of Englisli newspapers to the effect that " the citizens of the United States were the offspring of the vagabonds and felons of Europe . , , t It is needless to say that the worthy Postlethwayte had been grossly misinformed . Now and then one of this wretched class of indented white servants recruited from the jails and slums of London may , through superior ability and under exceptional circumstances , have succeeded in working his way up to the ownership of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the good society of the colony ; but such instances must have been extremely rare . As a general rule , these persons on their release from servitude became irreclaimable vagabonds . The fact that manual labor was a badge of servitude , while they were by nature and experience unfitted to perform any work of a higher sort , was of itself sufficient to prevent them from doing any work at all , save when compelled by actually threatening starvation . And as manual labor came to be more and more completely relegated to an inferior race of men this wretched position of the mean white men became worse and worse . They were a lazy , shiftless set , whom even the negroes regarded with contempt . The negro slave might at least take a certain sort of piide in belonging to the establishment of a powerful or wealthy master , and from this point of view society might be said to have a place for him , even though lie possessed no legal rights . But * Postlethwayte 's Dictionary of Gommerce , vol. ii. , p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outcast . The negro might be like a Sudra , but the mean white was simply a Pariah . On the frontier he relapsed into savagery , if such a change could in his case be properly called a relapse . In the midst of the colony he was wont to earn a precarious livelihood or a violent death by gambling , betting , and thieving , now and then engaging in bolder enterprises of arson or highway robbery . At his best he was but a lounger in taverns or at horse-races . Crimes against person and property , which were much more frequent in Virginia than in the Middle and Northern colonies , were usually committed by men of this class . In these characteristics we may easily recognize the attributes of an order of humanity which has not yet become utterly extinct on American soil , though its days have for some time since been numbered . This order of humanity , as I shall show hereafter , grew up in the other Southern colonies as well as in Virginia , and from precisely the same causes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sent over to be flogged and starved for a while on tobacco plantations , and then turned adrift to prey upon society , were undoubtedly in great part the progenitors of the most degraded portion of the English race  --  the so-called " white trash " of the Southern States . The great planters , the small planters , the negro slaves , and the half servile , half outlawed " white trash " may thus be regarded as constituting four classes of society in the colony of Virginia . But between the upper two classes it would be difficult to draw a hard and fast line . In origin , as already observed , the great planters were mainly English rural gentry , the small planters were mainly English yeomen . Even in England these two classes shaded into one another ; there was not so very much difference between a small country squire and a wealthy farmer . What difference there was might consist in the fact that the squire 's greatgrandfather might have been fourth or fifth son of a peer , while the yeoman 's ancestry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but both alike were descended from men who had never known what it was to bow down before a task-master or a despot . In Virginia both alike became land-holders and owners of slaves , they mingled together in society , and their families intermarried . It was otherwise with those middle-class Englishmen who came to the colony to engage in trade . Like all rural aristocracies , the Virginia planters despised tradesmen and manufacturers , and looked upon the management of country estates as the only occupation worthy of gentlemen . But the tradesmen and merchants were few in numbers , and of manufacturers there were none . The absorption of the people in tobacco-planting was so complete that there was no room for the development of manufactures and commerce . One principal result of this devotion to tobacco culture was the absence of town life . Ia 1765 there was nothing like a city in the colony . The largest town was Norfolk , with about 7000 inhabitants ; Jamestown consisted of half a dozen houses ; Williamsburg , which was at once capital and university town , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unpaved . Richmond had hardly a more substantial existence than Martin Chuzzlewit 's " Eden . " The Legislature , thinking this state of things hardly creditable to the colony , labored assiduously to cure the evil ; but its attempts met with no better success than ordinarily awaits the efforts of legislatures to guide the progress of society . Neither bounties nor direct orders to build were of any avail . To make towns on paper was as easy as to make a promissory note ; but nobody would settle in the towns . Most of the county seats consisted simply of the court-house , flanked by the jail , the wretched country store , and the still more wretched country inn . As there were no centres of business , the tradesmen were in the habit of travelling about from plantation to plantation and peddling their wares . One would suppose that the necessity for exporting the great quantities of tobacco that were raised would of itself have given rise to a considerable class of thriving merchants . But the manner in which the Virginia planter disposed of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the wide and deep rivers of which Virginia has so many ; and each planter would have his own wharf , from which his own slaves might load the tobacco on to the vessels that were to carry it to England . If the plantation lay at some distance from a navigable river , the tobacco was conveyed to the nearest creek , and tied down upon a // VIRGINIA IN THE COLONIAL PERIOD . raft of canoes , and so floated and paddled down stream until some head of navigation was reached , where a warehouse was ready to receive it . The vessels which carried away this tobacco usually paid for it in all sorts of manufactured articles that might be needed upon the plantations . Every manufactured article that required the least skill or nicety of workmanship was imported in this way from England , in ships of which the owners , masters , and crew were generally either Englishmen or New-Englanders . In the colony no manufacturing was done , and such rude carpentry or smithery as was needed was taken in hand either by specially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who travelled about the country in quest of jobs . As the traders were mostly peddlers , so the artisans were for the most part tinkers . We have just seen how the rivers and creeks were used as highways of traffic : for a long time they were the only highways , and the vessel or the canoe was the only kind of vehicle , public or private , in which it was possible to get about with ease and safety . Until after the middle of the eighteenth century there were but few roads save bridle-paths , and such as there were became impassable in rainy weather . There were also but few bridges , and these were very likely to be unsound , while the ferry-boats were apt to be leaky . It was often necessary for the traveller to swim across the stream , with a fair chance of getting drowned , and more than a fair chance of losing his horse . The course of the bridle-path often became so obscure that it was necessary to blaze the trees . It was not uncommon for people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overnight in the woods , perhaps with the howls of the wolf and panther sounding in their ears . The highway robber was even a more uncomfortable customer to meet than these beasts of prey ; and in those days , when banking was in its infancy , and travellers used to carry gold coins sewed under the lining of their waistcoats , the highwayman enjoyed opportunities which in this age of railways and check-books are denied him . In 1777 , a young Rhode Island merchant , Elkanah Watson , armed with a sabre and pair of pistols , journeyed on horseback all the way from Providence to Charleston in South Carolina , with several hundred pounds in gold quilted into his coat . In seventy days he accomplished the whole distance of 1243 miles , fortunately without encountering any more serious mishaps than being arrested as a British spy in Pennsylvania , and having a fight with a large bear in North Carolina ; and he has left us a narrative of his journey , which is as full of instruction as it is of interest . The Virginian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to carry any very large sums of money concealed on his person , for he dealt in a circulating medium too bulky for that . The current money of the Virginian was tobacco . The prices of all articles of merchandise were quoted in pounds of tobacco . In tobacco taxes were assessed and all wages and salaries were paid . This use of tobacco as a circulating medium and as a standard of values was begun in the earliest days of the colony , when coin was scarce , and the structure of society was simple enough to permit a temporary return to the primitive practice of barter . Under such circumstances tobacco was obviously the most convenient article by which to estimate values . But with the further growth of the colony the financial and social results of the use of such a medium became disastrous . People rushed to the cultivation of tobacco in somewhat the same spirit as that which in recent days prompted the rush to the gold mines of California and Australia ; and cereal crops , which might here and there have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example of Maryland well shows , were entirely neglected . But , besides this , tobacco was a highly speculative crop . The returns were usually immense , but they fluctuated considerably from year to year , and this fluctuation affected the value of every article that was bought and sold throughout the colony . No one could estimate from one year to another , with any approach to accuracy , what the purchasing power of his income was going to be . The inevitable result of this was wild extravagance in living , chronic debt , relieved by frequent bankruptcy , persistent evasion of creditors , and the destruction of that trait of character which among a commercial people is known as financial integrity , and prized as one of the cardinal virtues . This extravagance in living was further stimulated by the regal hospitality for which the great planters early became fa // mous . Apart from politics , these country squires found but little business wherewith to occupy their time . The direct supervision of the slaves was ordinarily intrusted to overseers and the masters were thus secured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noble ambition , such as Jefferson and Madison , could turn to good profit in cultivating their minds . But to men of more common mould this ample leisure became monotonous , and in such a society as that here depicted , with no town life , no roads or inns worth speaking of , and no amusements save horseracing , the entertainment of guests by the month together was regarded both as a duty and as a privilege . Every planter kept open house , and provided for his visitors with unstinted hand . The style of living was extremely generous , and often splendid . The houses were spacious and solidly built , sometimes of brick or stone , but more often of wood . Panelled wamnscots of oak and carved oaken chimneypieces were common , and the rooms were furnished with the handsomest chairs and tables and cabinets that could be brought over from England . The dress , too , of both men and women was rich and costly , and the latest London fashions were carefully followed . Silver plate , elegant china , and choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the stables were stocked with horses of the finest breed . The part of the house that was least amply provided for was , no doubt , the library , which usually contained a few English classic authors , with perhaps Montaigne and Le Sage . The Virginians were not a reading people , and nothing could be much poorer than the sort of education that was provided for the children . The long distances between the plantations , and the absence of towns , made it impossible to establish such a system of public schools as flourished in New England . In 1671 , Sir William Berkeley , the friend of the Stuarts , said he thanked God that there were no free schools in the colony , and that there were not likely to be any . In 1692 , James Blair , a Scotch clergyman of considerable learning and great energy and public spirit , succeeded in establishing William and Mary College , the second in age among American universities , and so long as he remained its president the institution flourished , and its influence seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it stood quite alone , unsupported by any schools , and it seems to have degenerated sadly as soon as the strong hand of its founder was taken off , until it came to be merely a second-rate high school . There was no intellectual life in the colony , and previous to the Revolutionary war there was absolutely no literature worthy of notice . The first newspaper did not appear till 1736 . The intellectual stimulus which schools failed to furnish to the colony was not supplied by the clergy . The parson in old Virginia belonged to the class of fox-hunting , wine-bibbing parsons , of which there were so many examples in the mother country at the same time . The general tone of the English Church during the first half of the eighteenth century was very low , even in England ; and the peculiar conditions of existence in Virginia did not tend to raise the tone of the clergy . The Episcopal Church was supported by the government in Virginia until the Revolution , the governor , as vicegerent of the sovereign , being the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parishes , after the English fashion , and the same functions of local government were discharged by the vestries in Virginia as in England . The vestries corresponded to the New England town-meetings as far as was possible in view of the vast difference between the concentrated life of New England and the scattered life of Virginia . Even under the conditions under which they worked in Virginia , the political value of these vestry meetings was very great ; and we may point to them as the one great benefit which came to the colony from the attempt to establish the English Church system there . From no other point of view can the attempt be said to have wrought any good . The degraded condition of the Church and its ministers afforded an excellent field for the labors of the Wesleyans and to such good purpose did they work that by the time of the Revolution two-thirds of the people in the colony had become Dissenters . When the Revolution came the Dissenters were all to be found on the patriotic side , while in the Episcopal Church were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed to break down the Church establishment entirely , and to cast upon it irredeemable discredit . The other learned professions in Virginia* before the middle of the eighteenth // century , stood at no higher level than the clerical profession . Medicine was perhaps in the most degraded condition of all , its practice being largely left to itinerant barbers and quacks . The lawyers , too , were at first men without learning or character . But shortly before the Revolution a great change had been wrought in this department ; and we find the profession graced by such names as those of Henry and Jefferson , until at last in John Marshall the old colony gave to the United States one of the very greatest jurists that the English race has ever produced . One chief cause of this rapid and splendid development of legal talent in the colony was undoubtedly the close connection which obtains between legal and political activity . The political life of Virginia was always healthy and vigorous . Unlike the men of New England in many respects , the men of Virginia yielded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or in the value which they set upon selfgovernment . They were fully imbued with all the deep and sound political instincts by the aid of which the English race has learned to rule itself and to guide the world . And the royal government of the colony afforded them an excellent school for political training . The whole political history of Virginia down to the time of the Stamp Act is a dreary history of bickerings between the governor appointed by the crown and the Assembly elected by the people . A dreary history one may well call it , inasmuch as its details can have no more interest , either from a dramatic or from a philosophical point of view , than the details of any petty lawsuit about a breach of contract or a disputed right of way across a field . To mention the names of the commonplace men who were sent over from time to time to govern Virginia , and to recount their paltry squabbles , would be to write history after a fashion which is happily becoming obsolete . Chronological tables and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this sort may best be found specifically stated . The value of such facts as materials is very great ; but the business of the historian is to set forth their import , not to recount them in detail , unless they possess some human interest of their own . Looking at the matter in this light , the colonial annals of Virginia may be passed over with little ceremony . The point which chiefly interests us to-day is that all these dismal bickerings were of signal use to the people in training them to ascertain what their rights were under the English constitution , and to defend themselves in the possession of these rights with intelligence and dignity . The remarkable advance in political skill achieved by the Virginians during the first half of the eighteenth century is illustrated by the contrast between the management of Bacon 's rebellion and the management of the great constitutional struggle which culminated in the independence of the United States . The rebellion headed by Nathaniel Bacon in 1676 is the one conspicuous event that breaks the dead monotony of Virginian history down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebellion in which the passions of the people were strongly enlisted , and for good reason , yet it instantly collapsed upon the loss of its leader . Bacon 's rebellion was a consequence of the oppression wrought in the colony by the infamous government of Charles II. , and by the hands of that Sir William Berkeley who took such pleasure in the thought that the Virginians were not likely to possess any means of educating themselves . Charles began by enforcing the Navigation Act , prohibiting the importation of any merchandise into the colony except in English vessels navigated by Englishmen . An attempt was next made to do away with the popular election of representatives . Under the influence of the loyalist feeling called forth by the restoration of the monarchy , the Assembly elected in 1661 contained a large majority of friends of the Stuarts-of men whobelieved in prerogative and in divine right ; and the governor , having thus secured a legislature which was quite to his mind , kept it alive for fifteen years , until 1676 , simply by adjourning it from year to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election . The first act of this royalist Assembly was to institute such a vigorous persecution against all Dissenters as to lead within two years to an abortive Puritan conspiracy and the hanging of several of its leaders . In 1669 , the king granted the whole of Virginia to Lords Arlington and Culpepper for the remainder of the century , at the same time giving them the right of appointing all public surveyors , so that the very titles of the colonists to the lands which they occupied were thrown into jeopardy . Thus threatened in their religion , in their // trade , and in their homes , the colonists were ripe for rebellion , when all at once the horrors of the tomahawk and scalpingknife were added to their other troubles . In 1672 , after a fearful struggle of twenty years ' duration , the Senecas of New York had overthrown their kinsmen the Susquehannocks , and driven them from their territory at the head of the Chesapeake . Slowly retreating southward , the defeated savages at first engaged in a war with Maryland , and afterward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They spread themselves all over the country , from the Potomac to the James , burning and murdering , and carrying terror to every household . After this state of things had lasted several months , and driven the colonists into frenzy , the sagacious governor , for reasons best known to himself , suddenly disbanded a large force that had been gathered for the purpose of chastising the Indians , and as a consequence the country was laid waste ; one parish in Rappahannock County , which on the 24th of January , 1676 , consisted of seventy-one plantations , was within the next seventeen days reduced to eleven . " i ' At last , after nearly four hundred scalps had been taken by the savages , the people raised a small volunteer force without authority from the governor , and by acclamation put it under the leadership of Nathaniel Bacon , a wealthy young Englishman of good family and li ral education , who had but just come over to Virginia . As Bacon marched against the Susquehannocks , Governor Berkeley proclaimed him a rebel , and started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insane conduct aroused the whole country to rebellion , and Berkeley was obliged not only to retreat , but to issue writs for a general election , and to promise a redress of grievances . Bacon was elected to the new Assembly , which was decidedly anti-Stuart in temper , and it was not long before he had come to control it entirely . An eloquent memorial was sent to the king , recounting the oppressions under which his faithful subjects in Virginia had suffered , and Bacon once more marched against the Indians . In the midst of a brilliant campaign he learned that Berkeley had once more proclaimed him a rebel , whereupon , leaving his work on the frontier , he instantly marched upon Jamestown , and took possession of the government , while Berkeley fled in dismay . A third time after settling affairs at the capital , did Bacon set forth to overwhelm the Indians and no sooner had he got out of sight than Berkeley came forward and resumed the administration of the colony . Again Bacon returned to Jamestown , captured the sixteen or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to the ground , that the town might no longer afford a shelter to the tyrant . His two principal supporters , Drummond and Lawrence , who owned the best two houses , set on fire each his own dwelling with his own hand . But a few days after this , Bacon was seized with a malarial fever , and died , and so the rebellion instantly collapsed . Virginian politics were still in that undeveloped condition in which everything depended upon the fate of the leader . Bacon 's principal followers were tried by court-martial , and hanged as soon as sentence was pronounced . " You are very welcome , " said Berkeley , with a low bow , as the wealthy Drummond was brought before him . " I would rather have had a visit from you than from any other man in Virginia . You shall be hanged in half an hour . " Drummond and twenty-one others were put to death , and three died of cruel treatment received in prison . On hearing of these troubles , Charles II . issued a proclamation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and especially for acting too much on his own discretion . " The old fool , " observed the king , " has taken away more lives in that naked country than I for the murder of my father . " i ' The too zealous governor was recalled in disgrace , but not a single point was gained by the people of the colony . The political results of the disturbance were rather disastrous than otherwise . Assemblies were henceforth to be called together only once in two years , and were to sit but fourteen days , while the universal suffrage was restricted by a property qualification . All the acts of Bacon 's Assembly were repealed , all the old grievances wererenewed , and many estates were confiscated into the bargain . The governors who succeeded Berkeley were as a rule no better than he , and from this time down to the passage of the Stamp Act the political history of Virginia is simply the story of a protracted brawl between the governors and their Assemblies . But this brawl* Bancroft , i. 545. * Bancroft , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
