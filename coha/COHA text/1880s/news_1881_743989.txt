txt The death of President GARFIELD and the accession to the chief magistracy of VicePresident ARTHUR , combined with the changes made in the Presidency of the Senate , very naturally excite public attention to what may be called the Presidential succession . Happily , complications like the - present have not been frequent in our history . At any rate , parties in the Senate lave not usually been so nicely balanced that the death of the President and the consequent promotion of the Vice-President have caused much commotion among partisan politicians . For this reason , probably , our people have not familiarized themselves with the possible results which may flow from the removal of the chief magistrate , or with the methods by which , under the Constitution and the laws , vacancies in the Presidential office must be filled . Upon one point , especially , the popular notion is wholly wrong . It is a common error to refer to the President of the Senate pro tempore as a constitutional officer , and sometimes as " acting Vice-President . " Furthermore , many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or removal , of the President and Vice-President , the President . of the Senate , should there be cne , would be the acting President of the United States , and would serve out the quadrennial term of the office . In the first place , confusion has arisen in the minds of some persons on account of the common usage of the title , " President of the Senate . " The Constitution ( Article I. , section 3 , ) provides that " the Vice-President of the United States shall be President of the Senate . " But it is not customary to refer to the Vice-President as President of the Senate . ? He is known by the title of the office to which he was elected by the people . The person occupying the chair of the presiding officer of the Senate is addressed as " Mr. President , " whether he be the Vice-President of the United States , the President of the Senate pro tempore , or a Senator called to occupy the chair for an hour , or a few minutes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " we usually mean to designate by that title the Senator chosen to act as presiding officer in the absence of the Vice-President . To be strictly accurate , one should give the title in full , and refer to the officer as " the President pro tempore of the Senate . " The Constitution gives the Senate power to choose such an officer , and the rules of the Senate provide that the President of the Senate pro tempore may designate any Senator to occupy the chair during one day 's sitting of the Senate , or less , but such substitution can not extend beyond an adjournment . The temporary character of the Presidency of the Senate , when filled by a Senator , is fixed beyond dispute . The incumbent is merely a Senator called to exercise the duties of the Chair " for the time . " In 1876 , after much debate , the Senate adopted three resolutions , summarized as follows : First , that the tenure of a President pro tempore does not expire at the meeting of Congress after the first recess , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second , that the death . of the Vice-President does not have the effect to vacate the office of the President pro tempore ; third , that the office of President pro tempore is held at the pleasure of the Senate . The President of the Senate , chosen from the body of Senators , does not become acting Vice-President of the United States in case of the Vice-President 's death , removal , or promotion to the Presidency . He remains a Senator temporarily in the chair , liable to be displaced whenever the Senate pleases , and exercising his proper functions as Senator as to voting , making speeches , and serving on committees , none of which functions is allowed to the VicePresident , except that of voting when the Senate is equally divided . As the office of Vice-President of the United States derives its chief significance from the fact that that functionary may , in a certain contingency , be President of the United States , so the office of President of the Senate pro tempore acquires special importance when the Vice-Presidency has become vacant from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by law for the case of removal , death , resignation , or inability both of President and Vice-President , declaring what officer shall act as President . Congress , accordingly , enacted , in 1792 , the only statute which provides for the contingencies above referred to . The law declares that " in case of removal , death , resignation , or inability of both the President and Vice-President of the United States , the President of the Senate , or , if there is none , then the Speaker of the House , for the time being , shall act as President until the disability is removed or a President elected . " The remaining sections of the act specify the forms to be observed in calling a new election , the most important being that which requires a notification of the vacancies to be served on the Governors of the States by the Secretary of the United States , specifying when the new Presidential Electors shall be chosen . As we have shown , the President of the Senate may be removed at any time at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cease to be a Senator . But should he become acting President of the United States , it is obvious that he must at once pass beyond the reach of the Senate . For several months , at least , pending proceedings to elect a President , he must discharge the duties of President of the United States . It may be presumed that his place in the Senate is made vacant by his translation to the Executive chair . But no provision is made for filling that vacancy . If Mr. ARTHUR should die and Mr. DAVIS , as President of the Senate , should become acting President of the United States , and should not formally notify the Governor of Illinois that he had resigned his seat , could the Legislature of Illinois , in consideration of the fact that the seat had been vacated , proceed to choose his successor ? A contingency like this , let us hope , is very remote , but this and similar minor difficulties in the way of adjusting the details of the Presidential succession , show the need of additional legislation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
