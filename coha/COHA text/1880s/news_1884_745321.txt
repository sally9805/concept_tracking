txt When the Military Academy Appropriation bill was before the House a few days ago an amendment was offered providing that all appointments to the grade of Second Lieutenant in the army should be confined to graduates of the Military Academy and to meritorious non-commissioned officers recommended for promotion in the manner now provided by law . This amendment , having been advocated by Gen. ROSECRANS , Chairman of the Military Committee and President of the last Board of Visitors to West Point , was adopted in Committee of the Whole , but after the bill had been reported to the House it was thrown out by a vote of 88 to 150 . The author and advocates of the proposed amendment seem to ilave had their attention directed to . an appointment made by the President in the last week of November . WILLIAM W. WRIGHT , the young man appointed at that time to be a Second Lieutenant , had been a member of the Class of ' 86 at the Academy . Joining ? his class in July , 1882 , lie was found deficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was allowed to resign . If he had not resigned he would , it is understood , have been discharged by recommendation of the Academic Board . If he had been discharged , the President could not have appointed him without violating the statute that says : " No cadet who ' is reported as deficient in either conduct or studies and . recommended to be discharged from the Academy shall , unless upon the recommendation of the Academic Board , be returned or reappointed or appointed to any place in the army before his class shall have left the Academy and received their . commissions . " In his annual report , dated only four days before this appointment was made , the Secretary of War declared that the rigid enforcement of this law had not failed to exercise a beneficial influence at the Academy , and remarked that in former years the force of discipline had undoubtedly been impaired by a disregard of its provisions . If WRIGHT 'S appointment had been made a week or two earlier , Secretary LINCOLN might have been led to change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not violate the letter of the law , owing to the fact that WRIGHT had resigned , and had thereby escaped discharge , it is very plain that the appointment was . not in accord with its spirit . At the same time time he rewarded deficiency at the expense of proficiency . This cadet , who could not keep up with his class , already has become a Second Lieutenant . Those members of his class who shall receive similar appointments at the end of their term , in 1886 , will find him two years in advance of them . Other members , after four years ' service at the Academy , may not be able to gain admission to the army . In his last report the Secretary said : " Under existing laws those cadets for whom there may be no vacancies existing in the army at the time of their graduation must be discharged from the military service . For the last few years the law requiring that there shall be no civilian appointments into the army until a sufficient number of vacancies exist to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with , civilian appointments into the army having only been made to fill such vacancies as remained on July 1 of each year , after the appointment of the graduating class of cadets and of meritorious non-commissioned officers recommended according to law ; vacancies occurring on or after July 1 of each year being kept open . The Superintendent of the ? Academy calls attention to the large number of cadets in the class which will be graduated in June . 1886 , the class now having 83 members , and he expresses the opinion that probably SO will be graduated . Unless there shall be a change in the law it will not probably be possible for all of the Class of ' 86 to be appointed into the army if any civilian appointments are made before their graduation , as the members of that class and the one which will be graduated next June , together with non-commissioned officers to be appointed under existing laws , will probably be sufficient to take up all the vacancies which will occur in the two years . " This statement was written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inclined to think that the amendment offered in the House should not have been rejected , but should have been made a part of the law .
