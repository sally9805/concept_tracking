" Mister Diry : I 've been intending ever since I got home from Yourope , to begin ritin ' in a diry , but I ai n't had no time , cos my chum Jimmy and me has been puttin ' in our days havin ' fun . I 've got to give all that sorter thing up now , cos I 've accepted a persisshun in a onherabel perfesshun , and wen I get to be a man , and reech the top rung of the ladder , I 'm goin ' to mak ' New York howl .

All them fellers wot rite in dirys begin by usin a lot of hyfalutin wurds wot sound orful big but do n't meen nothin ; so I guess I 'll be in the fashun , so here goes : You 're only a quire of " common noose " paper , Mr. Diry , so you need n't put on so menny airs over your cleen wite dress , wot only needs a morocker lether mantel and gilt braceletts to make you look like you b'longed to the Astor house dude . We all know you was maid of rags , and them rags might once have bean in the mazey , lacey laberinths of wite linnin wot audashusly pressed ' gainst the tender form of Lillyan , the dudine .

Then , agen , you mite have ben on some infantile prospecktive Preserdent , but you did n't stay on him long , cos baby 's and safety-pins maid you tired . Enyway you 've got a histery , cos them littel black spots on your rite bussum looks like they mite wunce hav ben part of Mrs. Dr. Walker 's patent backackshun , maskuline , dress-reform trowsers , wot she sent to the paper-mill to get ground up inter paper to mak books for the enlitenin of the wimmin of our country . How 's that for high , Mr. Diry ? My muse come playguey neer running away with me , so I had to wistle " down brakes , " and slow her up . Now I 'll begin to record my doins on your pages , so that , shuld the toes of my boots be applide to the patent bucket early in my useful carreer , the hull wurld 'll kno wot a treassure socieaty has lost . I ai n't givin you eny biled lasses candie , but do n't you let your memmerizin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Bad Boy wot 's ben to Yourope , ai n't no slouch . My pa sez I 'm a geneyus . I guess he 's ' bout rite , ony he orter sed I was a buddin ' one , ' cos my hankerin ' after a perfeshunal carrieer has led me to axcept a posishun in the publick-opinyun-moldin ' shop wots known as the Daily Buster , Joe Gilley , edittur and proprieat-her . Subskripshun price , $5 per yare . No trubbel to sine receits . N.B.  --  Speshell arrangements with ex-Senater Satan enabels us to give our delinkent subskribers cheap excurshun rates to the Hot Sulfur Baths , via the Haydies Short Line , our fitin ' edit-her corndoctor . This paper is run on red-hot indypendant principels , in a spicey , sparklin ' manher . In pollyticks our motto is : " Onhest men , regardless of partie , candy-dates with barr'ls xcepted . " The above is the prospecktus of the journalistick venture in wich I have mbarked in the capacerty of typergraffickal devil . So now Mr. Diry , look out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WILL THEY BE CONSINED TO A PLACE THAT IS HOTTER THAN THIS .  --  A LABER-SAVTN ' MASHEEN.  --  BEER , GASSERLIN AND PROHIBISHUN . I 've jest got my supper , so I guess I 'll tell you ' bout my first day 's xperience on the Dailey " Buster . " I was down to the offis at 7 ' clock , and the mannergin edittur , he detaled me to intervue , the old papers and dust , on the floor . By the ade of a broom , wot was so old , it was most bald-hedded , I suckceeded in completely ridden the floor of its surplus stock of litterature , and terbackhey balls , wot them printers spit out , wen they warnted to use there mouths , to consine sum feller , wot rote orful to Hallyfax , or sum other mild climat . I wunder if everybody , wot them printers dam , goes to Hades , cos , if they do , and all printin ' offisses is like ourn , I guess us fellers wont have much compenny in Heaven wen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pertickler spite ' gainst a Mister Copy , cos I hearn him bein ' dammed , more an a hundred times to-day . I guess the poor feller ai n't got no sho a tall . I never seen the wurkins of a edithers sanktuary before . I useter wonder , how they rote all them long artickels wot everybody sed show 'd the grate geneyus of the edittur , but I never knowed till this mornin ' bout the laber-savin ' masheen , wot is maid of two peeces of steal , with sharp points on one end , and two rings on the other , wot slip over the editturs fingers . Wen he 's got them on , he takes off his shoes and stockins , and waids inter a lot of old noosepapers , clippin ' out littel bits here and there , and pastin ' ' em on a sheet of wite paper . The masheen wurked splendid , and Mister Gilley sez its a sure anty-dote agin skribler 's parallysis , wot all great riters is trubbelled with . Jest ' fore dinner the edit-her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pernisshus Pizen ; or , Holesail Slaughter , " caused by the adulterashun of beer with arsernic , so he sent me down to the barroom next door to get him a bottle of beer on thirty days time . I 'd jest got back to the sanktum , and was takin ' out the cork , wen the Metherdist minnysteer cum in to arrange ' bout a big prohibishun rally wot comes off next week . He looked orful suspishus at the bottle , till the edit-her told me to take that bottel of gasserline , to the forman , and tell him to wash the forms with it , and be sure not to get it neer a lite , cos gasserline was orful ' xplosive . I guess it got ' xploded cos , wen the minnyster was gone , I went out to get it , and I culd n't even find a smell of it , so I had ter go round to the next block for another , cos the edittur 's face was n't good for morean one , in the same place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you ever get a whiff of the smell , throne out by the paste-pot , in an edittur 's offis , wot was ' stablished in ' 49 ? Cos , if you never did , you ca n't apreshiate how deliteful the consentrated ' xtract of half a dozen glew factorys would be , in comparyson . This afternoon the edit-her perlitely requested me to consine the contents of ours to their last restin ' place in the ash-heep , in our back-yard . Menny a silent teer did I shed over the cold and clammy remanes of hundreds of cockroaches , whose young and usefull lives came to such a sad and untimely end , in there brave efferts to ' xplore the mystear-ious and fathemless depths of the " Buster 's " paste-pot . I guess I muster forgot to wash my hands ' fore supper , cos pa 's down in the sellar settin ' a trap for a polecat , and ma she swares she 's goin ' to have a carpinter take up the dinin ' - room flure tomorrer mornin ' , and hunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHAPTER III . THE XCHANGE FYEND.  --  SHEECARGO ALL QUIETT.  --  THE FYEND GOES ABROAD .  --  HIS GRATE SPERIT APALLED.  --  THE BERRIED HOPES OF A RUMATIICK POET . Our offis has got wot is called a xchange fyend wot comes in every mornin wen we get the male and looks over all the papers , cos he 's too meen to buy his own readin matter . I knovv 'd by the way the edittur looks at him , he 'd like to kick him down 3 flites of steep steps , but I guess he borrowed a dime from him , bout ten years ago , and he 's ' frade he 'll ' tach the offis furniture for it . I alwus like to help my ' mployers outer a tite place , so , this mornin , I run ' cross a paper that was printed this day sevral yares ago , so I lade it down on the tabil where the Fyend 'd strike it the first thing , and then I got orful busy dustin the book-case . Wen he cum in , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I seen he was gettin orful xcited , then he snatched up his hat and segar stump , and run like he was chased by litenin . Purty soon , there was more an 5,000 peepel on the street in front of the offis , and the edittur got orful scared , cos he thought they was goin to run him outer town , on account of the big soshill scandell wot he published yesterday , so he sent me to the door to see wot they all wanted . Wen I got there the peeple was most crazey for noose from the Sheecargo fire . I told em to hold on and we 'd hav out an xtra in a few minits , and then I showed the edittur the paper wot the Fyend was reedin , wot gave a big account of the Sheecargo fire . Wen we got out our extra , we sold ' bout 10,000 coppies , with a artickel , wot red like this : " The latest despaches from that city report Sheecargo all quiett , thanks to the forethort of the Mayor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for service durin the sittin of the Youmorists Conven-shun , and the grate precaushuns taken by Common Counsil to see that no lickher was sold to delergates ! " You bet there was a mad crowd , wen they found out there warnt no fire a tall in Sheecargo . The ' xchange fyend 's gone to New Jersey , cos it 'll have time to blow over , ' fore Congres can promulgait a xtrodishun treety , with that government . This afternoon , I was appalled , my grate big spirit fell down into my shoes , like a Jump of led . Alass how grate the breech is , tween the orthor , and the columns of a noospaper , and how short the rode , wot leeds to the waist basket , espeschially the one , in a printin offis like the Daily " Buster , " were the basket covers bout a square akrc of flore . I was put to cleenin up the waste basket , so as we 'd hav the paper reddy , for the junk man , wot calls round with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I cold n't help lingerin over the contents , and sying , wen I thought , of the hopes wot lied burried thare . There was one littel peece of poultry , rittin on a sheet of ' lectric blue paper , and sented with otto of roses , and indited to " My dare George . " I wunder if the poultryess ment me , wen she rote it , cos if she did , she struck it jest rite , for Ive got it stowed away , in my pants pocket next my hart . There was a nother roll of manerskript , wot wayed a pound , and come by xpress , without bein pade . I guess the edittur was mad , wen he paid 50 sents charges , and found out it warnt no berthday present . A note with it , red like this : My dare Edittur Buster  --  The enclosed storie entitled " Dudish Dick , the Flirtin Corn-Doctor of Horse-car No. 36 , " is wurth $500 , but in complerment of the high standin of your valewbel jurnal , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will send me papers contain in it . Yours trooly , Sammy Lane , Author . Wat unappreciatin beins editturs are ! Wen they wuld let a geneyus wot was capable of pennin the follerin lines go unrewarded : A big politishun named Kelley , Had a gripin pane in his belly . He used St. Jacobs oil , And now he 's nussin a boil , But his pane has left him by golly . CHAPTER IV . HE AI N'T NO TYPERGRAFFICKAL CYCLOPEEDA.  --  SERIUS COMPLERCASHUNS , WITH A TEMPORY ABBERASHUN.  --  A PRINTIN ' OFFIS FEED . I 'm in a peck of troubel to-day , wot I 'll have ter trust ter Providence to get me outer . A typergraffickal devil ai n't s'posed to know everything , enyway . Now the hull offis is mad at me , ' cos I ai n't a walk-in ' cyclopeeda of typograffickal turm . In the fust place , the foreman of the composin ' room 's mad , ' cos wen he tole me to fech him a long stick , I went down street and hunted round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and brot him back a good lath . Wen I giv it to him I thot there was a erupshun from a volcano , the way he swared at me . He sed he 'd a noshun to brake it over my back , for not havin cents enuff to kno that he bot his fire wood by the cord . Y did n't he tell me in the fust place he wanted that thing wot printers use to set type in . Now the casheer 's on his ear , cos he sent me out ter buy a wooden galley . I know 'd very well I could n't make no mistake there , cos I 'm posted on ship 's kichens , so I arst him how big a one he wanted . He sed medeyum , so I went up to Johnny Roache 's ship-yard and had them send a galley down to the offis , wot would be big enuf for a good sized skooner . You orter seen the casheer 's face , wen the six-horse teem stopped in frunt of the dore . The driver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Casheer pade him to hawl it back , and rote Mr. Roache that there boy was laberin under a slite abberashun of the mind wen he ordered it . But I think its his mind wots got the abberashuns instead , from sittin up so late with the red-hedded grass widder wot keeps the bordin house crost the street from our house . If it had n't , y did n't he tell me he warnted a galley for keepin type in , wen the composin stick 's full . Fellers like him orter be put on ice , cos there too fresh to keep long . He only needs a tale to be a thorobred dude , cos he 's got everything else wat blongs to one . On my way home , at noon , I stopped to see a feller wot was sellin prize packits , at the corner of Nassau street , so I did n't get time to ete much dinner . I was gettin orful hungry bout 4 ' clock , wen the edittur arst me if I thot I culd clere up the pie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warnt to let him see I was so orful hungery , so I told him I did n't kno . " Well , " sed he , " there 's nothin like tryin ; the fore-man 'll sho you wear it is . " I could n't keep back my grattyfycashun , so I thanked him three or four times . You bet I was mad , wen I fownd out there warnt no cherry or mince pie , not even dryed appel , but only a lot of type wot had got mixed up . I think its reel mene to make a littel boy like me think he s goin to get a big feed , and then not give him enything but a lot of led wot nobodie else wuld try to ete . You orter see our imposin stone ; it must be orful valewble . Its a grate flat peece of marbel , tattooed , all over , with funny hyroglifficks . I guess its one of the old toombstones wot come from anshunt Troy . Its a wunder the edittur do nt sell it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms on , its so orful imposin . CHAPTER V. A VISIT FROM A DISTINGUSHED ANTY-MONOPERLIST TYPERGRAFFICAL TOREWRIST.  --  HE EXPOSES A MURDERUS CONSPIRACY .  --  A THRETEND RESIGNASHUN . This mornin our offis was onhered by a visit from a typergraffical torewrist , wot in-terduced hisself as John McNamee . He sed he 'd just returned from a xtensive visit in the Western States , ware he 'd been for sum time , for the benefit of his health . He is one of the most distinguished members of the perlitikel partis , called Anti-Monopolists . I admire a man wot praktices wot he preaches . Now , this Mr. McNamee has never been known to contribute a cent to surportin our grate ralerode mo-noperlists , altho he has travilled all over the United States by rale . Beside that , he would n't axcept any accommodashuns short of a green-line sleeper . Wen I arst him y he did n't ware his gold watch-chain and silk hat , like all other pollytishuns , he sed his partie was endevourin to freeze out the big clothin monopolies by wearin their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swellin with pride , as he spoke of the fruits there labor had brot forth in the failyure of so menney grate clothin furms . He condersended to thro in sum type , and wen he got thru , him and a cuppel of our printers adjurned down stares to partake of a shampayne lunch . I guess he war n't used to drinkin lite wines , cos he 's been sleepin under the paper-cutter all the afternoon , dreemin that he was bein nom-minated for Preserdent on the great anty-monoperlist ticket . Jest before dinner the edittur told me to tell the make-up man to kill Lawrence Rickard . Now , his store is ware my pa buys all his groseries , and his wife and ma 's orful good chums , and b'long to the same sewin ' sircle . Mr. Rickard alwus treeted me rite , and I did n't like to see a cupple of bludthursty villanes kill him without givin ' him tim to say his prayers , so I called inter his store and told him he 'd better skip out or lay lo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ordered a nuther feller to kill him . He sed he 'd fix ' em . So rite after dinner a cupple of perlice cum up to the offis and arrested Mr. Gilley and the make-up man for conspiracy to murder , and they had to xplane it , and pay all the costs . I took a littel vacashun this afternoon , and went out fishin ' , cos I remembured wot pa says after he 's kissed ma by telerfone , " Distance lends enchantment to the vue . " So I thot them two bad men wyld be more enchanted with me if I kep at a safe distance . I 'm orful frade my jurnulistick carrieer 's goin ' to be broken off short , but I do n't think they orter blamed me , cos the edittur shutd er told me to tell the make-up man to take out that local notis wot red : " Fresh vegetabels and grene truck received daily , at L. I. Rickard 's Grocerie , " insted of makin ' me tell him to kill Mr. Rickatrd , Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fortune , I ' kno wot I can be , I 'll go to the offis in the mornin ' , and if there 's eny music in the air , I 'll resine and berry my hopes . Then I 'll leese Dennis Ryan 's old blind muel , wot 's too week to kik , and go to peddlin ' fish . The Buster will bust ' fore they make enything outer this chickin ; ai n't that so , Mister Diry ? CHAPTER VI . THE CLOWD SHEW 's ITS SILVER LININ ' , AND GEORGIE DOES HISSELF PROUD .  --  THE RED-HEDDED OLD SNOOZER QUAKES BEFORE THE DEVIL .  --  HE 'S GOT THE GALL . To-day has ben a glorius day for me , cos it seems like I 'd done sumthin wot was a onher to the perfesshun . Wen I went down to the offis I felt like my resignashun wuld be axceptabel , cos my servises could easyly be dispensed with . I left the door opin wen I went in so as I 'd have a avenew of ' scape in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the press-room I hearn a muffelled voice say : " Georgie , my boy , is that you ? " I answered : " Yes , sir . " Then I seen the edittur reclinin ' in a recumbent posishun , under the big sillinder press , lookin'whither ' an a sheet , and tremblm ' like he 'd seen his grandpa 's gost . I arst him wot was the matter , and he sez : " Georgie , there 's a man in the offis wot I sed was a red-hedded old snoozer wot ort to be run outer town . Tell him I 've gone to Coney Ileland to fite a duhell with Sullivan , or say I 'm out takin ' my mornin ' pistil practise . Tell him enything , only get schutt of him . " I sez : " You becher life , I 'll fix him . " So I went inter the sanktuary , like I own 'd the hull bisness , and I seen his oner walk-in ' up and down , swarin ' to hisself , like he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soon as he cot site of me , he sez : " Young man , where am that red-hedded , shaller-braned , lantern-jawd , squint-eyed , crooked-knoes son of a ded beet ? Show me him till I pulverise him so fine that his remanes would n't bring 5 cents if you was to sell em for pure superfosfated binary bone . " " Wot did you remark ? " sez I. " Show me the insignificant littel puppy wot sed I was a red-hedded old snoozer , " sed he . " Oh ! you wish ter see the edittur . I 'll call him , " sez I. Illustration : A GENTLEMAN , WANTS TO INTER VUEHIM . Then I went to the speakin tube wot goes up inter the composin-room , and sung out orful loud : " Tell the fitin edittur that there 's a gentleman , down in the offis , wants to intervue him . Tell him he 'd better lode up his dubble-barrl 'd , breech-lodin blunderbuss with dannymite cartrag cos the gentleman prefers a-heeted argument . " Then I turned round and told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minnit . He cooled rite off and sed : " Thank you , my boy ; there 's no hurry ; I guess you 'll do jest as well . I only called to pay for your valuabel paper . Tell the edittur my hole family culd n't get along without it ; even the baby lays awake all nite cry in ' for it . " And then he handed me a $10 bill and did n't wate for no change , for he ony had a cuppel uv minnits to each a trane in . Mr. Gilley was listenin ' to the hull conversashun , an ' , wen the coast was cleer , he come out from his hidin ' place and patted me on the back and sez : " Georgie , you 're a brick ; you 're goin ' to be a onher to your perfeshun . Sum day you 'll be a Pulsitter , cos you 've got the gall of a Sun reporter . " I wonder if Sun reporters swet much , cos I never go golled ' less it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old buck saw , gettin ' the wood reddy for winter . I guess I must be a hero , cos the sportin ' edittur , wen he hurd wot I did , took me to the fotograf gallarv , and had my pictur taken , so as he culd pass me off for the new English prize fiter , wot he 's training so as he can lick Sullivan . CHAPTER VII . HE INTERVUES ELI PERKINS AND GETS SUM POINTS ON JURNERLISTIC EGGSAGGERASHUN , PREVARICASHUN AND MAGNIFYCASHUN.  --  Y PULLMAN STOK IS GOIN UP . Wen I was round to the hotels , this mornin ' gettin the arrivals , I seen sumthin on the regester of the Grand Pacific wot look 'd like a cuppel of spiders had ben fitin and got there legs in the ink bottel and crawled over bout a dozen lines . I arst the clerk wot it ment . He culdnt : say til he seen wot number the wot-is-it had . After lookin over his leger he found that No. 36 stood for Eli Perkins and a grate big bord bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a noosepaper man to intervue distinguished guests , so I thot it 'd do purty neer as well to intervue a distinguished liar . So I got the clerk to sho me up to Mr. Per-kin 's room . It feel like I 'd got up a rung or two on the ladder alreddy , cos the edither thot my peece wot I rote bout the intervue was good , and its goin to be put in to-morrer mornins paper . I rite it down in your pages , Mister Diry , so as I can look at it wen my hart grows weery strugglin for fame and wriches : " After xchangin good mornins , the Buster reporter sed : " ' Mr. Perkins , youre one of the biggest liars in America , ai nt you ? ' " ' Who sed I was one of ' em , yung man ? ' sed he , gettin mad , and comin over to were I was sittin , like he was goin to formally interduce his patent lether pumps to the paches wot I sit down on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll brand him as an infamous liar . Me , one of the biggest liars in America . It 's mene , to , contemtabel . To think that I shuld hav toiled a life to stablish a reputashun , only to be classed as one of the biggest liars of America . No , young man , you 're rong . I am the grate I am liar of the unyverse . ' " By this time our reprysentative was feelin like he 'd mistakin his callin , but musterin up courage , he sed : " ' Mr. Perkins , I 'm a yung aspyrant for jurnalistic onhers . Can you give sum points on the bizness , wot I culd use to advantage ? ' " ' Yes , my son , you becher bottom dollar , I can . Alwus bear in mind that the three furst principels of moddern jur-nalism is Prevaricashun , Eggsaggeration , and Magnifycashun . For instance : If Tallmage , in his sermin , sez he b'lieves there 's a hell , you want to be sure to rite it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a short visit , held his hearers spellbound for a hour , yesterday morning , by his grand and vivid discripshun of the mildness of the climat of a salubrous summer resort " This wuld be a excellent illustrashun of Prevaricashun . " ' Eggsaggershun would be like this : If a candydate of the oppersishun treats a fellow to a glass of beer , you wanter say : The barrel 's ben tapped , and fabulous sums are bein expended to inflooence voters , and never forget to hed the artickel Fraud , Corrupshun , and Forgerry . " ' If a six-pound baby comes to one of your subskribers , you warnter size the farther up , and if he 's good for twenty-five segars the babys got ter be twelve pounds . If he 's good for fifty make it eighteen pounds , and if he sends round a hole box , with the notis , the baby 's got to turn into twins . This wuld be a case of magnifycashun . It shos jurnerlistick enterprise . Y , I 've known cases where a puny 8-pound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doin ' well , all cos their papa had cents enuf to send sum wiskey ' long with the segars . Those are the principel points to bare in mind , and if you follow em up rite , you 'll become a grate and good jurnerlist . If you ever run short of sensashuns , get on the track of the " mercury " liar and foller him up , till you strike his mine of valuabel infer-mashun . ' " ' How long are you goin ' to be in the city , Mr. Perkins ? ' " ' Only a few days . I 'm here fixin ' up my fenses , and puttin ' in a bid for the nommenashun for the Preserdency . I 'm orful anxyus to run agin ' Ben Butler . ' " ' Is there enything else startlin ' that you know , Mr. Perkins ? ' queried our rep-rysentativ . " ' Yes , but you mus n't give it away , cos I 'm short on Pullman stok . Do you see this ? ' said he , holdin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square . ' Well I come down from Albanie on a sleeper last nite , and this morning I mistook one of the sheets for my hankerchef , and this thing is the sheet , but do n't menshun it , cos it 'll make the stok jump a foot . ' " ' Good mornin ' , Mr. Perkins , wenever I run short of lies I 'll call agen . ' " CHAPTER VIII . A CONVENSHUN OF THE DUDE DEMMERCRAZEY ,  --  A COUNTRY DELEGAIT.  --  THE EDITHER GETS NOMMERNATED FOR GOVERNOR , AND GEORGIE SMOKES A $15,000 SEGAR . There 's something to pay to-day , is wot the edither sed to the casheer tonite , wen I walked up to the desk for my $2 in munney and a bushell of gloryfycashun . Yes , it was to pay all day in town , cos there was a convenshun of the Dude Dem-mercrazey in the Grand Opera House , and the candydates had all the salloons leesed , and war busy servin out free wisky , like they 've got in O-i-o . Mr. Diry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country village ? Well , jist immagin a tall , leen , lank indyvidooal , with long hare , slouch hat , a knoes wot looked like it 'd been in collishun with a elderberrie pie , and a sute of cloes wot was bort wen old Father Adam 's wardrope of fig leeves was sold out by the Sherruf of Eden county . That is a kyrect pickter of them fellers whose hands is ichin to grab hold of the desternies and post-offisses of Amerika , and if you 'll take my advise you wo n't make no closer investi-gashun , lesn you 've got munney nuff to spare to set em up . The aldermen of the city passed a resurlushun closin up the front dores of the s'loons , cos they was frade if they was left open sumthin mite happin wot would hurt the reputashun of the partie in the common hurd wot do the votin . But then the delergates did n't mind circumventin a bildin , as long as they got a chanse , to circumvent sum hot stuf wen they got inside . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boss carpenter naled a lot of old seccund hand planks togethur , wot they called a platform . Then the onherabel members , got orful full of ' nthusyasm , cos the nommernashun for Guvner , was in order , jest then my chum jimmy , wots workin for the Districk Telergraf Corn-penny come in , and handed the Cheerman a despach , wot he red out loud . It sed : Nommernate Joe Gilley , for Guvner , and I 'll tap a barrel , Sammy Tilton . The thots of the barrl was too much for the assembelled multertude of the grate unwashed , and ther was quietness in the Hall , wile vishuns of wiskey baths , free lunch stands , and clene paper collars , past befor thir eyes . Then ther was a loud cheir , and Joe Gilley wos nommernated by acclamashun . The rest of the ticket was put on the slate , by order of John Kelley , and the delergates adjourned to the Buster offis , were the temperance edittur regaled em , with a demmyjohn of Appel Jack , wot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he lectured , on Proherbishun , in Hobokin . Wen the croud was cleered , Mr. Gilley arst me if I know 'd the boy wot brung the note . I told him he was my chum , and I 'd rote the despach for fun . Then he shook hands with me , and sed I was smarter ' an chane litenin ' , and I 'd get to be Preserdent sum day , cos I beet all the pollytishuns he ever know 'd at wirepulling . Then he thanked me , and give me a cuppel of segars , one for Jimmy and one for me , to call it square . We 're goin ' to save ' em til to-morrer after dinner , cos it tai n't offen boys , like us , get a chanse to smoke $15,000 dollar segars , and these muster cost that , cos the evenin ' papers says Mr. Gilley pade $30,000 for the nommernashun . He 's ben most everything but a demmycrat , but he says he guesses he can stummick there docktrins ' til he gets to Albany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ROS CONKLIN GIVES HIM SUM PRESERDENSHALL POINTERS , AND VANISHES WITH HIS BOTTEL . Yesterday was Sunday , so I did n't mak no entry , cos the corpse had n't climaxed . Jest as we was leavin the offis Saturday nite I heerd the city editur tell the purlitickal repertoriai liar that he wanted him to hunt up a purlitickal gost , cos the Buster culd n't afford to let a little one-horsed , two-for-a-cent daily , like the Times , have the monopolie of the etheriel spirit act , not by a numerous long site . Bout 10 ' clock in the evenin I saw the reporter passin our house , on his way to Trinity churchyard , so I run up stairs and borrered one of ma 's nite gownds and nite caps , wot she wares wen she 's ' mbracin morfeeus . Then I tuk a short-cut down to the seminery . I 'd jest got there , and was puttin the last touches to my gostley toilet , wen I seen the reporter comin in the gate . Wen he got purty neer up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unearthy like . Well , you 'd dide to see him drop his note book and get a fit of Hodeley 's shakin malaria . He was jest recoverin and gettin ready to vacate the premises wen I immertated the voice of the feller wot says the long prayers at Oshun grove camp meetin , and sez : " Young mortel noosepaper man , what warntedst thou , encroachin on the peece and quiet of our last restin place , with thy terrestriel note book ? " " In the name of John Kelley , the omnippetent boss of the New York Demmercrazey , who are you ? Speak ! " said the reporter . " Sinse you command me in the name of one of the gods , I will speak . See this brillyant plumage , " sed I , placin my hand where I sit down , " now covered from earthly vue . I am Stalwart Conklin , the stallwart of the Rerpublikan partie , doomed for a sertain time ( till ' 84 ) to strut arouad on the confines of the perlitickel arena , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , old boy , shake ! " sed the reporter , puttia out his baud and givia mine a urthly pull , soon as he found out he warnt talkin to no angel . " Who 's goin to be the coming President ? " " Lissen , and I 'll unfold a tail See yonder rooster , all bedecked in gold ? " sed I , pointin to the wether vein on top of the Tribune bildin . " Well , put your hand to it , and you 'll behold the man wot my in-flooence is going to carry to the Wite House . If you 've got eny spare change , put her up on Winnyfield Skot Hancock , and count Mr. Conklin in Secretarry of State , but do n't yer never giv it away , cos I 'm play in ' a dubbel game . Give us a suck of your bottel , and I 'll hie myself thitherward for my nitely game of pennie anty with Genral Grant , who alreddy is awaitin ' me behind yonder cloud of Havannah smoke . " " Hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sed the reporter , as I shoved the bottel in my pistil pocket , and disserpeered behind a toombstun . This mornin ' the intervue come out in the Buster , and the hull corpse of noosgathururs of the other papers is detaled in divishuns to wach all the semerneries in the hope of interviewin ' the gost of James G. Blame , and the demmercrazey is wilder with inthusiasm than they was after Fouracres got drownded in wiskey out in Oio . CHAPTER X. HE REPORTS A XERDENT WOT HAPPENED TO J. GOULD AND SETS ALL NEW YORK WILD .  --  XCITE-MENT IN WALL STREET .  --  JIMMY NERVOUS .  --  YOU CAN TELL THEM BY THE COMPANY THEY KEEPS . I never could see y peepel with good cents do n't xercise a little jugement wen they name their baby 's , so as fellus like me , wot is a young aspyrant for jurnerlistic ornhers , would n't git mixed up on ' em . Now the citie edittur told me if I ever hurd of any dog fites , or axydents , to report ' em , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mornin , bout 3 o'clock , we was woke up by a orfull loud poundin on the front dore . Pa thot it was burglers , jest as if they 'd nock at the dore if they wanted to cum in and steel . So ma had to go to the winder , and she found out it was Mrs. Gould , that 's my chum , Jimmie 's mother . She was cryin orful , and wanted ma to come over to her house , cos Jimmy had got the nitemare from etin too much minsepie , and fell outer bed , and she was frade he 'd brok his kneck , cos he had n't spok a wurd sinse . I seen I had a chanse to distinguish myself , so I put on my cloes and run down to the offis . Oll the editturs and reporthers had gone to bed , cos the paper was jest goin to press , so I told the foreman all bout the axerdent wot happinned to J. Gould . He got orful xcited , and sed I orter be promoted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the only paper wot would hav it , and then he got the paper reddy for 50,000 extra coppies . Wen I went down town after brake-fast I never seed such xcitement ; hundreds of peeple was at every street corner reedin ' the Buster and discussin ' probubillytees of a panic . The noose-boys was coinin ' money sellin ' our paper , singin ' out " All ' bout the axerdent , " and showin ' the peeple the Busters hedlines , wot red : " Terribel Calamyty ! J. Gould , the Ralerode King , Falls Outer Bed and Sustains Fatul Injuries . " The managers of the other noosepapers was orful mad , and maid all the citie reporters hand in their resignashuns , cos they was n't smart enuf to each the item . Down in Wall strete there was a reglar pannick . The Beers was jest as happy as they culd be , and most all of ' em maid there fortunes before dinner , cos all the stock went down like led . Jest wen a lot of the bulls was goin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the dollar , who should walk inter the Xchange but J. Gould himself . You never seen such a surprised crowd enyw'ere ; they all thot it was his gost till he ' xplayned that it war n't him wot fell outer bed a tail He sed he know 'd he was purty late gettin ' down town , but they must ' xcuse him , cos he was kep up purty late , calkin ' up a cask of " Western Union Water " wot sprung a leek . The ' xcitement 's beginnin ' to ware off now , but you bet the Buster 's got a big lot of free advertising and Mr. Giliey war n't a bit mad , wen I ' xplained how it all happened , cos the Wall strete beers is goin ' to s'port him for Guv'ner , cos the Buster 's made ' em all wrich . Jimmie 's allrite agin ; he was only stunned , and he got out of bed in time to get down to the telegraf offis . I feel orful proud of my chum now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . You see now , Mr. Diry , wot a boy makes of hisself when he ' sociates with a risin ' yung jurnerlist , like yours trooly , Georgie . CHAPTER XI . IN THE ROLE OF DRAMATICK CRITTICK.  --  " HOSIERY HENRYETTUR , OR A BOOM IN FANCY GOODS . "  --  THE HAPPY DENEWMENT . I did n't write nothin in you last nite , Mr. Diry , cos me and Maria  --  that 's my gal  --  was takin in the furst nite at the theatur . Jest wen I was lee vin the offis the edittur called me aside and arst me if I thot I was capabel to report the furst performance of " Hosiery Henryettur , or A Boom in Fancy Goods , " cos the dramattick edit-tur had gone and got mashed on the latest perfesshunal buty from Cleveland , and war n't fit for duty . I sez : " You becher sweet neck , I can . " So he give me a cupple of " comps " and a led nickle for to buy candie and peenuts with . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloes , and went round and wated wile my gal was puttin on her bandyline and rubbin her face with a red sawcer wot she sez she uses for newralgy . You bet , this devil felt proud , promerinardin his gal down the ile to the front orchestrey chares , wots reserved for us rep-rysentatives of the metrypollyton press . I got out my note-book and pencil , and me and Maria ete candie , talked sweet , and wated developments . I 'll pass over the prolog , and giv you the report jest as it was printed in this mornin 's Buster : " Last evenin , the curtin , in Niblo 's theattur , rose to a large , appreshiativ , and bald-hedded audiense wot sit in the orkerstry cheers . " The play wot come on the staige for the furst time in ' Merica was ' ntitled ' Hosiery Henryettur , or A Boom in Fancy Goods . ' The plot was novel , romantik , and excrushiatingly interestin . The principal charackters is Henryettur , a assthetick young ladie , dorter of a Fillydelphy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wot wares a eye glass and carries a gold plaited kane , wot he chews sted of terfaackky , cos his nerves is week . Henryettur is orful sick ' bout Gussy , and wuld giv her lock of Horsecar Wild 's hare , wot she carrys in her bussum , if Gussy would ony tumbel and marry her . But Gussy would n't tumbel if the hull of Broadway 'd fall on him , cos he 's mashed on a lot of dudines wot do the balleyin act in the academme . The furst act was very utter , in fact too utterly utter for utteranse . The scenery was grandly sublime , bein a combynashun of sunflours and Baltymore oysters , wot are sed to be very assthetick . The seccund scene is more commonplase , cos it reprysents a green room of a theat-tur with the artists sittin round a tabel , makin a supper off of Boston baked beens and shampain sawse . Gussy ' pares in the background and givs the gals $5 to danse a bally for his own speshell benerfit . Then they all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they b'long to the femail econymist persuashun , cos they all ' pared to be very eccornomical in goods wen they maid there skurts , or else they got there dresses wet , cos they 've shrunk way up ' bove their nees , and way down b'low there necks . The clerk wot sold ' em there stockins must of warrented them to wash , cos there all colors , and there bout the only part of there does wots anyways long . The dan-cin ' part of the performanse did n't ' pare to be much appreshyated by the older porshun of the audiense , cos they shaded their eyes with their opera glasses and blushed on the top of there heds , were there hare used to grow . The gals then go thru a lot of moshuns , dansin the racket , and Gussy sets ' em up . " The furst scene of Act III . is in Henryettur 's privat boodywar . She walks round , holdin a big sunflower in her hand , and calls it to witness that if her dare Gussy do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the tender thred wot holds her to this mundain spere will soon cum to a too utterly utter , suddint round turn . Then she whispers sumthin to herself , and jumps bout a foot , and xclaims , in a anty-assthetik voice : ' I will do it ! By the misterious hare , hidden in the opake depths of 10-cent-a-plate ice-creme , I will do it ! ' " The scene then changes to a rehursal in the theattur , with Gussy looking at the bailey . All on a suddint a gal comes dancin out on tip-toes and movin her hands round like she was playin ' skippin ' - the- rope . Her close is purty , ony they 're a good deal more shrunken than wot the other gals had on , and her lower xtremer-ties look like she was smugglin ' cotton from New Orleans . Gussy then gets mashed on her rite away , and she do n't ' pare to mind it a bit , cos she sot rite down on his knee , and they begun a-talkin ' awful soft . Purty soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pin inter her stockins . Then he reckernized her as Henryettur , and the bailey bring on the happey denewment act , by balleyin ' round wile Gussy and Henryettur ' mbrace and kiss each other , and the property man lifts up his hands and sez : " Henryettur , you had better Go put on your cloesietter , Cos you are too utter utter , Drest all in your hosieryetter ; Gussy , you must let her , let her , And I 'm sure you 'll like her better Wen you 've settur , settur , settur , And we 've drunk to your dudetter . " CHAPTER XII . A OLD BILL .  --  THE EDITTUR GETS A FORTUNE FROM OSSTRAILYER.  --  SAMANTHY LONGTUNG AS THE BLUSHING BRIDE EXPECTENT.  --  THE END JESTERFIES THE MEENS . The edittur was lookin outer the winder this mornin , wen , who should he spie cummin up the offis steps , but Miss Samanthy Longtung , that 's my Sundy skule teecher , wots sweet forty and ai nt never had a mash . He sed , he guessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd hav to stand her off , cos she 'd cum to collect the quarter , wot he 'd forgot to pay , wen he eat that plate of injy-rubber oyster supe at the church festival , bout a yere ago . Wen Miss Longtung cum in , she reck-ernized me , and congratulated me on enterin such a onherabel perfesshun . Then she kissed me rite on the mouth , and sed , she wished I was growd up to be a big man . Then she asst me if Mr. Gilley was in , and wen I told her " no , " she sed she was orful sorry , cos she 'd cum to collect a littel bill , wot she 's gone responsibel for , and wot was purty neer dew . I told her I was sure Mr. Gilley would be orful sorry , wen he cum back and found she 'd ben to see him , cos I 'd hurd him say , he thot she was the purtist yung ladie , he knowd , n town , and of all wimmin , she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife . She sez , " Do tell , Georgie , " and then she kissed and hugged me , all over , and asst me how long the edittur would be gone . I seen she was warntin to kno too much &amp; wuldnt stan off wuth a cent . So I told her that Mr. Gilley wuldnt get back til nite , cos he was up to his turney 's , arrangin bout gettin the big fortune wot his uncle , wot dide in Osstrailyer , had left to him . " The poor dare man , " sez she ; " did nt I alwus tell them yung snips of gurls at sewin circles that Mr. Gilley 'd be welthy sum day , I guess they wo n't turn up their knoeses and call me a dride up old made , when Samanthy Longtung turns inter Samanthy Gilley . I alwus knowd I 'd be married fore I got outer my teens , and to think my darlin Joe was too onherable and bashful to ask my hand fore he got his fortune . But I spose he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a poor man , wen so menny welthy suters wus round , " Then she hugged me agin , &amp; told me to tell Mr. Gilley never to mind bout that quarter , cos she 'd advance it outer her own pocket . Seein she was so orful kind , I told her all bout the fortune ; how Mr. Gilley 's uncle was sent out ter rustercate in Bottany Bey by the British Guvment , but the barmy breezes of the bey did nt agree with his constetushun , so he resined and took a boat for a nuther ileland , &amp; wen he got there he borrud sum sheep from a farmer , &amp; them sheep got marreed , &amp; then there was a lot of littel sheep , wen they growd up and got married , and kep the ball rollin ' even to the 3d &amp; 4th generashun , wen the old man dide . And now Mr. Gilley was goin to hav them aucshunned off , &amp; he thot he 'd get bout half a millyun for em . Then I show 'd her the plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is keepin for refrence , in case he 's called on to boom Mr. Tilden for Preserdent , and told her them was the plans of the reserdense wot Mr. Gilley was goin to hav bilt to take his blushin bride too , after they got back from a Yuropeean hunney-moon . Then I maid her promis faithfully that she wouldnt tell a sole bout the fortune &amp; manshun , cos the Edittur of the Buster was the maudestest man in New York city . The Jesuites used to say that " The end alwus justerfies the meens . " Sum of the old Rode Ileland Purytans may say I 'm a liar , but I do n't agree with em , cos I 've maid too peepel happy . Samanthy Longtung is radient , cos she walked up the strete like she was tredin on air . And Mr. Gilley acts like he 'd unloded a hull team full of pig led oflfen his mind , cos he knoes Samanthy 'll have the noose of the fortune all over town ' fore nite , and then he 'll be abel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for wotever he warnts , for a hull yare to cum . He told me , wen I was cummin home , that I was a born diplermatist , &amp; ort to hire myself out to King Alfonso , of Spain , in case he 'd get insulted agin . CHAPTER XIII . TRAVERLIN IN STILE .  --  GRAND RECEPSHUNS AND BABY KISSIN MATTYNAYS.  --  MISTAKEN FOR HIS AXERDENSY.  --  A DEDLEY STATE . 6 p. m. , Troy , N. Y. Mr. Diry : You will notis by the above address , that you and me are away from home to-nite , and I spose you orter have sum xplenashun of our doins . Well , wen I got down to the offis this mornin , Mr. Gilley told me to go rite home and put on my Sunday cloes , and be reddy to start for Troy on the leven clock trane , cos we was goin to opin up the campane there , and he wanted me to carry his sachell , wot had a demmy-John in . Wen I got back , Gilley was orful busy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fixin the rate per caperta wot was to be bid for votes . Wen we got to the depot , Vanderbuilt had had one of his spells , and had been sendin the publick to Haydies , so he wuld n't let the trane wate ten minnits for a guvmentel candy date . Mr. Gilley was in an orful way bout gettin left , cos he had to be at Troy to-nite , and there warnt no other trane wot would get us there , so he pade a feerful big pile of munney for a speshell . President Arthur , and a lot of other Republercan dudes was goin to start for Bufflo on a fishin xcurshun at 1 o'clock , so our train got under way rite off , and every other trane on the rode was sidetracked to let us get past . There was a norful crowd at every sta-shun , wot had cum from miles round , to see us distingushed cityzens . We stopped at Yungkurs to water . The town has got a orful apropriate name , judgin by the way the mothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do nt care nothin for baby 's enyway , but I had to submit to a lot of slobberin for the sake of inflooensin votes , for my Candydate . At Fishkill we stopped for refreshments , and was waited on by a brass band and the Mayor and more baby 's . Mr. Gilley spoke a few wurds and thanked the crowd for their curtesies , and named a few babies . Jest as we was steemin outer the depot , he dropt his red bandanner handkerchef ; you 'd dide to see them yung gals tumbel over each other and scrambel for it . Before they got it , it was tore all up , in little bits , and most every gal wot got a peece , unbuttoned there jerseys , and stowed it way in there bussums . Fishkill , like Yungcurs , has got a purty good name , cos it emits a perfume , very surgestive of cleenin fish , wot was fresh wen Preserdent Buckannon was inaugerated . Mr. Gilley was feelin orful proud of his recepshuns , all long the line , &amp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out that the peepel took him for Preserdent Arthur . Then he got orful indignant , &amp; made the air of the cur smell like condensed sulfur gas , the way he swared . He sez his xperience of unkindnesses has been purty big in his lifetime , but that the peepel of New York State shuld take him for his Axerdensy was the gol durndest unkindest cut of all , and he 'd be struck by litenin , with a asse 's jaw , if he did n't make the furst barber he seen shave them leg-a-mutton sidebords clene off , cos they was bringin his bald hed inter disgrace . Wen we got to Troy we was met by the Centril Committee , and druv round to all the salloons , so as we 'd see all the sites , &amp; set em up for the crowd . I heer the band pleyin " See the conqrin hearo comes . " I guess the populace is waitin for me , so I 'll have to stop ritin now . CHAPTER XIV . IMMENSE NTHUSIASM.  --  SUM POINTERS ON THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CAST OFF .  --  THE FALLEN GRATE . My bussum swells to-nite with pride cos we 've tuk the town by storm . If peepel warnt all Demmycrats before , they is now , cos our speechyfyin has struck in purty deep . The meetin was a grand suckcess fizzically , morally , numerrically , and , I guess , votingly . From the furst , we pollytishuns was received with a perfect ovashun . Chair after chair rended the air , and the seen was only comparable to the nitely concerts of the tommas cats and there parrymores on the back fences of 42d street . The silence was so grate you culd of hurd a dudine smile , wen Mr. Gilley , in answer to a request to say sumthin bout the tariff , sed : " Gentlemen and other Demmercrats , I regret very much that I can not axceed to your request to menshun that all important questshun , the tariff . My hart is reddy to bust with greef wen I think how menney of you listened last Thursday nite to that Republercan demmygog , John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a hotel in New York the other day . Sum one axed him if he 'd sed enything in his Troy speech bout the tariff . ' Yes , ' sed he , ' I fed them durn country gallutes with tariff taffy til they was runnin over . ' I shall refrane from sayin enythin more on the subject , cos you want to let your stummacks settel again fore you take a nuther emettick . " Mr. Gilley finished up his speech , by pointin to the glorious victory in Oio , and urgin the dem-mercrazey to " wurk , wurk , for the day is at hand . Look at Oio . A Republican legislatur begat a baby , &amp; it called it Seccund Amendment Propersishun , it put it up , for the admirashun of the peepel . The demmercrazy had a baby also , it was cristened Wiskey , it grew fat , saucy , &amp; popular . Seccund Amendment Propersishun appared to hav ben a littel too previous , wen it come round , &amp; grew to be a littel , puney , sickley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wouldnt she have hired a wet nurse ? Did the Republican mother do this ? No , gentlemen , not by a long shot she did n't ! She got ashamed of the baby , &amp; abandoned it at the dores of the wimmin of Oio , leavin it to them , to bring up on the bottel . This was not all , gentlemen , the hartless mother got jellus , &amp; tride to steel littel Wiskey . But the grate buxom , german frawleen , wot he had for nuss , couldnt see it a tall . Too much bottel . Too much W. C. T. U. soothin sirrup , &amp; too many wimmin , killed the poor littel cast off , Seccund Amendment Propersishun , and the remanes was berried last Tuesday . Littel Wiskey is growin to be a big &amp; lazy boy , mother &amp; father doin well . " This was too much for the crowd ' cos they got wild with nthusyasm , &amp; shoved us in a carriage , &amp; hauled us all over Troy . The luv I bare the grand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tempts me to pass over , the grand finale of todays proceedins . But my dutie as a chronickler of actooal events , compels me to menshun the fact that after our late drive tonite , the select sircle of pollytishuns , partuk of a banquet , and becom so full of grattytude , sour mash , and old borbon prinsipels , that they are now , down stares , humbly bitin ' the dust of the dinin room flure , and confessin there mannyfold sins , &amp; trespasses , to the open and obligin eers , of half a dozen nickel plated cusspy-dores . CHAPTER XV . IN A TROY HOTEL .  --   --  GRAND REVUE AND MILLYTARY DEMONSTRASHUN.  --  THE ATTAK OF THE LEEGUNS.  --  HOLESALE DETH AND CONFUSHUN.  --  THE RECALL . I feel most too tired to rite in you tonite , Mr. Diry , but I guess I 'll tell you wot made me feel so xerted . After the meetin and banquet was over last nite , the cullured gentelman , wot was in attendanse , at the hotel , ushered me up to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I CREP OUTER BED AND LIT THE GAS . I got off my cloes &amp; jumped inter bed , as quick as possibel , cos I was purty well used up . i 'd jest got inter a sleep , &amp; was dreemin I was a candydate for Preserdent , on the no-nuthin platform , with Benny Butler hung on the tail of the ticket , wen I was woke up by feelin sumthin like a lectric shock creepin over me . I begun to get scared , cos I felt like I was gettin the seven yares ich , so I crep outer bed &amp; lit the gas . On xammenashun I found a feerful lot of little wite lumps all over my bodie . Then I looked at the sheets , &amp; a grande site was presented to my vishun . There on a littel knoll , of the fether bed , stood the commander-in-chief , surrounded by his staff , issuin orders . Grouped all round , in regyments , divishuns , &amp; briggades , were comanys of privats in their full dress parade unyform of scarlet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ band struck up the Nashunal anthem of :  --  " Bite , Brother , bite with keer And do your dutie as a bed buggeer . " The processhun was the most imposin I ever seen . The entire time taken in passin a given point was two hours and ten min-nits . At eggsactly 2:20 a.m. , the army formed in a holler square , with the officers in the middel . The high priest then passed round them , skatterin insense all over the soldjers , and xhortin them to stand firm , cos vick-torie , glory &amp; spoils was rite within there reech . Then he skattered sum more insense , wot smelt wuss than limbugger cheese , all over them . By this time it was 3 a. m. , and I was gettin sumwhat nervus and cold , in my abbreevyated costume , my mercyfull disposishun and other considerations restrayned me from dealin out holesale slorter to the enemy . Wile I was tryin to devise meens to recapture my fortress , without incurrin the risk of a eppydemick , I seen the army form , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bein ordered to scale the walls and take a posishun on the ceelin . The other four divishuns to assume the offensive , and attack me simultaneously on my flanks . Alas for me , too soon , I seen , my mercy had ben illtimed , nothin was left me but to make hasty preperashuns for the defense . Quickly I grabbed the wash basin , and slop bole , and placed each under a leg of my chare . There was nuthin else in the room , wot I cud use for a mote , in despyration I seized a copy of the New York Sun , Presbyteeryan Banner , and a book ' ntitled " Biblikal Reesons Why . " Placin the Sun and " Biblikal Reesons Why , " under the remainin unprotected legs of my chare , and holdin the Presbyteeryan Banner over my bed with a feendish laff , I mounted my fortyfour cashun , and awated the attack . The corps on the seelin , under Genral Bludsucker , was ordered to take the inishiativ . Formin in a compact falanx , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leep , landing rite in the middle of my defense . Poor fellows ! they met the fate of many others . Miscalculate the distance they had fallen upon the Funny collum of the Presbyteeryan Banner , and its well known soporiffic effects completely overcom them . Seein the discomfertufe of the Bludsuckers command Genral Robeson advanced , on the dubbel quick , over my N.Y . Sun barrycade .

He immejiately sounded the retreet . Biblical Reasons Why was too much for him , and he did not feel like crossin the kasm , and exposin his men to more numerus and hotter perrils . A counsil of war was then held , and it was decided to get the forces all together , and make one determined effort , to capture my fortress from the see . A half burnt mach was obtained , and a company of soldjers embarked upon it . The ma-sheenary of the transport must of giv out , cos the bote became unmanageable , and its livin freight , seein there hopeless condish-un , joined in singin ' , " We 're goin down to Glory . " By this time , the sun streemin thru the cracks of the curtin , warned the survivors of the approch of day , and a genral recall was sounded , and the entire force retreeted to there impenetrabel fortresses in the cracks of the bedsted , leavin me completely master of the situashun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelin sum wot tired after such a xperiense , and a tedjus ride down from Troy ?

HE REPORTS A DRY GOODS OPENIN.  --  A XPENSIV KOSTUM WOT FINDS ITS WAY TO THE STABLISHMENT OF A JURNULISTICK MILLYUN-HAIR.  --  FEMMERNINE FEMMERNINITY 'S , WITH MICE AS APPENDAGES.  --  THE NEET THING IN A HAT . To-day was the grand openin' of fall and winter stiles at all the big Dry Goods and Millernery stores . Clara Bell , wot does up that bisness for the Buster had gone and got completely brok up on a 50 dollar bonnet , wot she sed was the cutest little thing she ever seen , so she had to go rite up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ munny outer her old bachler unkel , wot dotes on her . Mr. Gilley wuld of discharged her ony he 'd forgot to pay her sellary up in full for the last six months , so he had to make the best of it , and send me out ter report it in her place . The followin ' is wot 'll appear in termorrer mornin 's Buster : " The first place our repraysentertiv peramberlated hisself to was Lords &amp; Tailor 's . He was met at the dore by a aggressiv dude , to hoom he persented his paist-bord , and who immejeatly put him in charge of a demminutiv casheer , wot scorted him to the maid-up soot department . This department was feerfully crowded with ladies , wot were passin complerments on the dresses . " The most expensiv soot on exherbishun was ' mported from Paris , and is maid with a red and green pettycote , bilt up together so as it 'd look like a checkherbord . Over this pettycote , and runnin down the back , from the waste , in underlatin hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cheep , two-for-a-cent metrypollytan jurnals , was a skie blu sattin coursage , with a long trane , The front of the skurt was composed of a lot of curlykues , suspended from the sides , louped up in the middle , and maid of illushunairy stuff , so you culd see the pettycote . The hull bisness was blowd up like the upper half of a belloon , ony a little more so . Over all this was a pollynays , with panyers xtendin from the neck , down to the waste line and maid titer'an durnashun . " This kostume is the creashun of Wurth , the maskerline millerner , and cost 5 thousand dollars . It was ' mported xpressley for the wife of a up town plummer , but since she sent on her messures , she 's been living so high that the steem derrick , wot she bort a purpose , has utterly failed to lace her korsets tite enuf for her to get inter the dress . Wile our representertiv was present , the kostume was purchased by the wife of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars cash . " A sweeter'an-a-peech littel dudine , informed us , in reply to our questshuns , that jurseys , would be worn dubbel brested behind . That the regulashun bussel wuld containe at least six New York Heralds , covered over with a Texas Siftins , for the bennyfit of the occupants of the church pue , in the reer of the warer . That crin-nylines wuld average 4 feet , six inches , in diameter , and wuld be pervided with the new anti-ankel-xposin spiral springs . That basks wuld be cut very low , and filled in with gripher lace . That corsets wuld be pervided with rachets and set screws , to nabel them to be drawn more titely round the waste . That owin to the relertiv cheepness of wool , and its qualerty of xpandin , sted of shrinkin , it wuld ntirely tak the place of cotton as a indyspenserble adjunct in making up the fashuneebel wimmin . In reply to our inquisertiv reporters last query , the young ladie blushed way up b'hind her eers , and xclamed : ' Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flutin wil allwas remane in stile ? ' " The hoseery department had n't opened up wen our reporter called , but he was allowed to inspect it . It is in charge of clurks of the male persuashun , cos there sposed to kno better than gurls wot 'd look best on the fare purchasers of these indys-penserbel artikels of femmynine apparal . The latest noveltie reprysents a littel mouse , wots crawled bout half way up , and got stuck . " They are in all cullers , and are desined for weerin in wet &amp; slushy wether . The 're called ' Good Xcuse ' Stockins , cos they giv the blushin weerer a good xcuse , for not gettin her skurts wet &amp; muddy . The mouse looks orful naturel , and sum of these days , we 'll heer of sum gallant corndocktor of the Ell R.

" The neet thing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ velvit , surmounted by a derminutiv Tommas cat , wots got his back up , and his tale runnin down the lady 's neck . It costs a hundred &amp; fifty dollars , &amp; the lady 's , all say its too sweet for anything . " Wimmin 's logic is curius enyway . If there all mashed , so bad , on Tommas cats , Y , in the name of Pennylope Pennyfether , do nt they sit up sum moonlite nite , at a back winder , armed with a dubbel barrel shot gun , &amp; slugs ? Then they 'd get a durn site more'an they 'd use in a hull lifetime . This would ' pare to be more senser-abel than payin Lords &amp; Tailor 's 150 dollars for a little insignifercant kitten , wot ai nt cut his eye teeth yet . " CHAPTER XVII . DUMMIE " ADS "  --  WARNTED , A WIFE , BY THE RELIGUS EDDITUR.  --  THE CLIMAX .  --  BABYS , BABYS EVERYWERE.  --  A HORRID RECH.  --  EXPLERNASHUNS AND PACIFERCASHUNS , WITH A TWENTY-FIVE CENTER AS DESERT . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them wot did nt cum down much hav ben usin all sorts of skeems to keep up their circulashuns , so yesterday Mr. Gilley desided to run a cuppel of collums of free wanted advertisin . To start the ball a rollin , he maid me rite off a lot of dummie wants . I put in most everything I culd think of , from the soft and luvin pursernel to the big &amp; clumsy steem engine . Wen I got down to the oflfis this mornin there was a orful crowd of wimmin on Park Row , all ranged along the edge of the pavement , with bout a hundred extra purlice keepin them in singel file . I could n't for the life of me imagine wot was up , till I went up steers and seen the per-sesshun filin in and out the religus edittur 's offis dores . Then I remembered the advertisement I rote , wot red like this : " Warnted , a rotund , bucksom , good-lookin and good-natured madin , suiterbel for a wife . One wot knowes enuf to put on stile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offis , to the religus edittur . " Now , our religus edittur is purty sweet on wimmin enyway , so he tuk it all in good part , and kissed and hugged every one of em , tellin em he 'd let em kno by letter , wen he 'd made his choice . They kep swarmin in all the mornin , til you 'd thot all the wimmin in New York was warntin a man . Bout 11 o'clock we all notissed sumthing shut out the lite of the doreway , purty soon it turn 'd round and cum in sideways and sung out , " Oh , were ! Oh , were ! is the bloomin boy wot warnts a rotund , buxom madin for his wife ? " Then we all tumbeled that she was the Bowry Museum fat woman , so I pointed to the Religus Edittur . Then she grabbed him up in her arms , and squeezed him , till you could heer his ribs snappin . Wen he got black in the face she thot she 'd made a mistake , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remembered it was gettin on towards dinner time . At the dore of the offis I met the quire singer in the little Church Round the Corner , wot the Religus Edittur 's ngaged to , and she tole me to tell him he was a horrid rech , and she was goin to sue him for breech of promis , so she was . On my way hum to dinner , the manergin edittur overtuk me , and laffed and sed that was a purty good joke I 'd fixed up on the religus edittur . I told him I did nt meen nothin by it enyway , cos I did nt xpect eny gurl 'd think he was good lookin enuf to marry him . Now our mannergin edittur jest got marreed last week , and hee 's bordin at the Metrypollytan hotel . Just fore we got there he giv me a ten-center , and sed , thats for the laff him and his wife 'd hav wen he tole her bout the joke . I guess he got all the laffin he wanted , cos he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every man , woman , and child run up to him , and tride to giv him a baby , wot they sed was his . Baby 's was lyin round permiskusly , all over the desks , floors , and barroom . The rooms , up stairs , was chock full of baby 's . Xtra cots was lade out in the halls , and every cot , had half a dozen baby 's on to it , and every baby had a card pinned on its does , wot red :  --  Tom Wilson , Susie Wilson , Paddy Wilson , Biddy Wilson , and every Wilson you could think of . Eight pages of the reges-ter was filled with there names , and every page was hedded with the Editturs own name , John Wilson , Father . Wen he got to his own room , he found his wife cryin , lik her heart was brok . Soon as she cot site of him she let out a shreek wot brot everybody in the hotel to there room , and sung out : " John Wilson youre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , youre a inferrnus skoundrel . Take me back to my mama , rite away , and if youve got a spark of manhood about you , you 'll go and make wot little restertushin you can , to the mothers of these wurse than orfans . " Quicker'an litenin , Mr. Wilson tumbelled , and laffin a fiendish grin , he sung out in axcents wild : " Get me a Gatlin Gun , and lode it down to the mussle with thirty-leven charges of dannymite , and let me get a shot , at that incorragerbel imp of Haydes , the Buster 's Devil . " Then carmin down a littel , he took this mornins paper outen his pocket and red out loud to the crowd : " Wanted ; a fine , helthy infant for adopshun . No questshuns ast . Leeve it at the Metrypolytan hotel for John Wilson , mannergin edittur Daily Buster . " This put everybody in good humer agen , and , after settin up the drinks for the crowd , Mr. and Mrs. Wilson went out to the country to hire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby 's till homes culd be secured for ' em . I guess him and his wife 's sickened on baby 's enyway , cos I hurd him tellin the hotel clurk that they 'd had all the baby 's round them that they 'd ever have , by gumbo . And now , Mr. Diry , I must close for to-nite , cos I 've got to smoke the 25-center wot the religus edittur giv me for the laff he 'd had outer my joke on Mr. Wilson . CHAPTER XVIII . AT THE MASQUE BALL .  --  FRIVERLUS FIXINS.  --  A PARISIEN GREASETTE , WOT MASHED THE MASKULINE CHARACKTERS.  --  MR . GILLEY COT IN HER TOILS .  --  THE DEVIL IT IS . Last nite Mr. Gilley giv me a invyta-shun to the fancy masque ball , wot all New York 's ben torkin bout for the last six weaks . It was to be a toney affaire , so wen I got hum I went all thru my wardrobe , but culd n't find nothin fancyer than the cloes I wore wen I painted the back fense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they was hardly prackterkel , cos there was a feint oder of cows &amp; horses clingin to them wot the heet of the ball room mite develop in a way wot wuld n't be satisfacktorie to myself or the delercate knoeses of the other aristocrazey present . Illustration : IT WAS ONY THE WURK OF A MINNIT TO PRY OPEN THE LID So I put em away with a sy , and had jest bout maid up my mind that the other ballers wuld n't be treeted to my distingushed presense , wen I remembered the box of cloes wot our dinin room gal , wot was purty fly , left , wen she loped with the buggler , &amp; all ma 's silver spoons . It was ony the wurk of a minnit to pry open the lid , and a dazzlin array of butyful &amp; fancy does met my vishun . Then I shed all my things and commensed the arduus wurk of dressin . I say arduus , cos it was parrylisin , discom-fertin , &amp; puzzlin . I useter wonder y ma tuk so long to dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swarin and hurryin her up . Now , I wunder no longer cos I kno how t is myself , and after my own xperiense in pins , buttins , strings , laces , garters , and things , I shall ever look upon wimmin as martirs . The dress was jest short enuf to show my blu striped silk stockins , and bout two inshes of mbroidery . The stock-ins was a littel too big , so I had to fill em up with hankercheefs . The waste jest but-tened up on me , at the waste line , but it tuk half a dozen piller cases , and a cuppel of sheets , to stuff the upper part of the front . I had to put a reef in crinny line , cos it showd , and it tuk ma 's pach-wurk quilt to mak my bussel big enuf for stile . Wen I was all thru dressin , I looked like a Fifth avenue daysy , every particle of my dress was complete , only I culdnt set down very maudestly , cos my hoops was too wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maid a masque for me , and sed I was a true-ter-life Parisien greassette . Soon as I got in the ball-room , every maskerline carackter got mashed on me , and warnted me for a partner . Every one I dansed with treeted me to ice creme and carrymels , and I guess , I ete supper bout seventeen times , in fact I ete so much , that a terrebel strane round my waste , warned that if I indulged my appytite eny more , a feerful catastrofy , was lierbel to take place . Bout two o'clock I begun to get tired , &amp; warnted to go home , but my partner , wot was Mr. Gilley , drest in the costum wot he sent me down to Ike Israel 's on Chattam Strete , to hire for him , and wot the Jue sed , reprysented Tom Okiltree a Texas Briggand , promissed to get a carrage , and driv me home , if I 'd stay till three . I was ' greed , so I dansed three or four more sets with him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrage , &amp; told the driver to drive orful slow , cos he was frade the moshun of the carrage 'd have a bad effect on my nerves . Soon as we got started he tuk me on his knee , &amp; got to huggin me round the piller slips &amp; sheets and kissin my left eer , and gettin otherwise fermillyer , so I seen the moment had cum for me to be myself , so I lifted up my masque . Soon as he cot site of my face he xclaimed : " Oh ! the Devil ! " " Yes , Sir , " sez I , " t is the Devil . " Then , tellin the driver to stop the horses , he lifted up his foot and gin me a kick wot landed rite on ma 's pachwurk quilt , and sed : " Go to the devil . " I guess he 's mad at me , only he purtends not to be , but that 's put on , cos he 's frade I 'll gin the hull thing away , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on him . The sosighety edittur 's report in this mornins Buster says : " The Parisien Greasette was conseeded by everybody present to take the onhers of belle of the ball . The knowin ones claim that it was Miss Ellen Terrier , the latest artistick importashun from England , and that Mr. Vandybilt , as the Texas brig-gand , seen her home . If this is a fact , there 'll likely be sum domestick thunder flyin round in a uptown manshun . " CHAPTER XIX . THE HORSE REPORTER WANTS A COMPAGNON DE VOYAGE .  --  THE STRAPPIN YUNG WIDDER , WOT AI N'T ON THE MASH .  --  SWEET-FORTY MAKES A NUTHER MINNYSTEERIAL SKANDAL . Our horse reporter is a reglar wimmin hater , and he 'd walk round a hull blok , fore he 'd meet a gal , wat 'd try to flert with him . I guess he 's a grass widder that used to hav a woman , wot maid him tow a chock line , and he ai nt never got no divorse from her yet . His affeckshuns is all lavished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for one of them , than he wuld for Lillie Lan-kry or the hull curboodel of perfesshunal buties . I alwus did think it was a pitty , for a good lookin man like him , not to hav sum wimmin , wot was brakin there harts , and everything for him , so this mornin I sent out notes to a cuppel of gals , wot I thot was warntin to get mashed , tellin them to call at the Buster offis , &amp; ast for the Horse Reporter , ' cos he was ded struk on them , and warnted there compinny , on a trip to Boston tonite . Bout one ' clock , a grate stout woman , wot looked like a reglar bruisir , cum inter the offis and enquired for the Horse Reporter . I show 'd her into his room , and shut the dore , just enuf so as I could see all wot went on . " Air yer the spalpeen , wot calls hisself the Maire Reporter ? sez she . " I am the horse reporter , madame . Has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got the glanders , yer inserlent puppie , is that fhat yer say ? Me ma wots ben neeth the old sod fer ten yers . Do n't cast any miscomplementry reflecshuns , yung man , on my ma wot dide of anty-consumpshun , or I 'll plant the fore end of me toe nales forninst the pit of yer stummick in a way wot 'll mak yer feel like a he muel had bruk loose . Air yer the in-dyvidooal wot sent me this invytashun ? ' sed she , handin the reporter the note . " I assure you , madam , " sez he , " there must be some mistak , cos I did n't never rite this note . " " Yees did n't , yer rech ; is that the way your after crawlin outer it , after try in to ruin a respectibel widdy like meself ? Praps yer do n't think I 'm good lookin enuf for yer , yer babby-faced , downey-lipped , banged-haired , slim-legged , tite-laced , corset-cased , monkey-taled sun of a noospaper doode . If my Pat was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tride to mash a yung widdy like meself , moind that now , will yer ! " She had n't hardly got outer the door wen a tall , lone , lank maidin , wot had seen bout forty sommers and too numerous to menshun winters , cum salin in , with a slitely ellyvated skurt wot exposed to vue a couple of wite and blue shafts wot might have been pipe-stems if they had n't bin her ankels . Bowin sweetly to the law reporter , she requested to be shown into the horse reporter 's offis . Soon as I 'd showd her in she tuk a chare , wot was purty close to the Horse Reporters , &amp; sed to him : " Here I am Georgie , dere . I do feel so nurvus , you kno . I 'm so very yung and inexperienced , and my ma sez a yung and innocent gal lik me ortent to trust myself to go to Boston with a man . But then , Georgie dere , you do nt look one bit norty . Wont we have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kissed him rite on his mouth , and blushed wen she sed , " Do n't Georgie , yer orternter kiss me till we 're better aquainted . " Kissing him agen she sot rite down on his knee , and ex-clamed , in a horryfied tone : " You horrid , norty boy , if yer do that again , I 'll strik you with a fether , reel hard , so I will . " All this time the horse reporter was the pikter of despare . Suddenly espying a up town divine waitin for the Manergin Edit-tur , in the room opposite , he sed : " My dere madam , your sweetness is all waisted on me , cos I 'm a marreed man , wot had twins last nite . See , in yonder room , is the Horse Reporter , the man youre looking for . " By the time she was on the preechers nee , and was goin thru the kissing per-formanse , the Horse Reporter had the hull staff , lookin thru the half opened dore , and the fust day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one all reddy , bout the minnysteer kissin the madin of forty . CHAPTER XX . THE DEVIL IN CHURCH .  --  A TERRIFICK . XPLOSHUN , AND FLYIN DEBRIS GIVES MR . TALMIG A XCELLENT SUBJECT .  --  FASHUN AND STILE OF LONG AGO .  --  GET THE BEHIND ME SATAN . Today is Sunday . I kno I ortenter rite in you today Mr. Diry , but , as I 've had to rite up a serio commick , religus report , I do nt see no big objeckshun ter givin it ter you . Urley this mornin , the Religus edittur called up to our house , and sed he 'd giv me a quarter , if I 'd go over to Brooklin sted of him , and report a surmon , cos he warnted to go to the little church round the corner , and make it up with the quire singer , wot was goin to sue him for breech of promise . I was ' greed so I went over , and the ushur showd me inter one of the front seets , and did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess he knowd I had a ded hed ticket . Rite in front of me was a corpulent woman , fatter'an a poorpoise , and the wife of a Brooklyn alderman . She had a hat on wot was as big as a punshun hed , wot she kept twistin round , so I couldnt see a thing wot was goin on on the staige . I guess the woman wayed bout 250 pounds , &amp; her bussel was as big as a Ellerfants . The case was gettin desprit for me , cos I 'd agreed to bring hum a report of the performanse . The furst part was jest bout over ; the blonde artist was singin a solo , and the audiense was so interested that they all stood up . I seen the time had cum for acshun , so I stood a pepper box wot I had in my pocket on the seet . Soon as the ladie went to sit down , she had nt calkerlated on eny obstercal , and did nt try to control her gravytal momentum , so she cum plump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , roarin sound , then a terrer-bel xploshun shuk the buildin , and the air was filled with flyin debris , woman , pieces of cloes , hoopskirt , hat , buttins , little bits of rubber bussell , strings , and things innumer-abel and unmenshunabel . I never seen such a reck in all my life . The ladie landed right in front of the minister , were sum of the quire girls run to her rescue and kivered her up with shawls , puttin her in a carriage and sendin her home . Soon as the reck was cleered and order restored , the minister sed : " I came here this mornin with no idea upon wot subject I shuld speek , trustin entirely to Providense to reveal to the con-gregashun and myself a sootabel one . You see , my heerers , for yourself , my trustin has not been in vane . My text will be : ' And Eve bort a Bon Ton System , and maid herself a fig leef pollynays , cut a la Princesse , and trimmed with dandylion ruchin and sun-flower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wool thereof she formed a big bussel , and Adam got mashed on her fine does , and she turned up her knoes at the washerwomans darter wot did nt have on nothin but a palm leef jursey , wot fit her too soon . ' " You ladies are all alike , and you get your line of dress , from a purty long and direct line of ancestry . I do nt think a fine dress is a sinful appendage to eny lady , in fact I like to see a ladie drest well , but to be drest well , a lady ort not to practise deceit , or act a lie , for there is such a thing as actin a lie . Now bussils are the devils perticklar delite , cos there a form of deceit , in fact , I verily beleeve the devil is in every bussel , and actin on the Biblical advise , the ladies all say , ' Get thee behind me , Satan .

ROUTS THE REPUBLERCAN RABBEL.  --  CAMPANE LIES .  --  THE DEVIL IN LEAGUE WITH DEMMERCRAZEY.  --  GRATE WAS THE FALL THEREOF . Tomorrer is eleckshun day , so tonite the Republercans hav been havin a gran free strete exhybishun . I 'll be orful glad wen the eleckshun is over , ' cos the xcite-ment , &amp; late hours , attendin the campane , is weerin out my nurves . Jimmy and I hav jest got in Mr. Diry , and I think paraders are wonderin wot struck em by this time . Bout half past seven , the torch lite perrsesshun got together , at Cooper institute , and began the march up town to Uniyun square were the liars was to hold forth . There was a norful lot in the persesshun , and sum of ' em had banners , with a pole cat eatin a rooster . I got indignunt , cos they was ntirely too fresh , so me &amp; Jimmy run on ahed of em , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 'd dide to seen em marchin rite on to ' em , singing out " Down with Gilley and the wiskey suckin demmercrazey . " Soon as they stepped on sum torpedoes , they did n't wate for marchin orders . Cos there was a norful noise , like the demmycrazey was in leegue with the subterrainon bosses , and they was celebratin there indypendense day . I was sorry to see them disband , cos they looked sorter purty , and the band wot they had in the persesshun maid things lively . They had a big platform erected wot was meant for the big guns of the partie , to fire off lies and ellyquense from , soon as the persesshun arrived , so me and Jimmie run up there and wated til the crowd wot had got dermoreylized arrove , and the speekin begun . The fust speeker wot held forth , was a clerickel-lookin cus , wot peared to be only bout twenty-one years old . He give a long descriptshun of wot him and his partie , had done for the country durin the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was to hum , busy weerin out his pettycotes . This made me madder'an durnashun , cos I knowd the feller wos lying a reglar baldhedded lie , cos if Mr. Gilley wos weerin pettycotes wen the war brok out , his pa and ma orter kep on lettin him be a gal , and then , p'raps , his hare wuld n't all fell out . The peeple did nt pare to xhibit much inthusyism over the fellers remarks , cos he haled from out in Oio , and citizens out in such far away and semiuncivylized states , ai nt sposed to kno as much as us New Yorkers enyway . A nuther feller got up and sed : " Ladies and gentlemen , this is the eve of a grate eleckshun . Tomorrer us free men 'll go up to the poles and deposit our ballots inter the box , and thus signify our choice of rulers . Every one present knoes the disgraceful condishun of the New York Demmycrazey . Its platform is rotten in every plank . Its leeder Mr. Gilley is the dubble-extract of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party is in a fit state to be condemned by the fresh meet inspector . How is the Republican party ? Its swete and pure as a new-born baby . Its leeder is as clene and wite as new milk , and all Hay-dies culdnt find a flaw in the platform on wich we stand . " Just then I guess the devil muster taken excepshuns to the remarks , cos I 'd pulled the rope wot I 'd fixed to the loose leg of the platform , and the hull bisness toppled over the speekers and vice preserdents of the meetin , presentin a free accrobatic tumblin show to the amused and interested audiense . All the peepel wot was present and seen the platform give way are feelin blu and superstishus , cos there frade the Devil 's in leegue with the Demmercrazey , and I guess there bout rite ; ai nt they , Mr. Diry ? CHAPTER XXII . ELECKSHUN DAY .  --  THE DUDES PEDDLIN DEMMERCRATICK TICKETS .  --  THE METHYDISTS GO BACK ON THE G. O. P.  --  THE DEVIL AS A PERLITICKEL WIRE-PULLER . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're safe in hangin out the hemale chickin , cos all the reports from this city are givin Mr. Gil-ley a ' normous vote , and you bet this devil is feelin proud , cos did nt he nommernate the Guvner ? And bout tomprro nite the hull Statel kno that he lected him , too . I was kep orful busy this mornin till all our repeeters had scored there votes . Them Republercan fellers is orful trickey , and I had to do sum tall flyin round wile I was watchin them , so as they wuldnt steel our repeeters , wot we 'd imported a purpose from Jursey and Fillydeify , and mak em vote in a nother preecinct for there ticket . They call that kinder business equalizin , but , in this case , it did nt equalize wurth a cent , cos I told them all that they warnted to keep there eyes on them fellers wot clamed they was Republercans , cos they was Pinky-ton 's detecktives in disguise tryin to hatch up a case of illegal votin agen them . That scared em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skipped over to Jersey Citty . Soon as I got ' em safely off , I seen the Rerpublicans was gettin ahed of us , so me and Jimmy went down to the offis , and borrered the scientific editturs ' lectric pen , and rote bout 10,000 notes , addressin them to all the dudes whose names is in the di-recktary . Then Jimmy went out and got a lot of other messenger boys to take em round . In less than half a hour the stretes of New York and Brooklyn was crowded with dudes ( reel live dudes , livelier than they was ever known before ) , peddlin Demmercratick tickets round , and visertin all the taylors , and barbers , and thretnin to withdraw there custom if they did n't vote the strate Demmercratick ticket , and elecshunaire for Mr. Gilley . Illustration : AND ROTE BOUT 10,000 NOTES I guess I 'll have to be round tomorro nite , cos there 'll be sum fun , wen Lillyun cums out the stage dore cos every dude in New York has got a note wot red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunflower you ware in your hallered buttin-hole , and the admyrashun you bear your asthetick frend , vote for Mr. Gilley for Guvner , cos the delercate purple tint of his perfume absorbent , is quite too , too , and his long and shaggy Bur-muder-oniyun cullered locks are jest too delish-us , and placed in the guvermentel cheer , will do much towards educatin the common hurd , to a appresheashun of our assthetick tastes . Besides that , I think the other Candydate , is too much of a ' orridley ' orrid , common cad . If you will do this much for me , I will meet you at the stage dore , tomorrer nite . Yours , utterly in luv , Lillyun Russell , Dudine . Then I sent out notes to all the Bank Presidents and clerks , and nost everyone I culd think of wot had the handlin of other peepels munney . They wus short and sweet , but sum how they brot out a orful lot of voters . The notes red like this : If you kno wots good for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Remember . From one who knos you as well as you kno yourself . All the Methydists got notes from the Conferense Committee , sayin that they 'd discovered that the Republican candydate was a rank infydel , and advisin them all to vote for Mr. Gilley , cos he was goin to donate a big pile of munney to furrane mis-shuns . Every member of the Society of Hen Pecked Husbands , wot is very strong in New York , was requested by a letter sined by the President to vote for Mr. Gilley , cos he had it from good authority that the other feller had greed to order the legislate to pass a bill legalizin the wearin of the pants by married wimmen . Then I sent out a circular to every dout-ful German voter , tellin them that the Republican candydate , wen he was a boy , had licked a duch boy biggeran him , and called him a puddin' ' - hedded , pot-stummicked , pretzel-thievin ' son of a beer drinkin ' and sour krout etin ' duchman , and the time had cum for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a flaygrant insult to the most useful and respeckterbel standby 's of the Nashun , the German cityzens . I never seen enything do better in my life . With the excepshun of the few votes wot the Republercans had fore I got my wurk in , mine captured the hull cities of New York and Brooklyn , and the beer and wisky wots ben sent to rural districks , will giv us the hull State by a big majority . Wen I get big , Mr. Diry , I guess I 'll hire myself out for a perfesshunal pollytickal wire-puller . CHAPTER XXIII . A GLORIOUS VICKTORIE.  --  THE LICKED CANDYDATE GENERATES BLUE SULFROUS AIR ON ACCOUNT OF THE ACKSHUN OF HIS PLEGED SUPPORTERS . Xcitement is at fever heet , and tin horns and bonfires is seen and hurd everywere . We 've swep the hull State like a averlanche , and the Republercan partie is deder'n a dore nale . Me and Joe Gilley is goin to run this ere Guvment now for a wile , and you bet we 'll run her with discretion , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Demmercrazy , and John Kelley giv me and Jimmy a 5 dollar bill a peece , so as we 'd have munny enuf to hav sum fun with , cos Mr. Gilley sez I 've ben workin purty hard , and he guessed I 'd better take a rest tomorrer . The back strete was lined with dudes to-nite , and every one of them crowded up to Lillyun wen she cum out the stage dore , but she did n't speek to eny of them . They wus all purty hot , but they do n't regret the way they voted , cos they have the satysfackshun of knowin that the Xecutiv Manshun ' ll hav a occupant wot has a very asthetick blendin of cullers in his mak up . The Rerpublerkan candy date wot 's got licked has gone and got orful mad at the Methydist Conference and swares , by golly , he 'll never donate a nuther oyster to a church supper , and his remains ' ll be smolderin down b'low ' fore them ungrateful hyppercrites ' ll hold a nuther mute soshell in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them for the bord bill of them hoary hedded old delergates , wots been palmed off on her for the last fifteen years . She sez she alwuz expected sumthin ' d happen , cos when the young mens christshun associashun convention cum off , they sent all the yung and good lookin deler-gates over to Widder Masher 's , cross the street , and did n't giv her eny bodie but a lot of old men , wot was just walkin round to save funeral xpenses . The members of the Society of Henpecked husbands is looking like theyd been drawd thru a not hole , cos there wives hav ben wearin the pants again , and given them a taste of dissyplin for votin for a man wot has as outspoken anty wimmins rites vues as Mr. Gilley . I peeped in the windys of sevral banks on my way home , and most all of the clurks has a scart and hunted look in there eyes , but I guess there safe , cos the one who knoes , do n't kno quite as much as they think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all helped to rebuke a insult I guess they wuld n't feel so orful proud of theirselves if they 'd hurd John Kelley and Mr. Gilley talkin bout ' em , jest fore eleckshun , wen they was considered doutful , and Mr. Gilley sed  --   --   --  the Duch . Pollytishuns is purty persnickerty , eny-way . I bleive wen I get ter be a big man I 'll start out as a misshunary and devote my ' nurgies to savin the souls of pollytickel office-seekers and candydates ; taint no use tryin to save there bodies , cos the devil 's got a lien on them alreddy . CHAPTER XXIV . HIS HOLY DAY .  --  PERSONATIN A DUDE MAKES HIM LOSE HIS TRUST IN GALS .  --  MARIA GIVES HIM CLENE AWAY .  --  TERRERBEL REVENGE .  --  HE PROMISES FORGIVENESS ON CERTAIN CONDISHUNS . I 've lost all conferdense in gals and human nature , lost it all at one fell swoop . Yesterday I 'd ben willin to bet a 20-cent seegar that my gal , Maria , would ' er lep cross one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; yes , Mr. Diry , I was wonderfully and terribly deseeved in her . As I told you last nite , me and Jimmy got a holy day to-day and $10 to spend on havin a good time . So this mornin we drest up in our Sunday-skule cloes , and went down town to the property shop , and each bort ourselves a false mustash and canes . Then we went up to the barber shop and had our hare banged . Wen we was thru you wuldnt ben abel to tell us from full bludded Englush swells . We was just too too , walkin up and down Uniyun Square , puffin at our 10-centers , like we owned all New York and half of Brooklyn . You bet we maid sum mashes on the wimmin . Bout one clock we sta-shuned ourselves where we 'd meet our gals as they went to skule . Jimmie 's gal , Josie , and my Maria run together . Purty soon they cum long together , laffin and torkin . Then me and Jimmy braced ourselves up , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Maria she sed orful sweet , " How de do ? " so we followed em up . Purty soon Maria slowed up &amp; sed its a nice day . I told her it was , then I sez if she wuldnt like to take a walk . She sed " she was greed if Josie 'd go long , cos if they went walkin they 'd have to play hookey , and one darsent do it without the other . " After sum persuashun , Josie greed to go long , so I offered my arm to Maria , and we had a big time til bout 5 o'clock . Then we sez to the gals if they 'd like to go to the theater in the evenin , they thot it 'd be or- , ful nice , but they did nt believe there mas wuld trust em to go with strange gentelmen , cos it wuldnt be rite . I axt her if there wasnt sum way to fix it . Maria sed she guessed she culd tell her ma . Georgie was going to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a xtra ticket , &amp; warnted her to go long , so we greed to meet em , at the corner , bout 7 clock . They was there on time , all drest up ter kill , and we took em down to the Standard , and had a big time . Wen the show wos out , we went to a resterant , &amp; had sum oysters . Wile we was etin them , I axt Maria who the Georgie was who tuk her out . " Oh , " sez she , " he 's a red hedded devil , wot wurks in the Buster offis , and ai nt a bit lik you . Ma likes him , and thinks he 's orful steddy , and she ai nt frade to let me go eny place with him . He 's mashed on me bad , and thinks I 'm in luv with him , so he spends all his munney on me , and I jest go with him , cos he takes me to ennything wot cums along . It 's fun ter see him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never fixes up eny , and I 'm gettin most ashamed to be seen on the strete with him . " Illustration : THEN I HAWLED OFF MY FALSE MUSTASH By this time I was feelin purty bad , but I maneged to keep up and make blieve I was feerful in love with her , and got her to promis never to go with Georgie agin . I had a bottel of perfume in my pocket , and jest ' fore we left the restyrant , I put sum on the gals handkercheefs , then I hawled off my false mustash , and soon Maria seen , I was her Georgie , and begun a cryin lik her hart wuld brak . I felt sorry for her , but I told her to dry up her eyes . I guess I must giv them the perfume out of the assyfitity bottel , cos , soon as she rubbed her face you never smelt such a overpourin smell in all your life , we had to keep em at arms length , all the way hum , and if we 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combined , the peeple wouldnt hav givin us more room on the side walk . I felt sorry for them , cos they cryed , and felt so bad , all the way home , and , if I coulder got close enuf to Maria , without bein smuthered I 'd kissed and made it all up . Its a blessin that her ma and pa 's got catarrh orful bad , or there mite be war in her house . I 'm goin to send her the follerin note in the morning , and next time I go to see her I 'll fix up a littel , cos a fellow ca n't blame a girl for goin back on him if he do n't think enuff of her to dress up neet : Dear Maria : I was orful greeved by your conduct , but seein that you 're sorry I 'll forgive you for all . I 'll call round in a week , wot 'll give you time enuf to smell swete agin , if you 're careful to wash often , give yourself lots of air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lime scattered round were you are . Beleeve me your ever lovin Georgie . CHAPTER XXV . ADVERTISES A ARTICKEL WOT WAS FOUND .  --  WIMMIN 'S WAYS .  --  CLAMED.  --  IN DURANSE VILE FOR STEELIN A SHALL .  --  HAPPY EXPLERNASHUN AND INTERESTIN TABLOW . " The lady wot dropped a artickel of warin appairel in the Post Offis , last even-in , can have them by callin on the Devil at this offis and provin property . " The abuv is a advertisement wot I had put in the Buster this mornin , and all day long I 've ben kep busy attendin to the ansurs . The fust lady wot cum in had dropt a plume outer her hat . She giv me a full descripshun of it , wot it cost , and said she knowed it was hers wot I 'd found ; and then I showed her the artickel and axt her if that was it . She blushed up orful red , and sailed outer the offis like I 'd insulted her . Yesterday muster ben a orful bad day for wimmin loosin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two hundred ben to the offis . Sum lost there teeth , uthers there bangs , clokes , slippers , overshoes , gloves , skurts , hankercheefs , bussels , and most everything wot a woman could pile on her ; and I had to show every one of them the artickel wot was found , and axt them if that was it , and , curius enuf , every one went off mad and indignant . On towards nite I was jest beginnin to wonder wether , in a case like this , onhesty was the best pollysee , or wether it wouldnt of payed better for me to hav tuk em home to ma ; wen a madin ladie , of doutful age , come in to the offis , and sed : " Yung man , have they got C. D. marked on the band . " I sed : " Yes , marm . " " Well , they must be mine , cos my name 's Carryline Duncan , &amp; I alwus mark my cloes C. D. for short . I did n't kno I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd ben down to the Post offis sendin a letter to Tom ; that 's my feller wots ben to China for ten yeres . " Then I giv em to her , and puttin them under her arm , she walked out as happy as culd be . I thot I was thru with my trubbel with wimmin 's warin apparel for one day , so I started hum . I 'd ony got to the corner of Spruce street , wen a grate strappin perliceman cum up to me , and clappin me on the shoulder , sed : " I 've got you , sunny , this time ; cum along , now , or I 'll be after makin you . " I seen discreshun was the better part of valler , so I let him leed me . Wen we got to the stashun he preferred a charge of larceny gainst me . Then they axt me if I had eny bodie wot 'd go my bale , so I got ' em to send for Mr. Gilley . Wen he arrove , he cum up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sed : " Georgie , I 'm sorry to see you in such a posishun , but you 'd better pleed gilty , and axe mercy of the cort , cos they 've got a sure case agen you . If you 'd ony bin sharp enuf to hide the property , it would n't ben so bad . " Jest then the lady wot the shawl was stole from , come to identerfy it . Mr. Gilley &amp; me was lookin on . The lady looked orful close , and sed that looked jest like her shawl , wot was all black , ony this one did n't hav no yaller stanes on the corner were she dropt the lemon juce on to hers . Mr. Gilley looked at it close , and purty soon he sed : " Why , Georgie , that 's our offis towl . " Then I seen all thru it in a minnit , cos there was the towl wot I 'd been carryin home to get washed , and the per-liceman , seein the end stickin out from under my cote , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrested me as the theef . Then they had a big laff , and Mr. Gilley set em up for the crowd . He sed he knowd I was orful honorary , but he never culd b'leeve that I 'd steel enything . CHAPTER XXVI . THE DELINKENT SUBSCRIBER 'S ARISTOCRAZEY IDEAS ON THE EDITTUR 'S DIGESTIV ORGANS .  --  A NEW WAY TO COLLECT OLD DETS . There 's a lot of fellers wot hav brown-stone manshuns up town , and French cooks wot dish em up everything good , from frogs ' lim  --  er  --  leg to the posterier xten-shun of a eel 's spinal collum , frickerseed , with mushrum catchup sauce . B'sides that , they 've got lots of munney in the bank , and wuld n't think no more of givin sum Anglo Saxton perfesshunal beggar a thousand-dollar keepsake than they wuld of let-tin there folks go to Longbransh or Newport durin the all-fired heeted turm . I do nt mene , Mr. Diry , that all the welthy people of New York are alike , but I have refrense to that class of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stummicks was patented , and bilt speshelly and xclusivly for the absorpshun and dijestshun of printin-house paste and wind puddins , with ritin-fluid sauce as a con-dyment and appytizer . These are the peepel who alwus allow there noosepaper bills to accummerlate till they dropoff , and the edit-tur gives them a bang-up introduckshun on there long jurney , in the hope that the adminnysteers of there estates 'll allow his bill Feint hope that is , cos were was the adminnysteer that was ever known to acknowledge a noosepaper bill as genwine . They all go on the princerpel " that all editturs is liars , and all big liars is editturs , " and take the same deduckshun , wot is alwus this : " A bill persented by a liar must be a lie , on its face " ; therefore , it is unallowable . The reeson I 've ben thus sollykisin , Mr. Diry , is , cos the expenses of the campane hav ben purty hevvy on Mr. Gilley , and yet havin had a chanse to dip his fingers inter the State Tressurey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this afternoon he give me a lot of old bills to collect . I found it purty had work , cos every-bodie ' peared to be perticklar fond of pay-in all there bills next week . I was gettin diseurraged , and I did n't like to go back to the offis without no munney , so I thot up a littel skeem . There was a big flour deeler wot owd a bill of $40 , wot 'd got outlored . So I went over to his offis and ast the clurk to tell him I wanted to see him on pertickler bisness . The clurk sed he was orful ' ngaged , &amp; I 'd better call round next week , and praps he 'd hav time to tork to me . I insisted and told him to tell Mr. Paynuthin , that the bisness wot I warnted to see him on was a matter of immense importanse to himself . Soon as I got in , I sed : " Mr. Paynuthin , we 've got on to sum very valuabel informashun , wot 'll make your fortune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , if you 'll pay up this bill , I 'll giv it to you at wonce , and you 'll get the inside trak on ' em . " I seen he was gettin interested , so I concluded , by sayin : " Now if you do n't get this in-formashun , it may leed to your ruin . " He did n't say a wurd , but went to the safe , and got out the $40 , and I receeted the bill , and axt him for a peece of paper , cos he mite forget it if I did n't rite it down . Then I wrote in big letters : " Owe no man a cent , " and biddin him goodby , I took a hasty departure . The skeem work 'd splendid every place I went , only at wun old lawyers offis , and he sed : " Yung man , I 've been cheetin , fleecin and beetin everybody for the last forty years , and there ai nt no noosepaper man livin wot can tell me eny eeseier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I got . Mr. Gilley says I 'm the boss collecttur , and orter hire myself out to a Mutual Life and Accident Asso-shiashun as assesment gatherer . CHAPTER XXVII . MINSE PIE AND DREEMS.  --  TERRIBLE RETRYBUSHUN.  --  WOT 'LL OVER TAKE A GOOD MENNY.  --  VIRTUE RECEIVES ITS REWARD . I guess the wurry of collecktin yesterday afternoon muster wurked upon my mind , cos , last nite , I dremt a dreem , wot 'd maid each seprate hare on the heds of every delikent subskriber stand on end , and sing out " Pay up your noosepaper bill , old feller , if yer do nt warnt a skorschin in the dubius hereafter . " Ma and Pa was out , cos it was prayer meetin nite at our church , so I went ter bed urley , cos I was frade wen they cum home , they 'd miss the hull minse pie wot I 'd ete . I 'd just bout got ter sleep , wen I smelt a orful smell , surgestiv of a straw hat revivin shop , wen they burn sulfir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen a cort room , with a lot of lawyers and clurks sittin round a table , and the judge in a pulpit wot over looked them . The peepel all looked like Barnum 's skellyton man , ony they did nt have no skin over there bones , and there eyes was maid of fire balls and eech of em had a long tail , like a snake . Purty soon the judge sed the court was open for bisness , and the sargent at arms brot in a feller all dressed up with a gold wach and big charm wot I reckernized as one of our ded beet subskri-bers wot 'd dide last weak . The judge looked him all over in a com-plermenterry way , and ast him if he 'd alwus lived a onhest and uprite life . " Yer onher , " sed he , " I 've given of my substanse to the poor ; I 've luved my nay-bor as myself ; I 've surved for ten years as Warden of a fashunubble church , and tride to the best of my knowlege and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " sed the prosercutin turney , wot I reckernized as the ex-religio-jurnalistick edittur of a defunckted alliance noosepaper , " May I ast the prisner a questshun ? " " You may , " sed Judge Satan , for it was his infurnissimo himself . " Prisner at the bar , " sed the turney , " Did you pay your subskripshun to the Buster ' fore you checked your baggage thru to Hay dies ? " " No , sir , " sed the prisner , " I did not . I never thot it was perticklar , cos editturs ai nt like other mortels , enyway , and I never knowd it was a sin to beet em if you culd . " " Yes , sir , yer onher , " said the prosercutin ' turney , " he confesses his gilt , and I find , by lookin over the reckord , he ows the Buster offis for 8 years ' subskripshun besides a hull string of free advertisin wot the edittur giv him outer goodness of hart . Not only that , but I notis in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ departed he ordered his paper stopped , cos he was opposed to surportin ' , by his munny , a Dem-mercratick candydate for Guvner . You see , yer onher , there is nothing left for you but to pass sentense on the prisner . " " Prisner at the bar , " sed the Judge , " this yere cort sentenses you to hard laber shuvlin ' flames at a tempyrature of 6,000 degrees , for 10,000 yares , durin ' all wich time you will sing ' I want to be a angel , And with the editturs stand ! ' Shurruf , conduct the prisner to furnace number 561 , next to Gittoes . " Soon as he 'd gone , a cullered gentleman was brot in , and in ansur to there quest-shuns as to his morral standing he sed : " Jedge I knoes I'se a hard cityzen , and I 've done gone and sinned purty nigh all the sins wot I know 'd of . Steelin ' fouls , hookin ' nickles outer the contrybushun box , ' propriatin ' millyuns wot I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at camp meetin ' so as I culd mash wun of . them purty sistern , and other offenses too numer-ickel to menshun , but if this yere cort'U giv this nigger a sho , I 'll try to leed a dif-frent life . " " Prisner , did you ever tak a noose-paper ? " sed the Prosercutin ' Turney . " Yes , sar ; I'se skribed for the Christshun Advercate for ' bout six yares , and I 've payed it up in advanse for most a yare to cum . " " Bobby , my boy , " sed the cort to his rite hand man , " go order the cook , to kill the fatted ram , and prepare a bang up lay out , cos this here cullurd brother is a man , molded after my own hart . Shake , my man , " sed he , shovin his rite boney hand to the cullured feller 's , " and after we 've feested , and viserted my privat opra house , and taken in the new skellyton bailey at-trackshuns , I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the xpress for Skie stashun , and you bet you 'll say this here devil ai nt as bad as he 's painted , cos he knoes how to onher a distingushed guest . " Then the seen vanished from my vishun , and I woke up , hollerin with a pane in my programme , and ma had ter get me a dose of brandie and ginger , outer the flask , wot pa carries , when he goes a fishin . CHAPTER XXVIII . AT THE STOCK EXCHANGE .  --  THE ENGAGEMENT .  --  FIRE IN THE SHECARGO UNIYUN DEPOT .  --  A OFFER FROM JAY GOULD . This mornin noose was sorter dull , so the city edittur sent me down to the Stock Exchange for to write up the anticks of the Bulls and Bares . Wen I got down there I guess the annymiles had n't got round , but there keepers was purty numerous , and made a good deel more noise than they would theirselves . I was showd up to the visters gallary , so as I culd get a good vue of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coalers . The way they do there fitin puts me in mind of wen we use-ter go to skule , cos they chew up a lot of paper , and make spit balls outer it , and then paste each other on the eyes with them . Jay Gould is the name of a littel bit of a feller , he ai nt much in size , but he 's hale columby wen it comes rite down to spit ball fites , cos he pasted old Russel Sage and Vandybilt outer ther boots , hittin fare in the eyes every time . Wen they was gettin purty well tired out , a lot of fellers wot was " hit , " cum out , and the other formed rings round them and sung a song wot sounded like it was maid up of five 8s and three 1/4 s . I shuld think theyd be ashamed of theirselves , grate big men , spendin there time playin a game wot Boys , as big as me , wuld n't do for a nickel . I seen they was disgracin us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put a stop to it , and bring em down to bisness , so I sung out orful loud : " Gintelmin : Thurs a big fire in the Uniyun Depot in Sheecargo . " Then they all looked up to see who was talkin , and reckernized me , as connected with the Buster . You 'd dide , to see em flyin round ; the fellers wot do the bullin was purty neer crazey , coverin up there stocks , with margin 's . Stocks come flyin down , like litenin , and the barish porshun of the compenney , was makin a immense pile of munney . The country lams wot the Bulls and bares had been fleecin , so as there wives , &amp; gals culd have wool enuf , to stuff the footstools with , wot they was makin for Chrissmas boxes , hurd wot I sed , and tumbeled to it , and sold all the Western trunk stocks . I did n't say nothing till I seen thay 'd got a good deal onter the bulls , then I sung out agen , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the Uniyun Depot , at Sheecargo , is still burnin fiercely , in the heeter , wots lokated in the seller . " I did n't wate to say good by , cos the fire-like gleem wot gleemed at me from bout a hundred pares of eyes , boded no good for the Busters devil . Wen I got back to the offis a note was watin for me , wot red : Dare Devil  --  You 've mistakin your callin . A sensashunalist like yurself orter stick to the spesshialty bisness . If you 'll quit the noosepa-per perfesshun , I 'll form a syndycate , and run you as a stock hammerer , and gin you half the proffits . Yours very trooly , Gould . I assure you , Mr. Diry , the temptashun was purty strong , but I thot of my integrity and princerples , and rote : Sur  --  I prefer my present persisshun of hammerin branes inter the publick to that of hammerin stocks . Not all the syndycates of ' Merica wuld temp me to relinquish my onherabel con-necshuns with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . HE CALLS ON MARIA AND PRONOUNSES HER FRAGRANT .  --  AT A CHURCH SUPPER .  --  BENERVOLENSE REWARDED .  --   --  A EPPYDEMMICK . Last nite I went over to call on Maria . I thot I 'd be prepared , so I washed myself in ma 's lavender water , and sprinkeled oh de coloney all over my does . Wen I nocked at Marias dore , I stepped down off the steps and wated for her appairanse . At last she cum , and blushed up orful wen I ast her if it was all rite . She sed she did nt kno , cos she 'd got so used to it she culdnt tell , but she thot it was all rite , cos she 'd ben standin ' tween two open winders for the weak , and if it warnt gone by this time , she guest it 'd stick to her for life . I walked up a littel closer to her , and sed : " Maria , cum here .
