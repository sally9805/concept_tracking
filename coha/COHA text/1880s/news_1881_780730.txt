txt It having been announced in some of the local papers that the counsel for Gen. Brady would make a motion to-day to quash the information filed against him by the Government , District Attorney Corkhill , as a representative of William A. Cook , asked the court to-day that the Government should have two days ' notice before any such motion should be heard . Col. Cook is not well and could not have argued such a motion today . The court decided that such a course would be pursued and that notice would be given to the Government through Col. Cook . It is understood that the motion to quash the information will be made on Wednesday or Thursday and that Gen. Brady 's counsel will hold that the mode of procedure is unusual and that the grounds of the information are insufficient . While the Department of Justice is pressing the star route ring men in the courts , the Post Office Department continues to reduce the heavy pay which they fraudulently secured under the Hayes Administration . An order which took effect on Saturday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week on Route No. 38,113 , from Rawlins to White River . The sum in this way deducted from the annual pay was 820,881 , of which more than $20,000 was the cost of the expedition . This is one of the Dorsey routes . Its length is 180 miles , and it was let to John W. Dorsey , in 1878 , for $1,700 per year . The service was only one trip per week , and the time allowed was 108 hours . Dorsey 's work was inexcusably poor , and he was continually quarreling with his subcontractors , whom he had engaged to work for small sums . The service was so bad that temporary contracts were given four times within six months to local men to fill the gaps . Many complaints wore made , and it was said by the complainants that none but ring men could so long have avoided the department 's declaration that they were failing contractors . Army officers at one time reported that there had been no service for about three months . After a time S. W. Dorsey took the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 108 to 45 hours , and increasing the number of trips to 7 , the pay had been raised from $1,700 to $31,981 per year . The addition of four trips and 818,275 was made by Bradyjust before he was dis- missed and just after Mr. James had come in . It was the last thing he could do for the Dorseys . The reduction which has just taken effect was made by the express direction of the Postmaster-General , because the extra trips were added after he had become the head of the department .
