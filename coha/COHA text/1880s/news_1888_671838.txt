txt The majority of the Ways and Means Committee have agreed upon a tariff bill that will be found in our columns in full this morning . We need hardly ask for it the careful attention of our readers . It is by far the most important fiscal measure brought before Congress since the close of the war . " In the actual condition of the politics , the Treasury , the commerce , " and industry of the country it may be said to be the most important measure of any sort submitted . to Congress since the war , with the exception-of the Constitutional amendments and the bill for the resumption of specie payments . The political significance of the measure-can readily be understood . Twice . before the Democratic Party , in a majority in the House , has brought forward . a proposition to relieve the industries and . the commerce of the country of the burdens imposed upon them by the war tariff : Each time it has met the almost solid opposition of the Republican Party , and . thanks to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have gone into the Republican camp , it has been defeated . Now once more it takes up its task . Will it have the same opposition I That is - the question the Republicans must face . Let them think well upon the stage to which the country has arrived . During the twenty-two years that have passed since the war closed not one honest measure for the reduction of the war tariff has been enacted . There have been reductions of taxation , and heavy ones , but they have left the import duties under which great and grasping monopolies have been built up and " trusts " brought into being practically untouched , for the simple - reason that they were dictated by the men interested . in these monopolies and enriched by these " trusts . " Some of these reductions of taxation , like the repeal of the tea amd coffee duties , were expressly designed to prevent or postpone reduction of the burden on industry and trade . Others , like the repeal of the various internal revenue taxes , only had . the effect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by favored. enterprises ' and to build . higher the barrier against competition . This course of proceeding has left the war tariff with nearly all its unequal and oppressive features , with its discriminations in favor of certain classes of citizens and . against certain other classes substantially intact . The bill of the Ways and Means Committee proposes courageously , but with moderation , to remedy the worst of the evils of the war tariff . It is an honest bill , a practical bill , shaped by rational principle and directed to important and definite results . Will the Republicans offer it a solid , stupid opposition ? Or will they treat - it with candor and sense , accepting its principle , and , where they ' can not accept its details , offering amendments inl good . faith ? That is the Question that the Republicans in the House must answer , and on their answer will largely depend . the verdict of the people in the coming national elections . The plan of the committee bill is a simple one . It makes substantial additions to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the importations of the fiscal year 1887 by about $28,000,000 . This ' includes the repeal of the duties on lumber , On salt , oft wools , on flax , hemp , jute ; and like fibres , and . on some of ? their manufactures ; on a considerable number of chemicals , embracing boracio acid and vegetable dyeing substances On copper ore and regulus ; on tin plates and cotton ties ; books printed in foreign languages or published for free distribution ; on . paintings and statuary , and on numerous articles yielding a small revenue and having no especial effect except a vexatious and - impeding one . It is impossible to deny-that the principle by which these duties are repealed is a perfectly sound one . It is that of promoting American industry by removing artificial and . arbitrary burdens imposed upon it by legislation . Such removal is a more distinct and valuable advantage to American enterprises and to the labor engaged upon them than that derived from duties impeding foreign competition , and it has this Marked superiority , , that while it helps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits the consumer as well . It is also to be said . that the principle by-which these additions to the free list are justified . would . justify others that are not found . ink.the bill . The latter have-been omitted to secure support for the measure  --  a legitimate purpose , and one that the opponents of all additions to the list can not contest . The reductions made in the duties that are not abolished . are expected , on - the basis of the fiscal year 1887 , to produce a decrease in revenue of about . $24,000,000 , though against this must be set off whatever increases of revenue may come from larger importations under the lower duties . Some of the reductions are plainly in the line of the requirements of the present situation , especially those on . the various forms of iron . The bill will . of course , be subjected . to much criticism , and will be amended in. many details . What the country will watch for with the greatest interest will be to ? see what shall be - the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
