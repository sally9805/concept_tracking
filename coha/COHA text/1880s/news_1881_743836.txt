txt . Lord SALISBURY is evidently determined that the Lords shall rule or be ruined . If he thinks that the rejection of the Land bill in the upper house of Parliament would result in a dissolution and the return of a Conservative majority , then his after-dinner remarks on Friday night show him to be a statesman not lacking in courage , however deficient he may be in foresight . But if he meant to say that the Lords would throw out the bill merely because they disapproved of its principles and having no purpose beyond the defeat of a bad measure , that is another matter altogether . ' As the Conservative far outnumber the Liberal Lords , nothing could be easier than to veto the action of the House of Commons if the noble Lords can only be persuaded that that would be a wise thing to do . But whether it would be wise , or safe even , is one of the gravest questions which a noble Lord may ever be called upon to decide . It is plain that the organs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a propitious time nor the Land bill as a favorable issue for a trial of conclusions between the Lords and the Commons . Taking fair weather and foul together , the Conservative Party must necessarily be pretty constantly the advocate of enlarged powers , of something more than the function of registration , for the House of Lords , and to that house the present Opposition have looked appealingly as the sole barrier against the rising tide of Radicalism . But even the London Telegraph , the exponent of all that is most extreme and unreasoning in Toryism , rebukes the new Conservative leader for the recklessness of his speech . When the Lords threw out the Compensation for Disturbance bill last Summer , the question of the continuance of a class of hereditary and irresponsible legislators in the English constitutional elan was raised and very frankly discussed . The anomalous character of the upper house and its power to do harm were dwelt upon , and in quarters which represent the opinions of the present political majority , and hence of the majority of Englishmen , it was freely acknowledged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House of Lords to set itself in opposition to the will of the nation upon any measure of prime importance . It happened that the Liberals themselves were divided upon the Disturbance bill , and the wish of the electors was not clearly manifest . But when , a month later , the bill for the registration of Irish voters was defeated by the Lords , Mr. FORSTER said in the House of Commons that , if that policy were persisted in , the time would come when it would be necessary to change the constitution of the House of Lords , and Mr. O'CoNNOR moved that it was " no longer expedient that all measures for the improvement of the condition of the people of England and Ireland should be at the mercy of a body of legislators hereditary and irresponsible . " The spirit which then spoke out so frankly has not died away . The House of Lords is habitually spoken of as a " debating society , " and its reorganization is looked upon as inevitable and not distant . Lord SALISBURY believes it " would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that its functions should be merely to conform to the decisions of the House of Commons . " Nevertheless , it is accepted as settled that in all important matters upon which the nation has spoken unmistakably by a full majority vote in the House of Commons the Lords must acquiesce in that decision , and whenever of late they have taken a different course they have raised a storm . Lord SAusnuny is unwilling that the " old nobility " of England shall thus efface itself , and he has chosen the Land bill as a test of its strength against the elected body of legislators . Almost any other bill would seem better for the purpose , if we look somewhat beyond immediate to final results . The Irish Land bill involves questions which lie at the very foundation of caste distinctions . It aims to break up a system of vassalage , for in the worst districts of Ireland the tenant is simply a vassal . Rentpaying is an empty form , a fiction which leaves the tenant still a serf , the landlord a feudal lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtains from the soil is an amount of nourishment barely sufficient to keep soul and body together . And in England , though the more inhuman features of landlordism are there absent , the tenant farmers complain bitterly of their burdens , and agriculture grows less and less profitable . Yet the determined opposition to the Hares and Rabbits bill last year shows how little disposed the territorial nobility are to give up any of their ancient privileges . The arrogance of the landed class and the sympathy of the mass of Englishmen with the sufferings of the farmers foster a disposition to inquire whether it is wise for a State to encourage an aristocratic caste holding the hereditary privilege of legislation , with the associated evils  --  as some call them  --  of entail , inherited pensions , and vast estates , largely unproductive . There are many Turgots in England who , by passionless , economical reasoning , have become convinced that a privileged aristocracy is the reverse of beneficial to the State . It does not require , in these days of individual equality and constitutional right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called the French States General together to condemn and overthrow a political class or institution . It would suffice for the Liberal majority in England to see the noble Lords standing obstinately up for their class interests against the voice of the country and blocking the progress of a reform which is opposed only by themselves and " a few resolute sticklers for economical orthodoxy , " as the London Times puts it . The Irish Land bill is the last of a long series of attempts , and the one which promises to be successful , to protect a class whose sufferings are due to the vices of territorial aris- tocracy , and to remove causes of discontent which have several times brought the country " within a measurable distance of civil war . " In opposing this measure to the extent the Marquis of SALISBURY has indicated , the Lords will be putting their heads in the lion 's mouth . If they are bitten off it will be their own fault .                 @ @ @ @
