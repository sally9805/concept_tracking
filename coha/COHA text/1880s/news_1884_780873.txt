txt Seven of the New-York reform bills were passed by the Assembly to-day , all of them , save one , in substantially the same form in which they came from the Roosevelt investigating committee . Mr. Van Cott , Democrat , of New-York , sought to increase the salary of the Register from $12,000 to $25,000 . This proposition was criticised by Mr. Roosevelt as a simple absurdity . It was voted down , and Democrats and Republicans alike joined in passing the original bill . The vote was 92 to 1 , the negative vote being cast by Mr. Felter , of Rockland . The bill fixing the salary of the County Clerk at $15,000 , and requiring his fees to be paid into the city treasury , was productive of a long debate over the proposition of Mr. Smith , Democrat , of Clinton , to make the act so general that every County Clerk in the State would be placed upon a salary to be fixed by the Board of Supervisors . Both Mr. Smith and Mr. Rice argued that this would be good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chemung , agreed with them on this point , but insisted that this was not the bill in which to introduce the idea . Mr. Van Duzer told the Democrats that he would give them an opportunity to show whether they were in earnest in proposing such an amendment , for a general act covering the very point had been introduced by him and would soon be reached on the calendar . Mr. Welch , Democrat , and Messrs . O'Neil and Erwin , Republicans , and members of the investigating committee , spoke against the amendment , which was not , they said , demanded by other counties in the State . and which could not be tacked upon this bill without imperiling its passage through the Senate . The amendment was lost by 40 to 66 . An amendment by Mr. Lewis , Republican , of New-York , was adopted , which reduces the fees in the office between 25 and 30 per cent . The fees for searching judgments are reduced from 15 to 8 cents ; on other matters from 5 to 3 cents , and $5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This amendment was adopted by 73 to 36 , and the bill as amended was then passed by 107 to 1 , Mr. Felter again casting the negative vote . The Surrogate 's bill , which deprives the Aldermen of all connection with or power over the Surrogate 's office , and which brings the office 's expenditures under the surveillance of the Board of Estimate and Apportionment , was next considered . Major Haggerty recalled his efforts of last year to pass a bill creating two Surrogates , and vehemently declared that if it had been passed no such developments in the office would have been brought to light . Mr. House . Republican . promptly took up this matter by sneering at the Major s as not only unconstitutional and pronounced as such at the time by the best lawyers of the State . but it was also the product of the scheming brain of ex-Surrogate Calvin , a man who , Mr. House declared , had been rejected by the people . " That which was behind the bill of last year , " said he , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bill passed by a vote of 99 to 2 . Messrs . Felter and Coffey , Democrats , the latter from Brooklyn , voting in the negative . The fourth bill , which places the employes of the County Clerk on salaries , and which requires the city to pay them through the medium of the Board of Estimate and Apportionment , was passed without debate . the vote standing 93 to 1 , as usual the hide-bound Democrat from Rockland being In the negative . Speaker Sheard has given orders that all passes to the floor of the Assembly will be disregarded to-morrow during the consideration of the General Surface Railroad bill . Three more of the reform bills were passed at the afternoon session . These were the two bills relating to the Sheriff 's office and the one creating a single-headed Park Commission . The eighth and last one of the series , that abolishing imprisonment for debt , is in the hands of the Judiciary Committee , where it is being perfected . It ought to be reached at an early date . The first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law of last year , which , though nominally in the interest of humanity , for it sought to prevent the overcrowding of the city prisons of New-York , in reality was a direct means of increasing the Sh eriff 's revenue from boarders in Ludlow-Street Jail . The bill passed without opposition . Mr. Van Cott had an amendment for the other bill which brings the expenses of the Sheriff 's office under the critical eye of the Board of Estimate and Apportionment . His object was to relieve the present Sheriff from the operations of the Reform bill , but he was outvoted , and no further opposition was made to this bill by the Democrats . Upon the Park bill some of the Republicans were divided . Mr. Kittle , Republican , of NewYork , attempted to substitute a three-headed commission , and on this a long discussion occurred . Mr. House , Republican , joined with him in opposing the Reform bill . Such Democrats as Farmer Clarke , Mr. Van Cott. and Mr. Oliver immediately saw their opportunity , and they united with the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reform bill , and scouted the idea that the Kittle substitute would be any improvement upon the existing four-headed commission . The substitute was lost by 46 to 56 . Then Mr. Kittle and his Democratic allies strove to kill the bill . Farmer Clarke was excited and declared that the vast powers which would be lodged in a single Commissioner would make him a corruptionist beside whom Tweed would be a mere baby . Even Mr. Rice was disposed to believe that it vested too much power in one man . The friends of reform were compelled to skirmish for votes while the roll-call was in progress . The bill received 67 votes , 2 more than the necessary number , and these would have melted away in another moment , for they were pulled and hauled by the Kittle crowd , had not Gen. Husted promptly demanded the announcement of the result . The detailed vote was as follows , Republicans in roman , Democrats in italics : deleted 19 lines Mr. Gibbs 's Police Pension bill was received from the Senate with several verbal amendments , which were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It now goes to the Governor and will be signed by him . Among the bills passed by the Senate to-day was Mr. Robb 's bill to " regulate the height of dwelling-houses in the city of New-York and for the better preservat on of health in said houses . " Only one vote was cast against the bill-that of Senator Daggett , of Brooklyn . The bill now goes to the Assembly , where the builders ' lobby has already bought an adverse report of a similar bill introduced by Mr. Howe . An effort will doubtless be made by the same corrupt gang to defeat the Senate bill . Congressman 0 . B. Potter has lent his aid to the defeat of this much-needed legislation by writing letters to Senators and Assemblymen urging that such amendments shall be made to the bill that it will not interfere with the cloud-cleaving structures be is now engaged in rearing over the heads of New-Yorkers .

Mr. Gibbs 's bill naming Allan Campbell , John Kelly , Joseph Garry , Daniel Lord , Jr. , and Hugh Gardner as Commissioners of Assessment to revise the assessment for improvements in NewYork for several years past came up for a third reading , when Mr. Robb objected to the names of Garry and Gardner . He said Mr. Gardner was not fit for the duties of the office , but subsequently be admitted that he did not know much - about him except that he had been a Police Justice . He believed there were plenty of citizens far more fit for the duties of this office than Mr. Gardner . Senators Gibbs , Campbell , Murphy , Daggett , and others vouched for Mr. Gardner as being not only eminently qualified for the office contemplated in this bill , but as being entirely fit and competent for any position . Equally high compliments were paid to Mr. Garry by Senator Cullen and others .

Mr. Robb moved to recall from the Assembly the Fifth-avenue pavement bill with a view to putting the supervision of the work in the hands of the Commissioners of the Sinking Fund . He said the bill as it passed the Senate was a " job . " Mr. Gibbs favored the recall of the bill for the purpose indicated , but , he protested against the bill being called a " job . " There was no job in it , and the amount named ( $500,000 ) was none too much , as was conclusively shown in an editorial of THE NEW- YORK TiatEs , ( which was read by the Clerk , ) but he had no objection to , a change in the commission that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was concerned , he only objected to having the work done by the Commissioner of Public Works .

The object of the caucus is to discuss and possibly draw up resolutions for the sine die adjournment of the Legislature .
