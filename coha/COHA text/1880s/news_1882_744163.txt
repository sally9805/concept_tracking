txt It was rumored on ' Change to-day that the parties who control the Spring wheat deal are tired of their bargain , but this may bo entirely gratuitous . The magnificent weather is a very bearish fact , and may stimulate short selling to a point where few people would have the courage to restrain the market . On the mere question of supply the price hero might easily be put at 140 or over , but if the Winter wheat markets should be down to 120 about that time an appeal to the rule for determining value might make trouble for the longs .

California wheat was offered on ' Change to-day , the prlco named being about 138 . It is magnificent stuff , understood to be some of that sent to St. Louis overland recently . The statement that our No. 2 Spring Is worth only about 103 for shipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently been buying all the No. 3 they could get at about that price .

The market was really firm , though there was an impression that certain large holders are selling out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning of March . Liverpool was lower en both lard and meats , and private advices from England said that tho provision markets there are demoralized by the continued apathy of consumers at present prices . In the wheat pit there was more fear of a surprise by the longs , and this repressed the selling fever which had raged the previous day . The parties supposed to represent the clique wore changing over from March into April , and others buying for April while telling for May . which widened the discount on the latter to 3% cents at one time . It was remarked that as a matter of carrying May should be worth 5 cents more than April instead of 3. cents less . That difference of 8 cents about represents the relative fear with regard to squeezing those two months . Navigation , supposed to have closed last December , has not been actually suspended this Winter . One little sail vessel has made 14 trips across the lake since the 1st of January , bringing lumber and carrying back miscellaneous merchandise . Lumber has arrived by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A cargo , the only one since the latter part of December , was sold on the Franklin-Street Market yesterday .
