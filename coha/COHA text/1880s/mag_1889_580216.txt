THE GOLD HEART . WHEN the events occurred which I am about to narrate , I was ignorant of the superstitious veneration with which so many of the Northwestern Indians regard the symbol of the heart . A heartshaped leaf or pebble is never held in the hand if it can be avoided . The rude figure of a heart traced in red ochre on a rock or tree-stump commemorates some event of peculiar solemnity , and commands the respectful obeisance of every Indian who sees it . The same form outlined with boulders , on the prairie or hillside , marks the scene of a great battle and victory or the death of some great chief . The area within the encircling stones is holy ground . But , as I have said , I knew nothing of all this five years ago , when , in the first days of the Cwur d'Alene mining craze , I was working on my claim on Eagle Creek . Nor do I pretend to have // any explanation to offer of the incidents which I am about to chronicle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and know no more of the chain which connected the incidents than the reader will know after he has read what follows . I was working alone in my " drain ditch , " shoveling laboriously at the coarse gravel , which was obstructed here and there by large boulders , lying immediately above the bed-rock and some two feet below the surface of the ground . It was hard and discouraging work , for as yet there had been no indication that the claim was likely to be " rich . " The boulders had been more than ordinarily frequent and ponderous that day , and I was correspondingly weary , when suddenly my shovel turned up the Gold Heart . " Turned up , " I say ; but , as a matter of fact , the Heart was dislodged from the side of the ditch , and slipped down with a handful of pebbles to my feet . My first sensation was that of one who sees a miracle happen . It was certainly some seconds , and I think fully a minute , before I moved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass lay glistening in the trickling water at my feet . Then , slowly and cautiously , I laid my shovel on the ground beside the ditch , and stealthily took off my hat , like a small boy about to pounce upon a butterfly . Dropping on my knees , I clapped my hat over the golden lump , clutching the brim with my hands on either side , and grinding my knuckles into the wet gravel . My heart beat fiercely and my breath came quick and bard , as after great physical exertion . I was trembling and terrified at I knew not what . There was no human being within two miles of where I was , and I knew it . But as I kneeled I glanced fearfully around and behind me into the misty woods . Moments passed before I dared to lift one edge of my hat to see if the beautiful thing still lay beneath . Even when it lay uncovered and shining before me , it was long before I could bring myself to touch it or pick it up . Experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight and value of any piece of rough gold . This , I estimated , was worth something more than six hundred dollars . But the precious metal as it comes out of the ground , new from nature 's minting , has a beauty and a fascination which it loses on passing into the assay office ; and this was incomparably the finest nugget that I had ever seen . I weighed it in my hands , - first in one , and then in the other . I rubbed it and polished it ; held it out at arm'slength to look at it ; laid it down , and drew off a few paces to admire it . Then I kissed it . Finally I turned my attention to the place whence it had been dislodged , and made another discovery . Together with the lump of gold , my shovel had uncovered something else , which had also slipped to the bottom of the ditch and had lain unnoticed . It was a small bone . Looking at the side of the ditch where my shovel had last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gravel . The loosening of the pebbles with my fingers brought others to light , until I quickly saw that I had lighted upon the skeleton of a human hand . Before dark I had unearthed the entire arm , - an unusually long one , it seemed , - and arrived at a rib . Next day the exhumation was completed , and there lay exposed the skeleton of an Indian , evidently , buried who knows how many years before ? I had always understood that the Indians had never penetrated so far into the mountains . Eagle City , four miles distant , lay forty miles from the pass through which the Pend d'Oreilles on one side of the range and the Flatheads on the other used to exchange annual visits . Those forty miles were one stretch of dense forest , clothing steep hillsides ; and the Indian // dislikes nothing so much as climbing hills . In those early days of Eagle City two or three red men were occasionally seen about the camp , as will hereafter appear ; but they were Spokanes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Spokane Falls , a few months before , and were not indigenous to the mountains . Nevertheless , the skeleton was sufficient evidence that one Indian , at least , had been there years before ; and , moreover , somebody else had been there to bury him . The body was stretched at full length , parallel to the line of my ditch . The right arm was bent , the hand resting on the breast . The left arm had lain extended at right angles to the body , and it was on the fingers of this left hand that I had come so unexpectedly . The Gold Heart , I had no doubt , had been clasped in the dead man 's hand when he was buried . Still , I believed it to be a natural nugget , and not to have been fashioned by man into the form in which I found it . In one place a small crystal of quartz wa* imbedded in the gold , which would probably have been taken out in any moulding or carving process . Besides , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the human organ , and not at all the conventional symmetrically bi-lobed form which we see on valentines and playing-cards . But the Gold Heart was of precisely this conventional form , perfectly smooth save for the roughness of the one jagged point of quartz , and symmetrically rounded . The evening of the day following my discovery , my partner , Alfred Trask , returned from a three days ' trip to a claim on Trail Creek , twenty miles away , which he had some idea of purchasing . As my partner in the claim , he of course had a half-interest in the Gold Heart ; and we sat late into the night looking at the nugget , caressing it in turn , and each endeavoring , though with poor success , to persuade the other that there was n* connection between the gold and the Indian . If that were so , we might reasonably expect that the diggings which had produced such a nugget would turn out to be rich . But I doubt if either was much influenced by the arguments of the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before going to bed we decided to take the treasure into camp next day , and deposit it at the Pioneer bank . Before doing so , however , we had not a little work to finish about the claim , and it was after sundown and the bank was closed when we reached Eagle City . For the entertainment of the homeless , Eagle City , in those early days , was provided with certain lodging-houses , large tents , which looked like hospital wards , with their row of small canvas cots on either side . We drew our two cots close together , that night , leaving only room for a hand to be thrust down between them , and immediately below this interstice we set the bag containing the Gold Heart . It was within arm ' * length of both of us , therefore , and no one else could arrive at it without climbing over one or the other . The key of the bag was in the pocket of the clothes which I wore all night . We awoke , apparently , almost simultaneously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ascertain if the bag were still there . It was safe , and we at once proceeded to dress . Other occupants of the tent were soon astir in the dim , gray light , so it was with some circumspection that we drew the cots apart to reach the bag . I then stooped down , sitting on the edge of my cot , and unlocked the bag without lifting it from the ground . As soon as the jaws opened , Trask thrust his hand in , and I shall never forget the expression of utter blankness and bewilderment that came over his face . The Gold Heart was gone ! There was no doubt of it . The bag , when lifted , was lighter by some three pounds // than it had been the night before , and the nugget was certainly not there . There was nothing to be gained by making an uproar about it . If we had done so , we should have been likely to find ourselves involved in a quarrel with somebody , - the lodging-house keeper or one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been settled without the use of revolvers . We had no one to blame but ourselves , no one to suspect . There was no police in Eagle City then , and if the gold had been stolen we were more likely to catch the thief by saying nothing than if we raised a hue and cry in camp . So we said nothing . But although one or both of us stayed in camp for two weeks afterwards , not the smallest clue did we discover to lead us to the thief , - if thief there had been . It was in the middle of August that I found and lost the Gold Heart . It was late in September when Trask and a certain Charles Chapman and I started up Eagle Creek on a hunting trip , carrying our blankets , provisions , and cooking utensils on our backs . The second night , we camped at a place some thirty-five miles above our claim , - forty , perhaps , from Eagle City , - where the gulch was wide enough to leave a hundred feet or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stream and the steep pine-clad mountain-side . Before turning in for the night , Chapman and I made an excursion of a few hundred yards into the woods up stream , and there prepared a " salt lick " for deer . In the morning , at daybreak , we visited the lick , but found no game nor any sign that the bait had been visited . We spent the day idling iii camp , and catching a few of the small mountain trout with which the stream was meagrely supplied . At sundown we once more started out to visit the lick . Among the mountains and under the shadow of the dense growth of pines and tamaracks and cedars , it grows rapidly dark , and as we made our way cautiously through the brush the outlines of objects about us became more indistinct each moment . We were still some distance from the lick , when a rustling in the brush ahead made us both stop suddenly and look to our rifles . Again the leaves rustled , and the branches of a bush scarcely twenty paces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a dark body moving through the foliage . " Bear ! " I whispered , straining my eyes to get such a sight as would justify a shot . Chapman , however , had apparently a better view than I , for he slowly raised his Winchester to his shoulder , while I was still craning my neck in vain endeavors to arrive at some idea of how the quarry stood . Once , after raising his rifle to his shoulder , Chapman lowered it , as if in uncertainty . Then he raised it again , aimed deliberately , and fired . There was a sudden swaying of branches , the crash of a heavy body falling , and , simultaneously , a cry which made our hearts stop beating . A moment later we were scrambling forward abreast as fast as we could move . The cry which we had heard came from a human throat . A man was lying at full length among the brush , stone dead : an Indian , - one of the few of whom I spoke as being occasionally seen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm bent and the hand resting on his chest , his left arm extended down the slope , the hand and forearm hidden in the brush . Chapman , who had practiced medicine , stooped and laid his hand on the dead man 's heart . But it was u*mnecessary . We had known that he was dead as soon as we saw him lying there . As Chapman moved the right hand away from the breast to reach the heart , the great wound in the right side was disclosed . When he spoke it was in m*n undertone // " Let us carry him back to camp , and bury him there . " Stooping again , he placed a hand under each of the dead man 's arms to raise him , while I lifted his legs . As we lifted him , his left arm came into view , and there , clasped tightly in the fingers , glistened , even in the gathering darkness , the Gold Heart . And it came to me that this was how the other had lain , - on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm bent on the breast and his left extended , and the hand clutching the nugget . There was no doubt as to its being the same heart , for there was the small protruding point of quartz , and on the other side some crosswise scratches made by Trask 's knife in our cabin before we had lost it . What had brought the unfortunate Indian to the place where we had met him it was hard to guess . Certainly neither hunting nor prospecting ; he was alone and unarmed . Nor could he have been traveling from point to point , for no path or trail leading anywhere lay through the region in which we then were . Nothing but aimless roving could have led him those forty miles into the heart of the mountains . Then , why should an Indian rove unarmed ? Nor was it less difficult to conjecture how he had come into possession of the Gold Heart . That he could have stolen it from under our cots seemed impossible ; for an Indian would never have attempted nor have been permitted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locked , and was locked when we found it in the morning . It was utterly baffling . The red man held his secret , and we buried him there by the creek-side , under the overhanging bluff . Our plans had already been made for leaving the mines immediately on our return from this hunting trip . The killing of the Indian and the recovery of the Gold Heart cut the expedition somewhat shorter than we had intended that it sftould be , and we started for camp next day . It was our intention to leave by way of the river , the Crur d'Alene , of which Eagle Creek is a tributary , - or rather a tributary of another tributary known as Pritchard Creek . In the spring , several lives had been lost , of men endeavoring to float down the treacherous stream in small boats ; but in September , in spite of a rainy summer , the river was shrunken from the foaming torrent of the days of melting snow . We had bought in advance a boat large enough to hold us three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , laden with supplies for the mines ; and two days after our return to camp , embarking at the junction of the North Fork and the South Fork of the Comr d'Alene , we started down stream . We expected to arrive at Lake Co*ur d'Alene , into which the river empties , on the third day , and then to row across to the fort , where now Cnur d'Alene city stands . From there alternative stage-coach routes lay to Spokane Falls and to Rathdrum , Idaho . Though the river had dwindled to small proportions compared with its volume in the spring floods , we found its navigation still perilous enough . Sometimes for miles the current flowed smoothly through a broad channel between level banks , every pebble standing out clearly from the gravel bottom . Sometimes the channel narrowed , and the banks rose to steep hill-slopes on either hand . Through these gorges the stream poured in a noisy torrent , swirling into eddies over deep pools , and breaking in sudden foam against the heads of jagged rocks which thrust themselves up from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to within a few inches of the top of the water . At these times we took our station , each in his turn , in the very point of the narrow bows , and with an iron-shod // boat-hook kept the boat from the rocks as we rushed past them . It was keenly exciting , and we understood who so many men had perished in the attempt to float down to the lake . While one was thus warding the boat from the rocks , a second handled a pair of oars , to steer with rather than to row , for the speed of the current alone carried us at times all too fast . The third member of the party , meanwhile , took his ease , lounging in the stern . It was a fascinating voyage . On either side filed the endless procession of pines and cedars , with the dark hillslopes behind flecked and streaked with mist . From the woods came the constant tapping of woodpeckers and the monotonous cry of the myrtle robin . At almost every bend in the river , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top , and the kingfishers glided silently from the broken limbs or haunts of rock where they had sat so patiently . Now and then a flight of black and white wood-duck rose splashing from the water and circled away over the trees , while the dotterel went flitting and fluttering along the water 's edge . We had fishing tackle with us , and in one of my turns of idleness I began lazily to cast for trout . After a few casts I saw a promising pool a short distance ahead , and , half rising in the boat , prepared to make a throw at it in passing . As we approached , it looked more and more promising . There could not fail to be a fish in that , I thought . Nor was I mistaken . Hardly had my fly touched the eddying water when a magnificent fish rose to it . But , as is the exasperating way with the finest fish , it either missed its aim or changed its mind at the last moment , and dropped into the stream again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pool a point of rock thrust itself above the water . I had seen it , and ought to have been prepared to avoid it ; but in the excitement of missing my fish I suffered the fly to remain lying on the surface till it was swirled against the rock . In an instant the line was drawn taut . By some mischance the reel failed to do its duty . In a sudden effort to disengage the line I leaned over the boat 's side , and we were all struggling in the water . Fortunately it was not deep , - barely above our waists . Trask , with the boathook in his hand , had caught the boat before it drifted out of reach . But it must have turned completely over in the water , and righted again on the other side . There was not an article of all our belongings - camp utensils , provisions , rifles , clothes , or fishing tackle - left inside . And , with the other things , the bag containing the Gold Heart was gone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon found we could see our properties as they lay scattered on the river 's bottom . Undressing and hanging our clothes on the trees to dry , we waded out into the stream again , and commenced the work of salvage . One by one we found our several effects , - rifles and saucepans and axes , clothes and boots , even knives and spoons and flasks , - everything except the bag with the Gold Heart . All the next day we spent in searching , and there was not a foot of the river bottom for a distance of more than a hundred yards which we did not pass over many times . While engaged in the hunt we were joined by a party of French Canadians , who , inheriting the instincts and skill of their old voyageur ancestors , had been engaged all the summer in carrying goods to the mines in a light " dug-out " bateau , which made the perilous trip down the stream easily enough in two days and a half , but which it took a week of hard poling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , loaded with freight , from the fort to the mines . This party came laboriously up // stream as we stood in the water looking for the missing bag . The situation having been explained to them , they joined us in the search . But it was fruitless . Next morning we separated , - the Canadians resuming their toilsome progress up stream , and our party continuing its more rapid journey to the lake . So for the second time the Gold Heart was lost . I spent the greater part of the winter that followed on Puget Sound . I was in Portland , Oregon , at the time of the election of President Cleveland , going thence to Tacoma , where I passed Christm*s and New Year 's Day . Late in January I came east as far as Spokane Falls , and after a stay there of ten days , or so , started again early in February for New York , intending to break my journey at Minneapolis . It was to the train on which I was traveling that there occurred the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just east of the town of Glendive , in Montana , the track , after running for a distance of some rods along the top of an embankment , crosses a narrow gully on a trestle bridge . An early thaw had loosened the road-bed , and a land-slide had carried away two rails on the south side with it . It was late at night when the crash came , and I was asleep . Of the whole train , the sleeping-car alone was not overturned , so that it was not for some minutes - until I had dressed and made my way out of the car - that I learned that there had been a serious accident . The engine had left the track just before reaching the trestle , and had plunged headlong into the ravine , followed by the baggage-car and one other . Two day coaches and the dining-car had rolled off the embankment just before reaching the trestle , and were lying on their sides below . The sleeping-car , though it had left the rail , stood upright by itself upon the ties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dead being employees of the company . Of the other four , three were killed in the wreck ; and the manner of the death of the fourth will probably recall the accident to the minds of readers . As I jumped from the platform of the sleeper , the flames were just breaking out from one of the overturned coaches , which had caught fire , presumably from a stove . Fortunately , the passengers had been extricated , so that the flames could at least do no damage to life . Approaching the burning coach , I saw a knot of people gathered about the next car . As I clambered towards them along the side of the embankment , that strange solemnity about their attitudes and movements told me that they were in the presence of death . Edging through the by-standers , I came to where two persons lay , - a woman and her child , clasped in each other 's arms , pinned down by the heavy timbers , so that it might take an hour to extricate them , - dead . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car , their faces looked strangely , piteously white , as they lay upturned to the sky . Close beside them kneeled , motionless , a man , whom I conjectured to be the woman 's husband . For some minutes he remained kneeling , with bowed head , when without a word he rose and walked slowly and mechanically away . Hidden for a space in shadow , he emerged again into the light , and , too quickly for any hope of interference , I saw it done . He raised his hand , placed a pistol to the side of his head , and fired . It was done decidedly and without a moment 's hesitation . Almost before he had fallen half a dozen men besides myself were at his side ; but he was too far gone to speak , and died a few minutes afterward where we had laid him , with his head resting against his child 's face , and his hand clasping the hand of his dead wife . // By a curious coincidence , not only was I the only person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first to find the body of the last of the eight who were killed . He was lying on the upper side of the same car , almost hidden beneath the timbers which crushed him against the side of the embankment . At my call the others came scrambling up to where I stood , and between us we lifted the heavy beams which lay across him . He also was already dead . We first uncovered his head and breast , on which his right hand lay doubled . Another timber was moved , and exposed his body to the waist and the left arm , which lay outstretched at right angles to the body . Once more , gleaming now in the red light of the flames , I saw , clenched in dead fingers , the Gold Heart . The man was never identified , and I know no more how the nugget passed from the bottom of the Cceur d'Alene River to his hand than I know how it made its way from my bag to the Indian whom Chapman killed on the mountain-side . The Heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course passed into the custody of the Northern Pacific Railroad Company . Arriving in Minneapolis , I put in a formal claim to the nugget as being my property , less from any expectation of recovering it than from a hope of learning something of the dead man and of how it came into his possession . The correspondence with the company is before me as I write this . The first letter , dated " St. Paul , Minn. , February 16 , 1885 , " simply informs me that mine " of the 13th inst. is at hand , and will receive prompt consideration in company with the other claims growing out of the accident to this company 's train at Glendive , Mont. , on the 7th of this month . " This is signed by the general claim agent of the Northern Pacific Railroad Company . There was an interval of two weeks b*. fore he wrote again , and I remember that this letter reached me at Willard 's Hotel , in Washington , whither I had gone to see the ceremonies of the inauguration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1885 , " and notifies me curtly that " we are informed by counsel that you have no claim to the Gold Heart , for the handing over of which you make demand in yours of the 13th inst. ( already replied to ) . Under these circumstances we must respectfully decline to entertain any application from you in regard to it . We would add , moreover , that other disposition has already been made of the property in question . " Wondering what this " other disposition " could be , I wrote again on the 7th of March , and in reply received the following letter : - Northern Pacific R. R. Co. , General Claim Agent 's Office . ST . PAUL , Mii*x. , March 10 , 1885 . DEAR Sin , - Replying to yours of the 7th , would say that , as you have already been advised , this company does not recognize that you have any claim to the Gold Heart which was among the properties saved from the wreck on our line on the 7th ult . The circumstances connected with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this company , and as I gather from other sources , are so curious that I am inclined to give you the explanation which you ask for as to the disposition which has been made of the same . If you will refer to mine of the 2d , you will find that you are in error in quoting me as saying that this company has made any disposition of the nugget . I wrote you that " other disposition " had been made of it . Briefly , the Heart simply disappeared . After being recovered from the accident it was turned over to the custody of the company 's agent at Glendive , and on the 11th ult. was forwarded by him to this office . Our agent at Glendive , I may say , is a gentlemaim of whose pro-0 // bity we can entertain no question . As it happens , moreover , this Heart was placed by him in a sealed package , in the presence of more than one witness , and handed to the agent of the Express Company . Inclosed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman 's bracelet , a piece of a watchchain , two pocket-knives , a purse , seven dollars and twenty cents in coin , and two five-dollar bills , - all having been recovered from the same accident . The package was duly delivered to this office on the 14th of February , with the seal unbroken . All the other articles specified in the invoice were found intact , but the Gold Heart was missing . The package had been in the Express Company 's safe , untouched , from Glendive to St. Paul , and it seems impossible that it can have been tampered with in any way . I am entirely at a loss to give any explanation of the occurrence . In case any valid claim to the property was put in , presumably this company could hold the Express Company responsible for the loss . But , as you are aware , we do not recognize your claim as valid . I am yours , etc. , On a later visit to St. Paul I made inquiries at the company 's office , and saw all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the agent at Glendive and the representatives of the Express Company . Doubtless they are still on file at the same place . In the summer of the same year business took me again to the Pacific coast , and while in the West I made a series of expeditions , in the saddle , across the various unsettled sections of Washington Territory and Oregon , with Mr. Chapman once more for a companion . It was on one of these expeditions that I had the opportunity of witnessing that , to me , most interesting of the ceremonies now to be seen among the Northwestern Indians , the annual intertribal pony race of the Yakimas and Uinatillas . The race-course was on the prairie , indistinguishable from any other piece of prairie except by the two small stakes driven into the ground , to serve for starting and winning post respectively . The race itself was a short dash of something less than a quarter of a mile . It was a surprise to us to find ourselves the only white persons present , though by no means a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the entire membership of both tribes , male and female , infant and adult , was assembled . We arrived late in the afternoon of a still , sultry day ; but the race would not take place until after sundown , so we had leisure enough to study the scene and be studied ourselves . In the background on either hand , standing out from the hot , yellow plain , were the conical , smoke-stained teepees , each with its bunch in all directions , bands of ponies dotted the prairie ,  --  white , and piebald , and " buckskin , " and bay . Among the teepees the squaws sat in groups , chatting , making bead-work , or engaged in camp preparations of various kinds . The bucks were mostly inside their tents , though here and there a party stood talking , or a solitary figure on pony-back moved slowly across the level ground . About the women , rolling on the ground or straying over the prairie , were children , of all ages ; and mixed with them , forming a constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , almost countless in number , long , and gaunt , and hungry , showing in every point and movement the strain of wild coyote blood . As we rode up to one of the villages // or clumps of teepees , - the camp of the Yakimas , it proved to be , - the whole canine population poured out to greet us , a yelling , snarling , howling pack , reminding me of Carlyle 's " universal dog-kennel ; " snapping at our ponies ' heels , and circling round us just out of reach of our whips . As we approached , the children came to reinforce the dogs , the squaws gathered slowly into larger groups , and one by one the men appeared in the entrances to the teepees . Riding up to one of the bucks , we succeeded , by much improvised gesticulations , eked out with what little we knew of the Jndiaii sign-language , in assuring ourselves that we should not be disappointed in our expectation of seeing the race that evening . Before we had managed to arrive at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , while the dogs , which had relapsed or been beaten by the squaws into quietude , slunk away . Appearing as indifferent as we might to the hundred eyes that were upon us , we dismounted , slipped the nooses of our lariats over our ponies ' heftds , and sat down in the shadow of a teepee to wait for the race , allowing our animals to stray as far as the length of the lariat would permit them , while we held the ends in our hands to guard against any attempt to *tampede them . We had nearly two hours to wait for the race . The race itself - the short skurry of two seedy-looking ponies over a few hundred yards of prairie , each with a yellow Indian rider on its back - was not particularly interesting . But there was interest enough in the accompanying ceremonies . The Indian is a born gambler , and at these races both tribes bet recklessly , so that one lives in poverty and the other in affluence for the next twelve months . The method of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bucks of both tribes being gathered near the winning - post , an old grayhaired chief , chosen by common consent , squatted upon his heels , with a long spear driven into the ground beside him . His duty it was to see that the betting was fairly done on either side . As soon as he had taken his station a tall Umatilla buck approached , and threw a Winchester rifle on the ground in front of the old nian . It had n9t lain there ten seconds before a similar rifle , belonging to a Yakima , was by its side . Another Umatilla stepped up and deposited beside the rifles a necklace of elk teeth , to match which a Yakima deposited a large hunting - knife . So rifles were matched with rifles , skins with skins ; necklaces , bracelets , and coins were flung down , and offset with other necklaces , bracelets , and coins , or with knives or bears ' claws , moccasins , powder-horns , or belts . The pile grew steadily , till a wagonon-load of Indian valuables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all done in almost total silence . Occasionally a discontented grunt would show that some bettor was not satisfied with the equivalent of his stake , when a few words from the old man would either silence him , or , as the case might be , make the party of the second part throw down a coin or a ring to piece out the value of his wager . For half an hour , perhaps , we had watched , when suddenly there was a movement of excitement among the stolid bucks . A tall Yakima , whom I had not noticed before , strode out , and , with a magnificent gesture , flung down upon the heap - the Gold Heart ! I could hardly trust my eyes , and scarcely noticed the murmur of grunts which ran through the crowd - grunts of astonishment , of gratification , and of disgust - as the great lump of gold was thrown down . Stepping forward , after handing my lariat to Chapman , I made it understood by gestures that I wished to be permitted to look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked it up and gave it to me . There was no doubt of its being the same Gold Heart . On one side the sharp point of crystal stuck out , and on the other , faint but still discernible , were the marks of Trask 's knife . The gruntings and exclamations which had greeted the appearance of the nugget were suddenly silenced as an Umatilla stepped out , and , with a ring of defiance in his voice , made a short speech to the judge and the assembled crowd , at intervals waving his arm in the direction of a large band of ponies which were browsing on the prairie . Some haggling and bargaining followed , ending apparently satisfactorily , for the Umatilla and half a dozen of his companions separated themselves from the crowd , and rode off toward the ponies . Watching , we could see them " cutting out " certain animals from the band . Presently , having collected those that they wanted , they drove them leisurely to where we were standing . We counted the ponies as they were driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought close to the judge for his inspection . He was evidently satisfied , and the forty ponies were left standing huddled together , the stake matched against the Gold Heart . Then came the race . It was very brief . Reversing the usage of civilization , the riders made a terrible uproar , while the on-lookers gazed in profound silence . The representative of the Umatillas won , in racing parlance , by half a head , and the Indians again clustered round the aged judge , who had not left his place . Before a word was said , the Umatilla who had wagered the ponies pushed his way through the surrounding bucks , and , striding up to where the Gold Heart lay glittering on the pile of skins and Indian valuables , stooped and picked it up in his left hand . He looked at it a moment , and then exultingly raised it above his head . Suddenly another figure stepped up to him , the Yakima , with a look of rage upon his face . Flinging his blanket aside , he too raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a long-bladed knife in the air , and without a groan the victorious Umatilla fell on the ground . Death must have been instantaneous , for he lay absolutely still . At full length he lay , with his legs out straight , his face turned up to the sky , his right arm bent across his breast , his left stretched out at right angles to his body , and the fingers clutched the Gold Heart . Immediately an indescribable clamor arose , and Chapman and I , already in the saddle , disengaged ourselves from the throng as quickly as we could . In accordance , presumably , with established custom , all appeared to be unarmed , and while the babel of tongues was deafening , there was no sign of what we had expected to see , a hand-to-hand , roughand-tumble fight . But gradually the clump of men began to disintegrate , and , in two bodies , the members of the respective tribes hurried off in the direction of their several villages , the Uinatillas taking with them the dead man and the heap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fearing serious trouble , turned our horses ' heads for the Agency , twenty miles away . It was a long ride , and must have been hard on the animals we rode , but by ten o'clock we had reached the Agency , - " Joris and I. " Hurriedly telling the agent what had happened , we pushed on to the fort , two miles distant , leaving him to follow . Colonel Grace , a grizzled , soldierlike man , heard our story , and gave his orders without waste of time . Before eleven o'clock he had started for the race-course at the head of a company of cavalry . It was nearly noon when the party returned , bringing with them an Indian whom we recognized at once as the Yakiina murderer . The affair // had ended peaceably enough . The Indian nowadays - with the exception possibly of one or two tribes - is not a precipitate fighter . If the soldiers had not arrived , bloodshed would probably have followed , but both tribes seemed glad enough of the excuse of foregoing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a turbulent fellow and little liked , had been surrendered willingly , to be dealt with by the white man 's laws ; and the two tribes , instead of fostering a feud , had sensibly concluded to unite in a grand funeral celebration in honor of the dead man , whose relatives had been appeased with presents of ponies from the Yakima bands . " And by the bye , " said the colonel , who had told us all this as we sat at September , luncheon in his quarters , " when did you last see the Heart ? " glancing alternately at Chapman and me . " In his hand , " I said , - " the dead man 's hand , as he lay outstretched on the ground . " " They think you stole it , " he remarked quietly . " Who ? I ? " " One of you . " " Why , has it disappeared again ? " " Not again ' that I know of , " said Colonel Grace , " for I had not heard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has disappeared now . No one could be found who saw it after the dead man fell . " But we had not stolen it . Nor have I heard of or seen it since . Harry P. Robinson .
