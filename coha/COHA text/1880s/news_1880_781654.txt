txt Every right-minded citizen should be glad to do anything to resist the popular tendency to excessive drinking , and to add to the counter-attraction of sober sociality . Words can hardly exaggerate the evils which afflict this City from intemperance . Thousands of homes are continually devastated by it ; the hearts of women broken , and children turned friendless on the streets . - And beyond this misery , an enormous amount of the offenses against property and person arise from it . It is the one source beyond all others , of crime and human suffering . And yet the opposers and reformers of intemperance have to consider , carefully the causes of all this . We are to put ourselves in the places of working men and boys , busy at trades ; we must imagine the man returning home from his long day , tired , with nerves unstrung , to a small , perhaps dirty , room , without any of the relaxation of the richer classes in books and pictures , or the young man living in the hall bedroom of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tenement-house . Near their quarters are light , pleasant , warm saloons , withpapers and . society , and . all that a working man wants to spend an agreeable evening . Even without the stimulating glass , there would be enough here to attract any working man or boy who had no comfortable home . But the stimulus itself is an immense temptation . It changes fatigue to animation , low spirits to cheerfulness , drowns care , creates society , and , were that all , would be a blessing to human life . But the peculiarity of this stimulus , and especially of the liquor-saloons , is , that moderation is almost unknown among the working classes , wherever the extreme alcoholic beverages are employed . The custom of treating among laboring men is even more rigorous than in any other class ; then the form of alcohol used is the worst and most destructive , and a man beginning sociality in a whisky-saloon , ends almost invariably as a common tippler in the streets . The question then comes up , " Can not an attraction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the whiskysaloon I " Of course , nothing can fully compete with alcoholic stimulus as an attraction ; still it has been found in . Great Britain that among the working men coffee and coffee-houses can often hold their own against the attractions of the public liquorhouses . Any student of the history of customs will recall what a prodigious lessening of intemperance ensued in London and other British cities when coffee was first introduced and coffee-houses were opened , in the . seventeenth century . Probably , no one habit has so lessened the power of alcohlic beverages in the world as that of tea and coffee drinking . It is not incredible that the world will yet see the introduction of some other comparatively harmlesss stimulus , such , for instance , as the matai plant , from the extreme portion of South America  --  which shall even more break the power of King Alcohol . Within this generation a new effort has been commenced in Great Britian , which is sowing a harvest of good among the laboring classes  --  the opening of attractive sociable coffee-houses in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These are not uncommonly started by joint-stock companies which place them in various quarters , as they see need of them . Doing business on so large a scale , these associations are enabled to purchase their material at the lowest market rates , and . to supplement the losses of a coffee-house in an unfavorable quarter , by the profits of one placed in a more fortunate locality . Then , their large enterprise gives them soon a valuable experience , which enables them to provide in the best way for the wants of working men . The different companies in Liverpool , London , Glasgow and other ton-ns have not only planted numerous very attractive social resorts for the laboring people of these cities , but they have paid their stockholders very handsome profits on their investment . The coffeehouses have proved very formidable competitors to the " public houses . " Thousands of working men have been attracted . to temperate social resorts , and thus saved from the temptations of the ' gin. - shops . The whole movement has been one of the wisest ever set on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading citizens have formed a joint-stock company , to carry out precisely , the objects of these British associations . It is called the " New-York Coffee-House Company , ( Limited , ) " and its capital is to be $50,000 in 2,000 shares of $25 each . It proposes to plant in various quarters in New-York , agreeable coffee-rooms. furnished with miners and magazines , and , wherever practicable , having private rooms for clubs or as reading-rooms . These houses are all made as attractive , as beer-gardens or liquor-saloons . They are to be the social resorts , the clubs , and . saloons of working men . The wung are tempted to them , as places where they can find papers , society , cheerful , warm rooms , and all that they seek in liquor shops . The stimulus will be coffee or tea . And it is intended to make a business of the movement ; to found it on commercial principles . The coffee-houses are to be made to pay .
