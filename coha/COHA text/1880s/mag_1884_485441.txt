Almost every page has its illustration , and each illustration is fully deseribed-in a note at the front of the volume . Mrs. Green and Miss Norgate show no falling-off in their aptitude for selecting designs , views , portraits , caricatures , facsimiles , which embody the spirit of the age .

So is that of Dent 's faultless three-volume edition of Frances Burney 's Cecilia ' in the Jane Austen style , long since approved of amateurs-and of the public ( Macmillan ) . Canon Ainger easily finds a bridge from Lamb to Hood in the preface to Macmillan 's holiday edition of the Humorous Poems ' of the latter , and Charles E. Brock contributes an ample number of designs not irresistibly comic , but always graceful , and much in the vein of Hugh Thomson . This - volume , too , must be heartily commended . From the same house we receive the revised edition of Miss Swanwick 's translation of the first part of Goethe 's Faust ' ( London George Bell &; Sons ) , to which , as if to emphasize the age of this version , more than forty years , Retzsch 's outline illustrations have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of date From A C. McClurg &; Co. , Chicago , we have two dainty volumes in the " Elizabethan Library " of Elliot Stock , Thoughts that Breathe , ' from Bacon , and ' A Bower of Delights , ' from Nicholdi Breton , - both selected by A. B. Grocart , with indications of the sources and with occasional annotations . They are both , in form and contents , most companionable . Paragraph-Writing ' ( Boston Allyn &; Bacon ) is an enlarged and improved edition of an excellent little pamphlet published a few years ago by Profs . Scott and Denney . Until very recently the word and the sentence were the only units assumed in the study of composition , and text-books on rhetoric thought their duty done when they had treated the uses of words and the various forms of sentence structure . Of late years , however , it has been cus466 The IsTation . Vol. 57 , No. 1486 tomary to recognize the importance of the paragraph , and even of larger units of structure Falling in with this theory , and relegating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of words , the-authors of the present work aim " to - make the paragraph the basis of a method of composition , and to present all the important facts of rhetoric in their application to the paragraph " More than hall of the book is devoted to exercises of various kinds , or to lists of subjects or topics which the student may treat Some weeks ago we called attention to Mr. G. P Baker's- Specimen Briefs , ' as admirably designed for use in teaching argumentative composition , a rhetorical exercise of great practical value to which many colleges are beginning to give special attention . The same author has now compiled and edited a little volume of Specimens of Argumentation ' ( Henry Holt &; Co . ) The specimens are some half-a-dozen in number and consist mostly of political speeches , beginning with Lord Chatham on removing his Majesty 's troops from Boston , and ending with Henry Ward Beecher 's defence of the North at Liverpool in 1863 . All will be found valuable for illustration of logical and argumentative principles and as a basis for exercises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be well to insert a table of contents , and , as the book is one of a uniform series , to letter it on the back as well as on the side . Mr W. S. Jackman of the Cook Coilnty , Ill , Normal School has published a little book , entitled Number Work in Nature Study , ' in which he - develops a methoa whereby the scholar is led to prepare his own arithmetical examples , on the basis of elementary scientific observation . In this way , while the scholar becomes expert in matters of ratios , percentages , and so on , his interest is properly directed to the results that he gains rather than to the method of obtaining them . For example , an exercise adapted to the early months of the school year is in part as follows : Of one hundred leaves examined , how many have not been injured or used in any way-by animals 9 How many have been in part devoured 7 How many have been used in mating nests or cocoons 7 Of a hundred leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc , which has the greatest number of leaves injured 9 Then , what part of thaentire number of leaves has been stung by insects in laying their eggs What is the ratio of those injured to those un --  injured 9 What percentage of the whole number has been more or less eaten ? And so on , with many different exercises , arranged for successive autumnal months . A number of - publications of the United States Geological Survey have been distributed during the past season . Chief among these is the Eleventh Annual Report of the Director , long delayed , and less interesting thaff its predecessors from lack of variety in its essays . It is in two volumes , of which the second treats of irrigation , a subject which no longer touches the duties of the Survey ; but a bibliography of irrigation in this volume will be of permanent value . The volume on geology has nearly two hundred pages of administrative reports , and the rest of the book is taken up with McGee 's monographic essay on Northeastern Iowa , nearly four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural gas in Indiana . The chief lesson of the latter is the same as is taught by all students of this new fuel , namely , the wastefulness of its use under high pressure and for rough purposes , and the certainty that the wells now in use will be exhausted faster than they are supplied by the production of gas within the earth . In the second edition of his char-Ming ' book entitled - 'Nos ' Adieux a , la Vieille Sorbonne , ' M. Greard adds a note describing his discovery , on September 30 last , of a tablet commemorating the rebuilding of the Sorbonne by Richelieu in 1627 . The tablet is of copper , 51 cm. broad and 60 cm. high The inscription is well preserved , and is reproduced in full by M. GrOard .

The Calendar of the Imperial University of Japan for 1892- ' 93 shows the steady development and healthy growth of that institution , and of the colleges of law , medicine , engineering , literature , science , and agriculture which-compose it While most of the iustrucfors are Japanese graduates of foreign universities , there is yet a goodly number of Europeans and Americans associated with them A map accompanies the book , showing how the spacious enclosure known as- the gaga Yashiki , and once occupied by the retainers of one of the richest and most powerful of the feudal daimios , is now full of substantial structures devoted to science , instruction , and residence of the professors . Of the full graduates , reckoning from 1876 , 1,785 are now living , most of them in active public or private service . Their average age is twenty-five . The length of the curricula in the college of law is now four years . On the 18th of August , 1892 , the new and imposing library builduigs were completed. - The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of medicine and science are numerous and creditable , but on the page devoted to " contents of the memoirs of the literature college , " Prof. ' Chamberlain 's Amo studies stand in lonely majesty . How long can the Japanese allow this disproportion to exist 9 Parts 19-23 of the great Atlas of the Civil War , in course of issuance by the War Department , are largely occupied with Virginia , in which State the region about Richmond and Petersburg , and the battlefields of Winchester , Fisher 's Hill , and Cedar Creek , are particular= ly well mapped .

We notice a timely list of " Napoleana " ( as the editor designates the Napoleonic memoirs , new and old ) , and other similar lists of " Choice Books " are to follow . Dr Ellis 's long article on " A Non-Sectarian Theological School " is the most valuable in the contents of the current Harvard Graduates ' Magazine . Historically , as to the original aim of that college to train ministers especially , and as to the origin of the Divinity School , with its absence of tests for students or instructors , it is instructive if not complete in its survey Without allusion to Parker or Emerson , it makes a just distinction between Umtarianism and Liberal Christianity , intimating the author 's sympathy with Cha.nning in his dislike to the denominational name . It casts doubt upon the success of the proposed addition to the Harvard Divinity School of " courses representing different systems of theology , " as an absolute novelty " Schools of theology , " says Dr. Ellis , " have-always and without exception been identified- with and pledged exclusively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if we understand him , he does except the Divinity School in the intent of its founders and in its organic constitution , which were Liberal Christian and not Unitarian He seems to attribute the decline of the School to the creeping in of the Unitarian designation and control , and he certainly - regrets the failure of his efforts forty years ago to effect a legal separation of the School from the College . Mr. Bolles 's skilful summary of the University at the opening of the academic year possesses the usual interest , and will be widely approved for its frank remarks on the duty of the faculty to suppress the rem , nant of " Bloody Monday " rioting and the scandalous disorders of Commencement Day The London Tunes publishes an appeal from Mrs. Agnes S. Lewis to British and American scholars in behalf of the library in the famous convent of St Katharine on Mt . Sinai This lady , well known as a Syriac and Greek scholar and the discoverer in this library of apparently the earliest known version of the Four Gospels , says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a library , but that the manuscripts are kept in wooden chests in various small chambers and are suffering from want of light and air . Nor is there any place where they can be conveniently consulted . Plans have been prepared by a competent architect for a separate building , provided with bookcases , tables , etc , for the use of foreign scholars , at a cost of from $15,000 to $20,000 . The monastery is now too poor to raise this sum , " its landed property in Russia , Rumania , and Egypt having become depreciated , so that it has barely enough for the frugal sustenance of its thirty-five monks and of the troops of Bedaween who have , to be kept by it from starving during the long months when travellers do not want their camels " Mrs. Lewis adds that the monks are not the unlettered men which some travellers have represented them to be , but that they appreciate the value of their library and desire to give every facility to scholars to make use of it University Extension has reached the continent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undertaken under the auspices of the University of Ghent with great success . A similar movement has been started in Brussels , where the society having the work in charge is presided over by the rector of the University . In both cases the lines marked out by the University Extension movement in England are closely followed . How cheap flag-patriotism is , is shown by the cm-rent demonstrations in behalf of the Hawaiian usurpation . Still , as it seemed to need strengthening , a movement was initiated a few years since to supply ' every public schoolhouse in the country with the stars and stripes , and it has been at least as contagious as tree-planting . A Boston firm of expert engravers , A W. Elson &; Co , have conceived the notion that every school should have a portrait of Washington , at least , and this we take to be amore useful undertaking than the other . Among all the available portraits , they have wisely chosen the Stuart head in ' the Boston Atheneum , and have copied it and the Martha Washington in photogravure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The public will certainly not let these prints be monopolized by the schools . Messrs . Eisen propose to popularize the likenesses of other great men in the same manner . as John Jay and Longfellow , to mention those we have seen , Lincoln and Marshall , which are to follow Of these , too , we may hope the schools will get their share . - What the men represented stand for can be shown them or they can learn , what the flag stands for at any given moment is known to how many of us  --  even to the patriotic author of ' The Man without a Country ' ? ? There is very little of Washington in Dr. J M. Toner 's latest issue of his series , containing the journal of the Fort Necessity adventure , 1754 . The journal is known only through a translation into French , in which the personal " flavor " was lost and the original writing probably garbled To render the record back into English must have still further diluted this flavor , and left less of the personality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of June 27th , Dr Toner has compiled a continuation , " gathered from sources believed to be reliable , " but , of course , not containing -a line by Washington as diarist . - Upon this material the editor hangs copious notes , and expands the volume to 273 pages . In the absence of the young Virginian , attention may be directed to Dr Toner 's methods . There are the same minute study of detail , the same wide knowledge of men and affairs of Virgima colonial days , the same love and enthusiasm for his subject , as have marked his other issues of Washington material . For all this the editor is to be praised , and the general accuracy of his comments compensates for their diffuseness He has drawn largely upon the rolls of the companies , and account-books , letters , and notes , and no student of early Virginian history can pass by these volumes , which contain so much , and are made so convenient for use by a full index ( Albany ; Munsell ) ? Attention must still be called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope ever to master all the lore of Washington 's life and character . If Dr. Toner wishes to make his edition the final compilation , he should draw freely upon the work of those who have labored in the same field . Sparks , Brock , and other editors are frequently mentioned , but it is strange that , with all his wide reading , Dr Toner has apparently never met with Ford 's Writings of Washington , ' the latest attempt to give a general survey of the material at hand . Had this work been consulted , the notes of the editor could have been more complete , and his sense of justice would not have permitted him to make the claim of discovering that the MS. of the journal was captured at Fort Necessity , and not at Monongahela , as Sparks asserted . Nor would he have been in such doubt about the date of Washington 's commission as a heutenant-colonel , for Mr. Ford notes that Washington began to draw the pay of a lieutenant-colonel on March 20 , .1751 ; and the pay would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named the cadets taken with Jumonville as he did . Faulty as Mr. Ford 's collection may . be , there is much of value to complete such a record as Dr. Toner sets out to make . Some other errors have also crept into this volume V anbraam could not - have been in the " thirtieth " battalion of the Sixtieth Regathent , as no regiment had more than four- battalions He was in the third battalion The Indian Half-King is sometimes given - Tanacharison and sometimes Tenacharison The old form anglois appears as ttnglais in the capitulation , and Peyton is printed Payton ? In Ballads and Poems relating to the Burgoyne Campaign , ' Mr. W. L. Stone has brought together well-nigh three-sCore poems , as various in merit as in length . Some are only couplets or quatrains , others drag their slow length along through fifty pages , but all have a sort of interest , even those inspired in later generations ; most of all those struck out in the burden and heat of the day . It is a satisfaction to see these effusions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr Stone 's steadfast endeavors , committed to the art preservative . The volume figures as No. 20 in Munsell 's Historical Series ( Albany ) , is printed on substantial paper , with broad margins , and in large type ? Half-a-dozen previous monographs by Mr Stone concerning divers specialties in Burgoyne 's campaign have made him an authority on all minutiae regarding it . His pains to learn the truth if possible by personal observation , or at least by interviews with witnesses as nearly as possible contemporary , his indefatigable correspondence and research in archives , prove his work to be a labor of love , and leave scanty fragments for any who shall glean after him in his chosen field : In regard to one particular , however , namely , the color of Miss Jenny McCrea 's hair ( discussed on page 206 ) , which was sometimes described to have been " dark as a raven 's wing , " we can strengthen Col. Stone 's proofs which demonstrate rather thinly that that hair was a blonde or golden brown The present writer has of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who in 1777 was a neighbor of Miss McCrea ( for she lived about a mile north of Sandy Hill , which lies but two miles from the McCrea home in Fort Edward ) , say that Miss McCrea 's hair was red  --  a blunter term for golden ? Miss Katherine Lee Bates 's The English Religious Drama ' ( Macmillan ) shows independent study of the old miracle plays , as well as study of the best and most recent authorities . The four cycles , the Chester , Coventry , Towneley , and York plays  --  the last after Miss L T. Smith 's complete edition  --  are treated , and the Digby Mysteries , the Cornish plays , and several isolated miracle plays are also included , The work is written in a popular style , as it consists of ' " a brief course of lectures delivered in the summer school of Colorado Springs , July , 1893 , " growing out of which circumstance are occasional bits of " fine writing " that might have been toned down in the revision for publication .

M Compayre was duly impressed with the fact that " universities " in this country are on as large a scale as the country itself , and not a little perplexed by their great variety in standard . " What first struck me , " he says , " was the considerable number of distinct buildings that occupy the college campus . An American university is a world by itself ; and perhaps a little mixed up with schools of a widely different character . The American university comprises not only the four or five traditional faculties of the . Old World , but it maintains , m imitation of the universities of the Middle Ages , a college where secondary instruction is given It stretches out towards intellectual activity of every kind , and does not disdain to enrich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the study of the practical applications of all forms of knowledge . " M Compayre regards with justifiable surprise the fact that in 1889 we maintained twenty-one schools of law - that had less - than ten students each . At Yale he was astounded to learn that the method of instruction in law was by memorizing the pages of a textbook , and evidently is restrained by a feeling of courtesy towards his hosts from expressing himself on this point as strongly as he feels This sentence , too , should not be overlooked : " It must not be forgotten , " continues M. Compayrd , " that the United States have no standing army . I have , it is true , seen colonels , but they were in command of normal schools . I have even seen a general , but he had directed the Bureau of Education before Dr. W. T Harris , the present Commissioner . " ? ?
