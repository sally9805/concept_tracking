CHARLES STEWART PARNELL . By U/i//lam Clarke , ALA . I N view of the approaching victory of Mr. Parnell 's Home Rule movement , it may be worth our while to endeavor to estimate the value of that movement , and the character of the remarkable man with whom it will be forever intimately associated . Those who are fond of tracing historical parallels will be interested in observing that Parnell was born just one hundred years after Grattan , and that while the latter entered the old Irish Parliament in 1775 , Mr. Parnell first entered the British Parliament just a century later , in 1875 . Beyond these singular coincidences , however , the two great Protestant parliamentary leaders have nothing in common . Grattan was a splendid orator in the palmy days of British oratory - the days of Pitt and Fox , of Sheridan and Erskine . He was from the first a close friend of the great Whig leaders , and desired nothing more // than the introduction of recognized Whig principles into the government of Ireland . He was a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open light of day , and never in any way complicating his movement with any social question . His aims were strictly limited . It must not be supposed for one moment that Grattan had any particular sympathy with the poverty-stricken Irish peasantry , or that he and his friends intended to specifically benefit them . His ideal was a national Irish government in the hands of the Irish gentry , Catholic and Protestant alike . Beyond that he had no further vision . In short , he was a patriot of the highest character , anin*ated by the spirit and pursuing the general limited aims of eighteenth century constitutional Whiggism . Mr. Parnell , on the other hand , is as little of a typical Irishman as any man can well be . Partly American by extraction , mainly English by education , with the tone and habits of a country gentleman , one would say that Mr. Parnell was not at all the kind of man to lead the Irish democracy . Cold and impassive in demeanor , almost frigidly polite , Mr. Parnell differs from all previous Irish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Antony he has neither Charles Stewart Parnell . // " action nor eloquence nor the power of speech to stir men 's blood . " Could such a man possibly be a successor of Daniel O'Connell ? Let us note the character of the Irish representation and the position of the Home Rule movement when Parnell first entered Parliament . No country ever had a more feeble and useless body of representatives than had Ireland from the downfall of O'Connell to the rise of the Parnellite party . It was a body mainly composed of hirelings , sycophants , and place-hunters . The XVhig and Tory faction fight , meaningless and hypocritical , was kept up in Ireland , each of these English parties having its Irish contingent which looked out for the good things of office when its friends came into power . Whatever of genuine Irish agitation there was prevailed outside the ranks of the parliamentary representation . The Irish members , for the most part , did nothing but vote with their party . They were not dependent upon the people , for the suffrage was so limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil influences of Irish landlordism were working with deadly effect on the condition of the people ; but excepting to appoint a royal commission to inquire into the matter , nothing was done . The Tory and Whig members did not lift a little finger to improve the state of what they called " their country . " Had the governing class in Ireland been xvise it would have foreseen the evil day coming when the old economic condition must break down . But blind , ignorant , selfish , it paid no heed to the omens of coming change . It sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play . Meantime the most cruel rack-renting was going on , Irishmen were leaving their country by millions , and one of the most terrible famines on record had stalked through the land . Two important movements mark this period , viz. : the Young Ireland and the Fenian agitations . In the former agitation mingled some of the finest spirits Ireland has ever produced . John Mitchell , Thomas Davis , Thomas Francis Meagher , Francis Kearney , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martin are among the best-known men of the movement . They were all alive with national Irish sentiment , with the romanticism of the time , with fine and generous sympathies . But the movement was vague and thin , and , like the contemporary Chartist movement in England , was almost completely extinguished . More formidable , because less emotional and more practical , was the Fenian movement , which culminated in the years 1866-67 . Mr. Gladstone had the singular candor to confess that it was this movement which led him seriously to consider the Irish question and to prepare his measure* for the disestablishment of the Anglican Church in Ireland . It is interesting to note that just as the Volunteer movement in the last century which gave such substantial aid to Grattan derived its inception from the American War of Independence , so did the Fenian movement of our time arise out of the great number of armed Irishmen who had served in the Federal armies in the American Civil War . The underlying idea of the Fenians was to secure Irish independence by force of arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And now consider the origin of the Home Rule movement , and its parliamentary representation at the time of Mr. Parnell 's entrance into public life . Linked in historical continuity with the past of Irish nationalism , the Home Rule movement , like that of Grattan , was originally distinctly a movement of the wellto-do classes . The meeting at Dublin in 1870 , at which the new Home Rule organization was started , was largely attended by landlords and Conservative politicians . The new movement found a leader in Isaac Butt , an eloquent Dublin lawyer who was generally conservative in politics . There was no doubt that the Irish gentry desired to direct the public life of Ireland . Had the British Conservatives been wiser people than they are they would have made terms with the Home Rulers , so as to start a national Irish government under Conservative auspices . It is said that Disraeli was advised to " buy Butt " ; and it is strange , especially when we remember Disraeli 's deep insight into the Irish problem , that he never did so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party . At the general election of 1874 the Home Rulers first made an attempt to secure representation in Parliament , and several of their men were elected , with // Mr. Butt as the leader . Mr. Butt introduced a Home Rule resolution into Parliament in June , 1874 , which was scouted and rejected by both the English parties , with the exception of half a dozen advanced Radicals who gave it their support . Then it was that Mr. Parnell came upon the scene . Mr. Parnell saw very clearly that Mr. Butt might continue moving his parliamentary resolution till the Greek Kalends , without making any impression on the solid , combined Liberal and Tory vote . Another method must be adopted , viz. , to break down the British parliamentary machine by the introduction of a third party hostile to both the English parties , and by practising a system of obstruction . The idea was well conceived and was thoroughly successful . The whole of the British political system turns on the pivot of Parliament ; and Parliament can only do its work when there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are united on fundamental questions . Introduce a third party , assist the process of disintegration into groups , and the English system has received a death blow . This was Mr. Parnell 's idea , and its inception stamps him as a consummate master of the art of political tactics . As a matter of fact the parliamei4ary system has never recovered from Mr. Parnell 's blow and never will . Groups are being formed in place of the old parties , and a great transformation is inevitable . Mr. Parnell began his obstruction , with the aid of only two or three of the Irish members , in the spring of 1877 . The most memorable achievement of that year was the obstruction of the bill which was introduced to federate the South African colonies . On this bill Mr. Parnell and his few allies fought the whole House ; and it is worth recording that Mr. Parnell was in the right on the merits of the question . Had the fatal policy of the Tory government in South Africa been completely abandoned , the subsequent disgraceful events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gradually Mr. Parnell , though denounced by both parties , began to gain some influence over the English Radicals ; and in 1879 he joined forces with Mr. Joseph Chamberlain , who then posed as an advanced Radical and fought both the Tories and the Hartingtonian or moderate Liberals . In short , within four years this young man had become a power . I must now turn aside for a moment from the parliamentary arena to consider the great land agitation which had begun in Ireland . As I have already pointed out , nothing whatever had been done for Ireland during a period of nearly forty years , during the whole of which time the economic condition of that country had been growing steadily worse . The highly centralized administration of Ireland had ( and still has ) all power in its own hands , and the average Irishman was helpless . British statesmanship had admitted through the so-called Devon commission that the Irish people were rack-rented , that the landlords were an economic nuisance , that the condition of the people was deplorable ; yet nothing was done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal with the land question ; but his own not very advanced proposals were whittled down by the House of Lords to such a degree as to render his land bill all but useless . Meanwhile the operations of nature were aiding the economic forces to work a revolution . The immense fall in the prices of agricultural produce was caused by the increasing competition from America ; and a succession of bad harvests from 1875 to 1879 completed the ruin of the Irish peasantry . The time for a new departure had arrived . In 1879 the Irish Land League was founded , mainly through the energy and devotion of Michael Davitt , whose remarkable history is so well known that any account of it is unnecessary . Mr. Davitt saw clearly that not only had English government broken down in Ireland , but that the land system had broken down also , and that no tinkering at petty schemes of land purchase was of any avail . He raised the standard of " the land for the people , " and commenced a vigorous agitation , socialistic in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Irish land to the Irish people . The movement began simultaneously in Ireland and America , and soon spread to vast proportions . The old sentimental idea of Irish nationalism was now firmly wedded to the new practical idea of abolishing landlordism and securing for the people the produce of their labor . By the beginning of i 88o all Ireland was aflame with the new gos // pel - a veritable evangel to a starving and outraged peasantry . What was to be the attitude of the Home Rule party to this new movement ? Manifestly the old-fashioned Whigs and Conservative gentry , the lawyers and office-seekers , could have nothing to do with it . Yet these were the men who made up the Home Rule party in Parliament . They had stood aloof even from Mr. Parnell ; they could not be expected to support an agitation which , if successful , would take away their rents and compel them for the first time in their lives to do some honest work for a living . Mr. Parnell 's own position was also difficult . Conservative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little sympathy with a revolutionary movement . Himself a landlord , he did not wish to abolish landlordism . But Mr. Parnell has one great quality which always characterizes a first-rate politician - the faculty of vision . Mr. Parnell saw that the land agitation had taken hold , and that he , as the coming leader of the Irish party , must be at the head of the Land League . Therefore Parnell and Davitt , who , previous to the formation of the League , had discussed the situation , joined forces , and the new Irish movement of land reform plus nationalism was definitively constituted . Then came the general election of i88o , when the Beaconsfield government was overthrown and Mr. Gladstone took the helm of state . Mr. Parnell saw that the time had come for him to assert his position , and he did so in an unmistakable way . Mr. Isaac Butt had died in 1879 , and Mr. William Shaw , a banker and a pleasant , easy-going gentleman , personally popular in the House of Commons , had taken his place as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was practically a follower of Mr. Gladstone , and the votes of his supporters could always be counted on by the Liberals . Mr. Parnell had no antipathy to Mr. Shaw , but he perceived that under such leadership Ireland would secure nothing . Mr. Parnell therefore constituted a new Jrish party in opposition to all governments which would not concede the Irish demands . The members of the party were pledged to sit and vote together , and each one was to abide by the decision of the majority or lose his seat . And as Mr. Parnell had by this time shown such insight and determination , the constituencies practically left to him the choice of their candidates ; so that the new party was known as the Parnellite party , and was composed of men personally bound to Mr. Parnell in a peculiar and especial manner . Thus the Parliament of i 88o met with a divided Home Rule party . There were the old Whig Home Rulers under Mr. Shaw - the mere tail end of the Liberal party ; and the new Home Rulers under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Shaw section slightly predominated in numbers ; though in Ireland the predominance of Parnell among the people was overwhelming . It was the refusal to recognize Parnellism as representing the masses in Ireland which was the source of nearly all Mr. Gladstone 's troubles during his second administration . Mr. Gladstone and his colleagues assumed that , the Parnellite party being in a minority in Parliament , it was a minority in the country . It was a fatal error , as every one who knew Ireland plainly said . But though Mr. Gladstone was personally sympathetic towards Ireland , his cabinet could not be moved from the old beaten track of coercion . Not only were the warnings of the Parnellites disregarded , but the Parnellites were treated as public enemies . The Government seemed to have no conception of the magnitude of the problem and the serious economic break-down in Ireland . It allowed its Compensation for Disturbance bill to be rejected by the House of Lords in i88o without any protest , and so became partly responsible for the disorders which ensued . From that time the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spite of the attempts made by a few members of the party to effect a modus vivendi . So little did the cabinet comprehend the urgency of the Irish crisis that I am credibly informed the Irish Land Bill of i88i went through some twenty modifications in the cabinet before it assumed its final shape . The first draft of the measure was a most paltry production , and each succeeding one was more comprehensive . Had the government even then resolved to listen to the criticism of the Irish members and to accept their amendments , great good might have been done . But most of the Parnellite amendments were rejected , // while at the same time a coercion bill as insane in method as it was unjust in principle was being forced on the Irish people . To complete the folly the Government locked up Messrs . Parnell and Davitt , the two men in whom the people had confidence , and thus played into the hands of the turbulent agitators , who cared for very little else than creating a general noise and disturbance . The twofold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to be abandoned and Parnell and his colleagues liberated . The land act , from which so much had been expected by the average Liberal party man , evidently needed amendment in the very direction indicated by the Irish members . Once more the old , oft-repeated , weary lesson was driven into English heads , that Irishmen knew more about the needs of their own country than did people who had scarcely ever set foot on its shores . During all this period the power and authority of Mr. Parnell were growing . English statesmen had measured swords with him and had been beaten in the encounter and as for the average Irishman , his trust in his leader became greater than ever . Every effort was made to break down Parnell 's power , and each effort failed . The Government tried to bring against him the influence of Rome , and was baffled and humiliated , as every man who knew ireland foresaw would be the case . Inside the Parnellite party there were intrigues against Parnell , largely instigated by Messrs . Healy and Dillon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opponents and quietly put them down . He was elevated into a sort of political Pope , and all Ireland lay in the hollow of his hand . The harm which has resulted from this I shall refer to afterwards . The Gladstone ministry of i 88o seemed designed to illustrate the proverb that the path to a certain unmentionable locality with a high temperature is paved with good intentions . Mr. Gladstone came into office with the best stock of good intentions ever got together by any public man , and he made utter shipwreck of his ministry . Blunder followed blunder , and disaster came on the head of disaster . What with the inherent differences between the Whigs and the Radicals , the constant strife within the cabinet , the unfortunate resort to Irish coercion , the still more unfortunate intervention in Egypt , the unexampled run of bad luck in the Soudan , and the apparent inability of Mr. Gladstone himself to make up his own mind as to a definite line of policy , - what with all these troubles and the ceaseless , unscrupulous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disastrous period for the true friends of progress . Mr. Parnell looked on serenely , aided the Tories all he could , and finally struck down the Gladstone government in June , 1885 . Mr. Parnell had become in ten years ' time the maker and unmaker of cabinets , the first power in the state . In the general election of 1885 the Irish , spite of Mr. Davitt 's advice to the contrary , aided the Tories . And in January , i886 , Mr. Parnell proved once more that he wielded the balance of power . For Mr. Gladstone , having discovered that Parnellism was really the Irish creed , and that the moderate or Shaw party was wiped out of existence , took up the Home Rule cause . Whereupon Mr. Parnell 's 85 followers joined the Liberals , and with one blow struck the Salisbury ministry from office . Twice within six months had Mr. Parnell made and unmade cabinets . I shall not recount the events of the last three years since the defeat of Mr. Gladstone 's Home Rule bill and the advent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memories of all ; and in England the story is now tedious beyond expression . The interesting questions are rather , What has Mr. Parnell accomplished and what is his position as regards Ireland and the English parties ? How far has his influence made for genuine progress ? These questions are exceedingly difficult and can not be answered in a word . As regards Ireland , it is evident that Mr. Parnell has on the one hand accomplished a great and beneficent revolution , which apparently no other man could have accomplished . Irish agitation was formerly vague , sporadic , and unmethodical , marked by purposeless assassinations and useless acts of vengeance of all kinds . Mr. Parnell has methodized and rationalized irish agitation , and has welded his followers into a solid phalanx . He has taught the Irish that instead of firing old blunderbusses at Dublin officials or Connemara landlords it is better to make such use of the legal // forms and political institutions that are open to them as may cause the maximum of annoyance to their opponents . His agitation has always been rational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised little that he has not been able to perform . It is no small achievement for a young man without wealth , eloquence , genius , or large experience to become in a few years the most generally respected personality in the British Parliament ; yet this is exactly Parnell 's achievement . And in the respect paid to Mr. Parnell there is ipso facto an increased respect paid to his country . Lord Salisbury and Mr. Balfour may sneer in public , before Tory packed audiences , at Ireland ; but they fear her all the same . I do not contend that the Parnellite party as a whole commands much respect ; but undoubtedly Ireland occupies a relatively more important position in Parliament than it did half a century ago . This is in no small measure due to Mr. Parnell . English politicians are not greatly affected by bursts of eloquence ; they largely discount rhetorical flourishes ; but they are always impressed by practical sagacity . Mr. Parnell is the embodiment of this quality . And no one can doubt that Mr. Parnell has brought Irish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as 1874 , as I have said , Home Rule was opposed by Tory and Liberal alike , and was treated merely as an academic question , scarcely worth the consideration of practical men . Mr. Parnell has changed all that . He has compelled one English party to declare for Home Rule ; and there is not a single politician in England who does not know that the Conservative party was prepared to concede Home Rule in 1885 , and will again be prepared to execute a vo/te face as soon as the game of " Unionism " is up . No doubt it may be urged that the political evolution has necessitated all this , and that is quite true . But it is also true that the evolution of events is aided or hindered by the wisdom or unwisdom of the individuals who direct public movements . He would be a very ill-informed person who would not admit that the successful outcome of the American Revolution was due in some degree to the wisdom of Washington and his associates . And it is to the ability of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation which he found when he entered public life that we must ascribe the success which has attended his movement . Every one will admit that the foregoing remarks indicate pure good as resulting from the Parnell movement . But that movement has yielded fruit of a more dubious character . For it has ( i ) greatly strengthened one-man power in Ireland ; ( 2 ) weakened Irish nationalism ; and ( * ) fostered Irish conservatism . Some persons will of course regard the two latter results as beneficial ; but there are very many who deplore entirely this whole side of the Parnell movement . In no other country in the world does any one man now wield the influence which Mr. Parnell exerts in Ireland . Bismarck and Gladstone are the only two personalities beside Parnell who now dominate over large masses of men . But neither Bismarck nor Gladstone can nominate and elect candidates for scores of constituencies or carry the votes of his party in his pocket . Both these things Parnell does . There is really next to no freedom of election in Ireland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till Mr. Parnell is consulted . He decides who the candidate shall be , and the person selected by him is nominated and elected without the voters being in any way considered . Thus Mr. Parnell 's party is dependent upon him , and each man owes to him something very like personal allegiance . As a result of this the Irish members are mere delegates , whose votes are at Mr. Parnell 's disposal . The most signal illustration of this occurred in the divisions in Parliament on the royal grants . Mr. Labouchere and the Radicals , representing the undoubted sentiment of every Radical in the country and of not a few Conservatives , opposed resolutely any further grants to royalty . One would have supposed that the Irish , among whom there is much republican sentiment , and who certainly owe no favors to royalty , would have voted with the Radical party ; more especially as it is the Radicals who have espoused the Irish cause and made sacrifices for it . But Mr. Parnell , for reasons best known to himself , had decided to support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him , and , much to the disgust of the Radicals , they followed him like a flock // of sheep . There is secretly great irritation among some of the Irish members at this despotic rule ; but no one dares at present openly rebel , or Mr. Parnell would speedily find means to silence the rebel , and probably to eject him from the party . It may be that this despotism is necessary ; but it is a melancholy necessity and is working out great mischief in Ireland . For what the Irish need above all things is the self-reliance of the English and American character ; instead of which all sense of personal initiative and responsibility is taken from them , and they are left as so many pawns to be , moved at their leader 's pleasure . That is a bad thing for any nation . Secondly , the Parnell leadership is weakening Irish nationalism . This would be good if the Irish were becoming more cosmopolitan ; but they are not . The weak side of the parliamentary game which Mr. Parnell has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manipulation and some degree even of intrigue are necessarily substituted for the less successful but more manly and candid policy of violence and defiance . Mr. Parnell has made of his party the mere tail of the English Liberals . If it better suited his purpose ( as it did in 1885 ) , he would make it the , tail of the Conservatives . It is no longer an independent national force ; it is the mere wing of an army . A position of this kind destroys , or at any rate partly weakens , powerful and generous sentiments and enthrones management as the object of worship . I admit that , given Mr. Parnell 's method and object , this result is inevitable ; nevertheless , it is to be deplored . It presents the Irish party in the character of bargainers , as also did O'Connell 's alliance with the Whigs . Cavour found the same problem in Italy . He , like Mr. Parnell , preferred diplomacy and management to revolutionary revolt ; and he was certainly successful , which in politics covers a multitude of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finesse , we do not feel for him that generous admiration which we reserve for Garibaldi and Mazzini . Nor , spite of the praise we must bestow on his tactics , can we feel for Mr. Parnell that affectionate admiration which we freely offer to such unselfish enthusiasts as John Mitchell and Michael Davitt . The intrigue and diplo macy of Cavour have weakened that almost religious sentiment which Mazzini had aroused in Italy ; and the like qualities in the Parnell leadership are producing similar results in Ireland . It is apparently the price which nations must pay for the adoption of what are called " constitutional " methods . In the third place , the Parnell movement has fostered Irish conservatism . Ireland is peculiar in that it is almost untouched by the modern spirit which shows itself all over Europe as Socialism . Economically Ireland is pretty much where England was upwards of a century ago . Only a single corner of the island is given up to industrialism ; and there theological bigotry still obscures the great modem social and industrial questions . People in Ulster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceased to discuss for two centuries . Throughout the rest of the country there are farmers and peasants carrying on limited agricultural operations . This naturally makes for conservatism . But on the other hand , the exactions and robbery of the landlords have produced a spirit of revolt . That spirit found voice and utterance in the Land League , which , as I have said , was essentially socialistic in its inception . But what with the backward economic condition of Ireland on the one hand , and the necessity for blending the economic with the political movement on the other , the socialistic element of the Land League has been well-nigh strangled . Mr. Parnell and his parliamentary entourage have been permitted to take the sting out of the Land League movement . Mr. Parnell and his friends know nothing about economics , and their only notion of dealing with the Irish land question isto convert the Irish tenants into petty landlords . All who know anything of the dire consequences of this policy in France and Germany know that to create a class of small proprietors is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petty huckstering , against which the waves of progress beat in vain . It is the French peasantry which welcomed and sustained the humiliations of the infamous Second Empire ; it is the German peasantry which to-day supports the grinding tyranny of Bismarckian rule ; and if Mr. Parnell 's idea is carried out , the Irish peasantry will // be converted into defenders of the " rights of property , " and strong opponents of the new Radical movement in Great Britain . Already the Salisbury ministry is working towards this end . By its land purchase bills it is at the same time offering big baits to landlords , and winning over Irish tenants to the so-called cause of " law and order . " Now , both law and order are good things , and a contented people is good also , provided its content is based on rational grounds . But if those are right who contend that the path of evolution lies in the socialistic development , and that peasant proprietorship is a retrograde movement , then it must be inferred that the agrarian side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are many people in England , there are , I know , some men of intelligence even in America , who seriously believe that Mr. Parnell is a dangerous revolutionist in favor of a policy of violence . There can not be a more absurd delusion ; as the evidence in the tedious Parnell Commission has abundantly shown . All advanced people in England only wish that Mr. Parnell were a revolutionist ; what they complain of is that he is not . Many of them think that Mr. Parnell and his colleagues have exploited and emasculated a revolutionary movement . So far as Mr. Parnell has any definite politics , he is unquestionably conservative and merely national . It is this fact which has largely severed the Irish movement from Continental sympathy . All progressive people in Europe sympathize with Ireland as against the British government ; but they take comparatively little interest in a struggle which wears for them not only a merely local but a distinctly conservative character . The truth probably is that Mr. Parnell does represent better than any other man the average Irish sentiment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they love to get hold of property , and when rich are as conservative as any people in the world . Given a people largely conservative , a backward economic condition , and an absence of sound economic knowledge , and the Parnell leadership is the best kind of result you are likely to have . And now in the last place , I must consider the influence of the Parnell movement on the political situation in England . This is more interesting and of greater intrinsic importance than the results of Parnellism in Ireland . Mr. Parnell has , whether intentionally or not , done a great work for England . He has revealed to English people the weak side of their political system , and he has helped forward the all-important social question in England . As I have pointed out , Mr. Parnell had the perspicacity to perceive that Parliament was the pivot of the English system , which could only work properly when there was a well-defined solid party majority in the House of Commons . English politicians , who were never tired of lauding their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagined they had reached finality , received a rude shock when Mr. Parnell with his third party dislocated the whole parliamentary mechanism , and upset this little political house of cards . The disintegration has spread with wonderful rapidity ; groups have taken the place of the old parties , and these groups will extend and still further subdivide . The House of Commons now exhibits the following groups : Conservatives pure and simple , which is the largest and best-defined group ; Troy Democrats , who look to Lord Randolph Churchill as their leader , and whose creed is a curious jumble of Toryism , Radicalism , and Socialism ; Gladstonians pure and simple , who , judging from the divisions on the royal grants , constitute a very small number ; Liberal Unionists so called , which merely means Whig writ large ; Radicals , who are not definitely organized . but who generally look to Mr. Labouchere for guidance ; Irish Nationalists under Mr. Parnell . I do not know whether we should add the three or four followers of Mr. Joseph Chamberlain : they will probably not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an avowed Socialist , may perhaps be held to form a party by himself . Then the Radicals are apt to be divided among themselves by the lines of nationality ; for the Scotch and Welsh Radicals , noting the success of Parnellism , have now devejoped the art of combining for national purposes . Indeed , Scottish Home Rule is becoming a most formidable factor in British politics . No doubt , so long as Mr. Gladstone lives , his personal influence will keep the various sections of what I suppose we must // still call the Liberal party together . But wonderful as is Mr. Gladstone 's physical and intellectual vigor , it is manifest that his time is but short . When he is gone none can take his place , and the disintegration already begun will advance with rapid strides . It will be aided by the progress of Socialism . No one can understand the condition of British politics unless he sees that the new Socialist movement is the dominant factor in the situation . For obvious reasons Socialism makes greater progress in Liberal than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in England is , What will be the attitude of the Liberal leaders towards Socialism ? Upon this point the Liberals are at sixes and sevens . Some , like Mr. Bradlaugh , are ultra-individualists and conservative in everything but the name . Others are halting between two opinions . Some are for nationalizing land , others for individual ownership . Some are for legislative interference with the hours of adult labor ; others are for a theoretical " freedom of contract , " which as a matter of fact every one knows does not exist . Mr. Gladstone and the other leaders steadily ignore all social questions , as far as they can , in Parliament and the country generally ; but in London they are compelled to face them , and they deliver accordingly in London quasi-socialistic speeches and put forth for London audiences quasi-socialistic programmes . So the Liberal party has a kind of Janus-face , - Socialism for London , and mere Liberalism for the small towns and the country districts . This may do for a season , but the time of clearage must arrive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or rather which helped to reveal to the English people the inherent contradictions already latent in their system . The thorough discussion of the Irish land question prepared the way for the discussion of the far vaster question of the relations of capital and labor . At the bottom of the Irish question , the masses began dimly to see , lay the whole question of property . And though , as I have said , Parnellism is conservative and even reactionary on the land question , it stimulated powerfully beyond any controversy the discussion of the labor question in England . And the condition of England , with its vast and crowded cities , its desperate struggle for life , its highly de veloped industries , the degraded state of its lower classes , its masses of unemployed labor , and its advanced economic development , enlarged and transformed the problem , until what had been in Ireland a paltry question of rent reduction and secure tenure became in England a question reaching down to the fundamental bases of society . Superficial persons will say that to help in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But what if the disintegration is inevitable ? The claim made for Mr. Parnell is that he helped on a necessary and inevitable process . The contradictions inherent in the system existed before Mr. Parnell came to the light ; he has merely revealed them to men . The man who shows you that your house is tumbling about your ears renders you a service , no matter what his motive may be . This is exactly what Mr. Parnell , intentionally or not , has done . Mr. Parnell then has ( i ) rendered selfgovernment for Ireland inevitable ; ( 2 ) split up the English parties into groups ; ( * ) indirectly stimulated the labor movement in Great Britain . What will be the nature of his influence when Irish Home Rule is in one way or another an accomplished fact ? It is said that when that day comes he will retire definitively from public life . But whether he retires or not , his influence will remain in Ireland ; and of what nature will that influence be ? Home Rule once achieved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state politically , for she will have her own parties , formed on natural lines . The great Home Rule party will no longer be one mighty phalanx , but will be split up into conservative and advanced sections . The great mass of Irishmen will , I believe , form a centre party , holding the general ideas of Mr. Parnell . It will be a party of small proprietors who will desire to govern Ireland in their own interests . It will be practically conservative , narrow in sympathy and aim ; in short ( allowing for difference of nationality ) , not unlike the class of peasant owners in France . Opposed to this will be the Irish Radical party under Mr. Davitt , tending towards Socialism , and keenly in sympathy with the advanced movement in Great Britain . This party will be strongest in Ulster . There will be a small Fenian revolutionary party , still // trying to keep up the old anti-English feeling , but always decreasing in importance . And in the fourth place there will be the party of bigotry and bitterness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die out with the progress of culture and the development of a general national sentiment . If I am right in my general diagnosis , it will become evident that Mr. Parnell has performed a singular and paradoxical feat . For while on the one hand he has enormously stimulated what is called the New Radicalism ( i.e. , quasi-Socialism ) in Great Britain , has broken up the English party system , and rendered the political transformation of Great Britain certain - all of which achievements are distinctly revolutionary ; he has , on the other side , added a new force to British conservatism , i.e. , the force of the Irish peasant class , for the creation of which he is working . Conservative though he undoubtedly is , Mr. Parnell has thus earned the gratitude of both sections in Great Britain . He has aided alike conservatism and radicalism , has made both for order and progress . Most of the contemporary English criticism on him is utterly worthless , because written by mere partisans who do not in the least comprehend him and who are unable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good deal of the inner history of the Parnell movement and who , like myself , are not committed to any partisan position , see in Mr. Parnell one of the most remarkable figures of our time . A man of inflexible purpose , with the iron hand under the velvet glove , without eloquence or genius , but with a cool , clear head , he has welded together the Irish people as no other leader could have done , and he has met and baffled English statesmen on their own ground . He was above all things the man for the situation ; no other person could have done the kind of work he has done . Just what that work has been I hav , e attempted to describe . How far my prevision is accurate the coming years will soon reveal .
