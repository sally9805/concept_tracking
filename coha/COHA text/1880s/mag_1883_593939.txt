IT was a bright afternoon in early November ; the keen west wind was making a great stir among the tough brown leaves in the oakgrove near by , and the prophecy of a sharp frost was in the air , while the Reverend Theodore Strong and his friend Walter Franklin walked briskly up and down the platform of the railway station at Potsdam Junction . They were waiting for the Southern express , due in a few minutes , which was to carry them to Bradford . " Is your programme ready ? " asked the clergyman . " Substantially , " answered the banker . " The evening session is to be occupied by the address of Dr. Upson , followed by a social reunion in the parlors of his church . " " Upson presides , does he ? " " He does . Our rule is , you know , that the oldest pastor in the place where the convention is held shall take the chair at the meetings . This rule was adopted without thinking of the Methodists , but it does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual convention of the League , and Dr. Upson will be the second presiding officer furnished by the Methodists . It is his ninth year in Bradford-the third year of his second term with his present charge , and he served another church for three years between the two terms . So he happens to be the Bradford pastor longest in continuous service . " " I am glad of it , " answered Mr. Strong . " He is a hearty and positive man ; he believes in the League , and he will be sure to give us a breezy and stirring meeting . But what are we to have to-morrow ? " " Devotional hour from eight to nine ; reports from county leagues , followed by conversation , for the forenoon session ; two papers read and discussed at the afternoon session , and a public meeting in the evening , with three or four short speeches . " " This League gives you a great deal of work , old fellow ; added to all your other cares , it must burden you not a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " * See articles under the same title , in THE CENTURY for November and December , 1882 , and January , 1883 . VOL . XXVJ. - 8. // " Oh , no . This is my diversion . I like it better than a yacht or a stock-farm it costs me less money and less worry than Thompson 's fish-pond costs him  --  and that is his recreation , you know . Some of our directors laugh a little at my way of amusing myself , but the laugh is not always wholly on their side . I get about as much enjoyment out of my hobby as any of them gets out of his . " " I believe you , " responded Mr. Strong , heartily . " I have often thought that business men might find , in philanthropic enterprises of one sort or another , not less diversion and more wholesome enjoyment than they derive from their various expensive relaxations . But there 's the whistle . " In a few moments the train stopped at the junction . At the broad window of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loose gray traveling-suit , looking out at the group of passen gers and gazers on the platform . His eye fell on the parson , and instantly he raised the window and shouted : " Ho , there , my friend ! " Mr. Strong 's eye was lifted to the window , and he answered the salutation by springing to the platform of the car . Franklin followed him . The stranger met him at the door and greeted him warmly . " Bless my soul ! " he cried , " this is indeed an unexpected pleasure . I wondered much , on my way over , whether I should see you ; but I had not your address , and did not know where to look for you in all this vast country . You remember how unexpected was our parting ? " " I remember well , " replied the parson , heartily . " This meeting is just as , unexpected and far more welcome . But allow me to introduce my friend , Mr. Franklin . This is Mr. Thornton , an English gentleman with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And for whom , " interrupted the stranger , " you so kindly cared when he was prostrated by the heat . I owe much to your friend , Mr. Franklin . " " So do many of us , " answered the banker , sententiously . " But when did you arrive on these shores ? " asked the parson . " The day before yesterday . " " Is it your first visit to America ? " " It is the first . " " And how far are you going on this train ? " " Only to Bradford . It is the next station , Ii believe . " " It is , and it is our destination also . " " Good ! " The Englishman paused a moment , and then said : " I am on my way to a convention in that city of what is called the Christian League . You know of it , I dare say . " " Oh , yes ; Mr. Franklin , here , is the father of it . " " Bless my soul ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rev. Theodore Strong ! Well , well ! I have often wondered , as I read in the English papers the doings of the club , whether my* sometime friend in Damascus could be the Mr. Strong of New Albion . The name was the same , but I hardly thought it the same man . This doubles the delight of the meeting . And you , sir , " turning to Mr. Franklin , " are to be profoundly congratulated . The Christian League is a child of which a man has a right to be proud . " " Oh , that is Strong 's extravagance , " protested Franklin . " The Christian League , unlike the Corinthian Church , has many fathers . I am only serving it as a sort of dry nurse for the time being . " " We know all about that ! " exclaimed the Englishman . " The history of the League is quite familiar to many on the other side of the sea . As good luck would have it , I saw the announcement of your convention in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolved to be present . Are you the President of the League ? " " No ; the league has no officers , save a business committee appointed at each meeting to make arrangements for the next . We pass no votes and keep no records . We meet simply for conference and discussion . I have served , thus far , as the Secretary of the Business Committee ; they have done me the honor to reappoint me year by year ; that is the only office I hold . " " And that , " interposed Mr. Strong , " is no sinecure , as you may guess . The prosperity of the League is largely due to the abundant and gratuitous labors of my friend . That will be plain to you before the meeting is ended . But here we are at Bradford . " A delegation from the Bradford League was at the station to receive them , and the Englishman , protesting , was carried off by his friends to their lodgings . At seven o'clock , when the three appeared at the door of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the meeting was to be held , they found some scores of gentlemen and ladies gathered in groups , and filling the room with the noise of conversation and laughter . Recognitions , greetings , introductions , showed that these were delegates to the convention , who had come from various parts of the State , who were not altogether unacquainted , and among whom it was easy to establish the bond of a cordial // fellowship . Mr. Franklin and Mr. Strong were quickly surrounded and warmly welcomed . To extricate Mr. Thornton from the throng that pressed around them , Mr. Strong put him in charge of Mr. Stanley , rector of the Episcopal Church in Waterport , who was standing near . " I myself am a Churchman , " said the Englishman , as the two walked away to a quiet nook , " and the doings of this league have greatly interested me . There is need enough , in our country , of cooperation among Christians , and I have come to this meeting to see whether its methods would be at all practicable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would be , " answered the rector ; " but I can think of no reason why they would not work with you as well as with us . Sweetness and light ' are the only weapons of our warfare ; if your arsenals are not full of these , one of your countrymen is not to blame . We disseminate information ; we bring Christian people of all names together to talk about the work in which they are all engaged ; we try to promote unity and good-will among them . Such methods as these oughtto be feasible in England . " " They ought to be , indeed , " replied Mr. Thornton ; " but there are so many technical and formal difficulties . For example , there is the everlasting fuss about orders ; how do you manage that ? " " We have nothing to do with orders , " answered the clergyman . " There is no occasion , whatever , for raising any such question . Nobody takes orders and nobody gives orders . We do nothing in our clubs , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We meet simply as Christian neighbors to confer about our work and the best ways of promoting it . " " But your genuine High Churchman never could take part in any such conferences . " " I do n't know about that . Of course , the High Churchman who really thinks that these religious societies of the Baptists and the Congregationalists and the Methodists are not only irregular but irreligious bodies , and that they ought to be resisted and extirpated , could not have anything to do with our league ; but there are few High Churchmen , I fancy , who ever go as far as that . I myself am thought , by some of my brethren , to be a pretty rigid Churchman ; but I am quite ready to admit that these other religious bodies are doing efficient Christian work ; and when such an organization is occupying any field , preaching the Gospel to the people , and helping them to lead pure and upright lives , I do not think that Churchmen are called to enter that field , to divide and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better for us to spend our strength on some destitute neighborhood . I can not quite admit that these religious societies are genuine churches , or that their ministers are properly ordained ; but what of that ? You may call them what you will - conventicles or debating societies ; the question is not what name they ought to bear , but what they are doing ; and if your conventicle or your debating society is making men act like Christians , then I think we Churchmen had better not tear it into pieces , that we may build a regularly organized ' church out of its ruins . There is better business for us , I am sure . " " Hear , hear ! " responded Mr. Thornton . " Well , that is all that this league stands for . It promotes comity and co*3peration among Christians of different names . It asks me to do nothing more than Archbishop Tait , of Canterbury , the Primate of all England , has done more than once , as you know . He has repeatedly welcomed and invited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious work . " " You speak truth , " assented the Englishman . " And I can see no reason why some such measures might not be adopted in my own country . Your league , as I understand it , is only a device for generating and guiding public sentiment . " " That is all ; and this is done simply by bringing Christian people together , putting the facts before them , and inducing them to talk them over . But the bell is tolling for the evening service ; let us find seats in the church . " Dr. Upson 's opening address was a spirited and enthusiastic one , but there is no room for it in these chronicles . After the address , the reunion proceeded , the citizens of Bradford being present in force to welcome the delegates . It was delightful to witness the unconstrained and hearty manners of the company ; nobody seemed to have a burden on his mind ; there were no knots of slate-makers or wirepullers ; no one had a pet measure that he wanted to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected any office ; in all these respects it was quite unlike the preliminary meetings of many ecclesiastical bodies ; and to this difference was due in part , no doubt , the excellent temper of the members . The morning prayer meeting was almost wholly devotional . To singing and prayer , more than to speech-making , the hour was devoted ; the old hymns that express the unity of the Church were sung with a wholesome fervor ; the prayers laid hold upon the words // of the Intercessor , " that they all may be one , " as if they really expected that the answer would come . Promptly , at the hour of nine , Mr. Franklin called the convention to order : " We are hampered by no formalities , " he said ; " we are ready to proceed at once to business . According to our unwritten rule , the duty of presiding at this meeting falls to the Rev. Dr. Upson , in whose church we meet , and he will now take the chair . " " The Business Committee recommend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that the forenoon until half-past twelve be given to reports from the county committees and to conversation about them-fifteen minutes to each report , which may be oral or written ; ten minutes to the discussion of it . Of course , there is no room for speeches ; but some of you will want to ask questions of the persons reporting , for further explanation of portions of their report . We want you to get your questions into definite shape before you present them . A great many questions can be asked and answered in ten minutes , if no words are wasted . Brother Dickinson , you have the floor . The secretary from Midland County , thus addressed , rose and began the reading of his report , which we summarize : Of the twenty-nine towns and cities in the county , twenty-two have cooperated during the last year in the work of the County League . In all the large towns League clubs have been formed ; and in the small towns , the work of consolidation has been steadily advancing . The county contains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were one hundred and fourteen regularly organized churches in this county , besides various missions and congregations of a more or less ephemeral character . Of these churches , forty-one were in the cities and towns with over five thousand inhabitants ; the remaining seventy-three were in the smaller towns . The large towns and cities contain about forty-five thousand people ; the small towns about twenty-five thousand . In the large towns and cities , there was about one church to every twelve hundred inhabitants ; in the smaller towns there was about one to every three hundred and fifty inhabitants . Now , there are but ninety-three churches in the county , a reduction of twenty-one in the whole number . ( Applause . ) In the cities and large towns , four churches have been disbanded , none of which bad any other than sectarian reasons for its existence , and eight new ones have been formed , making a gain of four churches in the denser populations . In the small towns , twenty-five enthusiasm of the auditors , stimulates the churches have been disbanded and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones formed , so that in these sparser populations there is now about one church for every five hundred persons . ( Applause . ) Statistics , so far as procurable , indicate that , with the decrease in the number of churches , there has been an increase of from eight to ten per cent . in the number of regular worshipers , the movement toward consolidation having enlisted the interest of many persons who had previously remained outside of all churches , quite a number of them being men of intelligence and property , to whom the sectarian divisions had always been a stumbling-block . In all the towns where churches were consolidated , a movement was at once set on foot to establish mission services in districts distant from the church , and these were generally well attended and useful ; but several towns have settled upon a method which seems to be more successful . It is that of bringing the people to the central place of worship , instead of sending the Gospel to them . In the town of Summit , three fourhorse teams , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning about fifty persons , none of whom had previously been in the habit of attending church . The teams are furnished by farmers in each neighborhood ; the farm wagons kave been provided with springs and comfortable seats , and the invitation has been extended to all the people living on the roads through which these conveyances pass to make use of them in going to church . Every house was visited , the poorest people were made to feel that they would be welcome , and in some cases aid was quietly given to families who found it difficult to provide their children with suitable clothing . The result is a great increase in the attendance at the church in the center of the town . Quite a number of the farmers who have conveyances of their own , but have never used them on Sunday , have been stirred up to attend church , and the four-horse teams are accompanied by a goodly number of smaller vehicles . The old horse-sheds in the rear of the meeting-house are filled every Sunday . This policy of concentration seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought to work better than the plan of holding many small meetings in the separate neighborhoods . The school-houses are not always comfortable ; the lights are dim the singing drags , the attendance in each place is small . The central church , on the other hand , is commodious and cheerful ; there is an organ or some other instrument , and a choir to lead the singing ; and the greatly increased attendance doubles the interest and // moral effect of the whole service . Instead of distributing the broken meats of the Gospel feast to the people in the out-districts , the people themselves are brought to the first table and enjoy the best that the house affords . This tends wonderfully to strengthen the feeling of community between different parts of the town , and to prevent local jealousies and feuds . It is pleasant and useful for the people of all parts of the town to meet thus once a week . Those who advocate this method point also to the fact that , in thus drawing the whole town together at one central place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earlier days , when these country towns were much more populous and prosperous than they now are . Mr. Dickinson 's report was received with a round of applause . " Now , for your questions ! " cried the chairman . " The report has occupied only thirteen minutes ; you have twelve minutes for talk . Stand up , Brother Dickinson ! Go on , brethren ! " " Is there only one church in this town of Summit ? " " Only one . Five of our country towns have but one church apiece ! " " What kind of church is it ? " The question came from two or three parts of the room at the same time . " It is called , I believe , The Church of Christ in Summit . ' " " Were there other churches in the town formerly ? " " Yes ; there were three churches , two years ago. ** " What has become of the buildings ? " " The Congregational church stood in a breezy place on the top of the highest hill ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Baptist church is vacant . The Methodist church , renovated , is the one now occupied . " " Is that old vacant Baptist church a pleasant object to look upon ? " asked one elderly , quiet-faced man , who rose up under the gallery . " No , it is not , " answered Mr. Dickinson , with some feeling . " It is to me a very melancholy spectacle . Some of the shutters have been torn off , and many panes of glass have been brdken from the windows . The thought of what it is likely to become fills me with pain . My boyhood was spent in Summit , and I was a worshiper in that old church . I do not like to see it falling into ruin . " There is another such vacant church in our town , " continued the old gentleman ; " ours s a Congregational church , the church in which I used to worship when I was a boy ; the church where I stood up to confess my faith ; the church where my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doors he was carried out to be buried . I am glad of the union which has brought the Christians of our town all together again as in the olden time ; I praise God for it every day ; I am perfectly at home in our new union church , which stands in the factory village ; but the sight of that dear old church , falling into decay and desolation , is a perpetual sorrow to me . I know of three other towns in our county where the same melancholy spectacle may be seen . The movement toward consolidation leaves on many of our hills dear and venerable churches to be hiding-places for the moles and the bats , and sometimes for worse vermin . Forgive me for speaking so long , but I want to raise this question : What should be done with vacant churches ? " The responses from all parts of the room showed that the question had touched the hearts of the delegates . There was a short pause . Finally , the chairman spoke : " What answer do we hear from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I myself wish to be enlightened , " answered Mr. Dickinson . " If the convention will permit me to prophesy , " said the chairman , " I will venture the prediction that the report from Dunham County will deal with this subject . It may be well to wait for that . Indeed , the twelve minutes are all gone but one , and I propose that we devote that minute to singing the verse : " I love thy Church , 0 God ! Her walls before thee stand , Dear as the apple of thine eye , And graven on thine hand . " After the singing of this stanza with deep feeling , Mr. Hubbard , the secretary of the Dunham County League , began his report : The results have been somewhat less favorable than those contained in the preceding report , but there is still abundant reason for encouragement in the reduction of the number of small churches , in the great increase of church attendance , and in the effectiveness of the new methods of reaching the churchless classes . That part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we reproduce entire : " We have had troubles of our own with vacant churches ; troubles not merely sentimental , but practical . The consolidation in the town of Liberty left the Methodist church vacant ; and it was not only an offense to the eyes and a trouble to the heart , as every vacant church must be , but it became the haunt of tramps , and was a scandal to the community . At // length the good people determined to abate the nuisance in some way , and a meeting of the citizens was called in the old church itself , one evening last August , to consider what should be done with it . Among those who came to the meeting were several city people who were spending the summer in Liberty , some of whom were natives of the town . Various uses of the old sanctuary were suggested . One of the farmers offered one hundred dollars for it , to be used as a barn ; but the offer was not entertained . One heroic brother wanted to burn it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , and might better be solemnly devoted to God as a burnt-offering , than to live to be a disgrace and a pest to the community . This proposition pleased some of the more enthusiastic Christians and all the boys , and it was on the point of being adopted , when Judge Forsyth , of New York , arose and made a little speech . " It seems to me , ' he said , that you can put this church to a better use . I do not like to see valuable property destroyed , and I have personal reasons for not wishing that the church in which I worshiped when a boy should come to such an end . You need a parsonage and parish house , a home for your minister and a social center for the community . This building can be remodeled at no great cost , so that it shall serve this double purpose . I have had my friend Mr. Garland , the architect , who is here to-night , make a plan for this reconstruction , which he will show you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admit of two stories ; the two rows of windows lend themselves to the plan ; a floor can be thrown across , at about the height of the gallery floor ; the lower story can be divided into rooms suitable for the parsonage ; above you can have your parish hall , for lectures , concerts , sociables , literary meetings , etc. , with a room for the library which I hope you will have by and by , and of which your pastor should have the care . Mr. Garland tells me that the change in the building can be made according to his plan for about fifteen hundred dollars ; and I am prepared to say that if the community will pledge five hundred dollars of that amount , I will furnish the rest . ' " The offer of Judge Forsyth was received with loud applause ; the five hundred dollars was pledged at once , the carpenters were soon at work , and the pastor is now living in his parsonage , while the parish is rejoicing in such a place of social assembly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other wealthy gentlemen , natives of Liberty , now residing in Boston , are proposing to endow the library at which Judge Forsyth hinted , and for which a room was provided in the reconstructed building . " Thus one of our old churches has been converted and saved from ruin in its old age . But there was more serious trouble in Hector . There it was the old Baptist church that was abandoned , and the kind of tramps that it harbored were mostly religious tramps . Unluckily there were a few members of that church who proved incorrigible when the Union was formed ; they opposed it to the end , and in the face of an overwhelming public sentiment they continued to oppose it after it was an accomplished fact . These irreconcilables were determined to keep up some kind of sectarian division in the community , and they used the old church as their base of operations . The same tactics have been resorted to in other towns . A vacant church acts on the mind of your religious demagogue as a powerful stimulant . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not rest till he has gathered his awkward and ugly squad of sectaries within its walls . Very likely , too , he will name his schism shop a Union Church . ' Many an enterprise of this nature , whose only effect could be to divide and weaken the Christian community , has been baptized with the Union name . So it was'in Hector . First a traveling Baptist minister came along and held Union ' services in the old church for a few weeks ; but it was not long before he discerned the true character of his supporters and turned his back upon them . Their next resort was a Congregationalist from Bradford , who goeth about as a roaring layman , seeking whom he may exhort . His excuse for invading Hector was the lack of orthodoxy in the pulpit of the village church , and he began his campaign by attacking the loose doctrines ' and the heretical tendencies of the pastor . But a lawyer of Hector , who had some knowledge of this heresy-hunter 's business operations , made a brief statement in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take himself off . After him came a band of Adventists , with a series of meetings , and after them an itinerant Universalist , who tried to get up a discussion of his peculiar doctrines , and challenged the pastor to a controversy ; but the night after his first meeting  --  a cold , winter night- the stove was left open , a spark set it on fire , and the old church was saved from being the kennel of schismatics , yet so as by fire . But the fate of this and other vacant churches in our county has warned us against leaving in our rear , as we march toward Christian union , such a fortress of schism as a vacant church may become . Henceforth we are determined to find some good use for every church that is vacated ; it might far better be devoted to secular uses than be left to become a sanctuary for the bats or a den for tramps or religious demagogues . " After Mr. Hubbard 's report was concluded , a delegate rose and asked , timidly : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old churches ? " " Certainly , " answered the chairman . " We sold them . " " For what uses ? " inquired half a dozen at once . " One was bought by the town for a school , the other by a physician for a sanitarium and boarding-house . " " How much did you get for them ? " demanded some speculative disciple . " Five thousand dollars for the two. ** " What did you do with the money ? " came in several voices . " We invested it in a fund for the benefit of the Church ? " " How long ago was that ? " It was Mr. Franklin who asked this question . " Two years ago last spring . " " So you have had the benefit of this fund now two years . How do you thrive under it ? " continued Mr. Franklin . " At first , we thought ourselves very rich . But , when we came to figure up our income , we found that it had fallen off considerably . The year before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the interest on our fund reduced the amount about three hundred dollars , but it was twice as hard to raise twelve hundred dollars that year as it had been to raise fifteen hundred the year before . A good share of our parishioners fell back upon that fund and shut up their purses with a snap , and would not give anyTHE // thing . Last year it was still worse ; we began to be afraid that we should not be able to raise a thousand dollars Finally we called a meeting and determined to get rid of that millstone . By a vote of two to one we turned the money over to the town to be used in endowing a free library , and then we sang the doxology. ** Laughter and cheers greeted this illuminating speech . " He that hath ears to hear , let him hear ! " cries Dr. Upson . " A bank vault is a poor place for a church of Christ to lay up its treasure in . We will now hear from Ridgefield County . Brother Harlan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brother Harlan was a character . A man in plain farmer 's clothes , with keen gray eyes , glancing out from beneath beetling brows , a shock of refractory red hair , and a close-cropped beard of the same color , ambled to the front and began delib-erately : " I 'm not the secretary of our county , " he said ; " Captain Thomas is sick , and he sent word to me day before yesterday that I must come here and report for him . I have n't a word written , and I shall not begin to tell all that ought to be told about the work in our county ; but I 'll give a few facts that have come under my own eye . I do n't know much about the figures ; but I know that quite a lot of sickly churches have been killed off . And that 's the right way to serve em . We thin out a hill o ' corn that has seven or eight stalks when there is n't room for more than three or four , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When churches come up too thick around here on these hills , they 've got to be thinned out in the same way . Poor husbandry , I calc'late , to keep diggin ' round em , and manurin " em with home missionary money , when there 's no more chance of gettin ' a crop from em than there is from a patch o ' corn that 's sowed broadcast . " In the town where I live , in Ridgefield County , we had three churches for more'n twenty years . Fifty years ago there was n't but one , and the population was fifty per cent . larger then than it is now . Two years ago , the Congregationalists and the Methodists made up their minds to come together ; they kept both meetin ' houses , and the united society worships in one in the mornin ' and in the other in the evenin ' , and that accommodates both ends of the street . We have a congregation a good deal larger than the two put together used to be , and we pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salary . The fact is , we 've got a minister that it 's easy enough to pay . He 's a keen-witted , level-headed young man who understands himself and his business , and knows something outside of his business too . Everybody likes him . He talks to us very plain in church ; it comes right from his heart , and it goes right to our hearts ; and when he is around among the farmers he do n't find it hard to make talk come . He knows his Bible and he knows other books ; but he knows men , too , and cattle and sheep and horses , - especially horses . He 's got one of the likeliest colts in town , and he keeps his coat as shiny as satin . The other day the parson was sittin ' in his buggy in front of one of the stores talking with half-a-dozen men , when along came old Sime Harrison , who lives up at Scrabbletown . Sime 's one of those terrible slovenly critters that keeps everything at loose ends around his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never pays his debts ; but , because he is so loose in everything else , he tries to even things up by being mortal strict in his religious notions . He generally drives his horses tandem ; because he never gets ready to rig a whiffletree and a pole . It 's a city fashion , I understand ; but we farmers consider it a dreadfully shiftless way to hitch up horses . So Sime comes a drivin ' up his two old nags afore his buckboard , and he stops when he gets opposite the parson , and leanin ' over towards him in a kind o ' confidential way , he says : Brother Hall , do you think the Postle Paul ever druv a fast hoss ? ' Do n't know about that , ' answers the parson , quicker n lightnin ' , but I 'm pretty sure he never drove two horses tandem . ' You 'd ought to have heard them men shout . Sime did n't want to know any more about the Postle Paul , and he druv right on . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Smart as a whip , I can tell you ! He stands square on his feet , looks you right in the eye , and commands the respect of everybody . It 's a great thing for the town , and especially for our boys who are growin up , to have a man like that around among us ,  --  a gentleman , a scholar , a man of sense and self-respect , a man who pays his debts , and has no need to beg of anybody or to be beholden to anybody for his livin ' . It makes religion seem a sensible and respectable sort of thing . " One Sunday evenin ' last spring , we had a Sunday-school concert , and our pastor went down to the West village to preach to them , because they had n't any minister . The next day I was down there , and everybody was talkin ' about his sermon . Made it jest as plain as daylight , ' they said . Ca n't help listenin ' to him . ' Understood every word he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every Sunday , ' says Deacon Chapin . Well , what 's to hinder you hearin ' it ? ' says I. What do you mean ? ' says he . I 'll tell you what I mean , ' says I. It 's two mile and a half to the old church in the East village . When I was a boy I lived half a mile further west than you do , and our folks was always at the old church every Sunday , rain or shine , and so was quite a number of families livin ' down this way . It is n't any further now'n it was then , and there 's better roads . ' " But there 's a good many families in this neighborhood that have n't teams , ' he said . " Well , then , git up one or two big teams and bring em . ' " It 'd cost too much . ' " Would it ? How much does it cost you a year to keep your church goin ' ? ' " Well , about six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many do you git to church ? ' " Forty or fifty , ginerally . ' " Yes ; and a good share of them has teams of their own . Now you can arrange for teams that wont cost you more'n five dollars a Sunday , that 'll take at least thirty persons up to the old church . I 'm an old stager , and I 'd like to take the contract of transportin ' thirty from the West village to the East village and back agin every Sunday for five dollars . The rest can go with their own teams . You wont want to get your preachin ' for nothin ' up there , of course ; but you can pay for that and pay the expense of transportation , and then save money on what it costs you to keep up this church . Besides , you can have first-class preachin ' every Sunday , instead of four hundred and forty-fourth class . ' " But there will be many Sundays , ' said the Deacon , that it will be stormy , or the roads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' " There might be five or six Sundays every year , ' I answered , when the roads would be bad . But how many Sundays in a year on the average , are you out of preachin ' on account of a vacancy in your pulpit ? ' " The Deacon looked over the church books and found that for the last five years the pulpit of the church in the West village had been without a supply fifty-five Sundays in all-just eleven Sundays a year on the average . He agreed with me right off that there would not be so many Sundays as that in the year when the roads between the two villages would be too heavy for travelin ' . And the result of our talk was that a meetin ' of the people in the West village was held , the matter was talked up , a subscription to pay for teams was started , and now we bring the West villagers to church and Sunday-school at the East village every Sunday , and git more of em than ever went to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , in the afternoon , and their prayer meetin ' in the evenin ' , but they like the present arrangement and would n't on any account go back to the old plan . " In several other towns of our county the same thing , or something very much like it , has been done . We have seen the tribes that have been scattered abroad return with singin ' unto Zion . As the prophet says , we ai n't exactly slandin ' in the old ways , but we 're walkin ' in em or , rather , drivin ' over em up to Jerusalem ; and it seems good to have the people of the whole town come together with one accord in one place , just as they did on the day of Pentecost . We 've had some Pentecosts of our own , too , in Ridgefield County , and I should like mightily to tell you all about em ; but I 've kept my eye on the clock , and know that my time 's up . " Brother Harlan 's shrewd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon as it was ended the questions began . " How large is your congregation on Sunday mornings ? " " Last Sunday I counted three hundred and eighty-nine . It was not above the average . " " That is a large congregation , " interposes Dr. Upson . " Few of those in the cities are so large . " " How many do you think would have been found , on a pleasant Sunday , in the three churches before the consolidation ? " " Not above three hundred . " " Is your church entirely self-supporting ? " " Yes , sir . " " Do your people contribute to any missionary or benevolent societies ? " " Last year we gave over three hundred dollars . " " How do you manage that ? " " We take a collection every month . Several of these collections are for Union societies . When we take up our collection for foreign missions or home missions , or the publication cause , we distribute envelopes in the pews , and each person puts his amount into an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society to which he wants it to go . If he is a Congregationalist , he sends his foreign missionary money to the American Board ; if he is a Methodist , he sends it to the Methodist Board of Missions , and so on . The treasurer gathers up the amounts and forwards them to the right places , and reports to the church the amount of the collection and the sum remit- // ted to each of the societies . At our monthly missionary meeting , we hear from the missions of all the denominations , and know a great deal more about what is going on in the mission field than we used to know when we heard only from the societies of one denomination . " " How do your contributions in envelopes compare with those in cash ? " " They 're twice as big . Partly because there 's a little strife to see which society shall get the most , and partly because folks do n't like to put a cent into an envelope . Brother Harlan stepped down from the platform amid applause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informal and uncouth as it was , contained more meat than any that preceded it . The next to take the floor was Mr. Greene , the secretary from Bradford County . In this county are several cities and large towns , and the report was expected to deal not only with the problem of consolidating the small churches , but also with the important question of evangelization and charity presented by the urban populations . Bradford County contains New Albion , and was the home of the Christian League . Concerning the beginnings of the Union movement in some of the towns of this county the readers of this history are fully informed . In three of these towns Mr. Greene 's report showed that serious difficulties had been encountered . In Scantico , a few strenuous Methodists , egged on , as some said , by the presiding elder of the district , determined , after the Union church had been in successful operation for about a year , to reestablish sectarian worship . Accordingly they demanded , in the name of the Methodist Conference , the meeting-house which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for evening services by the united church . They asked for a minister , and a Methodist clergyman , partly disabled by ill-health , who was sojourning for the year in Bradford , was sent over to supply their pulpit . Unfortunately for their purposes , this clergyman was a man of broad views and generous temper , and he soon discovered the state of the public mind in Scantico . He called upon the pastor of the united church and proposed Union services in the Methodist church in the evening , and in the other church in the morning , so that things went on for a few weeks much as before , the only difference being that there were two ministers instead of one . This was not exactly what his supporters had bargained for , but he was a man of so much intelligence and strength of character that they did not like to quarrel with him ; and besides , it was somewhat ungracious to object to Union meetings . At length he told the united congregation , one Sunday evening , that his work among them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day to Bradford ; that Scantico needed but one church and that one minister was better than two ; that his brother Thomas , of the Union church , was a good enough Methodist for him ; that he should file with the presiding elder his protest against the reestablishment of Methodist worship in Scantico , and , if it became necessary , should carry the matter before the Conference at its next session ; that the Methodist Church should not be made , if he could help it , an instrument for creating or perpetuating destructive schisms in the Church of Christ . This bold movement completely discomfited the Methodist sectarians , and they abandoned their scheme without a struggle . In Tuckerton it was a Congregational clique that made the trouble . In that town there had been two Congregational churches , the division arising out of a feud about the choir , and continuing for many years , until the Union church was formed . The Second Congregational church stood in a small settlement dubbed by the Central villagers Potluck , in revenge for which the Potluckians persisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Much local warfare , of a nature not very sanguinary , had been waged between these two precincts from time immemorial , and it was considered a sure sign of the millennium when they agreed to come together and form a Union church . But this millennium did not last a thousand years , probably because the devil was not chained . He made his appearance in Potluck in the form of a Congregational minister of dubious credentials , who proposed to hold services in the church in that place , and by his unction and plausible speech contrived to deceive even the elect . To the ultra orthodox he suggested the danger of allowing their children to be trained up without any knowledge of the " doctrines of the fathers " ; to those in whose breasts local pride burned most fiercely , he urged the ignominy of allowing Potluck to become " a mere suburb of Kittleville . " Plying both these arguments industriously , he soon had quite a following at his heels , and almost before any one knew of it services were in full blast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was written to some of the leading Congregationalists in Bradford and New Albion , and a strong delegation from the League clubs of those cities went down to Potluck , called together the leading Congregationalists of that precinct , assured them // that they would fail of obtaining the Home Missionary aid on which they had depended for the support of their separate service , showed them the folly of the course into which they had been led , gave them some bits of the history of the man who had wormed himself into their confidence , and succeeded in bringing back Potluck from its wanderings , and in repairing once more the breach in the walls of the Tuckerton Zion . In several other towns where Union movements had been set on foot there had been outbreaks of a sectarian nature , some of which had not yet been subdued . The spirit of sect , like the Judaizing temper among the early Christians , was continually showing itself : men who had been bred in an intense sectarianism , who had been taught from their cradles to put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not all at once quench their unholy zeal and stop seeking , firs4 the kingdom of Methodism , or of Episcopacy , or of Congregationalism , and its righteousness ; nevertheless , the broader sentiment and wiser methods of a genuine Christianity were all the while gaining strength , and the partisans of a narrow ecclesiasticism knew that they were fighting a losing battle . In quelling these sectarian outbreaks the County League had been of the greatest service . Whenever any attempt had been made to form a new church or revive an old one in a town where the churches had been consolidated , the Outlook Committee , consisting of a representative of each of the denominations , had proceeded immediately to the spot , and had made a full examination of the circumstances , publishing the facts in the principal newspapers and making full report of them at the next meeting of the League . These temperate but truthful representations generally brought a considerable pressure of public opinion to bear at once upon the offending schismatics ; if that did not suffice , a committee , composed wholly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointed by the County League at its next meeting to remonstrate with them and bring them to a better mind , sometimes had the desired effect . At all events this County League , formed in the interests of Christian cooperation , concentrating and expressing all the most Christian sentiment of the county , keeping the eyes of its Outlook Committee on all the places where admonition or encouragement was needed , and swift to drag into the light of day all the hidden things of darkness that the spirit of sect lay in wait to do , was a mighty help in promoting the unity of believers and in preventing the reactions that were in danger of occurring here and there . Mr. Greene 's report , thus summarized , was given extemporaneously , and like many another layman he used up his time before finishing what he had to say . In the midst of his speech he was interrupted by the Chairman : " Time 's up , Brother Greene . I know what you have left unsaid , and how important it is that you have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in the conversation . Let me suggest to the convention that questions be asked about Christian League work in Bradford . " " That is just what I want to hear , " spoke up Mr. Strong . " I know something about it , but I want to know more definitely . Will Mr. Greene tell us something of the charitable work of Bradford ? " " Thank you ! " was the answer of the secretary . " I should have greatly failed of my duty if I had not brought something before the convention respecting this work . Our Charity Organization is an enterprise of the greatest importance , and it is the child of the Christian League Club of Bradford . " " What is the Christian League Club of Bradford ? " asked Mr. Strong . " It consists of the minister and one layman from each of the Protestant churches in the city . The organization is similar to that in New Albion , except that we have fewer laymen . With three laymen from each church our club would be unwieldy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the club first faced the problem of poverty and pauperism it found five charitable societies at work in the city , rivals and competitors , all striving to see which c6uld " relieve " the largest number of paupers , and collect and disburse the most money . Of course they disbursed a deal of money , and of course pauperism was rapidly increasing . To secure cooperation among them seemed a hopeless task . At length the club determined to solve the difficulty by organizing another society which should be pledged to give no material aid whatever , but to work wholly by moral and industrial methods . A system of registration was adopted , by which the names of all persons receiving charity were recorded , with such information as could be gathered concerning each of them . The other societies and their churches were all invited to send to this bureau the names of all the persons relieved by them ; and although this was at first refused by some of them , the measure was so evidently necessary , for the exposure of imposture , that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to notify the societies and the churches of many cases in which the same persons were receiv // ing aid from two or more of them at the same time ; and they soon found out the value of the bureau of registration . Then we divided the whole city into small districts , and after much labor succeeded in securing a competent visitor for each of these districts - one hundred and forty-seven in all . The charitable societies and the churches had had but few visitors-not a score of them in all the city . With all the money disbursed yearly , very little personal care and help had been bestowed on the poor , and this was the defect we sought to supply . We published a map of the city , with the districts numbered and the name of the visitor for each district , and offered the services of our visitors to the charitable societies and the churches for the investigation and care of the cases which they were called upon to relieve . Some intelligence and conscience in the administration of charity had begun to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves of our offer . Our visitors soon had their hands and hearts full . They were forbidden to give money or food or coal in any case , and were enjoined never to recommend the granting of such relief by the other societies , except in cases of sickness and absolute disability . Their problem was to help the poor without giving them money or subsistence ; to help them by finding work for them , by rousing them to help themselves , by directing them into more frugal and comfortable habits of living , and by befriending them in every possible way . Our visitors were taught that this work of moral aid was in the deepest sense of the word a missionary work ; that it could not be rightly done unless it was inspired by a " genuine enthusiasm of humanity " ; that it needed for its accomplishment a Christly sympathy and tenderness and tact , and a Christly courage and patience . Once in two weeks we have a meeting of all our visitors ,  --  a conference meeting , in which each one has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are mostly women ) , and of asking counsel about any hard cases . I tell you , brethren , these are the most interesting meetings I ever attended in my life . It would stir your hearts to listen to the stories told , and to see with what dauntless courage and what untiring patience and what marvelous tact and tenderness these good women are working for the salvation of the forlorn , discouraged , helpless creatures that are placed in their care . Our system does not allow a single visitor to have the care of more than two families at once ; we do not believe that one visitor can , as a rule , do justice to more than two families ; we want them to give to each family a great deal of time and care and personal attention ; and the results of this patient , loving , hand-to-hand work among the poor of our city are full of encouragement . " " Do n't you find some cases that are past saving ? " some one inquired . " We never admit it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , so far as we can see , no permanent improvement is made ; but , if men ought always to pray and not to faint , ' then they ought always to work for those for whom they pray , and not to faint in their endeavors any more than in their prayers . I always remember what Robert Falconer said to his father , the wretched old drunkard , Father , you 've gal to reform some time , and you may as well begin now . ' That is the substance of what he said . If we had a little more of that sort of purpose , we should save more of the hard cases. ** " How many families have you cared for during the last year ? " " More than three hundred . " " What has been the effect upon the disbursements of the charitable societies ? " " They have been reduced about fifty per cent. , and everybody admits that there is less suffering now than there was when the larger sum was distributed . " " What is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sentences for drunkenness and petty crime were fewer by fifteen per cent . last year than during the previous year . " " Do you attribute all this to the improved methods of charity ? " " No . That would not be fair . Other important agencies have contributed to this result . To the establishment of friendly inns quite as much is due . " " Tell us about them , " came in half-a-dozen voices . " My time is up . " " Mr. Greene may have ten minutes of my time , " said the secretary from Rockbridge County . " My report will be largely a repetition of what we have heard already . This is more important . " The generous proposition was hailed with applause by the convention . Mr. Greene went on : " Our club found , in fighting the saloons , that it was good tactics to borrow some of their weapons . We were confronted by exactly the same state of things as that which was discovered at New Albion , only our city is much larger than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the needs more urgent . A large part of our population is without homes . The clerks , the operators *n our manufacturing establishments , and the mechanics are largely homeless . // Such lodgings as most of them can afford are cold in winter and cheerless in all seasons ; it is for warmth , shelter , and companionship , more than for drink , that many of them resort to the saloons . Some of them will go to the reading-rooms , but many , and those who are in greatest peril , have no taste for reading . The problem was to provide safe places of resort for this class of persons . We thought of a Young Men 's Club , like that at New Albion ; but it seemed advisable , as our terntory is so large , to have several places of this character , in different parts of the city . Accordingly the plan of establishing friendly inns , or coffee-houses , in suitable localities , was suggested , and a company was incorporated , with a capital of ten thousand dollars , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a charity ; it was intended that the business should pay expenses from the start . The money was invested in lease and fixtures . Four suites of rooms , in different quarters of the city , were procured and fitted with counters , tables , crockery , cooking-ranges and furniture , and comfortable chairs ; the intention was that they should be used for lunchrooms during the middle of the day , and for places of resort in the evening . Many merchants and professional men and some mechanics , it was thought , would take their midday lunch in these clean and comfortable places . The tables were to be partly removed in the evening , to give room for free movement and sociability . In each of the rooms an open fire was to be kept in the winter , and a fountain surrounded with flowers to cool and sweeten the air in the summer . Coffee , tea , chocolate and milk were to be always on sale , with plenty of the nicest bakery rolls , biscuits , and the like ; and in the summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at reasonable prices . A cup of coffee with rolls was to cost but five cents ; a glass of milk but three cents . Newspapers were to be furnished , and various games , such as checkers , chess and backgammon , were to be provided . It was thought best to make a small charge for the use of the games , five cents for each person ; and to avoid , so far as possible , every semblance of gambling practices , persons taking the games were required to pay for . them in advance . In the rear of the larger*room , thus devoted to social purposes , was a smoking-room , well ventilated , with cozy chairs , where smokers could take their fill of their peculiar pleasure , without encroaching upon the enjoyment of those to whom smoke is not delectable . " After some such general plan as this , our coffee-rooms were all fitted up , the treasurer of the company giving much time and care to their arrangement . It is not too much to say that there are no saloons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was believed that rooms so furnished could be rented to men who would pay the rent and a fair rate of interest on the capital invested . The problem was , of course , to find the right men ; but there was no lack of applicants for the places , and the selections seem to have been wisely made . The inns have all paid expenses , and the stockholders have received a four per cent . dividend at the end of the first year . This success is due , largely , to the energy and business tact of the treasurer , Mr. Marble , who has taken this for his diversion , and has found unbounded satisfaction in the working out of his plans . The belief that the opening of cozy , free-and-easy places of refreshment and social resort would draw many young men away from the liquor saloons , has been abundantly justified by our experience . " Why do you charge for the games ? " asked some one . " For revenue only , " answered Mr. Greene . " We thought that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their use , and that they might feel a little more comfortable about using them if they paid for them . There has been no complaint about the charge , and the amount received from this source nearly pays the rent of the building . " " Does your company keep any control of the rooms ? " " No , each friendly inn is under the control of its own landlord . We make a definite contract with him , as to the kinds of refreshment ' he is to provide and the prices he . is to charge , and the general regulations of the rooms ; and , of course , we visit the inns frequently to see that they are properly kept and that the food and drink are of the best quality . " " Do you think that this has had any marked effect in reducing the amount of drunkenness ? " " I have no doubt that the great reduction shown by our police reports in the amount of drunkenness during the past year is largely due to the friendly inns . " As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the applause of the convention , Mr. Strong interrupted him : " You have two minutes more . Are there not some other features of your charitable work in Bradford of which you ought to tell us . " I should be glad , " answered the Bradford secretary , laughing , " to take twenty minutes more and tell you about our Employment Agency , our Industrial School , our Kindergartens , and our Day Nursery , all of which // have sprung up in connection with our Charity Organization society , and all of which are important departments of its work . But I have talked too long already ; if any one wants to know more about these forms of our Christian League work , I will show them to you this afternoon . They will speak best for themselves . " For the reports of the other county secretaries , there is no room in these chronicles . In many of their features they were similar to those already presented . They filled the morning session , and the interest had not flagged when the hour for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announcement , was devoted to the reading of two carefully prepared papers : the one by the Reverend Doctor Smalls , of New Liverpool , on " The True Definition of the Church , " in which he defended the proposition that the Church consists of all the faithful people residing in any given community-that there is but one church in any city or town , though there may be many congregations , worshiping in different places by different forms , and that the different congregations ought to recognize themselves as one church and behave themselves accordingly . The other paper , read by Thomas Marshall , Esq. , of Northbridge , on " Temperance and Tenement Houses , " proved to be a most luminous exposition of the effects of unsanitary dwellings upon the drinking habits of the people , together with accounts of some of the recent experiments made by capitalists in the erection of improved tenement houses , well lighted , ventilated , and drained , and of the obvious effects upon the morals of their occupants . But as these papers were printed in full in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must still be easily procurable , there is no need to reproduce them here . For the same reason it is unnecessary to report the two short speeches of the evening session . One matter , however , of deepest interest , must not be passed by . After the second speaker had taken his seat , Dr. Upson rose : " I am sorry , " he began , " to announce to this convention the only failure on our programme . Dr. Jackson , of Winchester , who was to make the closing speech , sends us a dispatch , which was received since the afternoon session , informing us that a railway accident on the Western road will prevent him from keeping his engagement . You will regret that as much as I do . But there are always compensations for our losses , if we know where to look for them ; and I think that I am on the track of one . The secretary of our Executive Committee , Mr. Walter Franklin- ( applause ) - has been receiving a good many letters from distant places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and giving information of movements that have been set on foot in other States with the view of carrying out its principles . I am sure that he could give us , if he would , some interesting and cheering reports . I have besought him to do so , but he has not consented ; I am going now to pass him over to you , and let you deal with him as seems good to you . " The , convention expressed its will in such a way that Mr. Franklin could not easily resist . He ascended the platform amid a storm of cheers . " Perhaps I ought to beg your pardon , " he said , " for hesitating to bring you such tidings as I have ; my only reason is my strong aversion to the sound of my own voice in a public place . But there are , as Dr. Upson has told you , quite a number of letters and newspaper clippings in my portfolio , showing the wide interest taken in our work , of which I will try to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are from persons who profess to be greatly interested in the history of our league , and who think the plan a beautiful one , but who fear that it is not practicable . There is no conservative so entertaining as your conservative who disputes an accomplished fact . You know that Dr. Dionysius Lardner proved , scientifically , that no vessel could be moved across the ocean by steam-power after the thing had been done . You know that an eminent electrician demolished the project of submarine telegraphy after messages had crossed the sea . And in like manner the measure of codperation in Christian work proposed in the organization of the Christian League is demonstrated to be impracticable by a theorist here and there , long after the thing has been successfully worked out in many places . I will not trouble you with reading any of these letters ; I have stuck them on pins to be preserved in my museum ; about fifty years from now they will be highly interesting reading . " Very amusing , also , are the letters from mystified correspondents , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Connecticut . If they could only look into this crowded room and hear the noise you make , they would probably be convinced that the League is not a myth . " The reports that come to us from all parts of the country show that the ideas of our league are taking hold of the people , especially of the laity , everywhere . I can not begin to give you any adequate notion of the extent of their working . Take this little item which I have clipped from the last number of one // of our religious newspapers , describing the payment of the debt of a Congregational church in a Western city : " The pleasantest feature of the occasion was the remarkably hearty and substantial expressions of interest on the part of the other denominations . They closed their churches Sabbath evening , and some of them in the morning also ; and the several pastors were to be seen moving among the congregation , soliciting subscriptions from their own people . Monday evening , when it seemed as if the ability of the audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the debt yet to be raised , the Methodist pastor came to the rescue . By a wise plan , which he pressed with great skill , he raised the entire amount amid great hand-clapping , and declared that , next to the pastor , he was the happiest man in the house . ' " That sounds like an echo from New Albion , does it not ? But it is not necessary for me to dwell upon facts that fall under your eyes in all the papers . Let me speak of a matter more remote , but not less notable . " It is well known to many of you that the sectarianism which we are organized to fight is making its worst ravages on our Western frontiers . The strife of the sects for the occupancy of every new settlement is the scandal of Christianity . Every man knows this who has traveled in the West and found in the small towns , on an average , one church for every hundred inhabitants . From this afflicted region I have had letters not a few , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and praying for the time when its tidal wave should begin to roll across their prairies and up their cafions . From a shrewd observer , who knows that Western field thoroughly , and who is in the deepest sympathy with the Home Missionary work , comes a letter from which I will read you a few sen-tences : " The real trouble now is with the intermediate agents of our churches . I mean the presiding elders , the synodical missionaries , and the district superintendents of missionary work . So long as our societies will appoint to such places men whose only qualification is business push-men of about the calibre of a good book-agent , men who could push a cyclopedia in a State - so long there will be confusion enough . I could tell of some in this great work that are perfectly unscrupulous . Our societies must be made to see that they must get men who will look at the work broadly , and build with eternity , not quarterly reports , in view . The policy of each missionary society should be expressed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for pushing in where not needed . ' " This extract shows that the responsibility for the state of things existing at the West belongs largely at the East . The power behind this pushing propagandism has its headquarters in Boston and New York . If you want to get at it , you can easily reach it . But let me give you another bit of the same letter . Speaking of the results of this sectarian scramble at the West , the writer says : I am quite sure it is very seriously affecting the character of our ministry . Who but a mean-spirited man will consent to be one of five in a town of five hundred people ? Then , is it not near to the sin against the Holy Ghost thus to misuse the gifts of the Spirit ? What wonder ministers are scarce , when they are employed in this way , four or five crowded into a place where there is need of but one , and set in antagonism and rivalry , with no chance to develop any spiritual power ? And all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this is the most serious phase of the question . A gift of the Spirit , a man furnished by the Spirit for the ministry , is a gift infinitely more precious than the money to feed him , and the misuse of such an one or the misapplication of the gift comes nearer to malfeasance than any misuse of funds . ' " This man writes out of his heart , you see . And he writes not unadvisedly . No man in the West is better qualified to judge . And I beg you to note what he says respecting the effect of sectarianism on the character of ministers . I confess that this was to me a flash of revelation . But who can question the truth of it ? What kind of a Christian is the man likely to become , whose character is developed in these denominational bear-fights ? What kind of a Christian is the man who is ready to rush into them ? I tell you , high-minded young men will not do it . And many a young man , who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , turns back when he sees into what sort of scrimmage he is pretty sure to be driven . " But I am only showing you the evils of this denominational strife . Of these you hardly needed to be told , though my correspondent may have thrown new light on their deformity . What I began to tell you was the good news that the Christian League has been heard of on the frontiers , and that its good seed is beginning to find lodgment in a soil where it ought to bring forth a hundred fold . We have heard some cheerful tidings here to-day , but none to me so significant as this which I read you from the representative of one of our Home Mission boards in the far West . He tells of a conference , lasting all day , between the Home Missionary representatives of four leading denominations , four men who have the oversight of two or three Territories . He says that they came to this conference with the Christian League in their minds , and this is his report of what came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no chairman or secretary , and passed no votes , but simply looked one another in the face , and tried to look the facts of the field in the face . We took up the case of each placewent from , on the , to , covering the whole // field . We did not realize my highest ideal of such a meeting , which would be the consulting entirely as though we were of one denomination ; but I believe it was a long step in the right direction . We have arranged not to go into a town where another denomination is at work , when there is any chance for misunderstanding , without consulting with the representatives of the church in that town , or with the superintendent of mission work . We have promised one another not to take advantage of temporary badluck in getting ministers . We have arranged to exchange fields and properties , as far as possible , when it becomes evident that the best interests of the cause demand it . I have , for instance , given up our church at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of that faith and ask for a - ist minister . The - ists have given up a field to me . The  - -  - ans promise not to enter a field where we have a church , though pressed by some to do so . We have arranged for another meeting in six months . ' " Now , I say that 's the best report we have had to-day . It makes me feel more like shouting hallelujah ! than anything I 've heard for many a day . And if this were my meeting-house , and were not the meeting-house of a very staid and undemonstrative body of disciples ( laughter ) I should call for three cheers for those grand fellows out West who have got the denominational devil fairly under , and who have set out to treat one another , in their mission work , like Christian gentlemen ! " As Mr. Franklin went down from the platform amid a tempest of hand-clapping , the organ and the choir burst forth with the doxology , in which the congregation joined , and the convention went out in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked quietly away to their lodgings . The first to speak , when they are out of the hubbub , was Mr. Thornton : " Does n't your friend need a vacation ? " Franklin ? " " The same . " " He does indeed . I have been urging him to go abroad . " " He must go . He shall go . I want him to help me organize a Christian League Club in Manchester . That is the place to begin . " " Do you think it would work on your side the water ? " " Why should n't it ? It might need some modifications . But it undertakes nothing more than the Christianizing of our churches . " And nothing less , " you might add . " And nothing less ! It is a great thing to undertake , but he would be a faithless Christian who should doubt whether it could come to pass .
