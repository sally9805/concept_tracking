txt The recent small majority only 36 ? reported in the French Corps L ? gislatif in favor of the Marriage law of 1816 shows that in all probability in the next session the Republican Party will restore liberty of divorce in France . It must be remembered by our readers that France , until the first French Revolution , was under the strict Catholic law of marriage . The great change in ideas and practices which then swept over Europe modified the French law in this particular , and at length , in the January Code Civil , ( 1792 , ) the grounds of divorce were settled , and were substantially what they are in many of our States , even " mutual consent , " expressed in certain prescribed legal modes , being a sufficient cause . The reaction , however , after the fall of the First NAPOLEON changed all this , and France in 1816 returned to the old ecclesiastical legislation on marriage and divorce , the bond being considered practically indissoluble , and only " separation of body " being permitted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposition has , however , been carried on during the last twenty years against this marriage legislation , by a party headed by a leader , M. NAQum ' , who has shown himself able as well as determined . He is at the head of the present movement in the French Assembly to return to the provisions of the Code Civil . The advocates of divorce in France have a great advantage in opposing a legislation which was enacted during the monarchical reaction . This effort seems to be a part of the general Republican movement . But if the experience of transatlantic Republicans is of any value in the question , we should whisper the old proverb to French democrats , " Festina lento ! " The wisest heads here agree that it would have been much better for this country if we had " made haste " a little more " slowly . " The current of the day set very strongly in favor of free divorce , so that in some of our States , especially in Connecticut and Indiana , we passed exceedingly liberal divorce laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for any such misconduct as permanently destroys the happiness of the petitioner , or defeats the purpose of the conjugal relation . " A natural result in. that State was that out of every ten marriages one was broken by divorce . In Indi -- ana , as is well known , divorce was obtained even more easily , and the procedure was so lax that sometimes a husband or wife was divorced without ever having heard of the petition of the other partner . The enlightened citizens of both these States are fully convinced of the evils resulting from such a lax condition of the marriage laws . Young persons have been found uniting in marriage as easily as they would join in an excursion party , and breaking the ? association as lightly . Children have been left uncared for on the world , and thousands of homes made wretched . A general sense of indifference has been attached to this most sacred tie , and the beginning of a fatal disorganization hag been experienced . So strong is the feeling among the most intelligent classes of these States that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? marriage ? law . The divorces in many States have increased in a truly alarming manner . In Vermont the proportion is 1 to 21.5 marriages ; in Massachusetts , 1 to 44.4 ; in Ohio , 1 to 26 , and in Connecticut , in 1864 , 1 to 10 . In France , on the other hand , from 1871 to 1874 it was 1 to 152 . The greatest evil felt in the United States from free divorce and loose marriage is among the foreign and ( mainly ) Catholic poor in the large cities . Wives are continually abandoned by their husbands as they become older and less attractive and their families increase . The children are left upon the streets , and form the criminal and abandoned youth who so swarm in our large cities . Loose marriage and free divorce are among the most prominent causes of juvenile crime and destitution in the United States . The conviction is ? strong here that if society ever degenerates on this continent it will be from the breaking up of homes by a loose marriage tie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position in the Union , has adopted the via media in this matter with very happy results . Our legislators have not believed in the extreme strictness characteristic of the English law and of the old law of South Carolina . They have considered such strictness as a hardship on the innocent , and as stimulating concubinage . They permitted separation for many causes , but allowed divorce only for a few extreme reasons . This added sacredness In the eyes of our people to the marriage bond , while in other extreme cases relief could be afforded by taking advantage of the marriage laws of other States . Marriages , on the whole , have been more permanent in New-York than in any other State : nowhere have theY been haupier , and in no large and wealthy community in the world are there so few concubinages . . Cases too , of great hardship , as of wives bound to drunken husbands , or similar misfortunes , are relieved by the laws of other States , and yet the respect - for the institution is preserved .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
