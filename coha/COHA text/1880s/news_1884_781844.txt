txt Mr. ALBERT DAGGETT , of Brooklyn , while admitting that he has been forced by public opinion to support the city reform measures , loses no opportunity to sneer at the whole business , and to refer to Mr. ROOSEVELT as if he were the mighty power that was forcing them through a reluctant Legislature . Mr. DAGGE'rT 'S actions and words provoke a comparison between the conduct of the two men . The gentleman from Brooklyn votes for measures which he is at some pains to show that he does not believe in and would oppose if he dared . He does not act upon conviction , nor would he do so if he followed his inclination . The bills which were before the Senate yesterday are intended to effect very important reforms in the administration of certain offices in this city . Those offices have long been used to furnish corruption funds for political factions . Their incumbents have received extravagant emoluments from the public in order that candidates might bear enormous election expenses and continue liberal contributions for political purposes after their election . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a business basis . Evidently Mr. DAGGETT does not appicrve of this , but there is nothing which in decency he can say against it , and therefore he sneers at reform in general , and makes a feeble effort to ridicule Mr. ROOSEVELT 'S power in the Legislature . Mr. ROOSEVELT 'S power and the position of influence which he has gained in so short a time are due simply to the fact that he does believe in reform . He is opposed to using the public service to furnish the motive power and pecuniary resources of party machinery . Therein he represents all intelligent and honest citizens , and wins their support and esteem . Mr. DAGGETT does not wish to have corruption and inefaciency in the public service exposed and remedied . He has profited by it in the past , and doubtless hopes to profit by it in the future . He admits that he must , just at present , permit it to drive over.him , but it is much against his will . Here we have two very fair representatives of the political forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties into corrupt practices , degrades the public service , and leads to dishonor . The party that is dominated by it can maintain itself only so long as the people are themselves either ignorant , corrupt , or indifferent . It is at war with the very life of popular government . ? Everybody knows what that spirit is and what the effect of its operation has been . Opposed to it is the spirit of reform , which demands the exposure of rottenness , the correction of abuses , and , the maintenance of . an honest standard in public administration . Mr. ROOSEVELT has had the sound instinct , the clear intelligence , and the moral courage to act upon the promptings of this spirit . It is an assuring sign of the times that he receives in this such support from the public that men like DAGGETT are forced to admit that it is useless to resist the cause of which he is the champion . This resistless power comes from the convictions of the people , which find in Mr. ROOSEVELT a convenient exponent . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that of Mr. ROOSEVELT which his own words suggest , the latter has no reason to envy his satisfaction .
