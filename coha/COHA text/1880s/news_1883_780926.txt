txt The people along the Lower Mississippi are already feeling uneasy about the unusually high water for this season of the year , and the knowledge of a severe Winter in the north-west , whose melting snow will continue to feed the streams above that are now overfull . The Mississippi River is now less than six feet under the high-water mark in front of New-Orleans , and is rising rapidly . The closure of the natural outlet of Bonnet Carre Crevasse sends down in front of the city an immense volume of water that formerly escaped through the lakes to the sea , and which will make a difference of several inches in the height of the stream . The city authorities have therefore begun to strengthen the levees above the city . In the meantime , news has been brought in to-day of a cave in the Sauve levee , six miles above the city , At this point the water is abreast of the base of the levee , and in some planes running through . It requires prompt attention to save this city from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Army engineers report that the levees at Alsatia and near Delta are still incomplete , and these points are in aangor . At the former a protection levee has been begun as a relief to the main work . It is to be 0 feet high and 1,200 feet long . The contractors have about 500 men and 90 teams at work on it . The levee from Bedford 's to Delta , in Madison Parish . is in a much more dangerous condition , and in the opinion of the engineers will not he up in time to prevent a rise of five feet more going over . The Point Conpee Levee , four miles above Bayou Sara . will not stand a rise of more than three and a half feet . Meyers , the contractor , is behind with the work . The force of men at the Government works at Wilson 's Point has been about 1,000. but , owing to the high stage of the water , has been reduced to 400 men .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
