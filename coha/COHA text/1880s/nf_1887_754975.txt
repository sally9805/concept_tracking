txt //he abolition of the old Colonial policy of trade was a great wrench . The cold , neglectful , contemptuous treatment of Colonies in general , and of Canada in particular , by the doctrinaire Whigs and Benthamite-Radicals , and by Tories of the Adderley school , had , up to recent periods , become a painful strain . Denuding Canada of the Imperial red-coat disgusted very many . And the constant whispering , at the door of Canada , by United States influences , combined with the expenditure of United States money on Nova Scotian and other Canadian elections , must be looked to , and stopped , to prevent a slide in the direction of Washington . On the other hand , the statesmanlike action of Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton , Colonial Minister in 1859 , in erecting British Columbia into a Crown Colony , was a break-water against the fell waves of annexation . The decided language of Her Majesty 's speech in proroguing Parliament at the end of 1859 was a manifesto of decided encouragement to all loyal people on the American Continent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I might say the triumphal progress  --  of the Prince of Wales , accompanied by the Colonial Minister , the great Duke of Newcastle , through Canada , in 1860 , the loyal idea began to germinate once more . Loyal subjects began to think that no spot of earth over which the British flag had once floated would ever , again , be given up  --  without a fight for it . Canada for England , and England for Canada ! But , what will our Government at home do with the new " North-west Passage " through Canada ? The future of Canada depends upon the decision . What will the decision be ? How soon will it be given ? Is this great work , the Canadian Pacific Railway , to be left as a monument , at once , of Canada 's loyalty and foresight , and of Canada 's betrayal : or is it to be made the new land-route to our Eastern and Australian Empire ? If it is to be shunted , then the explorations of the last three hundred years have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statesmen of past times are reduced to dreams , and nothing more . The strength given by this glorious self-contained route , from the old country to all the new countries , is wasted . On the other hand , if those who now govern inherit the great traditions of the past ; if they believe in Empire ; if they are statesmen  --  then , a line of Military Posts , of strength and magnitude , beginning at Halifax on the Atlantic , and ending at the Pacific , will give power to the Dominion , and , wherever the red-coat appears , confidence in the old brave country will be restored . Then the soldier , his arms and our armaments , will have their periodical passages backwards and forwards through the Dominion . Mails for the East , for Australia , and beyond , will pass that way ; and the subject of every part of the Empire will , as he passes , feel that he is treading the sacred soil of real liberty and progress . Which is it to be ? Some years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live to see the day  --  and if I do not , that my son may be spared , to see Canada the right arm of England . To see Canada a powerful auxiliary of the Empire , not , as now , a source of anxiety , and a source of danger . " Does Her Majesty 's Government echo this aspiration ? Thinking people will recognize that the United States become , year by year , less English and more Cosmopolitan ; less conservative and more socialist ; less peaceful and more aggressive . Twice within ten years the Presidential elections have pushed the Republic to the very brink of civil war . But for the forbearance of Mr. Tilden and the Democrats , on one occasion ; and the caution of leading Republicans when President Cleveland was chosen , disturbance must have happened . We have yet to see whether Provincial Government may not , in the Dominion , lead towards Separation , rather than towards Union . While one Custom-house and one general Government is aiding Union , the Province of Quebec accentuates all that is French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the problem , here , is how , gradually , to weaken sectional , and how gradually to strengthen Union , ideas . State rights led to a civil war in the United States : Provincial Government fifty years hence may lead to conflicts in Canada . In the United States there was no solution but war . Surely in Canada we can apply the safety valve of augmenting British aid and influence . Why not try the re-introduction of the red-coat of the Queen 's soldier  --  that soldier to be enlisted and officered , let us hope in the early future , from every portion of the Queen 's Dominions  --  as of the one Imperial army ;  --  an Imperial army paid for by the whole Empire .

CHAPTER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pacific . A quarter of a century ago , charged with the temporary oversight of the then great Railway of Canada , I first made the acquaintance of Mr. Tilley , Prime Minister of the Province of New Brunswick , whom I met in a plain little room , more plainly furnished , at Frederickton , in New Brunswick . My business was to ask his co-operation in carrying out the physical union of Nova Scotia , New Brunswick , and through them Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland , with Canada by means of what has since been called the " Intercolonial " Railway . That Railway , projected half a century ago , was part of the great scheme of 1851 ,  --  of which the Grand Trunk system from Portland , on the Atlantic , to Richmond ; and from Riviere du Loup , by Quebec and Richmond , to Montreal , and then on to Kingston , Toronto , Sarnia , and Detroit  --  had been completed and opened when I , thus , visited Canada , as Commissioner , in the autumn of 1861 . I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction of this arterial Railway  --  initial , in the sense that , without it , discussions in reference to the fiscal , or the political , federation , or the absolute union , under one Parliament , of all the Provinces was vain . I found , also , that Mr. Tilley had , ardently , embraced the great idea  --  to be realized some day , distant though that day might be  --  of a great British nation , planted , for ever , under the Crown , and extending from the Atlantic to the Pacific . Certainly , in 1861 , this great idea seemed like a mere dream of the uncertain future . Blocked by wide stretches of half-explored country : dependent upon approaches through United States ' territory : each Province enforcing its separate , and differing , tariffs , the one against the other , and others , through its separate Custom House ; it was not matter of surprise to find a growing gravitation towards the United States , based , alike , on augmenting trade and augmenting prejudices . Amongst party politicians at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1861 , little adhesion to the idea of a Colonial Empire ; and the reader has only to read the reference , made later on , to a published letter of Sir Charles Adderley to Mr. Disraeli in 1862 , to see how the pulse of some of the Conservative party was then beating . There was , however , one bright gleam of hope . That was to be found in the , still remembered , effects of the visit of the Prince of Wales , accompanied by the Duke of Newcastle , to Canada , and the United States , in 1860 . Entertaining , with no small enthusiasm , and in common , these views of an Anglo-American Empire , Mr. Tilley and I were of the same opinion as to practical modes . We must go " step by step , " and the Intercolonial Railway was the first step in the march before us . In the following pages will be found some record of what followed . Suffice it here to say , that the Railway is made , not on the route I advocated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the shortest iron road from the great harbour of Halifax , in Nova Scotia , to the Pacific may be secured . The vast western country , bigger than Russia in Europe , more or less possessed and ruled over , since the days of Prince Rupert , the first governor , by the " Merchant Adventurers of England trading to Hudson 's Bay , " has been annexed to Canada , and one country , under one Parliament , is bounded by the two great oceans ; and , as a consequence , the " Canadian Pacific Railway " has been made and opened for the commerce of the world . Mr. Tilley , now Sir Leonard Tilley , is , at the moment , Lieutenant-Governor of New Brunswick , having previously filled the highest offices in the Government of the " Dominion of Canada ; " and he has not forgotten the vow he and I exchanged some while after our first acquaintance . That vow was , that we neither of us would die , if we could help it , " until we had looked upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British railway carriage . " The Canadian Pacific Railway is completed , completed by the indomitable perseverance of Sir George Stephen , Mr. Van Horne , and their colleagues  --  sustained as they have been , throughout , by the far-sighted policy and liberal subsidies , granted ungrudgingly , by the Dominion Parliament , under the advice of Sir John A. Macdonald , the Premier . I have , in the past year , fulfilled my vow , by traversing the Canadian Continent from Quebec to Port Moody , Vancouver City , and Victoria , Vancouver 's Island , over the 3,100 miles of Railway possessed by the Canadian Pacific Company , and have " looked upon the waters of the Pacific from the windows of a British railway carriage . " My impressions of this grand work will be found in future chapters . " The Dominion of Canada " now includes the various Provinces of North America , formerly known as Upper and Lower Canada , New Brunswick , Nova Scotia , Prince Edward Island , British Columbia , Vancouver 's Island , and the extensive regions of The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manitoba , and the North West Territories ; in fact , the whole of British North America , except Newfoundland . This territory stretches from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean , and ( including Newfoundland ) is estimated to contain a total area of some four million square miles . As matter of mere surface , and probably of cultivable area , also , more than half the Northern Continent of America owes allegiance to the Crown and to Queen Victoria . So may it remain . So it will remain if we retain the Imperial instinct . These noble provinces are confederated into a vast dominion , with one common Law , one Custom House , and one " House of Commons "  --  by a simple Act of the Imperial Parliament , the Confederation Act of 1867 , passed while Lord Beaconsfield was Prime Minister and the Duke of Buckingham Colonial Minister . This union was effected quietly , unostentatiously , and in peace ; and ( circumstances well favouring ) by the exertions , influence , and faithfulness to Imperial traditions , of Cartier , John A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tupper , Van Koughnet , and other provincial statesmen , who forced the Home Government to action and fired their brother colonists with their own enthusiasm . At home , all honour is due to a great Colonial Minister  --  the Duke of Newcastle . Taking up , some years ago , a tuft of grass growing at the foot of one of the grand marble columns of the Parthenon at the Acropolis at Athens , I found a compass mark in the footing , or foundation  --  a mere scratch in the stone  --  made , probably , by some architect 's assistant , before the Christian era . I make no claim to more than having made a scratch of some sort on the foundation stone of some pillar , or other , of Confederation . And I throw together these pages with no idea of gaining credit for services , gratuitously rendered , over a period of years and under many difficulties , to a cause which I have always had at heart ; but with the desire to record some facts of interest which , hereafter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interleaved in some future history of the union of the great American provinces of the British Empire . I have another motive also : I should wish to contribute some information bearing upon any future account of the life of the late Duke of Newcastle . He is dead : and , so far , no one has attempted to write his biography . That may be reserved for another generation . He was the Colonial Minister under whose rule and guidance the foundations of the great measure of Confederation were , undoubtedly , laid ; and to him , more than to any minister since Lord Durham , the credit of preserving , as I hope for ever , the rule of her Majesty , and her successors , over the Western Continent ought to attach . For , while the idea of an union , of more or less extent , was suggested in Lord Durham 's time  --  probably by Charles Buller ,  --  and was now and then fondled by other Governors-General , in Canada , and by Colonial Ministers at home  --  the real , practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Atlantic to the Pacific were due to the far-sighted policy and persuasive influence of the Duke . The Duke was a statesman singularly averse to claiming credit for his own special public services , while ever ready to attribute credit and bestow praise on those around him . My first interview with the Duke was in January , 1847 . He was then Lord Lincoln , and the Conservative candidate for Manchester ; in disgrace with his father . His father was the old fashioned nobleman who desired " to do what he liked with his own , " and never would rebuild Nottingham Castle , burnt in 1832 by the Radicals . The son had cast in his lot with Sir Robert Peel and free trade . The father was still one of the narrow-minded class to whom reform of any kind was the spectre of " ruin to the country . " They were quite honest in the conviction that the people were " born to be governed , and not to govern . " They probably saw in the free importation of foreign food the abrogation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Manchester , whom we of the old Anti-Corn Law League supported . The interview I refer to was actuated by our desire to avoid an undeserved opposition ; Lord Lincoln retired , however , owing mainly to other reasons , including that of the intolerance of a body of Churchmen regarding popular education . A long period of wretched health compelled me for several years to consume what strength I had left in the ordinary routine of daily business . And it was not until 1852 that any further intercourse of any kind took place between us . In that year I published a little book about the United States and Canada , the record of my first visit to North America , in 1851 . And , if I recollect rightly , I travelled with the Duke in the spring of 1852 , probably between Rugby and Derby , and found him in possession of a copy of this little book , on which he had , faute de mieux , spent half-a-crown at the book stall at Euston . He recognised me ; and it was my fault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him till 1857 , by which time , no doubt , he had forgotten me . Still our conversation in 1852 about America , and especially as to slavery , and the probability of a separation of North and South , will always dwell in my memory . Lord Lincoln had studied De Tocqueville ; but he had not , yet , seen America . He had , therefore , at that time many erroneous views , which could only be corrected by the actual and personal opportunity of seeing and measuring , on the spot , the country , which always really means the people . This opportunity was given to him by the visit of the Prince of Wales to Canada and the United States , in 1860 . He accompanied the Prince in his capacity of Colonial Minister . These casual glimpses of Lord Lincoln were followed by an interview between us in 1857 . In the meantime , it is true , he had had my name brought before him during his term of office pending the Crimean War Some one had suggested to the Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Stores Department , at a time when all was confusion and mess , out there , and I was asked to call on the Minister about it . It seemed to me , however , a duty impossible of execution by a civilian , unless the condition of " full powers " were conceded ,  --  and the matter came to nothing . In 1856 I was the Manager of the Manchester , Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway . In that year a reckless engine , travelling between Shireoaks and Worksop , threw out some sparks , which set fire to the underwood of one of the Duke 's plantations  --  for he was then Duke  --  and he wrote to the Chairman of the Railway , the then Earl of Yarborough , in what appeared to me a very haughty manner . I therefore felt bound to defend my chief , and I took up the quarrel . In a note addressed from the Library of the House of Commons , I asked for an interview , which was somewhat stiffly granted . This was the note which led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Decr. 1856 . " MY DEAR YARBOROUGH , " Instead of placing the enclosed extraordinary production in the hands of my Solicitor , I think it best , in the first instance , to send it to you as Chairman of the M. S. &; L. Railway , because I can not believe that either its tone or its substance can have been authorized by the Directors . " I am sorry to say this is not the first piece of impertinence which I have had to complain of in reference to the damage done to my woods by the engines of the Company , and neither Mr. Foljambe nor I have had any encouragement to treat the matter in the amicable spirit which we were anxious to evince . " The demands now made by the aggressors upon the party aggrieved is simply preposterous , and , of course , will be treated as it deserves . We shall next have the Company , or rather , as I hope and believe , the Company 's Solicitors , demanding us to cut all our corn within 100 yards of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Your Solicitor knows perfectly well that the Company is by law liable for damage done to woods ; and , moreover , that such damage is preventible by proper care on the part of its servants . " I think the Directors ought to order their Solicitor to write to me and others , to whom so impertinent a letter has been addressed , and beg to withdraw it , with an apology for having sent it . " I am sorry to trouble you with this matter , because I feel that you ought not to be troubled with business in your present state of health ; but as you are still the Chairman , I could not with propriety write to any other person . " I am , my dear Yarborough , " Yours very sincerely , " NEWCASTLE . " THE EARL OF YARBOROUGH , &c.,; &c."; Accordingly , I went to the mansion in Portman Square . I waited some time ; but at last in stalked the Duke , looking very awful indeed  --  so stern and severe  --  that I could not help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your Grace . " Upon this he laughed , held out his hand , placed me beside him , and we had a very long discussion , not about the fire , but about the colliery he , then , was sinking  --  against the advice of many of his friends in Sheffield  --  at Shireoaks ; and when he had done with that , we talked , once more , about Canada , the United States , and the Colonies generally . After this date , I had to see the Duke on business , more and more frequently . The year after the Duke 's return from Canada , in 1861 , he happened to read an article I had written in a London paper , hereafter given , about opening up the Northern Continent of America by a Railway across to the Pacific , and he spoke of it as embodying the views which he had before expressed , as his own . In 1854 Mr. Glyn and Mr. Thomas Baring had urged me to undertake a mission to Canada on the business of the Grand Trunk Railway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when , in 1860-1 , the affairs of that undertaking became dreadfully entangled , the Committee of Shareholders , who reported upon its affairs , invited me to accept the post of " Superintending Commissioner , " with full powers . They desired me to take charge of such legislative and other measures as might retrieve the Company 's disasters , so far as that might be possible . Before complying with this proposal , I consulted the Duke , and it was mainly under the influence of his warm concurrence that I accepted the mission offered to me . I accepted it in the hope of being able , not merely to serve the objects of the Shareholders of the Grand Trunk , but that at the same time I might be somewhat useful in aiding those measures of physical union contemplated when the Grand Trunk Railway was projected , and which must precede any confederation of interests , such as that happily crowned in 1867 by the creation of the " Dominion of Canada . " I find that my general views were , some time before , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Baring , then President of the Grand Trunk , did not , at first , accept my views ; but he and Mr. Glyn ( the late Lord Wolverton ) co-operated afterwards in all ways in the direction those views indicated . " NORTHENDEN , " 13th November , 1860 . " Some years ago Mr. Glyn ( I think with the assent of Mr. Baring ) proposed to me to go out to Canada to conduct a negotiation with the Colonial Government in reference to the Grand Trunk Railway . I was compelled then , from pressure of other business , to refuse what at that time would have been , to me , a very agreeable mission . Since then , I have grown older , and somewhat richer ; and not being dependent upon the labour of the day , I should be very chary of increasing the somewhat heavy load of responsibility and anxiety which I still have to bear . It is doubtful , therefore , whether I could bring my mind to undertake so arduous , exceptional  --  perhaps even doubtful  --  an engagement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Grand Trunk Railway . " This line , both as regards its length , the character of its works , and its alliances with third parties , is both too extensive , and too expensive , for the Canada of to-day ; and left , as it is , dependent mainly upon the development of population and industry on its own line , and upon the increase of the traffic of the west , it can not be expected , for years to come , to emancipate itself thoroughly from the load of obligations connected with it . " Again , the Colonial Government having really , in spite of all the jobbery and political capital alleged to have been perpetrated and made in connexion with this concern , made great sacrifices in its behalf , is not likely , having got the Railway planted on its own soil , to be ready to give much more assistance to this same undertaking . " That the discipline and traffic of the line could be easily put upon a sound basis , that that traffic could be vigorously developed , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could be kept down , and that friendly , and perhaps improving and more beneficial , arrangements could be made with the local government  --  is matter , to me , of little doubt . Any man thoroughly versed in railways and quite up to business , and especially accustomed to the management of men and the conduct of serious negotiation , could easily accomplish this . But after all , unless I am very much deceived , all this will be insufficient , for many years to come , to satisfy the Shareholders ; and I should not advise Mr. Glyn or Mr. Baring to tie their reputations to any man , however able or experienced , if it involved a sort of moral guarantee that the result of his appointment should be any very sudden improvement , of a character likely much to raise the value of the property in the market , which unfortunately is what the Shareholders very naturally look at , as the test of everything . " To work the Grand Trunk as a gradually improving property would , I repeat , be easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great success in a few years can only , in my opinion , be done in one way . That way , to many , would be chimerical ; to some , incomprehensible ; and possibly I may be looked upon myself as somewhat visionary for even suggesting it . That way , however , to my mind , lies through the extension of railway communication to the Pacific . " Try for one moment to realize China opened to British commerce : Japan also opened : the new gold fields in our own territory on the extreme west , and California , also within reach : India , our Australian Colonies  --  all our eastern Empire , in fact , material and moral , and dependent ( as at present it too much is ) upon an overland communication , through a foreign state . " Try to realize , again , assuming physical obstacles overcome , a main through Railway , of which the first thousand miles belong to the Grand Trunk Company , from the shores of the Atlantic to those of the Pacific , made just within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corn-growing latitude . The result to this Empire would be beyond calculation ; it would be something , in fact , to distinguish the age itself ; and the doing of it would make the fortune of the Grand Trunk . " Assuming also , again I say , that physical obstacles can be overcome , is not the time opportune for making a start ? The Prince is just coming home full of glowing notions of the vast territories he has seen : the Duke of Newcastle has been with him  --  and he is Colonial Minister : there is jealousy and uncertainty on all questions relating to the east , coincident with an enormous development of our eastern relations , making people all anxious , if they could , to get another way across to the Pacific :  --  the new gold fields on the Frazer River are attracting swarms of emigrants ; and the public mind generally is ripe , as it seems to me , for any grand and feasible scheme which could be laid before it . " To undertake the Grand Trunk with the notion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and for Canada , throws an entirely new light upon the whole matter , and as a means to this end doubtless the Canadian Government would co-operate with the Government of this country , and would make large sacrifices for the Grand Trunk in consequence . The enterprise could only be achieved by the co-operation of the two Governments , and by associating with the Railway 's enterprise some large land scheme and scheme of emigration . " The visit of the Prince of Wales to Canada and the Maritime Provinces , in 1860 , had evoked the old feeling of loyalty to the mother country , damaged as it had been by Republican vicinity , the entire change of commercial relations brought about by free trade , and sectional conflicts . And the Duke , at once startled by the underlying hostility to Great Britain and to British institutions in the United States  --  which even the hospitalities of the day barely cloaked  --  and gratified beyond measure by the outbursts of genuine feeling on the part of the colonists , was most anxious , especially while entrusted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together all that was loyal north of the United States boundary . Walking with Mr. Seward in the streets of Albany , after the day 's shouts and ceremonies were over , Mr. Seward said to the Duke , " We really do not want to go to war with you ; and we know you dare not go to war with us . " To which the Duke replied , " Do not remain under such an error . There is no people under Heaven from whom we should endure so much as from yours ; to whom we should make such concessions . You may , while we can not , forget that we are largely of the same blood . But once touch us in our honour and you will very soon find the bricks of New York and Boston falling about your heads . " In relating this to me the Duke added , " I startled Seward a good deal ; but he put on a look of incredulity nevertheless . And I do not think they believe we should ever fight them ; but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be remarked that this conversation between Seward and the Duke was in 1860 . That no one , then , expected a revolution from an anti-slave-state election of President . Still less did the people , of either England or the United States , dream of a divergence , consequent on such an election , to end in a struggle , first for political power , and then following , in providential order , for human freedom . A struggle culminating in the entire subjection of the South , in 1865 , after four years ' war  --  a struggle costing a million of lives , untold human misery , and a loss in money , or money 's worth , of over a thousand millions sterling . In our many conversations , I had always ventured to enforce upon the Duke that the passion for territory , for space , would be found at the bottom of all discussion with the United States . Give them territory , not their own , and for a time you would appease them , while , still , the very feast would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cass had said , " I have an awful swallow ( ' swaller ' was his pronunciation ) for territory ; " and all Americans have that " awful swallow . " The dream of possessing a country extending from the Pole to the Isthmus of Panama , if not to Cape Horn , has been the ambition of the Great Republic  --  and it is a dangerous ambition for the rest of the world . We have seen its effects in all our treaties . We have always been asked for land . We gave up Michigan after the war of 1812 . We gave up that noble piece , the " Aroostook " country , now part of the State of Maine , under the Ashburton Treaty in 1841 . We have , again , been shuffled out of our boundary at St. Juan on the Pacific , under an arbitration which really contained its own award . The Reciprocity Treaty was put an end to , in 1866 , by the United States , not because the Great West  --  who may govern the Union if they please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West was cajoled by the cunning East into believing that a restriction of intercourse between the United States and the British Provinces would , at last , force the subjects of the Queen to seek admission into the Republic . So it was , and is and will be ; and the only way to prevent aggression and war was , is , and will be , to " put our foot down . " Not to cherish the " peace-in-our-time " policy , or to indulge in the half-hearted language , to which I shall have hereafter to allude  --  but to combine and strengthen the sections of our Colonial Empire in the West  --  to give to their people a greater Empire still , a nobler history , and a prouder lot : a lot to last , because based upon institutions which have stood , and will stand , the test of time and trouble . Unfortunately we have had a " little England " party in our country . A Liberal Government , immediately following the Act of Confederation , took every red-coat out of the Dominion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very shot and shell to any one , friend or foe , who chose to buy : and the few guns and mortars Canada demanded were charged to her " in account " with the ruth of the miser . If the Duke of Newcastle had been a member of that Cabinet such a miserable policy never could have been put in force ; but he was dead . I venture to think that the whole people of England , who knew of the transaction , were ashamed of it . Certainly , I saw , a few years ago , that one member of the very Cabinet which did this thing , repudiated the " little England " policy , as opposed to the best traditions of the Liberal party . The " little England " party of the past have tried , so far in vain , to alienate these our fellow subjects . But , fortunately for the Empire , while some in the mother country have been indifferent as to whether the Provinces went or stayed , many in the Colonies have been earnest in their desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these patriotic men was well described in December , 1862 , by Lord Shaftesbury , at a dinner given to Messrs . Howe , Tilley , Howland and Sicotte , delegates from the Provinces of Canada , New Brunswick and Nova Scotia . He said Canada addressed us in the affecting language of Ruth  --  " Entreat me not to leave thee , nor to refrain from following after thee "  --  and he asked , " Whether the world had ever seen such a spectacle as great and growing nations , for such they were , with full and unqualified power to act as they pleased , insisting on devoting their honor , strength , and substance to the support of the common mother ; and not only to be called , but to be , sons . " And Lord Shaftesbury asked , " Whether any imperial ruler had ever preferred , " as he said Canada had , " love to dominion , and reverence to power . " Lord Shaftesbury 's sentiments are , I believe , an echo of those of the " great England " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " sold the shot and shell , nevertheless . Whatever this man or that may claim to have done towards building up Confederation , I , who was in good measure behind the scenes throughout , repeat that to the late Duke of Newcastle the main credit of the measure of 1867 was due . While failing health and the Duke 's premature decease left to Mr. Cardwell and Mr. W. E. Forster  --  and afterwards to Lord Carnarvon and the Duke of Buckingham  --  the completion of the work before the English Parliament , it was he who stood in the gap , and formed and moulded , with a patience and persistence admirable to behold , Cabinet opinion both in England and in the Provinces . At the same time George Etienne Cartier , John A. Macdonald , and John Ross , in Canada ; Samuel L. Tilley , in New Brunswick , and , notably , Joseph Howe , in Nova Scotia , stood together for Union like a wall of brass . And these should ever be the most prominent amongst the honoured names of the authors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The works , I repeat , to be effected were  --  first , the physical union of the Maritime Provinces with Canada by means of Intercolonial Railways ; and , second , to get out of the way of any unification , the heavy weight and obstruction of the Hudson 's Bay Company . The ; latter was most difficult , for abundant reasons . This difficult work rested mainly on my shoulders . It may be well here to place in contrast the condition of the Provinces in 1861 and of the Confederation in 1886 . In 1861 each of the five Provinces had its separate Governor , Parliament , Executive , and system of taxation . To all intents and purposes , and notwithstanding the functions of the Governor-General and the unity flowing from the control of the British Crown  --  these Provinces , isolated for want of the means of rapid transit , were countries as separate in every relation of business , or of the associations of life , as Belgium and Holland , or Switzerland and Italy . The associations of New Brunswick and Nova @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Canada ; and the whole Maritime Provinces regulated their tariffs , as Canada did in return , from no consideration of developing a trade with each other , or with the Canadas , between whose territory and the ocean these Provinces barred the way . Thus , isolated and divided , it could be no matter of wonder if their separate political discussions narrowed themselves into local , sectional , and selfish controversies ; and if , while each possessing in their Legislature men in abundance who deserved the title of sagacious and able statesmen , brilliant orators , far-sighted men of business , their debates often reminded the stranger who listened to them of the squabbles of local town councils . Again , the Great Republic across their borders , with its obvious future , offered with open arms , and especially to the young and ambitious , a noble field , not shut in by winter or divided by separate governments . Thus the gravitation towards aggregation  --  which seems to be a condition of the progress of modern states  --  a condition to be intensified as space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the case of the Provinces , rather towards the United States than towards each other or the British Empire . Thus there were , in 1860 , many causes at work to discourage the idea of Confederation . And it is by no means improbable that the occurrence of the great Civil War destroyed this tendency . I remember an incident which occurred at a little dinner party which I gave in Montreal , in September , 1861 , to the delegates who assembled there , after my visits , in response to the appeal just made to the Governments of Canada , Nova Scotia , and New Brunswick , on the subject of the Intercolonial Railway . It illustrates the personal isolation alluded to above . The Honorable Joseph Howe , then Premier of Nova Scotia , said , " We have been more like foreigners than fellow-subjects ; you do not know us , and we do not know you . There are men in this room , who hold the destinies of this half of the Continent in their hands ; and yet we never meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit of the Prince of Wales , we are obliged to meet . I say , " he added , " we have done more good by a free talk over this table , to-night , than all the Governors , general and local , could do in a year , if they did nothing ' but write despatches . Oh ! if you fellows would only now and then dine and drink with us fellows , we would make a great partnership directly . " And the great partnership has been made , save only that Newfoundland still remains separate . In Canada the divisions between the Upper and Lower Provinces were , in 1861 , serious , and often acrimonious ; for they were religious as well as political . The rapid growth of Upper Canada , overtopping that of the French-speaking and Catholic Lower Province , led to demands to upset the great settlement of 1839 , and to substitute for an equal representation , such a redistribution of seats as would have followed the numerical progression of the country . " Representation by population "  --  shortly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great cry of the ardent Liberal or " Grit " party , at whose head was George Brown , of the " Toronto Globe "  --  powerful , obstinate , Scotch , and Protestant , and with Yankee leanings . In fact , the same principles were in difference as those which evolved themselves in blood in the contest between the North and South between 1861 and 1865 . The minority desired to preserve the power and independence which an equal share in parliamentary government had given them . The majority , mainly English and Scotch , and largely Protestant and Presbyterian , chafed under what they deemed to be the yoke of a non-progressive people ; a people content to live in modest comfort , to follow old customs , and obey old laws ; to defer to clerical authority , and to preserve their separate national identity under the secure protection of a strong Empire . Indeed , it is difficult , in 1886 , to realise the heat , or to estimate the danger , of the discussion of this question ; and more than one " Grit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ startled if we reminded him of his opinion in 1861 ,  --  that the question would be " settled by a civil war " if it " could not be settled peaceably , " but that " settled it must be  --  and soon . " The cure for this dangerous disease was to provide , for all , a bigger country  --  a country large enough to breed large ideas . There is a career open in the boundless resources of a varied land for every reasonable ambition , and the young men of Canada , which possesses an excellent educational machinery , may now look forward to as noble , if not more noble , an inheritance than their Republican neighbours  --  an inheritance where there is room for 100,000,000 of people to live in freedom , comfort , and happiness . While progress will have its periodical checks , and periodical inflations , there is no reason to doubt that before the next century ends the " Dominion , " if still part of the Empire , will  --  in numbers  --  outstrip the present population of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past antagonism of " Rep. by Pop . " is forgotten . Past and gone . A vast country , rapidly augmenting in population and wealth , free from any serious sectional controversy , free , especially , from any idea of separation , bound together under one governing authority , with one tariff and one system of general taxation , has exhibited a capacity for united action , and for self-government and mutual defence , admirable to behold . CHAPTER II . Towards the Pacific  --  Liverpool to Quebec . Leaving Liverpool at noon of the 2nd September , 1886 , warping out of the dock into the river  --  a long process  --  we arrived , in the fine screw steamer " Sardinian , " of the Allan line , off Moville , at five on the following morning ; and we got out of the inlet at five in the afternoon , after receiving mails and passengers . It may be asked , why a delay of twelve hours at Moville ? The answer is  --  the Bar at Liverpool . The genius and pre-vision of the dock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ port in a disgraceful condition , year after year  --  year after year . And the trade of Lancashire , Yorkshire , Cheshire , and Derbyshire , is compelled to depend upon a sand-bar , over which , at low tide , there is eight feet of water only . Such a big ship as " The Sardinian " can cross the bar in two short periods , or twice in the twenty-four hours , over a range , probably , of three or four hours . On my return home I wrote the following letter about this bar to " The Times " :  --  " THE BAR AT LIVERPOOL . " SIR ,  --  You inserted some time ago in ' The Times ' a letter from Professor Ramsay detailing the troubles arising to travellers from the other side of the Atlantic , owing to shallow water outside the entrance to Liverpool , and you enforced the necessity of some improvement , in a very able article . Professor Ramsay was at that time returning from the meeting of the British Association , held in the Dominion of Canada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question becomes more and more urgent , the bar , with its eight feet of water at low tide , remains as it was , save that some navigators contend that it grows worse . " Yesterday 340 passengers , of whom I was one , by the noble Cunard ship ' The Etruria , ' experienced the difficulty in all its varieties of trouble . " After rushing through very heavy seas and against violent winds for three or four days , we cast anchor a good way outside the bar at 5 o'clock yesterday ( Sunday ) morning . The weather was too rough for the fine tug-boat , ' The Skirmisher , ' to come so far out . So , after swinging about till 10 o'clock , we moved slowly on , crossed the bar about half-past 11 , and were off the northernmost dock later on . Here the usual process of hauling the ship round by the aid of the tug took place , and then the further process of putting the baggage on board the tug , in advance of taking the passengers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a special tug-boat by some friends , got to the landing-stage , where the baggage is examined by the Customs , and , a carriage waiting for me , was at the Central Station at Liverpool at one o'clock . But , with all these comfortable arrangements , I had lost at least seven hours , and had missed all morning trains . The other passengers , I fear , did not get through for two or three hours later , and those for London would be lucky if they just caught the 4 o'clock train . " It would not , I am told , be prudent to take a ship of the size and draught of ' The Etruria ' over the bar till two hours before high water on a flowing , and one hour after on an ebbing , tide . Thus , for such a ship  --  and the tendency is to build larger and larger vessels  --  the margin , even in moderate weather , is probably three hours out of the twenty-four , or , in other words , exclusion from the port @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less . " Lancashire will soon have to say whether its manufactures and commerce are to be tied to the bar at Liverpool ; and , in the new competition of ports , a port open at any time of tide must ultimately draw the trade and traffic . " Before the Committee of the House of Commons , on Harbour Accommodation , on which Committee I had the honour to sit , it was proved that every country in Europe , having a sea-board , was making and improving deep-water harbours ,  --  except England . " Take the case of Antwerp , which is already attracting traffic to and from the great British possessions themselves by reason of its great facilities . " Liverpool is a place where the dogma of absolute perfection is accepted as a religion . But some of us may be pardoned if , in both local and national interests , we must be dissenters . " That the bar may be made better instead of growing worse is obvious . But the great cure is by cutting through the peninsula of Birkenhead and obtaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and obviously alternative . This was the advice of Telford seventy years ago , and ' The Times ' has called public attention to a practical way of working out the Telford idea , planned by Mr. Baggallay , C.E. , and laid before the Liverpool authorities  --  in vain . " I may add that if our ship had called at Holyhead , the London passengers might have left Holyhead on Saturday evening instead of Liverpool on Sunday afternoon , a difference of a day . " I beg to remain very faithfully yours , " EDWARD W. WATKIN . " Northenden , Oct. 18 , 1886 . " Some Liverpool cotton broker wrote to me to say that I had forgotten that there were two tides in the twenty-four hours . Nothing of the kind . There was one word miswritten , and , therefore , misprinted , which I have corrected : but the broad fact remains , and why my compatriots in the broad Lancashire district do not see the danger , I can not comprehend , unless it be that some of them are up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best of them , are indifferent . Steaming along , after leaving Moville , we passed Tory Island , the scene of many wrecks , and of disasters around . It has a lighthouse , but no telegraphic communication with the shore at all . I wrote a letter about that to the Editor of the " Standard . " Here it is :  --  " TORY ISLAND . " SIR ,  --  Newspapers are not to be had here , but as this good ship is only a week out from Liverpool , and five days from out of sight of land to sight of land , I may fairly assume that Parliament is still discussing Irish questions . " Thus I ask your indulgence to make reference to a question which is decidedly Irish , but is also Imperial , in the sense that it affects the lives of large numbers of persons , especially of the emigrant class , and is interesting to all the navigation and commerce of necessity passing the north-west extremity of Ireland . " If your readers will refer to the map they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ireland , Tory Island . It was on Tory Island that ' The Wasp ' and her gallant captain were lost , without hope of rescue , for want of cable communication ; and Tory Island itself has excited the interest of the philanthropist on many occasions . On Tory Island there is a lighthouse , with a fixed light , which can be seen sixteen miles . Not long ago , as I learn , a deputation from the Board of Irish Lighthouses went all the way to England to beg the Board of Trade , at Whitehall , to sanction the expenditure of eight hundred pounds , with a view to double the power of the light on Tory Island . Perhaps the Board of Trade , after some interval of time , may see their way to do what any man of business would decide upon in five minutes as obvious and essential . But that is not the point I wish to lay before you . My point is , that while the lighthouse on Tory Island is good for warning ships , and may , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is made of it in the way of transmitting ship intelligence . " I ask , therefore , to be allowed to advocate the connection of Tory Island , by telegraph cable , with the mainland of Ireland and its telegraph system . The cost of doing this one way would , as I estimate , be two thousand five hundred pounds ; the cost of doing it another way would be about six thousand pounds . " The first way would be by a cable from the lighthouse on Tory Island , leaving either Portdoon Bay , on the east end of Tory Island , or leaving Camusmore Bay on the south of it , and landing either on the sandy beach at Drumnafinny Point , or at Tramore Bay , where there is a similarly favourable beach . The distance in the former case is six and a half , in the latter seven and a half miles , the distance being slightly affected by the starting point selected . Adopting this route at a cost of two thousand five hundred pounds , which would include about twenty miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local purposes , would be the shortest and cheapest mode . " The second way would be to lay a cable from Tory Island to Malin Head , where the Allan Steamship Company have a signal station . The distance is twenty-nine miles ; the cost , as I estimate , about six thousand pounds . I should , however , prefer the former and cheaper plan , as I think it would serve a larger number of purposes and interests . " From Portdoon Bay , on Tory Island , to Tramore Bay the sea-bottom is composed of sand and shells , very good for cable-laying ; and there is a depth of water of from seventeen to nineteen fathoms . " Tory Island is the turning point  --  I might say pivot point  --  for all steam and sailing vessels coming from the South and across the Western Ocean , and using the North of Ireland route for Liverpool , Londonderry , Belfast , Glasgow , and a host of other ports and places . It can be approached with safety at a distance of half-a-mile , near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there being twenty fathoms at a distance of one-third of a mile from the Island . " The steamers of all the Canadian lines pass this point  --  the Allan , the Beaver , the Anchor , the Dominion  --  while all the steam lines beginning and ending at Glasgow , Greenock , and other Scotch ports do the same . Again , all sailing vessels , carrying a great commerce for Liverpool and ports up to Greenock and Glasgow , and round the north of Scotland to Newcastle and the East Coast ports , would be largely served by this proposal . Repeating that this is a question of saving life and of aiding navigation at an infinitesimal cost , I will now proceed to show the various benefits involved . " First of all it would save five hours , as compared with present plans , in signalling information of the passing to and fro of steamships . As respect all Canadian and many other steamers it would also expedite the mails , by enabling the steam tenders at Loch Foyle to come out and meet the ships outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often save a tide across the bar at Liverpool , and sometimes a day to the passengers going on by trains . As respects the Scotch steamers going north of Tory Island , it would enable the owners to learn the whereabouts of their vessels fourteen hours sooner than at present . In the case of sailing ships the advantages are far greater . Captain Smith , of this ship , a commander of deserved eminence , informs me that he has known sailing ships to be tacking about at the entrance of the Channel , between the Mull of Cantyre and the north coast of Ireland , for eighteen days in adverse and dangerous winds , unable to communicate with their owners , who , if informed by telegraph , could at once send tugs to their relief . Again , when eastern winds prevail , in the spring of the year , tugs being sent , owners would get their ships into port many days , or even weeks , sooner than at present . " But it needs no arguing that to all windbound and to disabled ships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " For the above reason I hope the slight cost involved will not be grudged , especially by our patriots , who have taken the Irish and Scotch emigrants under their special protection . I respectfully invite them and every one else to aid in protecting life and property in this obvious way . " I am , Sir , your obedient Servant , " E. W. WATKIN . " S.S. Sardinian , off Belle Isle , " September 9 , 1886 . " Our voyage on to Quebec had the usual changes of weather : hot sun , cold winds , snow , hail , icebergs , and gales of wind , and , when nearing Belle Isle , dense fog , inducing our able , but prudent , captain to stop his engines till daylight , when was sighted a wall of ice across our track at no great distance . Captain Smith prefers to take the north side of Belle Isle . There is a lighthouse on the Island , not , I thought , in a very good situation for passing on the north side . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belle Isle and Anticosti . Thus , in case of disaster , the only warning to Quebec would be the non-arrival of the ship , and the delay might make help too late . I ventured to call the attention of a leading member of the Canadian Government to this want of means of sending intelligence of passing ships and ships in distress . In winter this strait is closed by ice , and the lighthouses are closed too . Inside the fine inlet of " Amour Bay , " a natural dock , safe and extensive , we saw the masts of a French man-of-war . The French always protect their fishermen ; we at home usually let them take care of themselves . This French ship had been in these English waters some time ; and on a recent passage there was gun-firing , and the movement of men , to celebrate , as the captain learned , the taking of the Bastille . On the opposite coast is a little cove , in which a British ship got ashore , and was stripped by the local pirates of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the piracy ; but nothing seems to have been done . A British war-ship is never seen in these distant and desolate northern regions . It may well be that the sparse population think all the coasts still belong to France , in addition to the Isles of St. Pierre and Miquelon . This is how our navy is managed . Can it be true that the Marquis of Lorne recommended that an ironclad should be sent to Montreal for a season , as an emblem of British power and sway  --  and was refused ? After some trouble with fog and wind , preceded by a most remarkable Aurora Borealis , and some delay at night at Rimouska , we reached Quebec , and got alongside at Point Levi , on the afternoon of Saturday , the 11th September ; and I had great pleasure in meeting my old friend Mr. Hickson , who came down to meet Mrs. Hickson and his son and daughter , fellow-passengers of mine . I also at once recognized Dr. Rowand , the able medical officer of the Port of Quebec , who I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stayed the night at Russell 's Hotel ; and next day renewed my acquaintance with the city , finding the " Platform " wonderfully enlarged and improved , the work of Lord Dufferin , a new and magnificent Courthouse being built , and , above all , an immense structure of blue-grey stone , intended for the future Parliament House of the Province of Quebec . The facility of borrowing money in England on mere provincial , or town , security , appears to be a Godsend to architects and builders , and to aid and exalt local ambition for fine , permanent structures . Well , the buildings remain . To find the grand old fortifications of Quebec in charge of a handful of Canadian troops , seemed strange . Such fortresses belong to the Empire ; and the Queen 's redcoats should hold them all round the world . I was told  --  I hope it is not true  --  that the extensive works above Point Levi , opposite Quebec , constructed by British military labour , are practically abandoned to decay and weeds . CHAPTER III . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening of the 12th September I left Quebec by the train for Montreal , and travelled over the " North Shore " line of 200 miles . One of the secretaries of the Vice-President of the Canadian Pacific , Mr. Van Horn , called upon me to say that accommodation was reserved for me in the train ; and that Mr. Van Horn was sending down his own car , which would meet me half way . It was no use protesting against the non-necessity of such luxurious treatment . I was further asked , if I had " got transportion ? " which puzzled me . But I found , being interpreted , the question was modern American for " Have you got your through ticket ? " I replied , that I had paid my fare right through from Liverpool to Vancouver 's Island  --  as every mere traveller for his own pleasure ought to do ; and I was remonstrated with for so unkind a proceeding , as the fact of my having been President of the Grand Trunk was of itself a passport all over Canada . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by very good light  --  good lamp , excellent oil , very good trimming  --  there was some shunting of the train , and the usual " bang " of the attachment of a carriage . A moment afterwards Mr. Van Horn 's car steward entered , and asked if I was Sir Edward Watkin ; and he guessed I must come into Mr. Van Horn 's car , sent specially down for me . Where was my baggage ? I need not say that I was soon removed from the little , beautifully-fitted , drawing-room into this magnificent car . In passing through , I heard some growls , in French , about stopping the train , and sending a car for one " Anglais . " So , on being settled in the new premises , I sent my compliments , stating that I only required one seat , and that I was certain that the car was intended for the general convenience , and would they do me the favour to finish their journey in it ? I received very polite replies , stating that every one was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , came in to make my acquaintance , but left me soon . I now became acquainted with Mr. Van Horn 's car steward  --  James French , or , as his admirers call him , " Jim "  --  and I certainly wish to express my gratitude to him for his intelligence , thoughtfulness , admirable cookery , and general good nature . He took me , a few days later , right across to the Pacific in this same car , which certainly was a complete house on wheels  --  bedroom , " parlour , kitchen and all . " His first practical suggestion was , would I take a little of Mr. Van Horn 's " old Bourbon " whisky ? It was " very fine , first rate . " On my assenting , he asked would I take it " straight , " as Mr. Van Horn did , or would I have a little seltzer water ? I elected the latter , at the same time observing , that when I neared the Rocky Mountains perhaps I should have improved my ways so much that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Montreal , my old friend and aforetime collaborateur , Mr. Joseph Hickson , met me and took me home with him ; and in his house , under the kind and generous care of Mrs. Hickson , I spent three delightful days , and renewed acquaintance with many old friends of times long passed . It was on the 28th December , 1861 , that Mr. Hickson first went to Canada in the Cunard steamer " Canada " from Liverpool . He was accompanied by Mr. Watkin , our only son , a youth of 15 , anxious to see the bigger England . Mr. Watkin afterwards entered the service ( Grand Trunk ) , in the locomotive department , at Montreal , and deservedly gained the respect of his superior officer , who had to delegate to Mr. Watkin , then under 18 , the charge of a thousand men . There were , also , Howson , Wright , Wainwright , and Barker ; subsequently , Wallis . Mr. John Taylor , who acted as my private secretary in my previous visit , I had left behind , much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good afterwards . Mr. Barker is now the able manager of the Buenos Ayres Great Southern Railway , a most prosperous undertaking ; and poor dear , big , valiant , hard-working Wallis is , alas ! no more : struck down two years ago by fever . These old friends , still left in Canada , are leading honorable , useful , and successful lives , respected by the community . To see them again made it seem as if the world had stood still for a quarter of a century . Then , again , there was my old friend and once colleague , the Honble . James Ferrier , a young-minded and vigorous man of 86 : who , on my return to Montreal , walked down to the grand new offices of the Grand Trunk , near Point St. Charles  --  offices very much unlike the old wooden things I left behind , and which were burnt down  --  to see me and walked back again . Next day I had the advantage of visiting the extensive workshops and vast stock yards of the Canadian Pacific , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of renewing my acquaintance with the able solicitor of the Company , Mr. Abbot , and with the secretary , an old Manchester man , Mr. Drinkwater . Then on the following day Mr. Peterson , the engineer of this section of the Canadian Pacific Company , drove me out to Lachine , and took me by his boat , manned by the chief and a crew of Indians , to see the finished piers and also the coffer-dams and works of the new bridge over the St. Lawrence , by means of which his Company are to reach the Eastern Railways of the United States , without having to use the great Victoria Bridge at Montreal . This bridge , of 1,000 yards , or 3,000 feet , in length , is a remarkable structure . It was commenced in May and intended to be finished in November . But the foundations of the central pier , in deep and doubtful water , were not begun , though about to begin , and this , as it appeared to me , might delay the work somewhat . The work is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the adoption of the simplest and cheapest mode of doing what is wanted . All the traffic purposes required are here secured in a few months , and for about 200,000l. only . The " Victoria " bridge at Montreal is a very different structure . A long sheet-iron box , 9,184 feet in length , with 26 piers 60 feet above the water level , and costing from first to last 2,000,000l. sterling . The burning of coal had begun to affect it ; but Mr. Haunaford , the chief engineer of the Grand Trunk , has made some openings in the roof , which do not in any way reduce the strength of the bridge , and at the same time get rid of , at once into the air , the sulphurous vapours arising from coal combustion . Mr. Peterson told me that their soundings in winter showed that ice thickened and accumulated at the bottom of the river . This would seem , at first sight , impossible . But experiment , Mr. Peterson said , had proved the fact , which was accounted for by scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways . May it not be that the accumulation is ice from above , loaded with earth or stones , which , sinking to the bottom by gravity , coagulates from the low temperature it produces itself ? Mr. Peterson is not merely an engineer , and an excellent one , but an observant man of business . His views upon the all-important question of colonising the unoccupied lands of the Dominion seemed to be wise and far-sighted . He would add to the homestead grants of land , an advance to the settler  --  a start , in fact  --  of stock and material , to be repaid when final title to the property , were given . Taking leave of my old friends , I left Montreal at 8 p.m. on the night of September 15th , in the ordinary " Pacific Express , " on which was attached Mr. Van Horn 's car , in charge of James French . I went by ordinary train because I was anxious to have an experience of the actual train-working . Mr. Edward Wragge , C.E. , of Toronto , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has sent me so concise an account of the journey of this train , and of the general engineering features of the line , that , anticipating his kind permission , I venture to copy it :  --  " Leaving Montreal in Mr. Van Horn 's car , the ' Saskatchewan , ' by the 8 p.m. train on the 15th September , we passed Ottawa at 11.35 p.m . " During the night we ran over that portion of the Canadian Pacific Railway which was formerly called the Canada Central Railway , and reached Callander ( 344 miles from Montreal ) , the official eastern terminus of the Canadian Pacific Railway , at 8.30 a.m. 13 miles from this , at Thorncliff is the junction with the Northern and Pacific Junction Railway , which forms the connection with Toronto and Western Ontario , being distant from Toronto 227 miles . At North Bay , which is a divisional terminus , the line touches Lake Nipissing , where there is a flourishing settlement , the land being of a fair quality . The line is laid with steel rails , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with ties about 2,640 to the mile . For the first 60 or 70 miles from Callander the line is ballasted entirely by sand , and , with the exception of a few settlements , is entirely without fencing . Most of the bridges are of timber ; but there are one or two of the larger ones of iron or steel , with masonry abutments . " At Sudbury is the junction with the Algama Branch , not yet opened for traffic . This is 443 miles from Montreal . After leaving Sudbury the character of the country changes , and is alternately swampy and wild rocky land . Numerous large trestles are necessary , which will eventually be filled in with culverts and earthwork . The schedule running time of the trains along this portion of the line is 24 miles per hour , including stoppages . " At 8 p.m . Chapleau , another divisional terminus , was reached , and the schedule running time during the night from that point to Heron Bay , reached at 5.15 a.m. the following morning , is 20 miles an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the north shore of Lake Superior is first touched , and the line runs along it to Port Arthur , a distance of 993 miles from Montreal . The scenery here is very wild and picturesque . At one time the line runs along the face of the rock , with the lake from 50 to 100 feet below , the road-bed being benched out on the cliff , and at another time is away back among barren hills and rocks , crossing several large streams ( with either bridges of iron and masonry or timber trestle work ) , which streams flow into the lake at the north end of deep indentations or arms of the lake . The line through this district is winding , having many sharp curves and steep grades . There are several short tunnels , all of them through rock , and not lined . The schedule time for trains on this portion of the line is 16 miles per hour . We were detained some little time near Jack Fish , owing to a slight land slide coming down in one of the cuttings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level with a steel trussed bridge , masonry piers and abutments , and there is an old Hudson 's Bay settlement on the river a short distance above the bridge . Between Nepigon and Port Arthur the line runs through a country much more accessible for railways , and the schedule time here is at the rate of 24 miles an hour . We reached Port Arthur at 4 p.m. on the 17th . This is a flourishing town , situated at the head of Thunder Bay , a large bay on the north shore of Lake Superior , and has a population of four or five thousand at the present time . From the north shore of Lake Nipissing to this point , however , a distance of over 600 miles , the country may be said to be almost without inhabitants , except those connected with the working of the railway , squatters , and Hudson 's Bay trappers and traders . The weather was chilly during the evening of this day , and a heavy sleet storm arose before arriving at Port Arthur . At night a fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a sharp frost . During the night the train was detained for some little time east of Rat Portage , in consequence of a trestle having given way while being pulled in , and the train arrived at Rat Portage at 7.30 a.m. , four hours , behind time . " From Port Arthur the line westward is run upon the 24 o'clock system , commencing from midnight ; 1 p.m. being 13 o'clock , 2 p.m. being 14 o'clock , and so on . The train arrived at Winnipeg at 12.45 on the 18th ( 1,423 miles from Montreal ) , and time was allowed to drive round the town , the train leaving again for the west at 13.30 o'clock . From Winnipeg westward the line runs through a prairie country , which extends without intermission to Calgary , a distance of 838 miles , and 2,261 from Montreal . At Winnipeg the Company have good machine shops , round houses , &c.,; and a large yard , and has acquired 132 acres of land for these purposes of working and repair and renewal . " The country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more or less settled ; in some parts farms are quite numerous , and the land good and well cultivated . At Portage la Prairie the Manitoba and North-Western Line leaves the Canadian Pacific . It is being rapidly pushed forward , and 120 miles of it have already been completed through the ' Fertile belt . ' It should have been mentioned that the line between Port Arthur and Winnipeg , a length of 430 miles , was constructed by the Government of Canada and given to the Canadian Pacific Railway Company free as a portion of their system . This part of the line is laid with 57 lbs . steel rails , and is well ballasted . The line is also ballasted east of Port Arthur , though in some places the ballast is of poor quality , and in others there is not sufficient of it . West of Winnipeg , however , there is no ballast across the prairie , except where the excavations through which the line goes afford ballast , it being simply surfaced up from side ditches with whatever the material may happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a line of such a character , and the schedule time is 24 miles an hour , including stoppages . " The train ran through Qu'Appelle , Regina , and Moose Jaw during the night of the 18th , and reached Dunmore ( 650 miles from Winnipeg ) at 15.30 o'clock on the 19th . At this point there is a branch , 3-feet gauge line , 110 miles in length , to the Lethbridge mines , belonging to Sir Alexander Galt &; Company . His son , Mr. Galt , met us at Dunmore , and invited us to go and inspect the mines , but as it would have made a delay of at least one day , the idea had regretfully to be abandoned . The train reached Bassano ( 750 miles from Winnipeg ) at 19 o'clock , our time , having made up 3 hours and 20 minutes since leaving Winnipeg , which was the time late leaving there . The train was then exactly 97 hours since leaving Montreal , having travelled 2,180 miles , an average speed , including all stoppages and delays , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 19th and the early morning of the 20th , the train ran through Calgary , at the foothills of the Atlantic slope of the Rocky Mountains ; and at 5.30 on the 20th arrived at the summit of the Rocky Mountains . As it was just daylight we were enabled to see the scenery at that point and Kicking Horse Pass . From the summit of the Rocky Mountains , for some nine miles , the line is considered to be merely a temporary one , though permanently and strongly constructed , there being a grade for two or three miles of it of 4-1/2 feet per hundred , say 1 in 22-1/2 . There are several catch sidings on this grade , running upwards on the slopes of the mountains , for trains or cars to be turned into , in the event of a break loose or run away , and a man is always in attendance at the switches leading to these sidings . All this day the train ran through mountains , the Rocky Mountains , the Selkirk Range , and Eagle Pass . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones are 116 feet to the mile , and there are numerous sharp curves , usually to save short tunnels . The line , however , is in some parts well ballasted , and work is still going on in this direction . The rails are of steel , 70 lbs . to the yard , and the locomotives , of the " Consolidation " pattern , with eight driving wheels , are able , Mr. Marpole , the able divisional superintendent , stated , to take a train of 12 loaded cars over the ruling grades , two of them being required for the same load on the steep grade already mentioned at Kicking Horse Pass . Mr. Marpole stopped the train at the Stony Creek Bridge , a large timber structure 296 feet high , and said to be the highest wooden bridge in America . The scenery through the Selkirks is magnificent , the mountain peaks being six and seven thousand feet above the level of the railway , many of them even at this season of the year covered with snow , and there being several large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was opened for traffic , observations were taken with the view of ascertaining what trouble might be anticipated from avalanches , the avalanch paths through the Selkirks being very numerous . Several large avalanches occurred , the largest covering the track for a length of 1,300 feet , with a depth in one place of 50 feet of snow , and containing , as was estimated , a quarter of a million cubic yards of snow and earth . The result of these observations caused the Company to construct during this season four-and-a-half miles of snow sheds , at a cost of $900,000 , or $200,000 a mile . " The sheds are constructed as follows :  --  On the high side of the mountain slope a timber crib filled with stones is constructed . Along the entire length of the shed , and on the opposite side of the track , a timber trestle is erected , strong timber beams are laid from the top of the cribwork to the top of the trestle , 4 feet apart and at an angle representing the slope of the mountain , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planking , and the beams are strutted on either side from the trestle and from the crib . The covering is placed at such a height as to give 21 feet headway from the under side of the beam to the centre of the track . The longest of these sheds is 3,700 feet , and is near the Glacier Hotel . " Over the Selkirk Range the schedule time for trains from Donald to Revelstoke , that is , from the first to the second crossing of the Columbia River , a distance of 79 miles , is only eleven miles an hour ; but this time table was made before there was much ballast on this portion of the line , and better time can now be made . On the 21st September the Fraser River was crossed early in the morning over a steel cantilever bridge , and the line runs down the gorge of the Fraser River to Port Moody , reached at noon . The train had thus been travelling from 8 p.m. on the 15th September to 12 noon on the 21st , apparently a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain of three hours in time , an actual total of 139 hours . During this time the train travelled 2,892 miles , or an average speed made throughout the journey , including all stoppages , of 20-1/2 miles per hour , and this is the regular schedule time for passenger trains at the present time . " Port Moody is the present terminus of the Canadian Pacific Railway , but the line has been partially graded for 12 miles further to Vancouver . Owing , however , to the hostile attitude of some landowners , the Company have not been able to complete this work , as the contention has been made that , although the Company have power to build branches , an extension of the main line is not a branch , and the Company will have to obtain legislation before this can be done . Vancouver at the present time is said to have a population of about 3,000 . It is situated at Burrard Inlet , a mile or so inside what are called the First Narrows , but the neck of land on which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the future , when the town grows , English Bay , which is outside the Narrows , can easily be made the harbour in preference to the present one , as it is fairly well sheltered , and affords good anchorage . " The trip down Burrard Inlet , the Straits of Georgia , and through the San Juan Archipelago to Victoria , a distance of about 90 miles from Port Moody , occupied 9-1/2 hours , and Victoria was reached at 10.30 on the night of the 21st September . " To this memorandum I may add a few words . First , in praise of the excellent rolling stock ; secondly , of the good discipline and smartness of the service ; and , thirdly , of the wonderful energy , boldness , and success of the whole engineering features of this grand work of modern times . I should be ungrateful if I did not thank the chief officers of the Canadian Pacific , whose acquaintance I had great pleasure in making , for their exceeding kindness , for the full information they afforded to me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready plans of construction , which might well be adopted in Europe . These gentlemen have looked at difficulties merely in respect to the most summary way of surmounting them ; and , certainly , the great and bold works around the head of Lake Superior , the many river and ravine crossings of unusual span and height , and , especially , the works of the 600 miles of mountain country between Calgary and the last summit of British Columbia , so successfully traversed , would make the reputation of a dozen Great George Streets . CHAPTER IV . Canadian Pacific Railways . The pioneer suggestion of a railway across British territory to the Pacific has been claimed by many . To my mind , all valuable credit attaches to those who have completed the work . The christening of " La Chine "  --  the town seven miles from Montreal , where the canals which go round the rapids end , and the St. Lawrence and the Ottawa rivers join their differently coloured streams  --  contained the prophecy of a future great high road to the then mysterious East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is to the Sieur de la Salle , who , 200 years ago , bought lands above the rapids from the Sulpician Fathers of Montreal , and began his many attempts to reach the lands of the " setting sun , " that we owe the name ; while the resolution of Sir Charles Tupper , carried in the Dominion Parliament , finally embodied in an Act which received the Royal assent on the 17th February , 1881 , and was opposed throughout by the " Grit " party , was really the practical start . It would be inadequate to write of the Great Canadian Pacific Railway without some reference to the history of railways in Canada itself . In the interesting book , " Rambles on Railways , " published in 1868 , it is remarked that great as has been the progress of Canada , in no respect has the growth of the country shown itself in a more marked manner than in the development of its railway system . It was in 1848 , or almost immediately after the completion of the magnificent canal system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tons could pass from the ocean to Lake Ontario , and vice versa ( ships now pass from Chicago to Liverpool of over 1,500 tons burthen ) , that the Canadians discovered it was necessary , notwithstanding their unrivalled inland navigation , to combine with it an equally good railway communication ; and accordingly , in 1849 , an Act was passed by the Canadian Government pledging a six per cent . guarantee on one-half the cost of all railways made under its provisions . In 1852 , however , the Government , fearing the effect of an indiscriminate guarantee , repealed the law of 1849 , and passed an Act guaranteeing one-half of the cost of one main Trunk line of railway throughout the Province , and it was under this Act that the Grand Trunk Railway was projected . These terms were subsequently modified , by granting a fixed sum of 3,000l. per mile of railway forming part of the main Trunk line . It is true that prior to these dates railways existed in Canada . There was , for example , the horse railway from La Prairie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Richelieu River , opened in July , 1836 , and first worked with locomotives in 1837 ; there was also a horse railway between Queenstown and Chippewa , passing Niagara , opened in 1839 , and over which I travelled in 1851 ; but with these exceptions , and the Lachine Railway , a line running from Montreal for seven miles to the westward , the railway system of Canada can not be said to have commenced until after the passing of the Railway Act in 1849 , and even then , it was not for about a year that any progress was made . Soon after that date , however , the works of several lines were pushed forward , and in 1854 the section between Montreal and Quebec was opened , the first train having carried Lord Elgin , who was then en route to England to confer with the home authorities respecting the future Reciprocity Treaty with the United States Government . So , whilst in 1852 , Canada could only boast of about 30 miles of railway , she has now over 10,000 miles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that this mileage gives something over two miles of railway for every thousand inhabitants , a greater railway mileage system per head of population than , perhaps , is possessed by any other country in the world . The old Grand Trunk proprietors feel that their early pioneer services to Canada , and their heavy sacrifices , have rather been ignored in competition , than recognized , by the Canadian Pacific not being an extension of the Grand Trunk system . Had I remained in office as President of the Grand Trunk , undoubtedly I should have laboured hard to bring about such a consummation , which undoubtedly would have economised capital and hastened the completion of the great Inter-oceanic work . But the London agents of Canada , who were , and are , responsible for launching the Grand Trunk and for its many issues of capital to British shareholders , have undoubtedly aided the competition and rivalry complained of ; for in July , 1885 , they floated  --  when other great financial houses were unable  --  3,000,000l. sterling , not for the Pacific line itself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system of a directly competitive character with the Grand Trunk , and which could never have been finished but for this British money , so raised . While I do not enter into the controversy , it still seems to me that blame lies nearer home than in Canada , if blame be deserved at all . Great financiers seem sometimes ready to devour their own industrial children . The Canadian Pacific Railway from Quebec to Port Moody is a mixture of the new and the old . The first section , from Quebec to Montreal , is an old friend , the North Shore Railway , once possessed by the Grand Trunk Company , and sold back to the Canadian Government for purposes of extending the Pacific route to tide-water at Quebec , and making one , throughout , management . From Montreal to Ottawa , and beyond , is another section of older-made line . The piece from Port Arthur to Winnipeg is an older railway , made by the Canadian Government . Again , on the Pacific there is the British Columbia Government Railway . All the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arthur , from Winnipeg across the Great Prairies to Calgary , and on to , and across , the Rocky Mountains , the crossings of the Selkirk and other Columbian Ranges , is new Railway  --  with works daring and wonderful . Pioneer railways are not like works at home . The lines are single , with crossing places every five , ten , or twenty miles ; ballast is not always used , the lines on prairies being laid for long stretches on the earth formation ; rivers , chasms , canons and cataracts are crossed by timber trestle bridges . The rails , of steel , are flat bottomed , fastened by spikes , 60 lbs . to the yard , except through the mountains , where they are 70 lbs . Begun as pioneer works , they undergo , as traffic progresses , many improvements . Ballast is laid down . Iron or steel bridges are substituted for timber . The gorges spanned by trestles are , one by one , filled up , by the use of the steam digger to fill , and the ballast plough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wagons on each side and through the interstices of , the trestles . Sometimes the timber is left in ; sometimes it is drawn out and used elsewhere . This trestle bridge plan of expediting the completion , and cheapening the construction , of new railways , wants more study , at home . Whenever there are gorges and valleys to pass in a timbered country , the facility they give of getting " through " is enormous . The Canadian Pacific would not be open now , but for this facility . All these lines across the Continent have very similar features . They each have prairies to pass , with long straight lines and horizons which seem ever vanishing and never reached ; mountain ranges of vast altitudes to cross , alkaline lands , hitherto uncultivable , hot sulphur springs , prairie-dogs , gophyrs , and other animals not usually seen . The buffalo has retired from the neighbourhood of these iron-roads and of the " fire-wagons , " as the Indians call the locomotives . Here and there on all the prairies on all the lines , heaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stag , are piled up at stations , to be taken away for agricultural purposes . The railways resemble each other in their ambitious extensions . The Canadian Pacific Railway , from Quebec to Port Moody , is above 3,000 miles in length , but the total mileage of the Company is already 4,600 miles , and no one knows where it is to stop , while Messrs . Baring and Glyn will , and can , raise money from English people ; the Union Pacific possesses 4,500 miles in the United States ; the Southern Pacific nearly 5,000 ; and the newest of the three , the Northern Pacific , has about 3,000 miles , and is " marching on " to a junction with Grand Trunk extensions at the southern end of Lake Superior , in order to complete a second Atlantic and Pacific route , through favoured Canada . Each of these great lines has found the necessity of supplementing the through , with as much local traffic , as it can command . Some of this is new , such as the coal traffic from Sir Alexander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 110 miles , running out of the Canadian Pacific at Dunmore , and the mineral traffic in the territory of Wyoming on the Union Pacific . But , again , some of it is the result of competition . Let us hope that the development of both Canada and the United States may quickly give trade enough for all . It seems to me , however , that the Ocean to Ocean traffic , alone , can not , at present at least , find a good return for so many railways . Canada has been unusually generous to the promoters of the Canadian Pacific Railway . A free gift of five millions sterling : a free gift of 713 miles of , completed , railway : a free gift of twenty-five millions of acres of land : all materials admitted free of duty : the lands given to be free of taxation for twenty years : the Company 's , property to be free of taxation : the Company to have absolute control in fixing its rates and charges until it should pay 10 per cent . dividend on its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be sanctioned ;  --  summarize the liberality of the Dominion of Canada , in her efforts to bind together her Ocean coasts . The work is essentially an Imperial work . What is the duty of the Empire ? CHAPTER V. A British Railway from the Atlantic to the Pacific . ( " ILLUSTRATED LONDON NEWS , " 1861 . ) My letter of the 15th November , 1860 , to a friend of Mr. Thomas Baring , then President of the Grand Trunk Railway of Canada , gives concisely my general notions of opening up the British portion of the Great Continent of America . A while later a leading article written by me appeared in the " Illustrated London News " of the 16th February , 1861 . The article was headed , " A British Railway from the Atlantic to the Pacific . " I will here quote a portion of it :  --  " ' I hope , ' said her Majesty , on proroguing Parliament in 1858 , ' that the new Colony on the Pacific ( British Columbia ) may be but one step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in North America may be ultimately peopled in an unbroken chain , from the Atlantic to the Pacific , by a loyal and industrious population . ' The aspiration , so strikingly expressed , found a fervent echo in the national heart , and it continues to engage the earnest attention of England ; for it speaks of a great outspread of solid prosperity and of rational liberty , of the diffusion of our civilization , and of the extension of our moral empire . " Since the Royal Speech , Governments have done something , and events have done more , to ripen public opinion into action . The Governments at home and in Canada have organized and explored . The more perfect discoveries of our new gold fields on the Pacific , the Indian Mutiny , the completion of great works in Canada , the treaties with Japan and with China , the visit of the Prince of Wales to the American Continent , and , at the moment , the sad dissensions in the United States , combine to interest us in the question , and to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized ; not a century hence , but in our time ? ' " Our augmenting interests in the East , demand , for reasons both of Empire and of trade , access to Asia less dangerous than by Cape Horn , less circuitous even than by Panama , less dependent than by Suez and the Red Sea . Our emigration , imperilled by the dissensions of the United States , must fall back upon colonization . And , commercially , the countries of the East must supply the raw materials and provide the markets , which probable contests between the free man and the slave may diminish , or may close , elsewhere . Again , a great nation like ours can not stand still . It must either march on triumphantly in the van , or fall hopelessly into the rear . The measure of its accomplishment must , century by century , rise higher and higher in the competition of nations . Its great works in this generation can alone perpetuate its greatness in the next . " Let us look at the map : there we see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washed by the great Atlantic on the East , and by the Pacific Ocean on the West , and containing 4,000,000 square miles , or one-ninth of the whole terrestrial surface of the globe . Part of this vast domain , upon the East , is Upper and Lower Canada ; part , upon the West , is the new Colony of British Columbia , with Vancouver 's Island ( the Madeira of the Pacific ) ; while the largest portion is held , as one great preserve , by the fur-trading Hudson 's Bay Company , who , in right of a charter given by Charles II. , in 1670 , kill vermin for skins , and monopolise the trade with the Native Indians over a surface many times as big again as Great Britain and Ireland . Still , all this land is ours , for it owes allegiance to the sceptre of Victoria . Between the magnificent harbour of Halifax , on the Atlantic , open throughout the year for ships of the largest class , to the Straits of Fuca , opposite Vancouver 's Island , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road line . For 1,400 or 1,500 miles of this distance , the Nova Scotian , the Habitan , and the Upper Canadian have spread , more or less in lines and patches over the ground , until the population of 60,000 of 1759 amounts to 2,500,000 in 1860 . The remainder is peopled only by the Indian and the hunter , save that at the southern end of Lake Winnipeg there still exists the hardy and struggling Red River Settlement , now called ' Fort Garry : ' and dotted all over the Continent , as lights of progress , are trading posts of the Hudson 's Bay Company . " The combination of recent discoveries places it at least beyond all doubt that the best , though , perhaps , not the only , thoroughly efficient route for a great highway for peoples and for commerce , between the Atlantic and the Pacific , is to be found through this British territory . Beyond that , it is alleged that while few , if any , practicable passes for a wagon-road , still less for a railway , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' territory , north-west of the Missouri , there have been discovered already no less than three eligible openings in the British ranges of these mountains , once considered as inaccessible to man . While Captain Palliser prefers the ' Kananaskakis , ' Captain Blakiston and Governor Douglas , the ' Kootanie , ' and Dr. Hector the ' Vermilion ' Pass , all agree that each is perfectly practicable , if not easy , and that even better openings may probably yet be found as exploration progresses . Again , while British Columbia , on the Pacific , possesses a fine climate , an open country , and every natural advantage of soil and mineral , it has been also discovered that the doubtful region from the Rocky Mountains eastward up to the Lake of the Woods , contains , with here and there some exceptions , a ' continuous belt ' of the finest land . " Professor Hind says :  --  " ' It is a physical reality of the highest importance to the interests of British North America that this continuous belt can be settled and cultivated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woods , to the passes of the Rocky Mountains ; and any line of communication , whether by wagon , road , or railroad , passing through it , will eventually enjoy the great advantage of being fed by an agricultural population from one extremity to the other . ' " Although the lakes and the St. Lawrence give an unbroken navigation of 2,000 miles , right to the sea , for ships of 300 tons burden , yet if there is to be a continuous line , along which , and all the year round , the travel and the traffic of the Western and Eastern worlds can pass without interruption , railway communication with Halifax must be perfected , and a new line of iron road , passing through Ottawa , the Red River Settlement , and this ' continuous belt , ' must be constructed . This new line is a work of above 2,300 miles , and would cost probably 20,000,000l. , if not 25,000,000l. , sterling . " The sum , though so large , is still little more than we voluntarily paid to extinguish slavery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceed the amount which a Royal Commission , some little time ago , proposed to expend in erecting fortifications and sea-works to defend our shores . It is but six per cent , of the amount we have laid out on completing our own railway system in this little country at home . It is equal to but two and a-half per cent . of our National Debt , and the annual interest upon it is much less than the British Pension List . " We say , then , ' Establish an unbroken line of road and railway from the Atlantic to the Pacific through British territory . ' " Such a great highway would give shorter distances by both sea and land , with an immense saving of time . " As regards the great bugbear of the general traveller  --  sea distance  - -  it would , to and from Liverpool , save , as compared with the Panama route , a tossing , wearying navigation of 6,000 miles to Japan , of 5,000 miles to Canton , and of 3,000 miles to Sydney . For Japan , for China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such a route must become the great highway to and from Europe ; and whatever nation possesses that highway , must wield of necessity the commercial sceptre of the world . " In the United States , the project of a Railway to the Pacific to cross the Rocky Mountains has ebbed and flowed in public opinion , and has been made the battle-cry of parties for years past , but nothing has yet been done . Such a project , in order to answer its purpose , requires something more than a practicable surface , or convenient mountain passes . Fine harbours on both Oceans , facilities for colonization on the route , and the authority of one single Power over the whole of the wild regions traversed , are all essential to success . As regards the United States , these conditions are wanting . While there are harbours enough on the Atlantic , though none equal to Halifax , there is no available harbour at all fit for the great Pacific trade , from Acapulco to our harbour of Esquimault , on Vancouver 's Island , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and is , in many states of the wind , unsafe and inconvenient . The country north-west of the Missouri is found to be sterile , and at least one-third of the whole United States territory , and situated in this region , is now known as the ' Great American Desert . ' Again , the conflicting interests of separate and sovereign States present an almost insuperable bar to agreement as to route , or as to future ' operations ' or control . It is true that Mr. Seward , possibly as the exponent of the policy of the new President , promises to support two Pacific Railways  --  one for the South , another for the North . But these promises are little better than political baits , and were they carried out into Acts of Congress , financial disturbance would delay , if not prevent , their final realization ; and , even if realized , they would not serve the great wants of the East and the West , still less would they satisfy England and Europe . We , therefore , can not look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands of the United States . " Such a work , however , is too costly and too difficult for the grasp of unaided private enterprise . To accomplish it out of hand , the whole help of both the Local and Imperial Parliaments must be given . That help once offered , by guarantee or by grant , private enterprise would flock to the undertaking , and people would go to colonise on the broad tracts laid open to their industry . " My subsequent and semi-official inquiries induced me to modify many of the conclusions of the article quoted above . On the essential question of the pass in the Rocky Mountains , in British territory , most adapted by Nature for the passage of a road or a railway , all the evidence which I collected tended to show that the passage by the " Tete-jaune Cache , " or " Yellow-head , " Pass , was the best . The Canadian Pacific Company have adopted the " Kicking Horse " Pass , much to the southward of the " Yellow-head " Pass . Again , it became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather a series of high mountain peaks , standing on the summit of gradual slopes , rising almost imperceptibly from the plains and prairies on the eastern side , and dropping suddenly , in most cases , towards the sea-level on the western or Pacific side , than a great wall barring the country for hundreds of miles , as some had dreamed . Every inquiry from trappers , traders , Indian voyageurs , missionary priests of the Jesuits , and from all sorts and conditions of men and women , made difficulty after difficulty disappear . The great work began to appear to me comparatively easy of execution between Fort Garry , or the lower town of Selkirk and British Columbia ; the cost less ; and , owing to facilities of transport , especially in winter , the time of execution much shorter than had been previously assumed . In addition , an examination into the physical conditions of the various routes proposed through the United States , convinced me that here again the difficulties were less , and facilities for construction greater , than I and others had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conclusion that the more southerly the United States route , and the more northerly the British route  --  while always , in the latter case , keeping within cultivable range  --  the better . Still , at this time there was much to find out . As respects real knowledge of the country to be traversed , the factors of the Hudson 's Bay Company knew every fact worth divulging , but they were afraid to speak ; while the Catholic missionaries , accustomed to travel on foot in their sacred cause over the most distant regions , possessed a mine of personal knowledge , never , so far as I could learn , closed to the Government of Canada or to any authorized inquirer . Prior to my sailing to New York , en route for Canada , to fulfil my mission for the Grand Trunk , in 1861 , I had a long interview with the Duke of Newcastle , as Colonial Minister . He had seen , and we had often previously discussed , the questions raised in the article above quoted , and which he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July , 1861 . Every point connected with the British Provinces in America , as affected by the then declared warlike separation of the northern and southern portions of the United States , was carefully discussed . The Duke had the case at his fingers ends . His visit to America with the Prince of Wales , already alluded to more than once , had rendered him familiar with the Northern Continent , and its many interests , in a way which a personal study on the spot can alone bring about ; and he declared his conviction that the impression made upon the mind of the Prince was so deep and grateful , that in anything great and out of the ordinary rut of our rule at home , he would always find an earnest advocate and helper in the Prince , to whom he said he " felt endeared with the affection of a father to a son . " I called the Duke 's special attention to the position and attitude of the Hudson 's Bay authorities . How they were always crying down their territory as unfit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to open up the land by roads , and use steamers on such grand rivers as , for instance , the Assiniboin and the Saskatchewan . He said Sir Frederick Rogers , the chief permanent official at the Colonial Office , whose wife 's settlement was in Hudson 's Bay shares , and who , in consequence , was expected to be well informed , had expressed to him grave doubts of the vast territory in question being ever settled , unless in small spots here and there . The Duke fully recognized , however , the difficulty I had put my finger upon . I never spent an hour with a man who more impressed me with his full knowledge of a great imperial question , and his earnest determination to carry it out successfully and speedily . The Intercolonial Railway , to connect Halifax on the Atlantic with the Grand Trunk Railway at Riviere du Loup , 106 miles below Quebec , he described as " the preliminary necessity . " The completion of an iron-road , onwards to the Pacific , was , " to his mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provinces and territories into " one great British America , " was the necessary , the logical , result of completing the Intercolonial Railway and laying broad foundations for the completion , as a condition of such union , of a railway to the Pacific . He authorized me to say ; in Canada , that the Colonial Office would pay part of the cost of surveys ; that these works must be carried out in the greatest interests of the nation , and that he would give his cordial help . This he did throughout . In bidding me good-bye , and with the greatest kindness of manner , he added : " Well , my dear Watkin , go out and inquire . Master these questions , and , as soon as you return , come to me , and impart to me the information you have gained for me . " Just as I was leaving , he added , " By the way , I have heard that the State of Maine wants to be annexed to our territory . " I made no reply , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still , with civil war just commencing , who could tell ? " Sir , " said old Gordon Bennett to me one day , while walking in his garden , beyond New York , " here everything is new , and nothing is settled . " Failing health , brought on by grievous troubles , compelled the Duke to retire from office in the course of 1864 , and on the 18th of October of that year he died ; on the 18th October , 1865 , he was followed by his friend , staunch and true , Lord Palmerston , who left his work and the world , with equal suddenness , on that day . But from that 17th July , 1861 , I regarded myself as the Duke 's unofficial , unpaid , never-tiring agent in these great enterprises , and , undoubtedly , in these three years , ending by his retirement and death , the seeds were sown . CHAPTER VI . Port Moody  --  Victoria  --  San Francisco to Chicago . At " Port Moody , " and even at the new " Vancouver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of crossing amongst the islands to the north-east of Vancouver 's Island , traversing that island , and making the Grand Pacific terminus at the fine harbour of Esquimalt , had not been realized . Halifax to Esquimalt was our old , well-worn plan . The " Tete Jaune " was our favoured pass . This plan , I believe , met the views both of Sir James Douglas and the Honorable Mr. Trutch . But I consoled myself with the reflection , that if we had not gained the best , we had secured the next best , grand scheme  --  a scheme which , as time goes on , will be extended and improved , as the original Pacific Railways of the United States have been . The sea service between " Port Moody " and " Victoria , " Vancouver 's Island , is well performed ; and Victoria itself is an English town , with better paved streets , better electric lighting , and better in many other ways that might be named , than many bigger American and English towns I know of . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an experimental trip , through the kindness of Mr. Dunsmuir  --  the proprietor of the Wellington Collieries , a few miles north of Nanaimo  --  over the new railway from Victoria to Nanaimo , constructed , with Government aid , by himself and Mr. Crocker , of San Francisco . I had the pleasure of making the acquaintance of Sir Mathew Begbie , the Chief Justice of British Columbia , to whose undaunted courage Vancouver 's Island and British Columbia owed law and order in the dangerous and difficult times of the gold discoveries . Upon the question of relative distances , engineering , and generally what I saw between Port Moody and Chicago , I again take advantage of Mr. Edward Wragge 's excellent notes .

" The Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway runs from West Victoria , near Esquimalt , to Nanaimo , which latter place is a small mining town in the Island of Vancouver , lying on the east coast , on the shore of the Straits of Georgia , nearly opposite Burrard Inlet , from which it is distant about 28 miles . " The line is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rails , weighing 54 lbs . per yard ( except a few miles near Nanaimo , where they are 50 lbs . per yard ) ; well ballasted , and well tied ; the bridges and trestles are all of timber , of which material there is about 1,000,000 cubic feet employed altogether . The steepest grade is 80 feet per mile rising towards Nanaimo , and 79 feet per mile rising towards Esquimalt ; these grades are rendered necessary to enable the line to overcome the summit lying between the two places , and which is 900 feet above the level of the sea . Running , as the line does , through a rugged country , there are a good many sharp curves rendered necessary . The distance from Esquimalt to Victoria is 75 miles . The line was not quite completed when we went over it ; and the buildings , turn-tables , &c.; were not yet erected , although some of them were under construction . " The traffic on the line will be light , the country being sparsely settled . It will consist to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the carriage of this article of merchandize ; and the station at Victoria is too far from the town at present for much of it to come by rail for consumption in the town . There is a wharf in the harbour of Esquimalt , at which coal can be delivered to men-of-war lying there . Mr. Dunsmuir , of Victoria , is the chief proprietor of the railway , and he has associated with him Mr. Cracker , President of the Southern Pacific Railway , and others . " The Government of Canada gave a bonus of $750,000 ( say 150,000l. ) in aid of the construction of the railway , and a belt of land , with the minerals under it , of 10 miles in width on each side of the line . " During the afternoon of the 23rd of September we visited the West Wellington Coal Mines , 4 or 5 miles beyond Nanaimo , and to which the railway is to be extended , work on the extension having just been commenced . The mines are owned by Messrs . Dunsmuir &; Sons , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the output for the month of August being 17,000 tons . We went down the shaft of No. 5 pit , which was 240 feet deep , and found the seam was very thick , from 10 to 11 feet , but not very solid block coal , having apparently been crushed . The mines are all connected with wharves on the coast at Departure Bay by a three-feet gauge railway ; the lines around the mines were all in fair order . The line is worked by small locomotives , six wheels coupled and no truck , of the Baldwin Locomotive Company 's manufacture , the load handled by them being 15 cars , each containing 3-1/2 tons of coal , and averaging in dead weight 1-3/4 tons each . The grade down to the port is very steep , and the heaviest work for the engines is in taking the empties back again . " The coal is mined by white miners , who employ each of them a Chinese labourer ; they employ gunpowder for blasting purposes , chiefly Curtis &; Harvey 's make , and use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all tools except their auger drills , which they all use , and which cost some $30 each . Each miner has an allowance of one ton of coal per month for his own use . There was a little drip at the foot of the shaft we went down , but otherwise the mine was quite dry . The mode of unloading the cars at the wharf was rather primitive , but at the same time simple and ingenious . When the car has been weighed it is run forward by five Chinamen to the end of the wharf , the front end of the car being hinged at the top , with a catch opened by a lever , a short piece of track sufficiently long for the car to stand upon is built projecting beyond the wharf and over the hold of the vessel , this piece of track is laid on a framework , which is hinged to the wharf in front so as to tip up from behind , to it is attached a long wooden pole as a lever , round the end of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a belaying pin ; as soon as the car is on the tipping track , the lever on the front end of the car is knocked up so as to allow the coal to fall out , and the end of the long wooden pole is allowed to rise slowly by the rope being loosened , the coal then shoots out of the car . When empty the Chinamen weigh down on the pole and bring the track , with the car on it , back to its former position , making the rope fast to the belaying pin , and the car is run back to make way for another . We were told that in this way five Chinese have put 1,000 tons of coal on board a vessel in a working day . " On the following morning we visited the mine at Nanaimo , of the Vancouver Coal Company , and Mr. S. Robins , the superintendent , showed us over his works , and accompanied us down the shaft into the mine . The shaft is 600 feet deep , and the heading and workings are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yards . The coal is hard and of good quality , making a good gas coal ( which the West Wellington coal does not do ) . There have been one or two faults met with lately in the seam , which is 7 feet thick ; but Mr. Robins thinks they have been overcome . There is only one shaft working , and the output in the 24 hours of the day previous had been 434 tons . The coal comes to the surface in two ' boxes ' at a time , each containing about 35 cwt . This Company has good railway tracks of 4 feet 8-1/2 inches gauge , with English locomotives , &c.; The machinery and appliances at this mine were all better and more costly than at the West Wellington mines , and the cars were hopper bottomed , and discharged their contents directly into the hold of the vessels by simply opening the hopper bottom . The staff of men employed at the present time amounts to 350 , and the miners are white men , with Chinese labourers . The work at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ESQUIMALT HARBOUR AND DOCK . " The harbour at Esquimalt is quite land-locked , and can be very easily protected from an enemy approaching by sea , the heights around being easily fortified , as there are many in good positions for commanding the entrance , both at a distance from it , and also in the immediate vicinity ; there is plenty of depth of water at low tide to enter the harbour . A fort on the Race Rocks , where there is a lighthouse , and which are some 2 miles or so from the coast , would , if supplied with heavy guns capable of long range , command the whole of the San Juan de Fuca Straits , the distance from Race Rock to the American shore not exceeding 8 miles . " The harbour contains an area of about 400 or 500 acres , in which there is sufficient depth of water for large vessels to lie at all states of the tide . " The line of railway from Nanaimo to Esquimalt touches the harbour , and has a wharf at which coal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any time . " The graving dock , which has been some eleven years in progress , or rather which was commenced eleven years ago , but which practically has been constructed within the past two years , has a length of 430 feet on the ways , and could easily have been made , in the first instance , 600 feet in length for a comparatively small additional cost . The cost will have been , when completed , about $700,000 , and it is now waiting only for the entrance caisson , which is being made at the Dominion Bridge Company 's Works , near Montreal . " The masonry of the dock is of a hard sandstone , the character of the workmanship being very good , and the dock very dry and free from leakage ; it has been constructed , so as to save excavation , in a small creek , but this has caused an additional thickness for the walls , and a considerable quantity of filling behind them . It would appear that it could have been built for very much less money had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the harbour , where the rock would only have required facing with masonry instead of the work having been done as it has . " The naval-yard is a fair size ; the workshop is small , however , and apparently little or no materials for the repair of vessels are kept on hand . It will be a necessity for this to be remedied if the graving dock is to be of any use for ships of the navy . We saw two torpedo boats , and some Whitehead torpedoes , the boats were built in Great Britain for Chili , and purchased from the Chilians two years ago . " SAN FRANCISCO TO CHICAGO . " Left San Francisco on 29th September , 1886 , at 7.30 , by steam ferry to Oakland , 4 miles across the harbour ; left Oakland by train at 8.10 a.m. ; 32 miles from Oakland we reached Port Costa , where the train was ferried across an estuary of the sea to Benicia ; for 20 miles from there the line ( the Central Pacific division of the Southern Pacific Railway Company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then into a cultivated country with the western foothills of the Sierra Nevada rising around it , the country being very dry and parched , having had no rain since March : the farm-houses have the Eucalyptus , or Australian blue gum , planted around them ; and about 75 miles from San Francisco we entered the vineyard country , which continues to and past Sacramento . Reached Sacramento , which is 90 miles from San Francisco , and only 30 feet above the level of the sea , at 12 o'clock ; the schedule time from Oakland , including the ferry at Port Costa , being 25 miles an hour . At Sacramento we crossed the Sacramento and American Rivers , the former by a Howe truss bridge , one of the spans being a swing-bridge , and having a total length of 700 or 800 feet ; the latter by a Howe truss bridge , and fully a mile of trestle work . " From Sacramento the line begins to rise so as to cross the Sierra Nevada Range ; the country is rolling , and with the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presents quite a park-like appearance . The grades as we ascend are very steep , 116 feet to the mile , this line being well ballasted . In the valleys the line was laid originally with steel rails of 50 lbs . weight , and 3,080 ties to the mile , in the mountains with 60 lbs . rails , but no renewals are made with less than a 60 lbs . rail . From Rocklin to Newcastle the vineyards and orchards are very numerous , and again at Colfax , at which latter place we got some very fine grapes grown at an elevation of 2,400 feet above the sea . In the afternoon we passed the mining country , where the whole features of the country have been changed by the use of the ' Monitor ' for hydraulic mining , by means of which the sides of the mountains have been washed down to the valleys , filling them and the streams up , and doing much damage to the flats below : this system of directing a stream of water through a six-inch nozzle against the cliff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is illegal , owing to the damage caused by it . The snow sheds commence at Blue Canon , 4,693 feet above the sea , and 170 miles from San Francisco . They are simply rough wooden sheds to protect the line from drifting and falling snow , there being no avalanches to contend with on this route . " Some of the views on the Sierra Nevada are very fine , notably that at ' Cape Horn . ' There is very little timber until Blue Canon is reached , but from there to Truckee and beyond the timber is good , and about equal to that on the Rocky Mountains of the Canadian Pacific Railway . There are several saw mills in this vicinity . After leaving Emigrant Gap we ran through a continuous snow shed for 39 miles , which was very unpleasant , both by reason of the smoke in the cars , and the noise , as well as the loss of the view . We reached Reno about 10 p.m. , an hour and a half late . The schedule time over the mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and from Oakland to Reno , 246 miles , 20 miles an hour . Reno is 4,497 feet above the sea . The summit of the Sierras , which is 196 miles from San Francisco , is 7,017 feet above the sea . We remained all night at Reno . While there we saw in the morning a locomotive engine , with cylinders 22 x 30 and eight driving wheels coupled , said by the driver to weigh 165,000 lbs. , start for the ascent of the mountain , up grades of 116 feet to the mile , with 22 cars and a van . " The country round Reno is table land with high mountains around it . The only crop grown is ' alfalfa , ' a species of clover . Three crops a year are taken off the land , and it fetches , as fodder , from $8.00 to $16.00 per ton , according to the season . " At Wadsworth we saw a very nice reading-room and library for the employes of the railway . This is quite a model station , kept green and bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and has a machine shop , round house , &c.; The country from Reno to Salt Lake is dry , and almost a desert , sandy , and with sage bush in tufts ; the journey through it was hot and terribly dusty . The view of Brigham and other villages , with farms at the foot of the hills on approaching Ogden , was a great relief after the monotony of the last day 's run . " At Ogden we were transferred from the Central Pacific to the Union Pacific train , and upon leaving there passed , after a few miles , through Weber Canon , and afterwards Echo Canon ; the scenery was very picturesque , and , at this season of the year , was rendered more so by the beautiful autumn tints which were afforded by the foliage of the bushes which grow up the mountain sides for more than half their height . At Evanston we left the mountains and got on the high table land , over which we ran all day , having it cool and pleasant , a great contrast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night of the 1st October we had it quite cold , our altitude being at no time less than 6,000 feet above the sea . " On the morning of the 2nd October we reached Laramie , where we saw the works of the Union Pacific Railway Company for Burnettizing their ties . The ties are placed on trucks , run into a cylinder , steamed , treated with a solution of chloride of zinc , with glue mixed with it , and afterwards with a solution of tannic acid . When dried they retain only about 1 1/4 lb. of the material with which they have been treated . Mr. Octave Chanute , of Kansas City , Missouri , United States , erected the works for the Union Pacific Company , and has an interest in the patents under which the process is carried out , which is a modification of Sir William Burnett 's process . At 8.55 we crossed the highest point on the Rocky Mountains , 8,235 feet above the sea , on table land , no peaks being more than a few hundred feet above us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of it disintegrated , which is used for ballast . There are many snow sheds on the high land here , but none very long . We ran rapidly down from ' Sherman , ' the summit , to 6,000 feet level , and more gradually afterwards , running all day through the plains , over which , although very dry , numerous herds of cattle and horses were pasturing , and we reached Omaha at 7.50 a.m. on the 3rd October . " At Omaha we crossed the Missouri River . The bridge here , of iron , founded on iron cylinder piers , is for a single track only , and is being taken down bit by bit , and a double track iron bridge on masonry piers substituted .. " From Council Bluffs , the station on the Iowa side of the Missouri River , we left by the Chicago and North Western Railway , which is a well constructed , well equipped , and first class American Railway . The line runs through a good agricultural country , the chief crop being Indian corn , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trains during the day , and saw several trains of cattle going east also . We reached Chicago on time at 6.50 a.m. on the morning of the 4th October . " CHAPTER VII . Negociations as to the Intercolonial Railway ; and North-West Transit and Telegraph , 1861 to 1864 . It was in September , 1861 , that I visited Frederickton and Halifax on the question of the Intercolonial Railway , travelling by way of Riviere du Loup , Lake Temiscouata , Little Falls , Woodstock , round by St. Andrews , Canterbury , Frederickton , St. John , Shediac , and Truro to Halifax . Later in the autumn , representatives from New Brunswick and Nova Scotia visited Quebec and Montreal , and it was generally agreed that deputations from Canada and from the two Maritime Provinces should proceed to England . These deputations were , from Canada the Hon. Mr. Van Koughnet , from New Brunswick the Hon. Mr. Tilley , and from Nova Scotia the Hon. Joseph Howe . It was impossible to choose a more influential delegation : men earnest in the cause they came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great influence in the colonies they represented . I arrived in England from Canada in the beginning of November , 1861 , and at once telegraphed to the Duke , and on my way to London , at his request , I visited him at Clumber , and made my report of progress , which appeared to be highly satisfactory . The only difficulty , as to the Intercolonial , appeared to rest in Mr. Gladstone 's " peculiar views about subsidies , grants , and guarantees out of the funds , or on the security , of the State . " But the Duke said , he must " labour to show the Chancellor of the Exchequer that this was no new proposal ; that , in fact , the Provinces had been led to believe that if they would find the money , the State would guarantee the interest under proper precaution , as the State had guaranteed the capital for the Canadian canals , every shilling expended on which had been honourably repaid . " In fact , " this work was not a mere local work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of this , and many other , interviews , at the Colonial Office and at the Duke 's residences , was complete concurrence in the following programme :  --  ( I ) the Intercolonial guarantee must be carried by the Duke ; ( 2 ) measures must be taken to start Pacific transit , in the first instance , and as a pioneer work , by roads and telegraphs ; ( 3 ) Confederation must be pushed on ; and ( 4 ) that the difficulties arising from the position of the Hudson 's Bay Company must be gravely considered with a view to some solution . Mr. Van Koughnet , accompanied by Mrs. Van Koughnet , was , unfortunately , wrecked off Anticosti , in the Allan steamer " North Briton . " Happily every one , after a time of great peril , was landed in safety , while losing personal baggage and almost everything else . At a critical moment Sir Allen McNab , who was on board the ship , also on his way to England , when the vessel was expected to go down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring your wife , and we will go down together , away from this crowd of frightened people "  --  alluding to the mass of steerage passengers jostling about in panic . On the 11th November Mr. Howe and Mrs. Howe , and Mr. Tilley arrived : and I took the delegates to the Duke 's house in London on the 14th . The Duke received these delegates with very great cordiality . He had made , already , an appointment with Lord Palmerston , the Prime Minister , and had spoken to Mr. Gladstone . So , armed with a letter from the Duke , we went on to Cambridge House . We were shown into a room overlooking the court-yard , and had not long to wait for the veteran minister . He came , as usual , with his grey  --  not white  --  hair brushed up at the sides , his surtout buttoned up to his satin neck-tie , or , more correctly , " breast-plate , " which had a jewelled pin in the midst of its amplitude . He said , the Duke had told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only for the interests we represented , but for the Empire , and especially so at a time when the " fires were alight " across the British border . Mr. Howe very ably and concisely stated the case . No subsidy wanted , simply a guarantee on perfect security . Precedent for such guarantees , which had always been punctually and fully met . Previous promises of previous Governments  --  sanction of such statesmen as Lord Grey , Lord Derby , and Bulwer Lytton . Peculiar need of the work at this time ; and so on . Palmerston listened attentively , did not interrupt ; did not while Howe , and afterwards Tilley , were speaking , stop either , by asking a single question ; but when they had concluded , he repeated and summed up the case in far fewer words than had been used to state it : and in a manner which gave a new force to it all . He then spoke of the various treaties with the United States . He spoke of the giving up of the fine Aroostook district , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat said , that " the Ashburton Treaty was the most foolish treaty ever made . " He replied to the argument about the past commitment of other Governments , by describing it as " not possessing much attraction for an existing Government . " Here Howe made him laugh much , by saying , " At least , my Lord , it might have an influence with your conscientious Chancellor of the Exchequer . " After a good many questions and answers affecting the state of the Provinces , the facilities and difficulties of moving troops in winter , the conveyance of the mails , future closer relations of commerce between the Provinces , and , especially , the state of things in the United States ,  --  he asked us to " Go and see Gladstone . " We " might say he had suggested it . " Then he shook hands , with a swinging jollity , with each of us , saw us to the door , and , finally , wished us " success . " There might have been no " Trent " affair pending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before we could see Mr. Gladstone . But we finally accomplished the interview with him at his fine house in Carlton House Terrace , on the 23rd November . After waiting some while , following , as we did , about a dozen previous waiters on the Chancellor , we were shown into Mr. Gladstone 's working room , or den . The room was very untidy . Placards , papers , letters , newspapers , magazines , and blue boots on the table , chairs , bookshelves , and the floor . It looked , altogether , as if the window had been left open , and the contents of a miscellaneous newspaper , book , and parliamentary paper shop had been blown into the apartment . Mr. Gladstone , himself , looked bored and worried . Though perfectly civil , he had the expression of a man on his guard against a canvasser or a dun . He might be thinking of the " Trent " affair . We stated our errand , and as I had , as arranged , to say something , I used the argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the creation of land routes , &c.; He brushed that aside by the sharp remark , " Those subsidies are unsound , and they will not be renewed . " He then spoke of the objectionable features of all these " helps to other people who might help themselves . " He did not seem to mind the argument , that assuming this work to be of Imperial as well as of Provincial importance , unless aid ,  --  costless to England , or , at the highest , a very remote risk , and not in any sense a subsidy ,  --  were given , the work could not proceed at all . He struck me to be a man who thought spending money , or taking risks , however slight , a kind of crime . That , in fact , it was better to trust to Providence in important questions , and keep the national pocket tightly buttoned . We got little out of him , save an insight into the difficulty to be overcome . And yet he had been a party to the Crimean War . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vote for the Intercolonial guarantee , on the 28th March , 1867 , Mr. Gladstone concluded his speech by declaring , " I believe the present guarantee does depend upon motives of policy belonging to a very high order , and intimately and inseparably associated with most just , most enlightened views of the true interests of the Empire . " Thus we had sown the seed not in vain , and the counsel of the Duke was not forgotten . Mr. Van Koughnet arrived on the 26th November . On the 27th I took him to see the Duke , and we had a long conference . Finally , it was decided to send in a memorial to the Duke to lay before the Cabinet . Howe prepared it . It was most ably drawn , like all the State papers of that distinguished man , and it was sent in to the Colonial Office on the 2nd December , 1861 . Thus , all had been done that could then be done by the delegation . We had to rely upon the Duke . Our difficulty was with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tilley , and I , attended meetings at Bristol , Manchester , Liverpool , Oldham , Ashton , and other places , endeavouring , with no small success , to make the Intercolonial Railway a public question . But the delays ; the " pillar to post " ; the want of knowledge of permanent officials , whose geography , even , I found very defective , made our efforts irksome , and now and then , apparently , hopeless . But an event had startled England , like a thunderclap in a summer sky . On the 8th of November , 1861 , Captain Wilkes , of the United States ship " San Jacinta , " took the Southern States envoys  --  Messrs . Slidel and Mason  --  and two others , forcibly from the deck of a British mail ship , " The Trent . " The country was all on fire . Palmerston showed fight , and the Guards and other troops , and arms and stores to the value of more than a million sterling , were sent out to Canada . The delegates were sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I accompanied them . At the time all seemed to hang in the balance . The powers had joined England in protest , and our ambassador was instructed by despatch , per ship  --  for the submarine wires were not at work  --  to leave Washington in seven days if satisfaction were not given . At the War Office we met Mr. Cornewall Lewis , Minister for War , a man erudite and accomplished , who had lived on public employments nearly all his life , but who hardly knew the difference between the two ends of a ramrod . He asked , in long sentences , the questions which Palmerston had put shortly and in the pith ; all sorts of queries as to winter transport in the Provinces , the disposition for fight of the people , and so on . Then it was demanded , What we had to suggest ? Van Koughnet , who writhed under the tone adopted , bluntly said , " Why , to fight it out , of course ; we in Canada will have to bear the first brunt . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no arms in the country . You have failed to keep any store at all . " This led to a deliberate note being taken by the Under Secretary , the present Marquis of Ripon . Other details followed , and then , finally , we were asked if we had anything more to propose ? To which I answered " Yes ; send out a man who may be truly regarded as a general . " This was received with silence and open mouths . The fact was , the soldier in command in Canada was General Fenwick Williams , a most gallant man , who , in a siege , would eat his boots before he would give in : but was not the man who could so manoeuvre small bodies of men as to keep in check , in forests and on plains , large masses of the enemy . When we left , Captain Gallon came running after us , and said , " I am so glad you said that , we all feel as you do here "  --  ( the War Office ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undefendable position , wisely and with dignity , by surrendering their prisoners , who , delivered over to a British man-of-war , landed in England on the 29th January , 1862 ,  --  still it was decided to keep the troops in the Provinces , to reinforce them , to add to the armaments , and to adequately arm strategic points alongside the American frontier . And , as President of the Grand Trunk , I was asked to go out to Canada to aid and direct transport across the country . In the meantime  --  whether the cause was the " Trent " affair , or pre-occupation on the part of the Duke , or neglect of permanent officials , or their bad habit at that time of regarding Colonists as inferior persons  --  our delegates and their wives felt hurt at the social neglect which they experienced . And I agreed in the truth of their complaints so much , that I formally addressed the Duke on the 31st December . He acknowledged the neglect , apologised for it , and thereafter , until the day of their departure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Koughnet , were received in high circles , and were especially invited to Clumber . To sum up , I left England for Canada , in " The Asia , " on the 1st February , 1862 , landing at New York , where my son and Messrs . Brydges and Hickson met me  --  and after a deal of hard work on the part of every officer and man on the Grand Trunk , and no small anxiety , labour , responsibility , and exposure to storms and climate , inflicted upon myself , Mr. Brydges , Mr. Hickson , and the whole staff , Quartermaster-General Mackenzie sent us a handsome acknowledgment of our semi-military services . But the authorities at home did not condescend to recognize our existence or our labours . The late Sir Philip Rose gave me the greatest assistance with Mr. Disraeli , Sir E. Bulwer Lytton , and all the great party whose confidence he possessed . The following letter , addressed to him by Sir E. Bulwer Lytton , will be read with great interest :  --  " BUXTON , DERBYSHIRE , " April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am much flattered by your wish , and that of our Colonial friends ; but I fear that I must decline the important and honourable task to which you invite me : partly from a valid personal reason ; partly on political grounds . With regard to the first , I am here for a course of the Baths , in hopes to get rid of a troublesome lumbago , which has harassed me all the winter , and appears to have been epidemical from the number of victims it has cramped and racked this wet season . And I fear I shall not be able to get away till the middle of May , unless it be for some special vote . But apart from this consideration , I doubt whether it would be prudent for any member of Lord Derby 's late Government , with the support of those leaders who might very soon form another administration , to urge upon Parliament any new pecuniary burthen , nay , any new loan , in the face of a deficit . Would not this really play into Gladstone 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of attack on the side in which he is most vulnerable , viz. , the dealing with a deficit as if it were a surplus ? And again , would it be quite prudent in the coming Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer and his future colleagues to commit themselves to a measure they might find it inconvenient to carry out when in power ? " These are doubts that occur to me ; and would be well weighed by Mr. Disraeli  --  who might , perhaps , agree with me , that , on the whole , it would be better that this very important question should be brought before the House by some one not in the late Cabinet  --  some great merchant , perhaps  --  some one , in short , who could not be supposed to compromise or commit the future administrative policy of the party . " I remain , however , of the same opinion , that aid to intercolonial communication can be defended on Imperial grounds  --  and would in itself , if not opposed on purely fiscal reasons , be a wise as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my absence from town prevents , my seeing Mr. Watkin and profiting by the information , he could give me . I fear he will have left London before I return to it . But I should be very glad if he would write to me and acquaint me with the exact state of the case at present  --  and the exact wishes and requests of the Colonists . " Is it a renewal of the former proposition or what ? ' The whole question of intercolonial communication ' is a vast one . But I suppose practically it would limit itself before Parliament to the Railway before submitted to us  --  according to the pamphlet you sent me . " Believe me , " Yours very truly and obliged , " E. B. LYTTON . " The following letter was addressed to me :  --  " BUXTON , " May 3,1862 . " DEAR SIR , " Allow me to thank you cordially for a letter , which can not but be extremely gratifying to my feelings . Certainly my first object when I had the honour to preside at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast Empire which our Colonies comprise to the Mother Country , by all the ties of mutual interests and reciprocal affection . " The importance of the Railway line between Halifax and Quebec must be transparent to every clear-sighted politician . And had I remained in office , I should have urged upon my colleagues  --  I do not doubt successfully  --  the justice and expediency , both for Imperial interests , commercial and military , and for the vindication of the Imperial good faith which seems to me indisputably pledged to it , some efficient aid , or guarantees the completion of the line . I should willingly have undertaken the responsibility of recommending that aid to Parliament ; and I do not think the House of Commons would have refused it when proposed with the authority of Government . In that case the Railway by this time would have been nearly , if not wholly , completed . " Traffic begets traffic ; railways lead on to railways ; and a line once formed to Quebec , it would not be long before the resources of British Columbia would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Railway that must ultimately connect the Atlantic and Pacific . That once accomplished , the destinies of British North America seem to me assured . " I shall rejoice to hear that the present Government make a proposal which the Provinces accept . Some time , I conclude , must elapse before their decision can be known ; and in that case the question can scarcely come before Parliament this Session . A mode of aid accepted by the Colonies would have my most favourable consideration ; and , I can not doubt , my hearty support , whatever might be the administration that proposed it . " Yours truly obliged , E. B. LYTTON . " The Canadian Parliament met , early in March , 1862 , at Quebec ; in bitter winter and snow storms . We took down all the members who chose to go , by a special through train , in charge of Mr. Brydges ,  --  desiring to show them that , poor and unfortunate as the Grand Trunk might be , we could carry " M.P.Ps. " safely and quickly , as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the satisfaction of the military authorities . The train made a famous journey . In a few days I followed in company with the Honourable John Ross , and was several days on the road  --  in constant fight with snowdrifts  --  in getting to Point Levi . Then came the canoe crossing of the St. Lawrence , an enterprise startling , no doubt , as a first experience , though safe , if tedious . We were put in a canoe , really a disembowelled tree , and this was dragged , like a sledge , by a horse down to the margin of the river , where it was launched amongst floating ice , going up , down , and across the stream and its eddies . Our canoe men coming to a big piece of ice , perhaps 20 feet square , jumped out , dragged our canoe over the obstruction , and then launched it again . When getting jammed between the floating ice , they got on the sides of our boat , and working it up and down , like pumping the old fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stream , sometimes down  --  all points of the compass  --  but , after an hour 's struggle , we gained the wharf at Quebec , safe and sound . But a while after I certainly was exercised . It was important that Mr. Brydges should go back to Montreal , and my son went with him . I watched their crossing the river from the " Platform , " in a clear , grey , winter afternoon . They were two hours in crossing the river , a mile or two in width , in a straight line . At one time , I almost despaired , for they had drifted down almost into the Bay ; but , by the pluck and hard work of their men , they kept , in this tacking backwards and forwards , and up and down , gradually making their way , till they landed , a long way below the right point , however , and we exchanged handkerchief signals  --  and all was well . In the interval between this and my last visit , Lord Monck had been appointed Governor-General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking with the Duke about this appointment , he said , " I offered the position to five men previously , and they refused it . " I replied , " Did your Grace offer it to Lord Lawrence , now at home ? " The Duke put down his pen , turned from one side of his chair to the other , looked down and looked up , and at last said , " Upon my honour , I never thought of that . What a good appointment it would have been ! " Be that as it may , Lord Monck made an excellent Governor in very difficult times . Canada , and the great cause of Confederation , owe him a deep debt of gratitude . I found unexpected difficulties about Grand Trunk affairs . The Government were afraid of their own shadows . Instead of bringing in the Grand Trunk Relief Bill as a Government measure , as we had expected , they , in spite of remonstrance from Mr. Gait , confided it to a private member , and such was the , unexplained , opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power the Bill , though entirely in the nature of a private Bill , affecting the public in every sense of indirect advantage , would have been thrown out . The newspapers throughout the two Provinces , with half-a dozen honorable exceptions , were vile and vicious , as trans-Atlantic newspapers especially can be . I was full of unexpected anxiety . The Government tactics were Fabian ; and on the 5th April they decided to adjourn the House to the 23rd . So I went home in the " China " from New York on the 9th April with my son ; saw the Duke of Newcastle , discussed the situation ; saw the opening of the Great Exhibition of 1862 on the 1st May , and a few days afterwards sailed , with Lady Watkin , in the old Cunarder , the " Niagara ; " arriving at Boston after a long and difficult passage , and then travelling on to Quebec . But , on the 20th May , an event occurred  --  caused , it seemed to me , as a looker on , through want of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The circumstances were these . Under pressure from home , administered through the new . Governor-General , the Ministry had brought forward measures of defence . They proposed to raise and equip , at the cost of Canada , 50,000 men . They proceeded , if my memory serves me , by the introduction of a Bill , and that Bill was rejected by a very small majority ( 61 to 54 ) , composed of Sandfield Macdonald and a few others , described as " Ishmaelites . " Upon that vote Mr. Cartier at once resigned , as I thought in too much haste . I met him as he walked away from the Parliament House in the afternoon , and expressed regret . He said , with set teeth , clenched fist , and sparkling eyes , " Ah ! Well , I have saved the honour of my country against those ' Grits ' and ' Rouges ; ' traitres , traitres . " Mr. J. A. Macdonald , afterwards , took the matter very quietly , merely remarking that the slightest tact might have prevented the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who was to succeed ? In the ordinary course Mr. Foley , the assumed leader of the Opposition , would have been sent for . It was the opinion of the Honorable John Ross that he ought to have been . But the Governor , considering , I suppose , that the scanty majority was led by Sandfield Macdonald , sent for him . All sides believed that it would be a ministry of a month . But this astute descendant of Highlanders managed to stay in for nearly two years : two years of no good : two years of plausible postponement of all that the Duke had been so loyally working for in the interest of Canada . Personally , I had no reason to complain as regarded Grand Trunk legislation . Sandfield Macdonald promised to carry our Bill , and he honourably fulfilled his promise . The Bill passed ; Lady Watkin and I sailed from Boston for England on the 7th June . But the refusal of the Canadian Parliament to vote money for defence had created a very bad impression in England . England had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a critical time  --  and it was naturally said , in many quarters , " Are these people cowards ? Are they longing for another rule ? " Sir E. Bulwer Lytton , when Mr. Rose and I called upon him at his lodgings , in St. James 's Place , during my short stay in London , said , " I do not see what we can do . Had Canada helped us at all , we could have succeeded . Now every one will say , What is the use of helping such people ? " And Mr. Disraeli said , in the House , answering a statement that the vote of the Canadian Parliament did not represent the feeling of the people : " I decline to assume that the vote of a popular assembly is not the vote of those they represent . " All this was awkward . But I resolved I would never give in . So I went to Canada again in the autumn of 1862 . Mr. Joseph Howe came from Halifax to Canada to meet me . He did all he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postal claim on Canada of the Grand Trunk ; but in vain . He never would settle it , just and honest as it was . Mr. Howe tried to induce the Government to take up the Intercolonial question where we had left it in the previous autumn : and in this he so far succeeded that it was agreed a delegation from Canada should meet delegations from Nova Scotia and New Brunswick before the end of this year  --  1862  --  in London . Messrs . Howland and Sicotte were the Canadian delegates ; Mr. Howe for Nova Scotia , and Mr. Tilley for New Brunswick . We set to work to carry both the Intercolonial guarantee , and the Pacific transit scheme , the moment these gentlemen arrived in England . Meeting Messrs . Rowland and Sicotte at their hotel , in Jermyn Street , on the 2nd December , 1862 , and discussing matters all round , they certainly led me , unsuspectingly , to believe they had the same desire to carry the Intercolonial as that entertained by Messrs . Howe and Tilley ; and further , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the broad lines laid down in so many discussions , their arrangements on both questions would be cordially welcomed and approved by their colleagues . I very soon found out , however , that they were " riding to orders , " and those orders , no doubt , being interpreted , were : " Refuse nothing , discuss everything , but do nothing . " On the 8th December we met the Canadian delegates at the bank of Messrs . Glyn , in Lombard Street , and we drew up a proposal , which these gentlemen corrected . We adopted their corrections and sent in the paper , as an agreed paper , to the Duke . Two days afterwards , for better assurance , we received the following memorandum :  --  " With a view of better enabling the gentlemen whom they met yesterday at 67 , Lombard Street , to take immediate measures to form a Company for the object of carrying out the construction of a telegraph line , and of a road to establish frequent and easy communication between Canada and the Pacific , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic , the undersigned have the honour to state , that they are of opinion that the Canadian Government will agree to give a guarantee of interest at the rate of four per cent , upon one-third of the sum expended , provided the whole sum does not exceed five hundred thousand pounds , and provided also that the same guarantee of interest will be secured upon the other two-thirds of the expenditure by Imperial or Columbian contributions . " If a Company composed of men of the standing and wealth of those they had the pleasure to meet is formed for the above purposes , under such conditions as will secure the interests of all parties interested , and the accomplishment of the objects they have in view , such an organization will be highly favourable to the settlements of an immense territory , and , if properly administered , may prove to be also of great advantage to the trade of England . " London , 10 Decr. 1862 . " L. V. SICOTTE , " W. P. HOWLAND . " To MM . Glyn , Benson , Chapman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days afterwards these Canadian delegates started an objection . The Imperial Government merely gave land and did not take one-third of the proposed guarantee , and the following further memorandum was sent to me :  --  " Although little disposed to believe that Her Majesty 's Government will not accede to the proposal of co-operation they have made in relation to the opening of communication from Canada to the Pacific , the undersigned have the honour to state , in answer to the letter of Mr. Watkin of the 17th instant , that in their opinion the Government of Canada will grant to a Company organised as proposed in the papers already exchanged , a guarantee of interest , even on one-half of the capital stated in these documents , should the Imperial Government refuse to contribute any portion of this guaranteed sum of interest . " In answer to another demand made in the same letter , the undersigned must state that the guarantee of the Canadian Government of this payment of interest ought to secure the moneys required at the rate of four per cent , and that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate of interest as the basis of the arrangement . " London , 20 December , 1862 . " L. V. SICOTTE , " W. P. ROWLAND . " ED . WATKIN , Esq. , London . " So much , and so far , for the Pacific affair . But in the Intercolonial discussion there was an undercurrent . The only points left for discussion with the Duke and Mr. Gladstone were the question of survey , which was easily settled , and the question of a sinking fund for the loan to be made on the credit of Great Britain . At first Mr. Gladstone insisted on such a short term of repayment , and therefore so heavy a put-by , that his terms took away the pecuniary value of the guarantee itself : that is to say , that what the Colonies would have annually to pay , would have amounted to more than the annual sum for which they could have borrowed the money themselves . I suggested a longer term , and also , that the interest on the annual put-by , to accumulate , should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer to a letter written with the assistance of Messrs . Howe and Tilley , I received the following from the Duke :  --  " CLUMBER , " 8 Decr. 1862 . " MY DEAR SIR , " I am sorry to say your letter confirms the impression I have entertained from my first interview with the Canadian delegates  --  an impression strengthened by each subsequent meeting  --  that Mr. Sicotte is a traitor to the cause he has come over to advocate . I am unable to make out whether he is playing false on his own account or by order of his colleagues ; but I can not say I have any reason to associate Mr. Howland with the want of faith in any dealings with me . " You can have no idea how I have been compelled to forbear and to fence with Mr. S. to prevent his breaking off upon every possible occasion and upon any almost impossible pretext . His whole aim has been to find some excuse for throwing up the railroad and saying it was the act of the Imperial Government . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows that in the financial details alone Mr. G. interferes , and I presume Mr. Rowland would tell him that this is the duty of a Finance Minister . " Nothing struck me more than Mr. S. 's objection to your being present at our meetings . When you did ' drop in ' I felt obliged to say nothing about it till your card was brought , and on that occasion I particularly remarked that his usual obstructiveness was suspended . " The one point now in dispute between the delegates and the Treasury is really of no importance to either party . I hope and expect that Mr. G. will give way ; but I suspect if he does Mr. S. will be ( by no means for the first time ) much disappointed . " Have you seen a remarkable letter in the ' Standard ' of the 6th , signed ' A British Canadian , ' commenting upon Mr. Sicotte going over to Paris and dictating to the editor of ' La France ' an article upon a despatch of mine to Canada on the subject of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can only come from a member of the present Canadian Government . " Do not at present get up any new deputation or go to Lord Palmerston . Considering Mr. G. 's strong opposition to the whole scheme on principle , I can not say I think he has shown any desire to thwart by obstacles in details a measure upon which his views have been overruled , and it would be ungracious to show distrust where none at present has been merited . I may differ with him on some points ; but he has certainly conceded more to me than I to him , and I could be no party to attempting to supersede his proper functions of the financial watch-dog ! " I am anxious not to be brought up to town unnecessarily , for I am conscious that I want comparative rest , and that my health is not very fit for the commencement of a Session ; but whenever you are passing between London and Manchester I shall always be happy to see you , and glad if you can stay a day or two  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NEWCASTLE . " The next day I had the following :  --  " CLUMBER , " 9 Decr. 1862 . " MY DEAR SIR , " It is no easy matter to give any advice as to what should be done , especially as I do not know whether Mr. Gladstone is still in London , though I rather imagine he has left for Hawarden . " If Mr. Sicotte were anywhere but here ( where he never ought to have been ) , I should advise Messrs . Howe and Tilley to see Mr. Gladstone , perhaps with you ; but I can neither recommend them to see him with or without Mr. Sicotte , so long as he is here . " As I wrote to you yesterday , the business ought to have been closed three days ago , for though I think . Mr. Gladstone 's stipulation wrong , it ought not to have been allowed to interfere with a final arrangement .

I will be at Thomas ' Hotel to-morrow night at 10 o'clock , if you can meet me at that time , and if you like to appoint Howe and Tilley a quarter of an hour later , I will see them and discuss what we ought to do . " I feel very confident we can yet set matters right , if we can only prevent Mr. Sicotte upsetting the coach .

Duke said Gladstone had expressed strong approval of Pacific , &c.; affair  --  and had added , ' that it was one of the grandest affairs ever conceived , and he hoped it would be completed in Duke 's time  --  and it should have his hearty support . ' Good . " Messrs . Sicotte and Rowland suddenly went home , and we appeared to be at a dead lock . After several letters and suggestions , the Duke sent me this letter :  --  " CLUMBER , " 6 Jany. 1863 . " MY DEAR SIR , " I have received several letters from you without sending any answer ; but I must confess I am so disheartened about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' delegates , ' that I do not know how to proceed , or , rather , I do not see the possibility of proceeding at all . " At the last interview I had with the Canadian delegates , everything was considered settled to their satisfaction , except the one point of a sinking fund , and even that was admitted by all but Mr. Sicotte to be met by Mr. Gladstone 's consent , that the money should be invested in Colonial securities . Thus matters stood until the day the Canadians embarked , when ( avoiding an interview with Sir F. Rogers , and everybody else ) they sent me in a paper , couched in terms offensive to the British Government , and complaining of every single provision in the conditions  --  evidently got up to carry out Mr. Sicotte 's pre-arranged plan of upsetting the whole scheme , and throwing the blame on the Imperial Government .

In reference to the tariff of charges of your Company , you must be aware that it is not legal , unless approved by the Governor and Council . I am not aware of the circumstances stated by you , but presume , that if the Provincial Secretary called for your tariff , it was because it had not received the sanction of the Government ; however , I feel safe in saying , that in the exercise of that power the Government would not be actuated by any feeling other than that of performing a public duty .

" I send by post the report of Mr. Taylor to the United States Government , upon the N. W.

" I am , yours sincerely , " NEWCASTLE . " This letter of the 27th March , 1863 , was in reply to a letter from me :  --  " ROSE HILL , NORTHEN , " March 27th , 1863 . " MY LORD DUKE , " In looking over the maps very carefully prior to sending in the documents proposed to be transmitted through your Grace , I find that it is very probable  --  from the desirability of carrying a telegraph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where buffaloes often move about in square miles of extent  --  that we may go through the Imperial territory for a more or less considerable distance . It therefore strikes me , that what I have before suggested , as to the desirability of Imperial assistance , may not be reconciled with Mr. Gladstone 's desire to avoid an Imperial contribution of money . I therefore suggest to your Grace , that the Imperial Government should agree to give a grant of land of some reasonable extent , also that portion of the territory lying between the Hudson 's Bay territory and British Columbia which belongs to the Crown , provided a telegraphic and road communication passes through any portion of that territory . " If this meets your Grace 's views , would it not be better that the fact of the Imperial Government having made this concession should be recited in the preamble of the proposed Bill which we are to send to Canada , and that thus invited to the scheme by a contribution of land , power to purchase or control should be directly given by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me your views upon this at once , I will have the documents prepared accordingly , and transmitted without delay . " ' Minesota ' has given about two millions of acres in aid of works to extend their rail and water communications in the direction of Red River . " I have to thank your Grace for sending me Mr. Foley 's report , and , also , copy of the Minutes of Council as to the Intercolonial and the western project . " The territory I allude to is hunted over by the Hudson 's Bay Company , and forms , mainly , a portion of what they call the Athabasca district . " It was matter of deep regret to me that the Government of the day would not accept any share of the pecuniary responsibility of adding to the compactness of the Empire , by connecting the two oceans by telegraph and by road . The despatch which I copy  --  dated Downing Street , 5 March , 1863  --  distinctly says , in its third paragraph , " Her Majesty 's Government are of opinion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the proposed subsidy by this country . " " DOWNING STREET , " 5th March , 1863 . " SIR , " I am directed by the Duke of Newcastle to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th of December , and to express his Grace 's regret that so long , though quite unavoidable , a delay should have occurred in replying to it . " I am now desired to make to you the following communication :  --  " Her Majesty 's Government are of opinion that they can not apply to Parliament to sanction any share in the proposed subsidy by this country ; and though they take great interest in the project contemplated with so much public spirit by the gentlemen represented by you for carrying a telegraphic and postal communication from the confines of Canada to the Pacific , they do not concur in the opinion of the Canadian delegates that the work is of such special ' Imperial importance ' as to induce them to introduce for the first time the principle of subsidizing or guaranteeing telegraphic lines on land . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a submarine Transatlantic telegraph the proposed line in America will be of comparatively small value to the Imperial Government , and that whenever a scheme of the former kind is renewed , it is almost certain that this country must be called upon to bear a much larger charge for it than that which it is now proposed to devolve upon the British Colonies in respect of the land-telegraph and communication . " As Canada has offered to bear one-half of the proposed guarantee , the Duke of Newcastle is prepared to recommend , and his Grace has no doubt of ready acquiescence , that British Columbia and Vancouver Island shall pay the sum of L10,000 per annum , as their share of L20,000 ( being at the rate of L4 per cent , on a capital of L500,000 ) , to commence when the line is in working order . " It will , however , be necessary , before any proposal is made officially to the Colonies , that the Duke of Newcastle should receive further details . It is requisite that his Grace should be informed what provision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; what conditions as to the right of purchasing the line , and to what authorities that right should belong ; and on what terms the whole arrangement may be revised in the event of the Hudson 's Bay Company coming to any agreement for the sale of their territory . " There will doubtless be other provisions which the Colonies will expect . " I am , Sir , your obedient Servant , " T. F. ELLIOT . " E. W. WATKIN , Esq . " I close this narrative of the Pacific Transit Scheme with the despatch of the 1st May , 1863 , which summarises the proposals made and generally concurred in . These long discussions were not abortive , for they led up to the great question of the buying out of the Hudson 's Bay Company , without which neither successful Confederation , nor its child the Canadian Pacific Railway , would have been achieved in this generation . " DOWNING STREET , " 1st May , 1863 . " SIR , " I am directed by the Duke of Newcastle to state that he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultimo , enclosing the heads of a proposal for establishing telegraphic and postal communication between Lake Superior and New Westminster , through the agency of the Atlantic and Pacific Transit and Telegraph Company . These proposals call for some observations from his Grace . " New Westminster is named as the Pacific terminus of the road and telegraph . His Grace takes for granted that if the Imperial Government and that of British Columbia should find on further inquiry that some other point on the coast would supply a more convenient terminus , the Company would be ready to adopt it . " Article 1 .  --  His Grace sees no objection to the grant of land contemplated in this Article , but the ' rights ' stipulated for are so indeterminate that without further explanation they could scarcely be promised in the shape in which they are asked . He anticipates , however , no practical difficulty on this head . " Nos. 1 and 2.  --  The Duke of Newcastle , on the part of British Columbia and Vancouver Island , sees no objection to the maximum rate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Colonies is clearly limited to 12,500l. per annum . Nor does he think it unfair that the Government guarantee should cover periods of temporary interruption from causes of an exceptional character , and over which the Company has no control . " But he thinks it indispensable that the Colonies should be sufficiently secured against having to pay , for any lengthened period , an annual sum of 12,500l. without receiving the corresponding benefit , that is to say , the benefit of direct telegraphic communication between the seat of government in Canada and the coast of the Pacific . " It must , therefore , be understood that the commencement of the undertaking must depend on the willingness of the Canadian Government and Legislature to complete telegraphic communication from the seat of government to the point on Lake Superior at which the Company will take it up . Nor could his Grace strongly urge on the Colonies of Vancouver Island and British Columbia the large annual guarantee which this project contemplates , unless there were good reason to expect that the kindred enterprise of connecting Halifax and Montreal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It will also be requisite to secure by formal agreements that the guarantee shall cease , and the grants of land for railway purposes revert to the grantors , in case of the permanent abandonment of the undertaking , of which abandonment some unambiguous test should be prescribed , such as the suspension of through communication for a stated period . " The Duke of Newcastle does not object to five years as the maximum period for the completion of the undertaking  --  and he thinks it fair to exclude from that period , or from the period of suspension above mentioned , any time during which any part of the line should be in occupation of a foreign enemy . But injuries from the outbreaks of Indian tribes and other casualties , which are inherent in the nature of the undertaking , must be taken as part of the risks which fall on the conductors of the enterprise , by whose resource and foresight alone they can be averted . " His Grace apprehends that the Crown land contemplated in Article 3 , is the territory lying between the eastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granted to the Hudson Bay Company by their charter . His Grace must clearly explain that Her Majesty 's Government do not undertake , in performance of this article of the agreement , to go to the expense of settling any questions of disputed boundary , but only to grant land to which the Crown title is clear . " With regard to the 7th Article , the Duke of Newcastle could not hold out to the Company the prospect of protection by any military or police force in the uninhabited districts through which their line would pass  --  but he would consider favourably any proposal for investing the officers of the Company with such magisterial or other powers as might conduce to the preservation of order and the security of the Company 's operations . " With reference to the 9th and concluding Article , the Duke of Newcastle would not willingly undertake the responsible functions proposed to him , but he will agree to do so if by those means he can in any degree facilitate the project , and if he finds that the Colonies concur in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such questions of detail as further consideration may elicit , the Duke of Newcastle cordially approves of the Company 's proposals , and is prepared to sanction the grants of land contemplated in the 3rd Article . He intends to communicate the scheme , with a copy of this letter , to the Governor-General of Canada , and the Governor of Vancouver Island , recommending the project to their attentive consideration . " I am , Sir , your obedient Servant , " C. FORTESCUE . " E. W. WATKIN , Esq . " CHAPTER VIII . Negociations for Purchase of the Hudson 's Bay Property . In response to our demand for a large tract of land through the " Fertile belt " of the Hudson 's Bay territory , the Governor answered , almost in terror , to the Duke of Newcastle :  --  " What ! sequester our very tap-root ! Take away the fertile lands where our buffaloes feed ! Let in all kinds of people to squat and settle , and frighten away the fur-bearing animals they do n't hunt and kill ! Impossible . Destruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are so patriotic , why do n't they buy us out ? " To this outburst the Duke quietly replied : " What is your price ? " Mr. Berens , the Governor , answered : " Well , about a million and a half . " Finding that our demands for land alongside the proposed road and telegraph were not acceptable to the Governor and Court of the Hudson 's Bay Company , we had nothing for it but either to drop the Pacific transit proposal , after many months of labour and trouble , or to take the bold course of accepting the challenge of those gentlemen , and negociating for the purchase of all their property and rights . Before making a decided move , however , I had many anxious discussions with the Duke as to who the real purchaser should be . My strong , and often urged , advice was , that whoever the medium of purchase might be , Great Britain should take to the bargain . I showed that at the price named there could be no risk of loss ; and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That the fur trade could be separated from the land and rights , and that a new joint stock company could be organized to take over the trading posts , the fleet of ships , the stock of goods , and the other assets , rights , and privileges affecting trade , and that such a company would probably pay a rental  --  redeemable over a term of years , were that needful to meet Mr. Gladstone 's notions  --  of 3 or 3-1/2 per cent , on 800,000l. , leaving only 700,000l. as the value of a territory bigger than Russia in Europe . Such a company would have to raise additional capital of its own to modernize its business , to improve the means of intercourse between its posts , and to cheapen and expedite the transport to and fro of its merchandise . I carefully described the nature of these changes and all that they involved . The Duke seemed to favour this idea . Then I pointed out that , if desired , a land company could be organized in England , Canada , and the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and redemption , might take over the lands  --  leaving a reserve of probably a fourth of the whole as the , unpaid for , property of the Government  --  at the price of 700,000l . If these proposals succeeded , then all the country would have to do was to lend 1,500,000l. on such security as could be offered , ample , in each case , in my opinion . But I said it must be a condition , if these plans were adopted , to erect the Hudson 's Bay territory into a Crown Colony , like British Columbia , and to govern it on the responsibility of the Empire . I showed that this did not involve any large sum annually ; and that , as in the case of British Columbia , the loss would be turned into a profit by sales of the one-fourth of the land to be given , in return for the responsibilities , taken , to our country . Again , the cost of government might be recouped by a moderate system of duties in and out of the territory , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , and the United States on the other . This , in outline , was one plan . The next was , to sell a portion of the territory to the United States at the price , which I knew could be obtained , of a million . A third plan which I suggested was , to open up portions of the " Fertile belt " to colonization from the United States . To offer homes , in a bracing , healthy country  --  with fertile lands and long waterways  --  to the multitudes of men and women in Ohio , Kentucky , Maryland , and many other States , who desired to flee from war and conflict ; whose yearning was for settled government and peace . These men and women had still resources , friends , and credit , and if our country opened its arms to them , they would flock to the old red flag , and bring their energies to bear on the industrial conquest of these vast regions to the West . But  --  if any man went , morally , down on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to beg , beseech , implore ,  --  that this great bargain , this purchase of purchases , of a Continent , should be made for our country , and should be untainted by even the suspicion of a mercantile adventure . In the end , I thought I had converted the Duke , well disposed always , to the wisdom of such a policy . Following this line , we discussed many details . He " would not sell , " but he would " exchange ; " and , studying the map , we put our fingers upon the Aroostook wedge , in the State of Maine  --  upon a piece of territory at the head of Lake Superior , and upon islands between British Columbia and Vancouver 's Island  --  which might be the equivalent of rectification of boundary on many portions to the Westward along the 49th parallel of latitude . Further , at one of our many interviews a name for the new Crown Colony , if established , was mentioned  --  " Hysperia . " Dr. Mackay had suggested it to me . The general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minister of Russia I should buy the land . It is the right thing to do for many , for all , reasons ; but ministers here must subordinate their views to the Cabinet . " Still , he went so far , that I believed if the Hudson 's Bay property were once bought , the Duke would manage to take the purchase over for the country . I was too sanguine . I had not measured the passive resistance of the inside of the Colonial Office to everything that inside had not initiated ; though the fact that day by day objections , urged to the Duke from inside , were put to me , by him , and , I believe , always satisfactorily answered , might have warned me . I hope to live to find three conditions established at the Colonial Office :  - -  (1) That no one , from the head down to the office boy , shall enter the doors without having passed in general and in British Empire , geography . ( 2 ) That no one shall be promoted who has not visited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) That no one shall be eligible for the highest offices who has not visited and studied , personally , every portion of the distant British Empire . With confident hope I went to work . It is true that Mr. Thomas Baring warned me . He said : " If the Duke wants these great efforts made he must make them on behalf of the Government : he must not leave private persons to take the risk of Imperial work . " And , in this state of mind , Mr. Baring refused , afterwards , to be one of the promoters of the Pacific scheme , a refusal which led Mr. Glyn to hesitate to sign the legal papers without his friend and colleague . It was an anxious time for me ; for on my head rested the main responsibility . One circumstance somewhat sustained me . On " the 10th December , 1862 , at Thomas ' Hotel , the Duke had read to me a private letter from Mr. Gladstone to him , containing these words . Words of which I was allowed to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandest affairs ever achieved , and I hope it will be completed in your time . It shall have my hearty support . " Alas ! however , Mr. Baring was right . The first official interview with the Governor and Court of the Hudson 's Bay Company was at the " Hudson 's Bay House , " Fenchurch Street , on the 1st December , 1862 . The room was the " Court " room , dark and dirty . A faded green cloth , old chairs almost black , and a fine portrait of Prince Rupert . We met the Governor , Berens , Eden Colville , and Lyell only . On our part there were Mr. G. G. Glyn ( the present Lord Wolverton ) , Captain Glyn ( the late Admiral Henry Glyn ) , and Messrs . Newmarch , Benson , Blake , and myself . Mr. Berens , an old man and obstinate , bearing a name to be found in the earliest lists of Hudson 's Bay shareholders , was somewhat insulting in his manner . We took it patiently . He seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his Fertile belt , tap root , &c.!"; Subsiding , we had a reasonable discussion , and were finally informed that they would give us land for the actual site of a road and a telegraph through their territory , but nothing more . But they would sell all they had , as we " were , no doubt , rich enough to buy , " for " about " 1,500,000l. , as they had told the Duke . The offer of the mere site of a road and ground for telegraph poles was of no use . So , just as we were leaving , I said , " We are quite ready to consider your offer to sell ; and , to expedite matters , will you allow us to see your accounts , charters , &c."; They promised to consult their Court . And , gradually , it got to this , that I was put in communication with old Mr. Roberts , aged 85 , their accountant , and with their solicitor , the able and honorable Mr. Maynard , of the old firm of Crowder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many interviews ; and on the 17th March , 1863 , I met the Governor , Mr. Ellice , jun. ( son of Edward Ellice-the " old bear " ) , Mr. Matheson and Mr. Maynard . They showed me a number of schedules , which they called " accounts . " Next day I had a long private interview with Mr. Maynard , but " could not see the ' balance-sheet . ' " The same day I saw the Duke with Messrs . Glyn and Benson . Next day ( 19th ) I spent the forenoon with Mr. Roberts , the accountant , and his son and assistant , at the Hudson 's Bay House . Mr. Roberts told me many odd things ; one was that the Company had had a freehold farm on the site of the present city of San Francisco of 1,000 acres , and sold it just before the gold discoveries for 1,000l. , because two factors quarrelled over it . I learnt a great deal of the inside of the affair , and got some glimpses of the competing " North West " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mover , many years agone with the Hudson 's Bay Company . Pointing to some boxes in his private room one day , Mr. Maynard said : " There are years of Chancery in those boxes , if anyone else had them . " And he more than once quoted a phrase of the " old bear " : " My fortune came late in life . " On the 8th May I went to see the Duke . He was very ill ; but his interest in the Hudson 's Bay purchase was unabated . I saw him again on the 15th , and wrote a letter to the Hudson 's Bay Company . On the 19th Mr. Maynard told me that the Hudson 's Bay Court were meeting that day to reply to my letter . The reply came on the 21st , and was " nearly what we wished . " Owing to the Duke 's illness , and to some secret difficulty which he never enlightened me upon , I was given to understand , after a short , but anxious delay , that any purchase must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of moral support would be at our service . What good was moral support in providing a million and a half ? What was to be done ? There were only two ways : one , to make a list of fifteen persons who would each take a " line " of a hundred thousand pounds for himself and such friends as he chose to associate with him ; the other , to hand the proposed purchase over to the just founded International Financial Association , who were looking out for some important project to lay before the public . Leaving out Mr. Baring and Mr. Glyn ( senr. ) we had a strong body of earnest friends , substantial men , and we could , no doubt , have underwritten the amount . My proportion was got ready ; and my personal friends would have doubled that proportion , or more , if I had wanted it . I strongly recommended this course . But the Hudson 's Bay Company would give no credit . We must take up the shares as presented and pay for them over the counter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxious days , adopted . Mr. Richard Potter was the able negociator in completing this great transaction , began and carried on as above . The shares were taken over and paid for by the International Financial Society , who issued new stock to the public to an amount which covered a large provision of new capital for extension of business by the Company , and a profit to themselves and their friends who had taken the risk of so new and onerous an engagement . I may finish this section by stating that , as respects the new Hudson 's Bay shareholders , their 20l. shares have been reduced by returns of capital to 13l. , and having , nevertheless , in the " boom " of lands in the West , been sold at 37l. as the price of the 13l. ; they are now about 24l . Thus , every one who has held his property , and will continue to hold it , has , and will have , a safe and unusually profitable investment . These shareholders , besides the large reserves near their posts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one-twentieth of the land where settlements are surveyed and made . This gives a great future to the investor . On the other hand , Canada  --  in place of the Mother Country , to whom the whole ought to have belonged , for the purposes previously set forth  --  has obtained this vast and priceless dominion for a payment of only 300,000l. , on the award of Earl Granville ; and the Pacific Railway , by reason of that great possession , has been completed and opened . But there is much to record between the period of purchase and the sale to Canada . I here give to the reader some letters of the Duke 's relating to these negotiations generally :  --  " DOWNING STREET , " 14 Augt. 1862 . " MY DEAR SIR , " I am glad to tell you that since I received your letter of Saturday last , the Hudson 's Bay Company has replied to my communication , and has promised to grant land to a company formed under such auspices as those with whom I placed them in communication . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will give , for of course they propose to include the whole length of the line through their territory . A copy of the reply shall be sent to Mr. Baring , and I hope you and he will be able to bring this concession to some practical issue . " I was quite aware of the willingness of the Company to sell their whole rights for some such sum as 1,500,000l . I ascertained the fact two months ago , and alluded to it in the House of Lords in my reply to a motion by Lord Donoughmore . I can not , however , view the proposal in so favourable a light as you do . There would be no immediate or direct return to show for this large outlay , for of course the trade monopoly must cease , and the sale of land would for some time bring in little or nothing  --  certainly not enough to pay for the government of the country . " I do not think Canada can , or if she can ought to , take any large share in such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proposal with views of their own ,  --  but it would be a serious , and for some time unremunerative , addition to their very embarrassing debt . " I certainly should not like to sell any portion of the territory to the United States  --  exchange ( if the territory were once acquired ) would be a different thing ,  --  but that would not help towards the liquidation of the purchase-money .

" CHAPTER IX . The Right Honorable Edward Ellice , M.P. I have alluded to this remarkable man under the soubriquet attached to him for a generation  --  " the old Bear . " I assume that when his son , who for many years represented the Scotch constituency of the St. Andrews Burghs , grew up , the father became the " old " and the son the " young " Bear . Mr. Ellice was the son of Mr. Alexander Ellice , an eminent merchant in the City of London . Born , if the " Annual Register " be accurate , in 1789 , he died at the end of 1863 . It is strange that he began life by uniting the Canadian fur trade with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long enough to witness the sale and transfer of the interests he had , by a bold and masterly policy , combined in 1820 . Leaving Canada , Mr. Ellice joined the Whig party , and was returned to Parliament for Coventry in 1818 ; and , with the exception of the period from 1826 to 1830 , he retained his seat till the day of his death . Marrying the youngest sister of Earl Grey , of the Reform Bill  --  the widow of Captain Bettesworth , R.N.  --  who died in 1832 , leaving him an only son ; and , in 1843 , the widow of Mr. Coke , of Norfolk , he became intimately connected with the Whig aristocracy . In Mr. Ellice 's evidence before the Parliamentary Committee of 1857 , on the Hudson 's Bay Company , I find that , in answer to a question put by Mr. Christy , M.P. , as to the probability of a " settlement being made within what you consider to be the Southern territories of the Hudson 's Bay Company ? "  --  he replied , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive . " Events have proved his error . Mr. Ellice was a man of commanding stature and presence , but , to my mind , had always the demeanour of a colonist who had had to wrestle with the hardships of nature , and his cast of countenance was Jewish . According to his own account , he went out to Canada in 1803 , when he must have been a mere youth , and then personally associated himself with the fur trade , a trade which attracted the attention of almost the whole Canadian society . It was , in fact , at that time , the great trade of the country . The traders had inherited the skill and organization of the old French voyageurs , who , working from Quebec and Montreal as bases of their operations , were the doughty competitors of the Hudson 's Bay Company , many of whose posts were only separated by distances of a hundred miles from those of the French . When Canada became the possession of our country , in the last century , Scotch and English capital and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , a powerful organization , called the " North-West Company , " arose , and extended its operations right across to the Pacific . At the end of the last century , or the beginning of this , Mr. Ellice 's father , as Mr. Ellice stated , " had supplied a great part of the capital by which the whole north-west trade was conducted . " Profitable trading brought division of interests ; and , in addition to smaller swarms from the parent hive , a new organization , called the " X. Y. Company , " or " Sir Alexander Mackenzie and Company , " carried on trade in competition with the original " North-West Company of Canada . " Mr. Ellice became connected with this " X. Y. Company " in 1805 . The leading spirit of the North-West Company was Mr. McGillivray : and Mr. McGillivray and Mr. Ellice were , as a rule , cordial allies . Two leading firms engaged in the fur trade were McTavish , Fraser &; Co. , and Inglis , Ellice &; Co . Competition raged amongst these Canadian interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose affairs were administered from England . The business was carried on , therefore , with great extravagance . The Indians were tempted and corrupted by strong drink . Frequent collisions took place between the Indians and the whites , and everything grew worse till 1811 . In 1811 Lord Selkirk joined the Hudson 's Bay Company . He became not only a stockholder in the Company , but took great interest in the trade ; and he was the proprietor of a large tract of territory on the Red River , acquired from the Hudson 's Bay Company under a deed dated 12th June , 1811 . In this territory , he made settlements for the purposes of agriculture . The conflict of interests between the Canadian fur traders and the Hudson 's Bay Company became more and more violent , and ended in bloodshed . Finally Lord Selkirk , in virtue of his assumed powers as a magistrate , seized Mr. McGillivray , of the North-West Company , at Fort William , at the head of Lake Superior , and the whole of his property . The confusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a Mr. Coltman was sent up as Commissioner . Mr. Coltman reported , and made a recommendation that , to restore peace and order , some attempt should be made to unite the interests of the various fur traders in the country . In the meantime the Hudson 's Bay Company ceased to pay dividends , and the other companies were almost bankrupt . At this moment Mr. Ellice , by great tact , and force of will , succeeded in uniting all the conflicting combinations ; and from that time onwards the fur trade has been carried on under the Charter of the Hudson 's Bay Company , extended by licenses , from time to time renewed , of exclusive trade in the North-West and in the Pacific States , including Vancouver 's Island . Out of these fusions arose the Puget Sound Company , created to utilise , cultivate , and colonise the Pacific territories , over which licenses to trade had been given to the Hudson 's Bay Company . The vigorous action of the united interests soon told upon the trade and discipline of the vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to tea and water in place of rum and brandy ; and peace was restored , everywhere , between the white man and the red . The epidemics of small pox , which had at times decimated whole tribes of Indians , were got rid of by the introduction of vaccination . Settlement , if only on a small scale , was encouraged by the security of life and property . The enlargement of their action , as issuers of notes and as bankers aided the trade and the colonists ; and so good was a Hudson 's Bay Company 's note that it was taken everywhere over the northern continent , when the " Shin Plasters " of banks in the United States and Canada were refused . When , for a short time , in 1865 and 1866 , I held the office of shareholders ' auditor of the Hudson 's Bay Company , I cancelled many of these notes , which had become defaced , mainly owing to the fingering of Indians and others , who left behind on the thick yellow paper coatings of " Pemmican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buffalo , done up in skins like sausages  --  a food eminently nutritious and lasting long , but fearfully odorous and nasty . Mr. Ellice supplied much of the political energy inside the old Reform party , displayed in the Reform Bill struggle of 1830-1832 . He became one of the Secretaries of the Treasury ; and , in 1831 , had to organize the eventful election of that year . His great powers and never-failing energy , devoted in early life to the fur trade and its conflicts , became of infinite value to the country , in many momentous struggles , at home , for liberty and progress . It amused me much when , by chance , meeting Mr. Ellice , after we had bought and paid for his Hudson 's Bay property , to see the kind of astonished stare with which he regarded me . I think the purchase of the Hudson 's Bay Company was a mystery to him . I remember meeting him at the Royal Academy a few months before his death . He stopped opposite to me , as if to study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor did I. He seemed in a state of abstraction , like that of a man endeavouring to recollect a long history of difficulty , and to realize how strangely it had all ended ,  --  by the negociation I had brought to a head . CHAPTER X. The Select Committee , on Hudson 's Bay Affairs , of 1857 . This Committee was appointed " to consider the state of those British possessions in North America which are under the administration of the Hudson 's Bay Company , or over which they possess a licence to trade . " Lord John Russell , Mr. Gladstone , the present Lord Derby , Mr. Roebuck , Mr. Labouchere , Mr. Lowe , and Mr. Edward Ellice , were of the nineteen members of which the Committee originally consisted . Later on , the names of Mr. Alexander Matheson and Viscount Goderich were substituted for those of Mr. Adderley and Mr. Bell ; and Mr. Christy was added to the Committee . The evidence before the Committee much resembled that taken by the Committee of 1749 . There were the same disaffected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rivals ; the same desire , in varied quarters , as before , to depreciate and despoil a somewhat prosperous undertaking . The rival views were those of the majority of the Committee , on the one hand , and of Mr. Gladstone , on the other . The claims of Canada to annex territory useful , in her opinion , to her inhabitants , was solidly urged . But the Honorable John Ross , then President of the Grand Trunk Railway of Canada , who was the first witness examined , said , " It is complained that the Hudson 's Bay Company occupy that territory and prevent the extension of settlement and civilization in that part of the Continent of America . I do not think they ought to be permitted to do that ; but I think it would be a very great calamity if their control and power in that part of America were entirely to cease . My reason for forming that opinion is this : during all the time that I have been able to observe their proceedings there , there has been peace within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have been carried on , at all events , in such a way as to prevent the Indian tribes within their borders from molesting the Canadian frontier ; while , on the other hand , those who have turned their attention to that quarter of the world must have seen that , from Oregon to Florida , for these last thirty years or more , there has been a constant Indian war going on between the natives of American territory , on the one side , and the Indian tribes on the other . Now , I fear very much that if the occupation of the Hudson 's Bay Company , in what is called the Hudson 's Bay territory , were to cease , our fate in Canada might be just as it is with Americans in the border settlements of their territory . " Mr. Ross advocated a railway to the Pacific , and he showed good practical reasons for it . Failing a railway , he claimed a " good , broad open road . " On the question of renewed competition in the fur trade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Toronto very anxious to get up a second North-West Company , and I dare say it would result in something like the same difficulties which the last North-West Company created . I should be sorry to see them succeed . I think it would do a great deal of harm , creating further difficulties in Canada , which I do not desire to see created . " " Certain gentlemen at Toronto " have ever been ready to despoil any old and successful undertaking . Mr. Gladstone 's resolutions , as proposed at the end of the evidence , were negatived by the casting vote of the chairman , Mr. Labouchere , the numbers being 7 and 7 . Mr. Gladstone proposed that the country capable of colonization should be withdrawn from the jurisdiction of the Hudson 's Bay Company ; while the country incapable of colonization should remain under that jurisdiction . And , having thus disposed of any chartered , or other , rights of the Company , his last , or 10th , resolution , said , " That inasmuch as the Company has tendered concessions which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Committee has come to no decision upon the question how far it may be , as some think , just and even necessary , or on the other hand , unwise or even unjust , to raise any judicial issue with the view of ascertaining the legal rights of the Company . " The Committee 's report recommended that the Red River and Saskatchewan districts of the Hudson 's Bay Company might be " ceded to Canada on equitable principles , " the details being left to her Majesty 's Government . The Committee advised the termination of the government of Vancouver 's Island by the Hudson 's Bay Company ; a recommendation followed , a year later , by the establishment of a Crown Colony . But they strongly advised , in the interests of law and order , and of the Indian population , as well as for the preservation of the fur trade , that the Hudson 's Bay Company " should continue to enjoy the privileges of exclusive trade which they now possess . " CHAPTER XI . Re-organization of Hudson 's Bay Company . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and investigation  - -  a grave game of chess with the Hudson 's Bay Company  --  many anxieties and a great pecuniary risk , surmounted without the expected help of our Government , the battle was won . What now remained was to take care that the Imperial objects , for which some of us had struggled , were not sacrificed , to indifference in high places at home , or to possible conflicts between the two Provinces in Canada ; and to secure an energetic management of the business of the fur trade and of land development by the executive of the Company , whose 144 posts covered the continent from Labrador to Sitka , Vancouver 's Island , and San Francisco . It seemed to me that this latter business was of vital and pressing importance . The Hudson 's Bay factors , and traders were , in various grades and degrees , partners in the annual trade or " outfit , " under the provisions of the " deed poll . " This " deed poll " was the charter under which the hardy officials worked and saved . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the date of the Royal concession , in the twenty-second year of the reign of Charles the Second . The deed poll in existence in 1863 provided that the profits of the fur trade ( less interest on capital employed in the trade , which belonged to the stockholders who provided it ) were to be divided into 100 parts , of which 60 parts belonged to the stockholders , and 40 to the " wintering partners . " The " wintering partners " were the " chief factors " and the " chief traders . " These 40 parts were again subdivided into 85 shares ; and each " chief factor " was entitled to two of such shares , and each " chief trader " to one share . The clerks were paid by salary , and only a person who had served as a clerk could be promoted to a " chief tradership , " and only a " chief trader " to a " chief factorship . " Thus all had a direct or remote partnership interest . On retirement , an officer held his full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeeding six years . I had much apprehension that if the unexpected sale and transfer of the share property , under terms and conditions in every sense unique , were not frankly and explicitly explained , and under authority , alarm and misconception would arise ; while the news of the transfer would find its way to distant regions in a distorted fashion , and through unfriendly sources , long before the explanation and answer could arrive . My fear , owing to bad management in London , was somewhat realized , and I found that I had not rushed across the Atlantic , to perform every service in my power to the undertaking , in June , 1863 , one moment too soon . Then , having studied the " deed poll , " I felt that , unless we made the factors and traders partners in the whole enterprise  --  fur trade , banking , telegraphs , lands , navigation of rivers  --  on generous terms , we could not expect to elicit either their energies or their adhesion to a new order of things . Further , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fertile belt , and all around it , except by the construction , to begin with , of a main line of telegraph from St. Paul to the Hudson 's Bay territory , and thence by Fort Garry to the extreme western post on the east side of the Rocky Mountains . Such main line to be supplemented by other subsidiary lines as rapidly as possible . The " wire , " to my mind , was the best " master 's eye " under the circumstances . But , apart from business re-organization , it was most essential to explain everything to the Government of Canada ; and to ascertain the views of political parties , and of industrial interests , as , also , of religious bodies , as to future government . In dealing with these questions , I had to assume an authority which was to have been confided to a delegation , to consist of Captain Henry Glyn , Colonel Synge , and myself . On leaving England promptly  --  the main work being done  --  Mr. Richard Potter undertook for me all the details which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he especially took up the discussions at the Colonial Office , which I had personally carried on , with the Duke , for the previous period . Thus it was that the new Board was constituted , and the arrangements for taking over were made in England without my taking any , further , part . Sir Edmund Head was appointed Governor at the suggestion  --  almost the personal request  --  of the Duke of Newcastle : some members of the old Board were retained for the , expected , value of their experience , and amongst the new members were Mr. Richard Potter and Sir Curtis Miranda Lampson , a rival fur trader of eminence and knowledge , and an American . A seat at the Board was left vacant for me . It may be interesting here to quote what the Duke of Newcastle said , in explaining , in the House of Lords , the recent transactions with the Hudson 's Bay Company . TIMES , July 3 , 1863 . HOUSE OF LORDS . " The DUKE OF NEWCASTLE , in moving the second reading of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give some further information as to an extension of the means of communication across that great interval of country between British Columbia and Canada . After referring to the system of government which then existed both in Vancouver 's Island and British Columbia , and to the revenues of both colonies for the previous few years  --  that of British Columbia being most remarkable , having nearly doubled itself in two years ( the imports in 1861 being $1,400,000 , and in 1862 $2,200,000 )  --  the noble Duke proceeded to say , that the greatest impediment to the future prosperity of the Colony was a want of communication with the outer world . He had stated on a previous occasion that he hoped to be able to state this year to the House that arrangements had been made to complete the communications between the Colony and the east of British North America , and he thought he could now inform their Lordships that such arrangements would be carried out . He had desired a gentleman of great experience , knowledge , and energy , who was constantly travelling between Canada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible to effect a communication across the Continent . This gentleman  --  Mr. Watkin  --  had returned with considerable information , and he had suggested to him to place himself in communication with persons in the commercial world who might be willing to undertake the carrying out of such a communication . He had put himself in communication with Mr. Baring and others , and he believed they had arrived at the conclusion that if arrangements could be made with the Hudson Bay Company the undertaking should have their best attention . In order that these important communications might be made certain , guarantees were to be given by Canada on the one hand , and British Columbia and Vancouver Island on the other . A complete Intercolonial railway system had long been looked forward to by those interested in our North American Provinces , and it would be impossible to overrate the importance to this country of an inter-oceanic railway between the Atlantic and Pacific . By such a communication , and the electric telegraph , so great a revolution would be effected in the commerce of the world as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Good Hope . It was unnecessary to point out to their Lordships of what importance it would be in the case of war on the other side of the Atlantic . There was another matter on which he wished to say a few words . Some eight or nine days ago it was stated in a portion of the press that the Hudson Bay Company had sold their property . That statement was not altogether accurate , and certainly it was premature , for he had been informed within two hours before he came down to the House that the whole arrangement had only been completed that afternoon . He had not received any official communication on the subject , but some of the gentlemen concerned had been kind enough to inform him of the facts . He had stated on a former occasion that the Hudson Bay Company had wished to sell . Certain parties in the City had , in the first instance , entered into communication with them for the purpose either of purchasing or obtaining permission for a transit through the Company 's possessions . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed upon . That conclusion having been arrived at he did not know what it was that raised the whole question of sale again , but some fortnight or three weeks ago fresh negociations were opened . Parties in the City proposed to the Hudson Bay Company to give them by way of purchase a sum of 1,500,000l . What had taken place was this : The Hudson Bay Company very prudently required that the money should be paid down , and that the whole sum of 1,500,000l. should be ready on a given day , which he believed was yesterday . Of course the intending purchasers could not carry out that transaction in the course of a week , and they , therefore , applied to the International Financial Association to assist them . The Association agreed to do so , and the money either had been paid or would be on a day arranged upon . A prospectus would be issued tomorrow morning , and the shares would be thrown upon the market , to be taken up in the ordinary way upon the formation of companies . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but would pass to the Proprietors , as if they had bought their shares direct from the Hudson Bay Company . Of course the Company would only enjoy the rights which those shares carried , and no more . They would , in fact , be a continuation of the Company ; but their efforts would be directed to the promotion of the settlement of the country : the development of the postal and transit communication being one of the objects to which they would apply themselves . Of course , the old Governor and his colleagues , having sold their shares , ceased to be the governing body , and a new council , consisting of most respectable persons , had been formed that afternoon . Among them were two of the Committee of the old Company , with one of whom , Mr. Colville , he had had much personal communication , and could speak in the highest terms as a man of business and good sense . There were , also , seven or eight most influential and responsible people , and the name of the Governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would be a guarantee of the intentions of the new Company , for no one would believe that he had entered into this undertaking for mere speculative purposes , or that the Company would be conducted solely with a view to screw the last penny out of this territory . While the council , as practical men of business , would be bound to promote the prosperity of their shareholders , he was sure they would be actuated by statesmanlike views . No negociation with the Colonial Office had taken place ; and as this was a mere ordinary transfer , no leave on their part was necessary . But arrangements must be entered into with the Colonial Office for the settlement of the country ; and at some future time it would be , no doubt , his duty to inform their Lordships what these arrangements were . " The Prospectus , as issued in London , for the new organization , at the end of June , 1863 , contained this paragraph :  --  " With the view of providing the means of telegraphic and postal communication between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and thereby of connecting the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans by an exclusively British route , negociations have been pending for some time past between certain parties and Her Majesty 's Government and the representatives of the Government of Canada , and preliminary arrangements for the accomplishment of these objects have been made through Her Majesty 's Government ( subject to the final sanction of the Colonies ) , based upon a 5 per cent . guarantee from the Governments of Canada , British Columbia , and Vancouver Island . In further aid of these Imperial objects , Her Majesty 's Government have signified their intention to make grants of land in portions of the Crown territory traversed by the proposed telegraphic line . " One of the first objects of the Company will be to examine the facilities and consider the best means for carrying out this most important work ; and there can be little doubt that it will be successfully executed either by the Hudson 's Bay Company itself , or with their aid and sanction . " For this , as well as for the other proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canada , will be commissioned , with other gentlemen specially qualified for the duty , to visit the Red River and southern districts , to consult the officers of the Company there , and to report as to the best and safest means of giving effect to the contemplated operations . " A letter of instructions , from the new Governor , dated London , 6th July , 1863 , received by me about the 22nd July , after I had made no small advance in the real business , stated :  --  " SIR , " I am authorized by the Committee of the Hudson 's Bay Company to request you to proceed on their behalf to the Red River Settlement , for the purpose of reporting to them on the state and condition of this Settlement , the condition of the adjoining territory , the prospect of settlement therein , and the possibility of commencing operations for an electric telegraph line across the southern district of Rupert 's Land . " The Committee have full confidence in your discretion and judgment , but they have deemed it right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Red River Settlement , with whom they request you to communicate at once . " The Committee are aware that it is now so late in the season as to preclude you from doing more than procure such information as may enable them to commence fresh inquiries at the opening of next season . " I have the honour to be , Sir , " Your obedient Servant , " EDMUND HEAD , Governor . " EDWARD WATKIN , Esq . " I found soon after my arrival in Canada that Governor Dallas was coming down from Red River , and would meet me at Montreal . He was a very able man ; cool , clear , cautious , but when once he had had time to calculate all the consequences , firm and decided . He had been for years on the Pacific coast ; and , thanks to his prudence , the landing , in 1859 , of General Harney , and a detachment of United States troops on the Island of St. Juan , between Vancouver 's Island and the mainland , on the Pacific , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a joint occupation until negotiations had settled the question of right . This right was , afterwards , given away by our Government under the form of an arbitration before the Emperor of Germany . Governor Dallas ' opinion of the transaction will be gathered from his letters to me of the 29th and 30th October , 1872 , hereafter copied . The Governor and I became fast friends , and our friendship , cordial on both sides , continued until his death , a very few years ago . The only fault of Governor Dallas was a want of self-assertion . Brought out by the Mathesons  --  hardy Scots of the North  --  as he was , he made a reasonable fortune in China : and coming home , intending to retire , he was persuaded to accept the Governorship of the Hudson 's Bay Company on the death of Sir George Simpson . Meeting at Montreal , our first act of " business " was to voyage in the Governor 's canoe from Lachine through the rapids to Montreal ; a voyage , to me , as almost a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather startling adventure ; but the eleven stalwart Indians , almost all six feet high , who manned the boat , made the trip interesting , as it was to me in the nature of a new experience . These men had been with Governor Dallas nearly 4,000 miles by river , lake , and portage ; and he told me he never knew them to be late , however early the start had to be made ; never unready ; always cheerful and obliging ; and that a cross word had never , in his hearing , been uttered by any one of them . These men made Caughna Wauga , opposite Lachine , their home , and there were their families . After the most careful study and discussion of the questions above alluded to , and others , the discussion extending over a month , we agreed to various memoranda . The one affecting the re-organization of management was as follows :  --  " The first measure necessary towards the re-organization of the Hudson 's Bay service , will be the abolition , or modification of the deed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried on . The difficulty involved in this proceeding is , an interference in the vested rights of the wintering partners ( chief factors and chief traders ) . That might be overcome by some equitable scheme for the extinction of those rights , which would serve the double purpose of rendering practicable a reorganization of the service , and a reduction in the number of superior officers , at present too large . This reduction would give the opportunity of dispensing with such men as are inefficient , and of retaining those only likely to be useful . The Company are under no covenants in reference to the clerks . " The arrangements of the deed poll are , in outline , as follows :  --  The profits of the fur trade ( less the interest charge , which goes exclusively to the stockholders ) are divided into one hundred parts ; of those , sixty are appropriated to the stockholders , and forty to the wintering partners . These last are subdivided into eighty-five shares , of which two are held by each chief factor , and one by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only a clerk can be promoted to a chief tradership ( 1-1/85 share ) , and only a trader to a chief factorship ( 2-1/85 shares ) . The promotions are made by the Company on the nomination of the chief factors , though this rule has not always been adhered to . On retirement an officer holds his full interest for the first year , and half this interest for the succeeding six years . The deed poll authorizes the Company to put an officer on the retired list , without reasons assigned , after he has served four years , but they can not deprive him of his retired interest except for proved misconduct ; but neither of these regulations has ever been put in force . It is possible the wintering partners might raise a question whether , under the existing deed poll , the Company could make any great changes in their business , or embark in new undertakings , if likely to affect injuriously the incomes of the officers on the active list , or the interests of those on retirement . " One mode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a retired interest , and to give a money compensation to each officer on his entering into an agreement to consent to the abrogation of the deed poll . This would involve an outlay of money , but would also be productive of a considerable subsequent annual saving . " The eighty-five shares belonging to the wintering partners are , at this date , held as follows :  --  15 chief factors 30 shares 37 " traders 37 " 10 retired chief factors 13 " 10 " " traders 5 "  --  - 85 " === " As regards the shares held on retirement , some of the interests have nearly run out , and none of the parties have any voice in the business . " The value of a 1-85th share has been , on the average of the last thirteen outfits , which have been wound up ( 1846-1858 ) , about 408l . At that rate a chief factor 's retired interest would amount to 3,264l. , and a chief trader 's to 1,632l. , less discount , supposing payment to be made at once , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the other hand , the invariable custom of the service has been to allow every officer one or more year 's furlough on retiring , which has come to be considered almost a right ; when more than one year has been granted , it has been by special favour . Adding one year 's furlough , a factor 's retired allowance would be 4,080l. , and a trader 's 2,040l . The discount being taken off , to render them equal to cash , would make a factor 's allowance about 3,000l. , and a trader 's 1,500l . " The cost of commutation , on the above scale , would be  --  15 chief factors , at 3,000l L45,000 37 " traders , at 1,500l 55,500 18 shares held on retirement , about 14,000  --   --   --   - -  L114,500 ======== " Without allowing a year 's furlough , the above amount would be reduced about one-sixth . " The outlay would only be called for in the case of such officers as are already retired , and of such as under a new agreement might not be re-engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a new engagement would be provided for in the revised deed poll . " As a set-off for the outlay on commutations would be a large reduction in the pay of officers , to be hereafter noticed , and the Company would also receive actual value for their money ; and on buying out the wintering partners they would become possessed of their 4/10th share of the profits of the trade . " Under the present organization the pay of officers in the service is about as follows :  --  Governor-in-Chief L 2,000 16 chief factors 12,000 35 chief traders 14,000 Clerks , about 10,000  --   --   --  - L38,000 ======= " The following would probably prove a more efficient staff :  --  Governor-in-Chief L 2,000 Lieutenant-Governor 1,250 4 councillors , at 800l 3,200 25 chief traders , at 300l 7,500 100 clerks , at various salaries , about 10,000  --   --   --  - L23,950 ======= " The saving of 14,000l. per annum would soon reimburse the Company 's outlay in buying up the present interests of the factors and traders . " The system of making the pay of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success of the business , has worked well , and might be advantageously continued , in a modified form , to be hereafter noticed . " The duties of the officers of the proposed reduced staff would be adapted to the existing distribution of the territory into departments and districts , which are as follows :  --  " There are four main divisions  --  the Northern , Southern , Western , and Montreal Departments , roughly bounded as follows :  --  the ' Western ' embraces all the country west of the Rocky Mountains ; the ' Northern ' is composed of the country east of the mountains , as far as Lake Winnipeg and Lac la Pluie , and from the American frontier to the Arctic Sea ; the ' Southern ' embraces the southern and eastern shores of Hudson 's Bay ; and the ' Montreal ' extends from Lake Superior down the Gulf of St. Lawrence to Labrador . These departments are divided into districts , and in each district are several posts . The limits of districts are fixed by local peculiarities ; but commonly embrace some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  such , for example , as the McKenzie and the Saskatchewan . There are twenty-three districts on the east side of the mountains ; to the west such subdivision of the business is now scarcely practicable , and is being abandoned . To proceed to the duties of the officers . " The Governor-in-Chief would fulfil his present large functions , and be the medium of communication between the Company and their officers in the country . " Under the present system the Governor is supposed to maintain a personal supervision of the whole service . This is practically impossible , the country being too large to enable him to travel over more than a limited section of it in each season . To relieve him of that heavy duty , and at the same time to maintain a real and close personal inspection , one of the four councillors might be stationed in each department , of which , in the absence of the Governor , he would be the chief officer , and held responsible for all local details , and the various posts in which he should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in each year , a meeting of the Governor and the four councillors should be held , at any time or place most convenient  --  say , Fort Garry , Montreal , or elsewhere . Aided by such a council , the Governor would be accurately informed as to details in every part of the country , and able to deal satisfactorily with all local questions . " The duty of the Lieutenant-Governor would be to relieve the Governor-in-Chief of some share of his labours , and to act in his absence as President of Council . " The chief traders would , as a general rule , be placed at the head of districts , and the clerks in charge of posts . " The very efficient class of officers known as ' postmasters ' would remain as at present . They are usually men who have risen from the ranks from merit ; and , being good interpreters , and Indian traders , are commonly placed in charge of small posts . Their scale of pay is rather less than that of clerks , and they are rarely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is satisfied when they are made postmasters . " Reverting to the mode of paying officers , and making their incomes to some extent dependent on the success of the business , it might answer to give them an interest as stockholders . Instead of paying a chief trader 300l. per annum , he might have 250l. , and a sum of 1,000l. of stock placed to his credit , of which he would receive the dividends only , the stock itself reverting to the Company when his connection with them terminated . " A councillor might have 700l. pay and the dividends on 2,000l. stock . It would also be a great encouragement to the officers , and secure prolonged service , to give them an annual increase of stock  --  say , 200l. to be added for every year 's service . Thus , if a man did not get as early promotion as he expected , he would still benefit by length of service . " The principle of retired interests might be maintained , by allowing the officers to receive the dividends on the stock they held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before it reverted to the Company . " To carry out these arrangements , it would be necessary to set aside in trust about 150,000l. stock . But the Company would lose nothing by it , as they would save in salaries what they gave in dividends . " At the outset only 35,000l. of the stock would be called for , with an increase of 5,400l. per annum . Even allowing for a considerable retired list , it is doubtful if the whole 150,000l. would ever be appropriated ; and of course the dividends on whatever portion was not appropriated would revert to the Company . " In the revision of the deed poll , it would be essential to retain the clauses which secure to the Company the right to place officers on the retired list , and to dismiss them for misconduct . " The mode of keeping the accounts , both in London and in the country , is one of much importance , requiring early consideration . At present there are no accounts , properly speaking , kept at the posts ; and very great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London . It is essential to introduce some system of analysed post accounts , which should keep the Governor and his Council fully informed of the state of the business at every post , and by which they might judge of the management of the officers in charge . There is now no practical check on extravagance or dishonesty , except that arising from the upright principles of the officers in the service . The adoption of a system of local audit appears the best remedy for many of the existing evils . " The Company 's agent at New York ( Mr. Wm . McNaughton ) , who is a valuable officer , has not at present sufficient employment to make his position worth occupying . As there is a valuable market in New York to which it would , at certain times , be advantageous to send buffalo robes , wolves ' and some other furs , which could be done without interference with the market in England , it is important to render the New York agency more efficient . " ( Signed ) A. G. DALLAS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ August , 1863 . " This memorandum was sent home to Governor Sir Edmund Head , with other papers . On the serious questions of the future relations of the vast territory to Canada and the Mother Country ; how it could best be settled ; how it should be governed ; what arrangement as to boundaries , and so on  --  I had many and serious conferences with public men . And in answer to many questions as to my own views , I drew up the following memorandum , as a resume of the whole subject . It is now nearly twenty-four years old . I have read it again and again . I am not ashamed of it . I see nothing to retract ; little to alter :  --  " The present state of government in the Red River Settlement is attributable alike to the habitual attempt , encouraged , perhaps very naturally , in England and in Canada , to discredit the traditions , and question the title of the Hudson 's Bay Company , and to the false economy which has stripped the Governor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resort , to support the decisions of the legal tribunals . No other organized Government of white men in the world , since William Penn , has endeavoured to rule any population , still less a promiscuous people composed of whites , half-breeds . Indians , and borderers , without a soldiery of some sort , and the inevitable result of the experiment has , in this case , been an unpunished case of prison-breaking , not sympathised in , it is true , by the majority of the settlers , but still tending to bring law and government into contempt , and greatly to discourage the governing body held responsible for keeping order in the territory . " At the same time it must be conceded , that , while government by a merchant organization has eminently succeeded , up to an obvious point of time and circumstances , in the cases both of the East India and Hudson 's Bay Companies , and is still applicable to the control and management of distant districts , it contains within itself the seeds of its own ultimate dissolution . In fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dividend to stockholders , is opposed to the high impartiality and absence of individualism which should characterize a true Government . Individuals and corporations may trade and grow rich ,  --  Government may not ; they may embark in constant speculation , while it can not ; they must either insensibly measure their dealings by consequences , as affecting gain , or be suspected of doing so , while the interest of Government is not individual , but collective ; its duty being , to give facility to the acquirer , security to the possessor , and justice and equal protection to all . " Therefore , although the Government of Red River has had few faults and many excellences , and has been marked by a generous policy , in many instances it has been , and is , open to suspicion ; because the commercial power which buys furs , trades with Indians and whites alike , and is , in fact , the great merchant , storekeeper , and forwarder of the country ; appoints a Governor and assistants , places judges upon the bench , selects magistrates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rivals and trade competitors . Such a state of things is unsound in principle , and ought only to be continued until a stronger and permanent Government can be organized ; at the same time it can only be continued in safety , on the opening up of the country , by arming the Governor with a military force of reasonable amount . " That the Hudson 's Bay Company can govern the country efficiently , on this obvious condition of all other Governments , is clear enough ; and the peaceable relations between the Indians and the whites , and between the various tribes themselves , throughout the whole of this enormous territory , as well as the general state of health and occupation of the aborigines , prove how perfect and wise has been the management of the country . But government of Indians , who can be employed and traded with , and who at last become more or less dependent upon the Company 's organization , as in this case , is one thing ,  - -  government of a large and expanding colony of free white men is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government of the Indians can or ought to be changed , for a long period to come , so completely is the Indian life now associated with the operations of the Company . Of course , the settlement of a new or an extended colony , involves the extinguishment of Indian rights within the area proposed ; and while the outside district not set apart , would still be roamed over by the Indians , and be valuable for the fur trade , its limits must , from time to time , be narrowed by further additions to the circle of civilization and free government . Thus , the Hudson 's Bay Company , if dispossessed of the government of Red River , and the proposed new Colony , would still manage and govern where it traded , and would still preserve sobriety , order , and peace amongst the Indian tribes of its territory thus limited . " It may happen that the Hudson 's Bay Company may be compelled to govern everywhere , by the refusal of the Home or Canadian Government to encounter the responsibility and expense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as regards cost , must be greater in their hands than in those of a Company using portions , of its business organization for purposes of administration . It is well to look these probabilities fairly in the face . " Such a necessity may arise from the indisposition of certain schools of politicians at home to incur Colonial expense , and the responsibility of defending a new nation flanking the United States ; it may happen , owing to the refusal of Lower Canada to widen out the borders , and thus increase the political power of Upper Canada ; or it may be objected in Canada generally , that the finances of the country will not , at present , prudently authorize the maintenance of a new Canadian military force ; and again , the Indian war in Minnesota , which may spread itself , may raise up fears of Indian wars in the new country to be settled . " Should the Hudson 's Bay Company be compelled , then , to continue to govern the whole territory , the first essential , as before said , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular troops , partly of mounted irregulars or militia , and it need not , in their hands , be large . The next essential would be a convention and treaty with the United States , as to boundary and transit through the United States and Hudson 's Bay territory respectively , for purposes of travel , and commerce , and of postage , and the telegraph . " Then the limits of colonization must be defined , and it must be maturely considered at the outset , and decided as to how far , and in what form , and how soon , the principle of self-government shall be introduced . It is assumed that a thriving and expanding colony of white men neither can nor ought to be taxed and governed without their own consent , obtained in some form or other ; and that it would be both unwise and unjust to attempt a permanently autocratic government . This is a most serious question , and the Act 31st George III. , under which Canada was governed until 1841 , would appear to solve the difficulty . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as the new Colony had a population of ( say ) 50,000 , and its provisions might be elaborated into a constitution , to be voted by the Colony in general assembly , so soon as the population reached ( say ) 300,000 . " The grand basis of all successful settlement  --  the land  --  presents fewer difficulties than might have been imagined , because the admirable model of the land system of the United States is before us , and no better can be devised to enable a country to grow up side by side with the Republic . Reliable surveys and plans , cheap and unclogged titles to the land in fee , a limited upset price of not exceeding $1-25/100 an acre ; division of the land saleable into regular sections ; the issue of land warrants and regulations as to location , which will prevent , as far as may be , monopolies of land in the hands of speculators  --  are all essential conditions , and whatever power governs , they must be equally observed . " Again ,  --  reserves of land , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools and churches , and to assist roads and other public works conducted by the Government . " But let it be hoped that this necessity of continued government by the Hudson 's Bay Company may be avoided by the wise and far-sighted action of the Home Government and of Canada . No beneficial decision can be arrived at without the concurrence of both powers , for each have rights and ideas in some respects differing , and Canada especially has the deepest concern in the future organization of the North-west . In selecting a governing power for such a country , the strength and influence of that power are the grand essentials . Even with equal enlightenment , these essentials could not be overlooked . A weak Government would invite attack , deter investment , and check general confidence . " Apart from the government by the Hudson 's Bay Company , there appear to be these alternatives :  --  " 1 . Government by Canada annexing to her territory a tract of country extending to the limits of British Columbia , under some reasonable arrangement with the Hudson 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which arrangement ought not to be difficult to draw out , when once the principle of the settlement of the country , and the land system , and extent of land reserves , are agreed upon . " 2 . Government by the Crown , as a separate Crown Colony , totally independent of Canada . " 3 . Government by the Crown as a separate Crown Colony , with federation , more or less extensive , with Canada , and the establishment of a customs union between the new and old communities . " It must always be observed that a decision as to the fate of this territory must be immediately made . It can not wait political necessities elsewhere , or be postponed to suit individual wishes . The fertile country between Lake Winnipeg and the Rocky Mountains will be now settled , since that is now a fixed policy , and its plan of government must be in advance of , and not lag behind , that settlement . The electric wire , the letter post , and the steamboat , which two years more will see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and as Minnesota has now 250,000 inhabitants , where , in 1850 there was hardly a white man , so this vast district may , when once it can be communicated with from without , with reasonable facility , be flooded with emigrants , not forgetting a very probable rush of English , Irish , and Scotch farmers , and settlers from the United States , who here will find a refuge from conscription and civil war . " The discoveries of gold , and the disturbed state of the border Indians in Minnesota , are both unanswerable reasons of necessity for the immediate establishment of a permanent form of Government , and fixed laws and arrangements for the settlement and development of the country . " 1 . The government of the North-west , as an ' annexe ' to Canada , possesses advantages of contiguity and similarity of ideas on the part of Canadians and the probable settlers . Canada , it will be said , has a good and responsible Government , and why not now extend its machinery to the 1,300 miles between the height of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept the expense and responsibility , and , more especially , is it just now politically possible ? Were Canada politically and practically one united country , the answer would be perhaps not difficult . But Canada , for the present , is really two countries , or two halves of one country , united under the same form of government , each half jealous of the mutual balance , and neither half disposed to aggrandize the power or exaggerate the size of the other . " Would Lower Canada , then , submit to see Upper Canada become , at one bound , so immensely her superior ? And would Upper Canadian statesmen , however personally anxious to absorb the North-west , risk the consequences of such a discussion as would arise ? Would it be possible , in fact , to found a Government based upon the platform of accepting the responsibility of settling , defending , and governing the North-west ? If not , then , however desirable , the next best alternative must be chosen . " Assuming that at some period , near or distant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pacific , unite in a federal or legislative union , and thus become too great and too strong for attack , that next best alternative would point to such arrangements , as respects the North-west , as would lead on to and promote this union , and not stand in its way . Thus , disputes about race and customs should , if possible , be avoided by anticipation , and the constitution and power of the new Colony should foreshadow its connection with the countries to the east and to the west . Future isolation should be forbidden , while present independence should be accorded . " 2 . The above assumption tends to throw doubt upon the desirability of establishing a Crown Colony , separate in all respects from Canada , and able to shut out or let in Canadian produce and manufactures at its pleasure . This is a danger to be foreseen and avoided . " The new Colony , placed between Canada and the Pacific , must be essentially British , in the sense of its forming one secure link in a chain of British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had better never be organized . The power and prestige of the Crown is essential to this end , and a separate Colony , even , would have many advantages per se . It would also save Canada the cost of a new Government at a time when financial pressure and political majorities would be in the way . A Crown Colony could not be looked upon with jealousy in Canada , while government by the Hudson 's Bay Company would be so regarded . " 3 . But a Crown Colony with such a federation as would not alter the political balance of Upper and Lower Canada , and with a system of free trade with Canada , would appear to solve the whole difficulty ; and if so , the scope of the federative principle would be matter to be settled between Canadian statesmen and the Colonial Office . The interchange between the North-west and Canada appears to be an absolute necessity in the interest of the latter . As Government , however , would require taxation , the new Colony must , in all probability , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Custom-house of Canada would not serve , as far as the eastern frontier is concerned , for the new Colony . If so , why should not duties , on a scale to be agreed upon under constitutional powers to agree , be levied on imported foreign goods , by Canada , and the duties be divided between the two powers in agreed proportions ? Were this done , at least in the beginning , expense would be saved to the new Colony , a revenue would be easily collected for it , through existing machinery , and Canada would obtain the revenue and trade . Of course the scale of duties must be moderate , so as not to excite dissatisfaction , by establishing dear prices , and it would be the interest of Canada to make them so , for the more she stimulated the growth of the new customer , the better for the trade . On the other hand , the new Colony would be insured a market and an outlet for its own productions , and would be content , therefore , to accept a reasonably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on its articles of foreign consumption . " I discussed the question involved at length with the Honorable George Brown and with his brother Gordon , at Toronto . I felt the importance of having the views , and , if possible , the concurrence of the leader of the " Grit " party . He led me to think that he concurred with me ; and I sent him a copy of this document . He kept it some time , and then re-directed it to me without remark . Afterwards , I received a verbal message to the effect that " It would not do at all . " I became convinced that nothing " would do at all " with a small band of men  --  who , at that time , had objects of their own  --  in Upper Canada .

" My official letter to Sir Edmund Head from Montreal , 24th July , 1863 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MONTREAL , " July 24th , 1863 . " SIR , " I have the honour to acknowledge your official letter of the 6th July , requesting me to proceed to the Red River Settlement , for the purpose of reporting upon the state and condition of that Settlement , of the condition of the adjoining territory , the prospects of settlement therein , and the possibility of commencing operations for an electric telegraph line across the southern district of Rupert 's Land ; and associating with me in this inquiry Governor Dallas , of the Red River Settlement , with whom you request me to communicate at once . " I observe that the Committee consider the lateness of the season will preclude me from doing more than procure such information as will enable them to commence further inquiries at the opening of the next season . " In consequence of verbal communications received before leaving England , and suggestions unofficially received from members of the new Committee , I have deemed it my duty , though unofficially , to communicate with the Canadian Government , and with those gentlemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change of ministry take place on the opening of Parliament , so as , as far as possible ( unauthorized as I was ) , to prevent antagonism to the operations of the new organization pending official communication and explanations from the Governor and Committee . " No one can be better aware of the state and views of parties in Canada than yourself . The leader of the present Government expresses a strong opinion in favour of the settlement of a separate Crown Colony in the Hudson 's Bay district , and this also is the view taken by Mr. Cartier and Mr. J. A. Macdonald , and is strongly concurred in by Mr. Cazeau , the Vicar-General , who , as you are aware , leads the Catholic party in Lower Canada . On the other hand , the feeling of Mr. Geo . Brown and the ' Grits , ' as heretofore expressed , has been in favour of annexing the Hudson 's Bay territory to Canada , thereby securing that preponderance which would practically settle the question of the future government of the whole country . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so far as I understand them , the views of yourself and your colleagues , being in favour of the establishment of a separate colony unconnected with Canada , I consider the discussions which have taken place have now put the question in its right position here ; but at the same time I shall endeavour to see Mr. George Brown , and give such explanations , unofficially , as may at all events prevent his considering that he has not been consulted in this important transaction . " I have also placed myself in communication with many of those who have advocated the settlement of the North-west , including Professor Hind , who has explored much of the district ; and , at my request , Professor Hind has written a memorandum , and letter upon the gold discoveries in the Hudson 's Bay territory , which I now enclose . " I have no doubt that Governor Dallas 's own letters will more than corroborate what is stated in this memorandum , and I need not suggest that the most anxious and immediate attention of yourself and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political and other necessities and consequences . " Having possessed myself of so much information in reference to the subjects referred to Governor Dallas and myself , I think we shall be able to fulfil the wishes of the Governor and Committee , Governor Dallas being here , accompanied by Mr. Hopkins , without the necessity of my proceeding on this occasion to the Red River ; though , should further discussion with the Governor lead to our joint impression that such a visit would be advantageous , I shall not hesitate to undertake the journey . " In advance of some memorandum to be prepared for you by Governor Dallas and myself , and which I shall beg him to be good enough to draft , I would mention that I have suggested that the Governor issue a circular to the employes of the Company , stating briefly the nature of the recent changes of proprietorship in the Company , and thereby having the tendency to remove any misconceptions which might arise , and which , I regret to learn , have in some few quarters appeared amongst the factors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partners in the trade , have considered themselves entitled to be consulted by the late Governor and Council on the subject of the transfer . " Governor Dallas informs me that the outfit of 1862-3 will show very much improved results ; and I have little doubt that the wise and energetic measures which he has initiated since his tenure of office will bring abundant benefits in every direction . The result in the western district , which , if I recollect rightly , exhibited a loss , and which , in the past year , with all exclusive privileges taken away , gives a profit of no less than $166,000 , is a convincing proof of what may be effected by improved business organization and thorough energy and firmness . It has , however , been matter of considerable anxiety to me to learn that it is Governor Dallas 's desire to return to England next year . " As regards the future management of the fur trade , Governor Dallas is of opinion that a considerable reduction may be made in the number of the employes ; and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all large establishments managed from a distance , either were originally , or have become , inefficient , not only will expenses be saved , but a much larger trade be carried on . " In any considerable change of personnel , the partnership rights of the factors will have to be considered ; and one of the gravest and most difficult subjects of consideration will be , how to reconcile the rights of these gentlemen in a share of profit with that reorganization which the commercial interests of the Company evidently require . " These changes can only be made after discussion with the factors and chief officers ; and in some cases it may be desirable to buy out individual interests on a more or less extended scale . " The 40 per cent . of the net profit of the Company allowed to the factors , in addition to the salaries of considerable amount , is a heavy drain , and involves other considerations opposed to rigid discipline , which need not be further touched upon here , but which are sufficiently obvious . This re-organization can only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceptional powers , and without delay . If these powers are given , I am quite confident that the results will be such as abundantly to satisfy the Committee . Hitherto , as it appears to me , far too little discretion has been permitted ; and the practice of sending all the accounts home to England , and dealing with them in such a manner that the Governor could not tell from time to time how the financial results of expenses and profits were progressing , has produced its inevitable consequences . In future , I feel convinced , it will be found matter of the utmost consequence to concentrate the accounts at Fort Garry , and to send copies of the vouchers , journals , and ledgers from Fort Garry to England , instead of adopting the reverse practice , and endeavouring , as hitherto , to make the accounts travel as long a distance and be made up over as remote a time as possible . With proper telegraphic and postal communication between the principal posts of the Company and Fort Garry and Montreal , there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrear in future . " As regards the settlement of the country , and , involved in that important question , the state and prospects of the Red River , the discoveries of gold above alluded to involve very serious considerations . " Assuming a rush of miners to different portions of the territory , the machinery of Government for the preservation of order can not be for a moment neglected , or its construction be delayed . This involves , again , the question of the establishment of a new colony . Is that colony to be governed by the Hudson 's Bay Company , who are essentially a trading and landowning corporation , or is it to be governed in the name of her Majesty , the Hudson 's Bay Company , so far as the limits of the Crown Colony are concerned , becoming merely traders and landowners , and ceasing to govern as at present ? " All the difficulties at Red River  --  which , after all , have been much exaggerated , and can be very easily dealt with  --  would be disposed of at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be sent out ; and it does not follow that representative institutions need at first be granted , though ultimately they would become matter of necessity . The great object of the Governor and Committee  --  and Governor Dallas and myself perfectly agree in the view  --  should be to induce the Colonial Government to found a Crown Colony under arrangement with the Hudson 's Bay Company with the least possible delay . " Such a Government would not only relieve the Hudson 's Bay Company of an immense responsibility , but it would render titles to land sold by them , and claims to interest in the minerals , far more certain , marketable , and profitable than at present . " The commercial re-organization of the Company is a matter perfectly easy in the hands of Governor Dallas , empowered to act in accordance with his own best judgment ; but this question of the government of the country is , after all , the grand difficulty , and , if successfully negociated , the grand hope of success as regards the future settlement of this vast district @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the district west of Fort Garry for eligible settlement , Governor Dallas  --  who has now made journeys of 1,800 miles in the last year  --  has no doubt whatever ; and I trust that the old traditional phantoms of inhospitable deserts will be finally dismissed from the minds of the new Governor and Committee , especially when they have before them the many letters and reports in evidence of the true state of affairs , which must be in possession of the Company in Fenchurch Street . " As regards telegraphic communication , I have made every inquiry necessary upon the subject , and Governor Dallas agrees with my views of the importance of connecting the Hudson 's Bay posts by telegraphic communication . " Subject to further discussion , I may indicate my opinion that the route suggested by Governor Dallas through the Hudson 's Bay territory , viz. , from Jasper House by Edmonton , Carlton , and Fort Pitt to Fort Garry , would be the proper route for a telegraph . " This portion , as it seems to me , should be constructed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Were it to be constructed in Canada , it would not cost more than 15,000l. sterling . It may cost less , though in some cases it may cost more , through your territory ; though I am inclined to think that it may be constructed for 20,000l. as an outside sum , and that it is impossible that the cost of this portion of the work should exceed 30,000l. in any event . " This outlay being sanctioned , the connection with the American telegraph through Minnesota would be a matter of negociation ; and the extension of telegraphic communication to Fort William on the one side , and to Fort Langley on the other , would depend upon the subsidies to be obtained from Canada , and from British Columbia and Vancouver Island . " I have the assurance of the present leader of the Canadian Government , that the offer to give a subsidy , made last year , will be officially renewed , and I shall endeavour to get this promise put into writing , and send it to you home . " British Columbia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but , in any case , we ought not to commit ourselves to a through communication through Canada and British Columbia without a clear understanding as to the subsidies . At the same time , if you , the Hudson 's Bay Company , have command of one thousand miles of telegraph , enabling you to transmit information through your own channels with a new expedition , you will practically have command of the future discussion of this large question . " I have obtained estimates , and made calculations of the cost of these telegraphic operations , and I have selected a very eligible gentleman , Mr. Wood , the Manager of the Montreal Telegraph Company , who , I am quite sure , will carry out the operation , with the assistance of the employes of the Hudson 's Bay Company , and under the orders of Governor Dallas , with perfect success . I should recommend that immediate steps be taken ; and there is no reason , in my opinion , why all the materials should not be on the ground by the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by canoe , and the remainder may be taken across the snow in the winter ; and why may not the whole telegraph from Jasper House to Fort Carry be completed by September in next year ? " The present attitude of the Sioux Indians in the State of Minnesota deserves serious attention . Little Crow has waited upon Governor Dallas , and the Governor has written to General Sibley . " I have suggested whether a visit to Washington would not be desirable , and that the opportunity of assisting the American Government to make peace with these troublesome Indians should be improved , by attempting to get a settlement of your Oregon claims .

" NORFOLK STREET , PARK LANE , " August 26 , 1863 . " MY DEAR SIR , " I have to thank you for sending me copies of the official letter from the Secretary of the 13th instant , in reply to my report and private letter of the 24th July , and of your private notes of the 13th and 18th instant , the latter noticing my letter of the 4th instant . " I desire at once to say that the heads of arrangement which I have written down with the Montreal Telegraph Company and with Mr. Wood , for your consideration , were of course entirely subject to the sanction of the Governor and Committee of the Hudson 's Bay Company . And , in accordance with what I understood to be your views , when to-day you were good enough to leave the Deputy-Governor in order to see me in the board room by appointment , I shall consider it my duty to cancel all that has passed , in such a manner as , I trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will then remain nothing beyond a responsibility for a few essential materials , as to which time was an object , amounting to not more than a few hundred pounds at the utmost , which I shall take entirely upon myself , under the circumstances of doubt and difficulty as to the opinions of the shareholders of the Hudson 's Bay Company which you represented to me . And with a desire to avoid similar complaints , I do not propose to make any charge whatever for my own expenses , or , if I may be excused the word , services , in connection with the mission I have had to undertake . That mission , however , can not go without explanation , for I am anxious to avoid all misconception now , or hereafter , and I desire , therefore , by a frank statement , at once to court contradiction , should it be merited . " Having had much to do with the discussions which led to the transfer of the Hudson 's Bay Company 's property , I had expressed my willingness , inconvenient as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of a proposed commission of three , including Captain Glyn , R.N. , and Captain Synge , R.E. , whose duty would be to investigate the position of the undertaking at its head establishment ,  --  to report upon the re-organization of its business , the development of its mineral resources , the settlement of portions of its territory as a new colony , and the opening up of the country by the telegraph and by means of transit . Captain Glyn and Captain Synge had both been consulted , and the Duke of Newcastle had been applied to to obtain leave for Captain Synge at the War Office . I had been led to believe that my services were considered of some value , and I left England on the 20th June , expecting that Captain Glyn and Captain Synge would follow me in a week , and that we should at once proceed to Red River , and send home a first , but full , report by the beginning of October . I understood also that such a report was desired , to clear away any objections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factiously raised . And when , after my arrival in Canada , I received the prospectus with your name as Governor of the Company at its head , I found a condition of that document to be that I was to examine and report and advise generally , in concert with other gentlemen , specially qualified for the duty , not only upon the question of telegraphic and postal communication , but also as to the other objects proposed in the scheme officially laid before the public . " Before leaving England , I repeatedly pressed the necessity of communicating with the Governor and ' wintering partners ' of the Company in America , so that they should not hear of the transfer of the property for the first time from the newspapers ; and I expected to be specially authorized to give the needful information and assurances . I was no party , I beg to say , to this mention of my name in the prospectus ; but my friends and business connections who may have taken shares on the faith of my name , will naturally hold me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a project which , energetically managed , is so intrinsically sound , I refrained from writing to you to decline the responsibility , hoping that the original plan of delegation , though delayed , would be carried out . That plan , I must observe , involved not a mere commission of engineers to explore the route for a telegraph to Jasper House , as assumed in the Secretary 's letter of the 13th inst. , but far wider objects , the realization of which would , I venture to think , have given satisfaction at home , and have dissipated many misconceptions , now existing , inimical to the interests of the new proprietary . " Your letter to me of the 6th July did not reach me till the 20th , and in the meantime the newspaper notices in England led to many official and unofficial inquiries from me , involving difficulty of answer . I found , in fact , that the staff of the Hudson 's Bay Company was quite at fault , and that public men in Canada misunderstood the objects of the new organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but which  --  except so far as the prospectus authorized me  --  I had no right to supply . " Several of the Hudson 's Bay Company 's chief factors and traders had , it appeared , addressed a memorial to the then Governor and Committee , some months ago , upon the rumoured sale of the property , and had been , as stated to me , informed that no transfer was likely to take place , or would in fact be undertaken without previous consultation ; and yet these gentlemen learnt for the first time from the public papers that new arrangements had been made . It was not unnatural , therefore , considering the relations of these gentlemen with the Company , that they should feel much annoyed ; nor was it , perhaps , surprising that an influential member of the body should have predicted a general resignation of the factors ' from Labrador to Sitka , ' followed by a confederation amongst them , in order to carry on the fur trade in competition with the Hudson 's Bay Company , they possessing , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the capital to do it . ' " The appearance of Mr. Lampson 's name as Deputy-Governor , in the absence of any prior explanation , aggravated the first feeling of distrust ; for it was said that he and his connections had been , and then were , the Company 's great , and often successful , rivals in the fur trade , carrying on a vigorous competition at all accessible points . " The arrival of Governor Dallas at Montreal some days before my receipt of your letter of the 6th July , enabled these misconceptions to be dealt with ; and the issue of a circular by the Governor , together with many personal explanations , and some firmness on the part of Mr. Dallas , will , I trust , very soon remove the want of confidence and dissatisfaction on the part of the staff , which at first looked threatening . These explanations , of course , took time , and rendered the Governor 's presence in Canada necessary . " Governor Dallas and myself made various opportunities of meeting members of the present and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the subject of the North-west , and of its organization and government ; and I feel convinced that these unofficial discussions were of considerable use , and may help to prevent antagonism and territorial claims on the part of Canada , which , in my opinion , might be very embarrassing , and ought to be foreseen and avoided . Possibly the following article in the Government organ , written by order , and handed to me by the Honorable W. P. Howland , will best exhibit , without further troubling you , the friendly spirit of the Canadian Government before I left for England :  --  " ( From the Quebec Mercury . ) " ' The recent announcements concerning the transfer of the title and territory of the Hudson 's Bay Company to a new corporation have naturally awakened considerable interest in Canada . So far , however , no specific intimation of the opinions of the new Company has been given . It is understood that they will not confine themselves to a mere following in the footsteps of their predecessors , but that colonization , telegraphy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of railroad communication , enter into the scheme which , whether as regards the interests at stake or the capital involved , may be said to be colossal in its character . It is no doubt anticipated by the new Company that the Canadian Government and people will cheerfully aid them in an enterprise which evidently concerns us so closely . Speaking in general terms , we presume that it may be conceded that such anticipations have been correctly formed . The development of Canadian territory , or of British territory immediately adjacent to it , could never be a matter of indifference to the Government or people . Though young in years , still Canada can not forego those aspirations regarding the future which are naturally suggested by the magnificent domain which , stretches along the northern portion of the Continent . It is for Canadians to occupy and eventually to govern it , and any means which point to the furtherance of an object which may be called spontaneous in the Canadian mind must engender solicitude and evoke encouragement . " ' When Messrs . Howland and Sicotte were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be willing to aid the " Atlantic and Pacific Transit Company " in their enterprise of opening up communication across the Continent through British territory . Upon their return to this country , the matter was fully discussed , and it was understood , subsequently , that the Government of that day was prepared to recommend an appropriation of $50,000 per annum , provided that the Company gave the necessary assurances of their ability to commence and carry out the work . Since that time , however , those who formed that Association appear to have enlarged the field of their operations , and have included the whole of the Hudson 's Bay Company , with their territory , prestige , and appliances , within the scope of their operations . But the same general policy which suggested the recommendation of the $50,000 referred to , would also prompt similar assistance to the New Hudson 's Bay Company . It can be of little moment to Canada by whose agency the western territory is developed  --  that which is wanted is development . " ' Judging , then , by what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit of progress imposes upon all Governments , it is not improbable when the new Company has itself determined what they will do , in what shape their enterprise will be promoted , that reasonable assistance will be given them . At present , it seems hardly likely that any exact conclusion has been made by themselves in this matter . Mr. Watkin , in whom a wide and just confidence is placed , not only by the shareholders in the new enterprise , but by the British Government itself , is here , engaged , no doubt , in collecting from the various sources within his reach such information as will enable him to report fully upon the matter . That done , the Company will be able to make propositions and to solicit the kindly aid of Canada . Looking at the wide field for enterprise that will be opened up ; at the speedy colonization that is likely to take place , consequent upon the recent discoveries of gold ; at the prospect that Canada may be made the high road for commerce between the great East and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all the various and manifold interests connected with it , will be inspired with new and energetic vitality ,  --  from these and many other considerations it must be evident that the policy for Canada , let her political position as to parties be what it may , is to extend a friendly and greeting hand to those who come with capital and confidence to become the pioneers of a new order of things , which can not fail to pour riches into the lap of Canada , and to lay the foundation of a prosperity which can be at present but dimly imagined . ' " The importance of assisting the work of opening up the North-west for telegraphic and postal purposes would , I believe , be alluded to in the Governor-General 's speech on the 15th . Footnote : This was done , and the following is an extract from the speech of the Governor-General of Canada , on opening Parliament :  --  " I have received a despatch from the Secretary of State for the Colonies , enclosing copies of a correspondence between Her Majesty 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Transit and Telegraph Company , ' in reference to a proposal made by that Company for the establishment of a telegraphic and postal communication between Lake Superior and New Westminster , in British Columbia . The importance of such an undertaking to the British North American Provinces , both in a commercial and in a military point of view , induces me to commend the subject to your consideration . Copies of the correspondence shall be laid before you , and I feel assured that should any proposal calculated to effect the establishment of such communication on terms advantageous to the province be submitted to you , it will receive encouragement at your hands . " But whatever may be the extent or the value  --  as to which latter point I fear my opinion does not , as I regretted to find , quite coincide with yours  --  of the sympathy and support of Canada , any new bias in favour of your projects , as promised in your prospectus , has been mainly aided by the belief which , entertaining it , I inculcated , that without loss of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merchants , the new Government of the Hudson 's Bay Company would establish , with the aid of the provinces east and west of the Hudson 's Bay territory , but without shirking its own share of duty , telegraphic and postal communication in British interests , available for commercial , and requisite for other and even more serious , purposes . That the works would be begun at once , and that the Hudson 's Bay Company , so long obstructive , would now set an example of despatch , and that that which had long been hoped for and promised by others , would now be accomplished by them as the pioneer works of an early settlement of the cultivatable portions of the country . " It is obvious that , unless materials are supplied and plans arranged before the end of September , the overland operations must wait a year 's time . Therefore , apparently under a misapprehension of your wishes or policy , as our interview of yesterday showed , I looked out for the best practical man I could find fit to undertake the construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and telegraphic service to be worked together . I found that man in Mr. O. S. Wood , an American settled in Canada , the engineer and manager of the 4,000 miles of telegraph owned by the Montreal Telegraph Company , which pays 23 per cent , upon its capital of 100,000l. ; and believing him to be exactly the man for the occasion , I agreed with him , subject to your sanction , to superintend and be responsible for the erection and operation of a telegraph and system of posts between Fort Garry and Jasper House . I do not trouble you with the document , as it is to be cancelled , so far as your Company is concerned ; but I may shortly state that it proposed the completion of the works by October , 1864 , and in addition to a liberal , but not excessive , payment for Mr. O. S. Wood 's work , responsibility , and experience , it awarded a percentage upon all savings on the total sum of L30,000l. , the outside estimate taken for the whole job , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work . These payments were to be so made that the integrity , completeness , and success of the work would be their main condition . " I also made a very important conditional agreement with this Montreal Telegraph Company , under which they were to extend a new and independent , or precautionary , line of telegraph from Halifax ( Nova Scotia ) to Mirimichi and on to Father Point , connecting with the other existing telegraphs up to Arnprior ( Ottawa ) , and another telegraph from Arnprior to the Sault St. Marie , where you have a trading port . On the other hand , subject to the aid of Canada and British Columbia , your Company were to extend , or obtain the extension of , a telegraph from the Sault by Lake Superior to Fort Garry , and another by Jasper House to Fort Langley . All these telegraphs were to be completed by October , 1865 . The Montreal Company were also to obtain the extension of the Minnesota telegraph to your boundary near Pembina , you extending your telegraph to that point . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be completed by October , 1864 , and knowing that this , and the telegraph from Fort Langley to Jasper House , could be finished as easily , a complete and independent Atlantic and Pacific telegraph , stretching for more than 1,000 miles through your territory , might have been secured ,  --  always assuming that this season of 1863 were saved , which was the great practical object before me . I obtained , as a condition , that in dividing the rates paid for messages , your telegraphs should have a bonus of 33 per cent . so long as your capital did not pay a clear 10 per cent . dividend . " To this end , I advised you to confirm the order of 175 tons of charcoal wire and of the insulators , post pins , batteries , and instruments needed for the length between Fort Garry and Jasper House ( the wire from England , and the other material from Canada and the United States ) , at a total cost , already given you in complete detail , estimated , when delivered at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This statement of cost , and a reference to my past statements , will answer the question in Mr. Fraser 's letter of the 13th , as to whether I had calculated the heavy expense of carriage  - -  20l. per ton to Fort Garry . The question shows that it had not been calculated in Fenchurch Street that the poles and timber would be got in the country , and that the whole weight of material to be sent to Fort Garry was about 200 tons at the most . " I may pause , however , in answer to another similar question , about the relative prices of American and English wire , &c.,; to say , that the best market for wire is England ; and the best market for the less important articles is the United States , while the proper prices chargeable for the best article by the best houses are known to all practical men . I may add , as I am asked what is the weight per mile of telegraphic wire , that ' best charcoal No. 9 electric wire ' is 320 lbs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this subject , I may add , that if on further consideration you determine to store the material above named ( cost and carriage 10,000l. ) at Fort Garry , there is yet time to get it out to St. Paul , and some , if not all , may go through to Fort Gany . There is a post three days per week to Fort Garry , and posts go through all parts of your own territory regularly , the ' Winter Express ' leaving Fort Garry on Christmas Day . Though , in my humble opinion , not the best thing , still the transmission and storage of that material would be looked upon as an evidence of your intentions , and would help to keep you right in Canada and in your own territory , as also in British Columbia , and would expedite a final and favourable decision as to the proposed subsidy . So strong is my opinion , that I am ready to join any four or five gentlemen of your Committee feeling an interest in the work , in providing and paying for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once . " It will , I assume , be apparent to you how necessary it is to keep the section of telegraph in your own special district in your own hands . Your organization , also , will enable you to convey and erect material very cheaply . As to all details , I refer to the papers already sent over containing full particulars , and showing quantities , kind , cost , means of conveyance , and , more important than all , character of country and proposed route ; the latter from the personal experience and knowledge of the country of Governor Dallas and Mr. Hopkins , whose reliability and capacity as advisers no one will question . " While in Upper Canada , I received proposals for the establishment of steamers on your rivers and lakes : and no doubt these could be arranged for ; but as the telegraph is to stand over for the present , I do not add to the length of this paper by any statement on this head . " I would call attention , however , to the exploration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the lands adjoining Lakes Huron and Superior . Dr. Hector has surveyed a line of road all the way up to Dog Lake ; and Mr. McDougal , the present Commissioner of Crown Lands , appears ready to recommend the gradual , but rapid , construction of roads throughout this territory , and onwards to that of the Hudson 's Bay Company . Possibly you may consider the suggestion which I made in reference to obtaining an independent outlet to Lake Superior , in the direction of Superior City , as well worthy of consideration . " As respects the alleged discoveries of gold , upon which some doubt is thrown in Mr. Fraser 's letter of the 13th , I have merely to add that the testimony of Governor Dallas is important , and that the report of Professor Hind appeared to me to contain valuable evidence and reasoning , which can be tested by the further explorations of a geographical commission , for which purpose either Professor Hind , or Sir William Logan , or Mr. Sterry Hunt , or all these well known Canadians , are at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply of quicksilver by the Company to miners , may or may not be valuable to a Company desiring to retain the lead of trade in portions of its own territory ; but a reference to his report will show that it was not proposed to you as an immediate measure , as surmised . In any case , it is undoubted that gold exists in districts east of the primary rocks of the east flanks of the Rocky Mountains , and that persons are seeking for it in greater or less numbers . We have yet to learn how far the information has spread , and what influence it may have upon the movement of the American population . But , great or small , it is a fact affecting the settlement of the community , which enlarges the general pressure for a decision as to how large tracts of your territory , suitable beyond doubt for human habitation , are hereafter to be governed for the good of the people who may come , and so as to preserve British ascendency in your part of the Continent . Both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , and you have before you already both his views and mine . But the paper gives a resume of the general case as presenting itself to many thoughtful persons , known to you in Canada , and belonging to the various political parties . It was desirable to record their ideas , and I present them for what they may be worth , wishing you to understand that the proposal for federation and a joint Custom-house is the view of Mr. George Brown . On the other hand , Mr. Cartier , and even Mr. Sandfield Macdonald , desire to see a separate Crown Colony established . " I now come to the all-important matter of the wise , economical , and efficient working of the business of the Company in America . The paper drawn up under the instructions of Governor Dallas by Mr. Hopkins , and discussed at length between us , is offered to you as an attempt to solve a difficulty which must be got rid of if more business is to be done at less cost , and if the competition around you is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with thorough success . The deed poll is an arrangement standing in the way of change and extension of your operations : it covers legal questions which some day may give you trouble ; and it may be modified in some such manner as that suggested by your assent in the first place , and by the judicious action of Governor Dallas , who should receive your instructions soon , consequent thereon . " The proposal to substitute a contingent and temporary interest in so much stock of the Company for the 40 per cent . of profits now given to the chief factors and traders , may assist you in placing your unissued shares , in a mode leading to a very large annual saving , to be accompanied by an evident increase of efficiency . For , able as your staff is in general , there are many useless , and even mischievous , persons under pay or profits ; and the unfortunate propensities of Sir George Simpson did not lead in his latter years , I fear , to the improvement of the moral tone of your servants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all creditable , such as that of the employment of Sir George 's illegitimate son , and the retention of a chief trader notoriously useless and drunken , for many years after the chief factor of his district had reported his demerits to the local governor . But the service is popular , and there can be no difficulty in keeping up a staff fully able to cope with the sharp and energetic men employed by the American traders ,  --  your permanent rivals in business . " It is perhaps unnecessary further to explain the reasons of my not proceeding to Red River . As before stated , I had expected to do so in company with Captains Glyn and Synge , without whom I should have hesitated to undertake the more extended and responsible task at first proposed . I did not in any event expect that Governor Dallas would come to Canada prior to the receipt of your official letter of the 6th July , and for which I had been waiting from the 30th June until the 20th July ; and when he arrived , and especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been in great measure previously fulfilled by him , it became a question of whether it ought not to be postponed . He had already folly advised the Governor and Committee of the ' state of the Red River Settlement , ' of its ' suitability for settlement , ' and of the general and highly favourable features of the tracts , over which he had travelled for 1,800 miles in various directions . The best route for a telegraph could be , and was , suggested , to you from his own observations , corroborated and added to by the personal experience of Mr. Hopkins and others , who had often traversed the districts , and had resided for years therein . The entire feasibility of constructing a telegraph across the Continent was not only confirmed by these experiences , but by the practical views of persons consulted , who had set up lines through even more difficult and wilder tracts of country . " Therefore the objects you appeared to have before you were realized , if not directly through me , yet through the colleague you had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom I can not express too high an opinion , having been his almost constant companion for above a month , during which every detail , so far as we could grasp it , was thoroughly discussed . " Having given my best attention and labours to the whole subject for some years , and believing that I might be of more service to you here , since Governor Dallas could not be spared to come home , and could not prudently have left Canada until he had put all your business there in order , I exercised no unwise discretion in returning to England . " I have now to ask your forgiveness for the length of this paper , and to express my readiness to give any further explanations in my power , while wishing you and your colleagues quite to understand that I have no desire whatever  --  but far the contrary  --  to obtrude myself upon you in the control of an enterprise which I honestly believe can be made completely successful by the exercise of even ordinary energy and skill , and which ought to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yours . " I have the honour to be , dear Sir , " Yours faithfully , " EDWD . W. WATKIN . " Sir E. W. HEAD , Bart. , " Governor of the Hudson 's Bay Company . " One other object I desired to accomplish , was an exchange of boundary between the Hudson 's Bay and the United States , with the view to Superior City being brought into British territory by a fair payment and exchange of land . The negociation looked very hopeful at one time , but it was not followed up in London , and it fell to the ground . There are few people who understand that it is not only desirable to do the right thing , but to do it at the right time  --  that is , when circumstances favour the doing . I am entitled to say that , owing to the non-acceptance , at the time , of our proposals , much delay in realizing the great object of settling the government and colonizing the territory arose : inadequate terms for the sale and purchase of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Canada ; and the " wintering partners , " not made real partners , as recommended by Governor Dallas and myself , but held at arm 's length , had , at last , to be compensated for giving up the old " deed poll " with a sum of 107,055l. , paid in 1871  --  ten years after the date of our report to Sir Edmund Head . But , " all 's well that ends well , " and the great work is , at last , accomplished . CHAPTER XII . The Hudson 's Bay Company and the Select Committee of 1748-9 . The history of the old co-partnery , the " Governor and Company of Adventurers of England trading into Hudson 's Bay , " ought to be written by some able hand . Samuel Smiles or Goldwin Smith , with the aid of the archives held by the Governor and Committee , would make a book which would go round the world . To publish such a record is a duty incumbent upon Mr. Eden Colville and his colleagues . From no merit or prevision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made of their undertaking . The individuals , as well as Canada as a State , and the Empire , also , have gained largely . The monopoly has been broken up , under liberal and generous treatment of the monopolists  --  monopolists who had deserved their monopoly by their able administration ; and those who ran the risk , paid the cost , and incurred the anxiety , neither complain nor ask for the credit of their work . The merchant adventurer trading to the Eastern Indies , and the merchant adventurer trading into Hudson 's Bay , each on his side of the world , has preserved vast territories to the Crown and people of England . Their conquests have cost the taxpayers of England nothing ; while the trade and enterprise they promoted have enriched millions , and have opened careers , often brilliant , for men of courage and self denial , many of whose names will go down to posterity in fame and honour . The Hudson 's Bay Company was constituted under a charter of Charles the Second . That charter began thus : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of England , Scotland , France , and Ireland , Defender of the Faith , to all to whom these presents shall come greeting : " Whereas our dear intirely beloved cousin , Prince Rupert , Count Palatine of the Rhine , Duke of Bavaria and Cumberland ; George Duke of Albemarle , William Earl of Craven , Henry Lord Arlington , Anthony Lord Ashley , Sir John Robinson , and Sir Robert Vyner , Knights and Baronets ; Sir Peter Colleton , Baronet , Sir Edward Hungerford , Knight of the Bath , Sir Paul Neele , Sir John Griffith , Sir Philip Carteret , and Sir James Hayes , Knights ; John Kirke , Francis Millington , William Prettyman , John Fenn , Esquires , and John Portman , citizen and goldsmith of London , have at their own great costs and charges undertaken an expedition for Hudson 's Bay , in the Northwest parts of America , for the discovery of a new passage into the South Sea , and for the finding of some trade for furs , minerals , and other considerable commodities ; and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encourage them to proceed farther in pursuance of their said design , by means whereof there may probably arise great advantage to us and our kingdom : " And whereas the said undertakers , for their further encouragement in the said design , have humbly besought us to incorporate them , and grant unto them , and their successors , the whole trade and commerce of all those seas , streights , and bays , rivers , lakes , creeks , and sounds , in whatsoever latitude they shall be , that lie within the entrance of the streights commonly called Hudson 's Streights ; together with all the lands , countries , and territories upon the coasts and confines of the seas , streights , bays , lakes , rivers , creeks , and sounds aforesaid , which are not now actually possessed by any of our subjects , or by the subjects of any other Christian Prince or State . " And the adventurers were made " one body corporate and politic , in deed and in name , " by the name of " The Governor and Company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They were granted " the sole trade and commerce " of " all those seas , " &c.,; &c.,; " in whatever latitude they shall be ; " " together with all the lands and territories upon the countries , coasts , and confines of the seas , bays , lakes , rivers , creeks and sounds aforesaid ; " " with the fishing of all sorts of fish , whales , sturgeons , and all other royal fishes ; " " together with the royalty of the sea upon the coasts within the limits aforesaid , and all mines royal , as well discovered as not discovered , of gold , silver , gems , and precious stones , to be found and discovered within the territories , limits , and places aforesaid ; and that the land be from henceforth reckoned and reputed as one of our plantations or Colonies in America , called Rupert 's Land . " All this was to be " holden " " of us , our heirs and successors , as of our manor of East Greenwich , in the County of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in capite or by knight 's service ; yielding and paying yearly to us , our heirs and successors , for the same , two elks and two black beavers , whensoever and as often as we , our heirs and successors , shall happen to enter into the said countries , territories , and regions hereby granted . " The adventurers were further granted " not only the whole , intire , and only liberty of trade and traffick , and the whole , intire , and only liberty , use and privilege of trading and traffick to and from the territories , limits , and places aforesaid , but also the whole and intire trade and traffick to and from all havens , bays , creeks , rivers , lakes , and seas into which they shall find entrance , or passage by water , or land , out of the territories , &c.; aforesaid ; and to and with all the natives and people , inhabitants , or which shall inhabit within the territories , &c."; The charter proceeds to grant the fullest powers for the government of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , provided the laws in force in England were administered . And then it authorizes " free liberty and license , in case they conceive it necessary , to send either ships of war , men , or ammunition , into any of their plantations , forts , factories , or places of trade , " " for the security and defence of the same . " " And to choose commanders and officers over them , and to give them power and authority , by commissions under their common seal , or otherwise , to continue , or make peace or war with any prince or people whatsoever , that are not Christians , in any places where the said Company have plantations , forts , or factories , or adjacent thereunto , as shall be most for the advantage and benefit of said Governor and Company , and of their trade ; " " and also to right and recompense themselves upon the goods , estate , or people of those parts . " Thus , the adventurers had exclusive rights of trade , exclusive possession of territories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make war , or conclude peace . By an Order of Council of 4th February , 1748 , a petition from one Arthur Dobbs , Esq. , and from members of a committee appointed by the " subscribers for finding out a passage to the Western and Southern Ocean of America , " was referred to the consideration of " A. Ryder " and " W. Murray , " who heard counsel for and against the Hudson 's Bay Company , and finally decided that , " Considering how long the Company have enjoyed and acted under this charter without interruption or encroachment , we can not think it advisable for his Majesty to make any express or implied declaration against the validity of it till there has been some judgment of a court of justice to warrant it . " On the 24th April , 1749 , a Select Committee of Parliament reported , through Lord Strange , upon " the state and condition of the countries adjoining to Hudson 's Bay , and the trade carried on there . " The report begins by stating  --  " The Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries adjoining to Hudson 's Bay , and the trade carried on there ; and to consider how those countries may be settled and improved , and the trade and fisheries there extended and increased ; and also to inquire into the right the Company of Adventurers trading to Hudson 's Bay pretend to have , by charter , to the property of lands , and exclusive trade to those countries ;  --  have , pursuant to the order of the House , examined into the several matters to them referred , and find the particular state thereof to be as follows :  --  " Your Committee thought proper , in the first place , to inquire into the nature and extent of the charter granted by King Charles the Second to the Company of Adventurers trading to Hudson 's Bay ; under which charter the present Company claim a right to lands , and an exclusive trade to those countries ; which charter being laid before your Committee , they thought it necessary , for the information of the House , to annex a copy thereof to this Report , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to examine the following witnesses :  --  " The witnesses were Joseph Robson , who had been employed in Hudson 's Bay for six years as a stonemason ; Richard White , who had been a clerk at Albany Fort and elsewhere ; Matthew Sergeant , who had been employed in the Company 's service , and ' understood the Indian language ' ; John Hayter , who ' had been house-carpenter to the Company for six years , at Moose River ' ; Mathew Gwynne , who ' had been twice at Hudson 's Bay ' ; Edward Thompson , who had been three years at Moose River , as surgeon ; Enoch Alsop , who had been armourer to the Company at Moose River ; Christopher Bannister , who had been armourer and gunsmith , and had resided in the Bay for 22 years ; Robert Griffin , silversmith , who had been five years in the Company 's service ; Thomas Barnett , smith , who went over to Albany in 1741 ; Alexander Brown , who had been six years at Hudson 's Bay as surgeon ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Company 's ; Arthur Dobbs , ' Esquire , ' ' examined as to the information he had received from " a French Canadese Indian " ( since deceased ) , and who was maintained at the expense of the Admiralty , on a prospect of his being of service on the discovery of a North-west Passage , ' ' and who informed your Committee that the whole of that discourse is contained in part of a book printed for the witness in 1744 , to which he desired leave to refer ' ; Captain William Moore , who ' had been employed in Hudson 's Bay from a boy ' ; Mr. Henry Spurling , merchant , who ' had traded chiefly in furs for 28 years past , during which time he had dealt with the Hudson 's Bay Company ' ; Captain Carruthers , who had been in the Hudson 's Bay service 35 years ago ; Arthur Slater , who had been employed by the Company on the East Main . " It will be seen that one object aimed at in granting a charter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the " North-west Passage . " Beginning in 1719 , and ending , probably in despair , in 1737 , the Hudson 's Bay Company fitted and sent out in the whole six separate expeditions , which the Committee record in their Appendix , as follows ( The instructions to the commanders usually ended , " So God send the good ship a successful discovery , and to return in safety . Amen " ) :  --  A List of Vessels fitted out by the Hudson 's Bay Company for Discovery of a North-West Passage . 1719 .

The Mus-quash , Robert Crow , master , sailed from Prince of Wales ' Fort , July 7th . Returned 22nd August . It must be observed that , in 1745 , Parliament had offered a reward of 20,000l. for the discovery of the North-west Passage . The Act was entitled " An Act for giving a publick reward to such person , or persons , His Majesty 's subjects , as shall discover a North-west Passage through Hudson 's Streights to the Western and Southern Ocean of America . " In the evidence before the Committee , varied opinions were given as to this Northwest Passage . Mr. Edward Thompson , who had been a ship-surgeon , being examined as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He had the greatest reason to believe there is one , from the winds , tides , and black whales ; and he thinks the place to be at Chesterfield 's inlet ; that the reason of their coming back was they met the other boat which had been five leagues further , and the crew told them the water was much fresher and shallower there ; but where he was the water was fifty fathoms deep , and the tide very strong ; the ebb six hours and the flood two , to the best of his remembrance ; that it is not common for the tide to flow only two hours ; but he imagines it to be obstructed by another tide from the westward ; that the rapidity of the tide upwards was so great , that the spray of the water flew over the bow of the schooner , and was so salt that it candied on men 's shoes , but that the tide did not run in so rapid a manner the other way . " Captain William Moore , being asked whether he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said , " He believes there is a communication , but whether navigable or not he can not say ; that if there is any such communication ' t is further northward than he expected ; that if it is but short , as ' t is probable to conclude from the height of the tides , ' t is possible it might be navigable ; and it was the opinion of all the persons sent on that discovery that a north-west wind made the highest tides . " Captain Carruthers said , " That he do n't apprehend there is any such passage ; but if there is , he thinks it impracticable to navigate it on account of the ice ; that he would rather choose to go round by Cape Horn ; and that it will be impossible to go and return through such passage in one year ; and he thinks ' t is the general opinion of seamen that there is no such passage . " Mr. John Tomlinson , merchant , of London , said , " He was a subscriber to the undertaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for want of money : that he should not choose to subscribe again upon the same terms ; that he can not pretend to say whether there is such a passage or not , or whether , if found , it could be ever rendered useful to navigation . " The merchant witnesses were in favour of throwing open the trade of Hudson 's Bay ; and this Mr. Tomlinson said more ships would be sent , and more people brought down to trade . " This is confirmed , " he said , " by the experience of the Guinea trade , which , when confined to a company , employed not above ten ships , and now employs 150 ; " and " that the case of the Guinea trade was exactly similar ( to the Hudson 's Bay ) , where the ships near one another , and each endeavours to get the trade ; and the more ships lie there , the higher the price of negroes . " The capital of the Hudson 's Bay Company , increased by doublings and treblings of its nominal amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighty-six proprietors . The trade between London and Hudson 's Bay was carried on in 1748 , and for some previous years , by four ships . The cost of the exports was in 1748 5,102l. 12s. 3d. , and the value of the sales of furs and other imports in that year amounted to 30,160l. 5s. 11dd . The " charge attending the carrying on the Hudson 's Bay trade , and maintaining their factories , " in 1748 , is stated at 17,352l. 4s. 10d . The original cash capital was 10,500l . That capital was " trebled " in 1690 , making the nominal capital 31,500l. ; in August , 1720 , it was proposed to augment the cash capital , and to make the nominal total 378,000l . But at a " General Court , " held on the 23rd December , 1720 , it was resolved to " vacate " the subscription " by reason of the present scarcity of moneys , and the deadness of credit . " And it was further " Resolved , that in the opinion of this Committee , that each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid in , " " which resolutions were agreed to by this Court . " Anyhow , the capital in 1748 is stated at 103,950l . A trade which , by sending out about 5,000l. a year , brought back a return of 30,000l. , was no doubt worth preserving ; and even taking the outlay for working and maintenance of forts and establishments , there was over 8 per cent , on the nominal capital left , or probably 40 per cent on all the cash actually paid in ; not too great a reward for the benefits gained by the country from this trade . Some particulars of the regulation of exchange of commodities may here be interesting . The system of trade was simple barter . The equivalent of value was beaver skins ; while skins of less value were again calculated as so much of each for one beaver . A kettle was exchanged for one beaver . A pound and a half of gunpowder , one beaver . One blanket , six beavers . Two bayonets , one beaver . Four fire-steels , one beaver . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beaver . One four-foot gun , twelve beavers . Three knives , one beaver , and so on over a long list of various articles . Some of the things exchanged nearly 130 years ago , show that the Indians had a good knowledge of trade , and of objects used by civilised people . For example ; brandy ( English ) , one gallon , four beavers . Vermilion , one and a half ounces , one beaver ; and combs , egg-boxes , files , glasses , goggles , handkerchiefs , hats ( laced ) , hawk-bells , rings , scissors , spoons , shirts , shoes , stockings , and thimbles . The factors were accused of imposing upon the Indians by using defective weights and measures ; and it was said that the doubtful profit thus made , in opposition to the standards sent out from England , was called the " overplus-trade . " In the year 1748 , the forts and settlements of the Hudson 's Bay Company " in the Bay " were :  --  Latitude Moose Fort 51 28 Henley House , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 52 18 York Fort 57 10 Prince of Wales ' Fort 59 This limited occupation contrasts in a marked manner with the area of posts , all over the continent , at this later date ; see a list at pp. 222-226 , and a map in front of this volume . The skins and other articles imported , and sold at the Company 's warehouse , in the City of London , by the " inch of candle "  --  a mode of auction common in those days ( under which the bidding went on till the inch of lighted wax , candle went out )  --  fluctuated in the ten years between the years 1739 and 1748 very much . In that period the highest and lowest prices were for :  --  L s d L s d Beaver ( per lb ) 0 7 101/4 0 5 3 Martin ( per skin ) 0 6 8 0 5 11/4 Otter " 0 13 6 0 5 5 Cat " 0 18 0 0 10 101/4 Fox " 0 11 71/4 0 6 71/4 Wolverines " 0 7 0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 71/2 0 12 101/4 Mink " 0 4 8 0 2 0 Wolves " 0 18 11 0 9 01/4 Woodshock " 0 12 0 0 8 0 Elk " 0 11 7 0 6 1 Deer " 0 0 9 0 2 01/4 Bed feathers ( per lb ) 0 1 41/4 0 1 0 Castorum " 0 13 21/4 0 6 1 Ivory "  --   --   --   --   --  0 0 61/4 Whale Fins " 0 2 9 0 1 101/4 Wesakapupa " 0 2 4 0 0 61/4 Whale Oil ( per tun ) 18 13 0 10 1 0 Goose quills ( per 1,000 ) 0 18 0 0 11 7 " Ivory " only appears once , viz. in the sale of 1738-9 . This article may have been , simply , bones of the whale ; and " whale oil " only appears four times in the ten years quoted . The report of Lord Strange 's Committee quotes many quaint and solid instructions , as well in times of war as of peace , to the governors and agents on the Bay . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , " The English and French having declared war against each other , and the war with Spain still continuing , we do hereby strictly direct you to be always on your guard and to keep a good watch ; and that you keep all your men as near home as possible . We do hereby further direct that you cut away all trees , hedges , bushes , &c.,; or any other cover for an enemy ; and lay all level and open round the factory , further than cannon shot , which we compute to be a mile ; in order to hinder the enemy from attacking you unawares , and from being sheltered from the factory 's guns . But you are to keep up , and repair , your palisadoes , for your defence . " ... " You are to fire point blank upon any ship , sloop , or vessel that shall come near the factory , unless they make the true signal , and answer yours . The letter proceeds to offer 30l. to the widow or children of any man killed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose a leg , or an arm , 30l . Compensation to men receiving smaller wounds ; and especial reward to such of the " chiefs , officers , and common men " as might specially distinguish themselves . The 18th paragraph of this remarkable letter says : " In case you are attacked at Henley House , and , notwithstanding a vigorous resistance , you should have the misfortune to be overpowered , then you are to nail up the cannon , blow up the house , and destroy everything that can be of service to the enemy , and make the best retreat you can to the factory .

" Uncertain Sounds " I may illustrate the consequences of vacillation and delay in the vigorous government of the Hudson 's Bay territory , and in all distant parts of the Empire , by giving a verbatim copy of a Bill ordered to be " printed and introduced " in July , 1866 , into the " House of Representatives " of the United States , at Washington , providing for relieving the Queen of her sovereign rights in the British territories between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans . The only excuse  --  an excuse far from valid for so monstrous a proposal  --  was that no one knew what the British Government were inclined to do ; and at Washington no one believed that John Bull would " make a fight of it ; " while everyone knew that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southern States to come under the dominion of the Queen , had been introduced into the British House of Commons , the United States Ambassador " to the Court of St. James ' " would have been recalled  --  to begin with . The British Ambassador took no notice , made no remonstrance ; but the advent of Mr. Disraeli to power discouraged such outrages , and led in the following year to the passing of the Act for Confederation . In printing this Bill , my object is to show the mischief , mischief which half-a-dozen times in my lifetime has placed before my countrymen the alternative of ignominious concessions or war between English-speaking people , of " uncertain sounds . " It is essential to continued peace , trade and prosperity , that it should be known to all the world that the broad lands between the two great oceans are an integral part of the Empire ; that they will never be parted with without a struggle , in which all our forces will be amply used ; and that either invasion , or the insidious agitations which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an eye to rebellion , will be put down by force . Here is this insulting document printed verbatim . I challenge the quotation of any similar outrage on the part of any civilized nation at peace with the Empire attacked :  --  " Printer 's No. , 266. " 39TH CONGRESS , 1ST SESSION . " H. R. 754 .

" So much for an outrage of a character unheard of and unparalleled . It was the result of " uncertain sounds ; " of " duffer " government . Let me give some illustrations . Before we began the , finally successful , movement for the Intercolonial Railway , the confederation of the Provinces of North America , and the final completion of a railway binding the coasts of the Atlantic and Pacific together , the Right Hon. C. B. Adderley , M.P. , wrote a " letter to the Right Hon. B. Disraeli , M.P. , on the present relations of England with the Colonies . " It was a skinflint document , and here are a couple of quotations :  --  Page 57.  --  " I would have the Canadian Government , in the right time and manner , informed that after a. certain date , unless war were going on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as all their requisite peace establishments , as they might deem fit ; and that they should be prepared to hold their own in case of foreign attack , at least till the forces of the Empire could come to their aid . " Page 50.  --  " Let Canada , however , by all means look to England in the hour of peril also ; but if the sight of English red-coats , at all times , has become a needful support of Canadian confidence , and English pay has ceased to be resented as a symptom of dependence , we must bow humbly under the conviction that Canada is no longer inhabited by men like those who conquered her . " Then I must quote my revered friend , Mr. Cobden , who , addressing his relative , Colonel Cole ( at one time administrator of New Brunswick ) , on the 20th March , 1865 , only thirteen days before his ever-to-be-lamented death , wrote about Canada : " We are two peoples to all intents and purposes , and it is a perilous delusion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dependence , which will snap asunder if it should ever be put to the strain of stem reality . It is all very well for our cockney newspapers to talk of defending Canada at all hazards . It would be just as possible for the United States to sustain Yorkshire in a war with England as for us to enable Canada to contend against the United States . It is simply an impossibility . We must not forget that the only serious danger of a quarrel between these two neighbours arises from the connection of Canada with this country . In my opinion it is for the interest of both that we should , as speedily as possible , sever the political thread by which we are , as communities , connected , and leave the individuals on both sides to cultivate the relations of commerce and friendly intercourse as with other nations . " ... " There is , I think , an inherent weakness in the parody of our old English constitution , which is performed on the miniature scenes of the Colonial capitals , with their speeches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country , changes of ministry , &c.,; and all about such trumpery issues that the game at last becomes ridiculous in the eyes of both spectators and actors . " Speaking in the House of Commons on the second reading of the British North America Bill , in 1867 , Mr. Bright said : " Is this new State  --  or this new nation , as I think Lord Monck described it  --  to be raised up under the authority of an Act of Parliament  --  is everything to be done for it ? Is it intended to garrison its fortresses by English troops ? At present there are , I believe , in the Province 12,000 or 15,000 men . There are persons in this country , and there are some also in the North American Provinces , who are ill-natured enough to say that not a little of the loyalty that is said to prevail in Canada has its price . I think it is natural and reasonable to hope that there is in that country a very strong attachment to this country . But if they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and for fortresses , and for works of defence ; if everything is to be given to a nation independent in everything except Lord Monck and his successors , and except in the contributions we make for these public objects , then I think it would be far better for them , and for us  --  cheaper for us , and less demoralising for them  --  that they should become an independent State , and maintain their own fortresses , fight their own cause , and build up their own future , without relying upon us . And when we know , as everybody knows , that the population of Canada , family for family , is in a much better position as regards the comforts of home than family for family are in the great bulk of the population of this country  --  I say the time has come when it ought to be clearly understood that the taxes of England are no longer to go across the ocean to defray expenses of any kind within the confederation which is about to be formed . The Right Honorable gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never been an advocate for great expenditure in the Colonies by the Mother Country . On the contrary , he has been one of the members of this House who have distinguished themselves by what I will call an honest system to the Mother Country , and what I believe is a wise system to the Colonies . But I think that when a measure of this kind is being passed , having such stupendous results upon the population of these great Colonies , we have a right to ask that there should be some consideration for the Revenue and for the taxpayers of this country . " In speaking on the Canada Railway Loan Bill in the House on the 28th March , 1867 , Mr. Gladstone , alluding to Canada , said : " We have carried it to this point , that as far as regards the Administration , I believe it may be said that the only officer appointed by the Colonial Secretary is the Governor ; and I believe there can not be a doubt that if it were the well-ascertained desire of the Colonies to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parliament would at once make over to them that power . " I may , perhaps without presumption , here add two short speeches of mine in the House of Commons : one , in reply to Mr. Bright in the discussion on the Confederation , or British North America Bill , on the 28th February , 1867 ; the other , in reply to Mr. Lowe , on the Canada Loan Bill , on the 28th March , 1867 . Language affecting the relations between the Mother Country and the Colonies , such as I have quoted , does infinite mischief  --  more mischief than those who do not mix with the people can understand . It is as bad in its consequences as the unfortunate policy of Mr. Gladstone : the " Majuba Hill " policy . Hansard , vol. 185 , page 1187 , Feb. 28 , 1867 . " Mr. Watkin said he fully concurred in the statement of the right hon. gentleman ( Sir John Pakington ) , that the House of Representatives and the Senate of Nova Scotia had approved the scheme of Confederation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the right hon. gentleman the First Lord of the Admiralty had stated . " There was a general election in 1863 , and the Prime Minister ( Mr. Tupper ) went through the country preaching this Confederation of the Provinces . It was brought under the notice of the electors at every polling-booth , and at every hustings the issue was distinctly raised . Well , after that general election , the plan of the Government was sustained by an enormous majority in the House of Representatives , and delegates were sent to the Conference to carry out the plan . If there was any question on which the British North American Provinces not only had enjoyed an opportunity of expressing , but had actually expressed , opinion , it was on this very question of Confederation . " Mention having been made of the name of Mr. Howe , whose acquaintance he had the honour of possessing , he might state his own conviction that a man of purer patriotism , or one who had rendered more able and distinguished service to the Crown of this country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Howe some years ago at Detroit on the question of whether the Reciprocity Treaty should be continued or not ; and he believed it was in no small degree owing to that remarkable speech  --  one of the most eloquent ever heard  --  that the unanimous verdict in favour of continuing the treaty had been arrived at . It was matter of surprise and regret to him that the valuable and life-long services of Mr. Howe had not received recognition at the hands of either the late or the present Government . " The hon. member for Birmingham seemed dissatisfied with the phrase used by Lord Monck respecting the establishment of a new nation . Now he ( Mr. Watkin ) supported the Confederation , not as the establishment of a new nation , but as the confirmation of an existing nation . It meant this , that the people of the confederated colonies were to remain under the British Crown  --  or it meant nothing . He joined issue with those who said , ' Let the Colonies stand by themselves . ' He dissented from the view that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crown the territory of this enormous Confederation . But there was a vast tract beyond Canada , extending to the Pacific ; and the House should bear in mind that more than half of North America was under British dominion . " Did the hon. member ( Mr. Bright ) think that it was best for civilization and for public liberty that this half of the Continent should be annexed to the United States ? If that were the opinion of the hon. gentleman , he did not think it was the opinion of that House . Every man of common sense knew that these territories could not stand by themselves ; they must either be British or American  --  under the Crown or under the Stars and Stripes . The hon. member for Birmingham ( Mr. Bright ) might think that we should be the better for losing all territorial connection with Canada ; but he could not agree with that doctrine . Extent and variety were amongst the elements of Imperial greatness . " Descending to the lowest and most material view of the subject , he did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separation would be for our interest . " Take , again , the question of defence . Our North American possessions had a coast line of 1,000 miles on the east , and 800 on the west , and possessed some of the finest harbours on that Continent , and a mercantile marine entitling it to the third rank among maritime nations . The moment these advantages passed into the hands of the United States , that country would become the greatest naval power in the world . In preserving commercial relations with the United States , the Canadian frontier line of 3,000 miles was likewise extremely useful . " As long as British power and enterprise extended along one side of this boundary line , and as long as the tariff of extremely light duties was kept up by us , and that imposed only for the purposes of revenue , it would be impossible for the United States to pursue what might be called a Japanese policy . " If England , therefore , desired to maintain her trade , even apart from other considerations , it was desirable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had lately had to pass through a cotton famine , and they had been taught the inconvenience of the prohibition of the export of cotton by the American Government . " A large proportion of the corn imported into this country was brought from America , and in what state would England find herself if all the food exports of North America were placed under the control of the Government of Washington ? If the frontier line became the sea coast , what might be looked for then ? Scarcely three years had elapsed since Mr. Cobden declared that if there had not been a plentiful harvest in America he did not know where food could have been procured for the people of this country . " Now , the corn-growing fields of Upper Canada alone ranked fifth in point of productiveness . Did England not wish to preserve this vast storehouse ? Suppose that Canada belonged to America : in the event of a quarrel with England there was nothing to prevent the United States from declaring that not an ounce of food should leave its territories , which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico . He had hoped that upon this Bill , not only both sides of the House , but every section of the House , might have been found in unison . " It was no use blinking the question . This would not be a decision affecting Canada merely . We had sympathies alike with Australia and the other Colonies . If it were seriously proposed that England should denude herself of her possessions  --  give up India , Australia , North America , and retire strictly within the confines of her own Islands , to make herself happy there ,  --  the same result might be brought about much more easily by those who wished it . They might become citizens of some small country like Holland , and realize their ideas of happiness in a moment . But he hesitated to believe that the people of England did really favour any such policy . " If any one were to hoist the motto , ' Severance of the Colonies from the Crown , ' he did not believe that one per cent . of the people would adopt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deep attachment to their Empire , and that not a barren rock over which the flag of England had ever waved would be abandoned by them without a cogent and sufficient reason . Every argument used in support of the necessity of giving up the Provinces , which lay within eight days of our own shores , would apply with equal force in the case of Ireland , if the people of the United States chose to demand possession . " Was this country prepared to give up Gibraltar , Malta , Heligoland , all its outlying stations , merely because some strong power took a fancy to them ? He did not believe that the people of England would ever act in such a spirit . " As to the argument of expense , if Canada chose to pick a quarrel on her own account , clearly she ought to pay the bill ; but if she were involved in war on Imperial considerations , then he maintained that the Imperial revenues might properly be resorted to . " The British Empire was one and indivisible , or it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States acted ? If any portion of the territory of the Union was touched , were there one of its citizens who would not be ready and forward to defend it ? Should we then be less determined to maintain intact the greatness and the glory of the British Empire ? " He , for one , would not give up the opinion that Englishmen were prepared to maintain , in its integrity , the greatness and glory of the Empire ; and that such a feeling would find a hearty response in that House . " " CANADA RAILWAY LOAN . " March 28 , 1867 . " In reply to Mr. Lowe and others , " Mr. Watkin said that , in following the right hon. gentleman ( Mr. Lowe ) , he felt very much as a quiet Roman citizen must have done on passing the chief gladiator in the street  - -  inclined to pass over to the other side , and to have nothing to say to him , for fear of the consequences . " But some years ago he was requested by the late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the hobgoblin fears expressed that night in regard to the construction of this 375 miles of railway were unfounded . " Let hon. members remember that Her Majesty 's American dominions extended over an area equal to one-eighth of the habitable globe . This Railway gave us communication , not only with Canada and with 10,000 miles of American railways , but with the vast tract of British territory extending across to the Pacific . The consequence of making this Railway would be , that two days would be saved in going from England to the northern continent of America , including the great corn-growing district of the West . " If the House had seen , as he had seen , the Canadian volunteers turn out in bitter winter to repel a threatened invasion , without a red-coat near them , they would think that the right hon. gentleman 's taunts might have been spared . " The British Provinces had taxed themselves 360,000l. a-year for the execution of these works , which Lord Durham had proposed in 1838 , with the object of binding together , by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Queen 's American dominions . " The evidence of every military man , including Sir John Michell , the present Commander-in-Chief in Canada , was that this Railway was absolutely necessary for the military defence of the Colonies . It was , however , to be defended not only on that ground , but upon the ground of its great commercial advantages . " There were now in the Government offices memorials from many of the large towns in the three kingdoms , concurring in the commercial necessity and advantages of the measure which the House was now asked to agree to . Therefore , originating as it did with Lord Durham ,  - -  sanctioned as it was by Lord Grey 's proposals of 1851  --  adopted by the late and present Governments ,  --  demanded for purposes of defence , as also for the more genial and generous objects of commerce and peace ,  - -  he hoped the House would support the construction of the Railway by a guarantee , which would not cost this country a shilling . " The motion for giving the guarantee was carried by 247 votes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ XV . " Governor Dallas . " I should do injustice to my own loving memory of the man , if I did not publish some letters from the late Governor Dallas , which are , to my mind , especially interesting . Though some of his views , in 1863 , as to the value of the Hudson 's Bay lands , and their settlement , did not accord with my own , yet his experience should plead against mine . No one was more pleased than he to find that the country was in process  - -  after many delays , over which he and I used to groan in concert  --  of successful colonization . " MONTREAL , " 17th August , 1863 . " DEAR SIR , " With reference to our late conversations upon various matters connected with the past and future of the Hudson 's Bay Company , I take the liberty of calling your attention to several points of the business requiring immediate attention , in a more explicit manner than I may have done in desultory conversation . " The government of the territory is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and nothing short of direct administration under the authority of the Crown will , in my opinion , remedy the evil . Two prisoners have been , in separate instances , forcibly rescued from jail , and they , with about thirty to fifty others implicated in the riots , are still at large , fostering discontent , and creating great disquiet . Their secret instigator controls the only paper published in the settlement , and its continued attacks upon the Company find a greedy ear with the public at large , both in the settlement and in Canada . The position of those in authority is so disagreeable that I have had great difficulty in persuading the magistrates to continue to act . Mr. William Mactavish , Governor of Assiniboin , has resigned his post , and I have only been restrained from following his example , for a short time , in the hope that a remedy would speedily be applied , and that I should be relieved from the unfair position in which I find myself placed , with all the responsibility , and the semblance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ignored , by the Crown . In the absence of a just grievance , the cry of ' the Company ' is quite a sufficient watchword amongst the ignorant and discontented . " The open malcontents are few in number , and I had ample volunteer force at my back to protect the jail and support my authority , but , as I have already explained to you , I could exercise but little control over my friends , who were keen for what would have ended in a free fight , with the certain death of the sheriff and ringleaders on both sides , and led to endless animosities . It required more resolution on my part to follow the course I did , than to have resisted the rioters . For details of the transactions I refer you to my official letters to the Board , which you will find in the Hudson 's Bay House . " Of the settlers , the greater number , including the French Canadians , are our staunch personal friends , while the openly disaffected are but few . There is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though taking no open part , are yet dissatisfied . Some of these last named have real or imaginary grievances , of long standing to complain of , and nothing but the extinction of the governing powers of the Company will satisfy them . I came amongst them as free from prejudice as you can be , and determined to redress every grievance and meet their wishes in every reasonable way , but to no avail . I have already transmitted to the Board evidence in the ' Nor ' Wester , ' that our unpopularity arises entirely from the system of government , and not from any faults in its administrators . " A continuance of this state of matters may lead to the formation of a provisional government by the people themselves , and to annexation to the United States , as have been threatened . With the opening up of the St. Paul 's route , there has been a large increase of the ' American ' element in the settlement ; and in the enclosed copy of the ' Nor ' Wester ' of the 22nd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is quietly recruiting for its army in British territory . This matter , I trust , may be in the meantime brought to the notice of the proper authorities pending further information upon my return to Red River . " The trust which the Board has placed in my hands , and the confidence reposed in my ability to guide you in forming your plans for the future , impose on me no little responsibility and anxiety . I must relieve my shoulders of this weight by stating plainly my belief that the opening up of the country by waggon road and telegraph , and by the encouragement of settlement , must prove so far detrimental to the current commercial business of the Company as to render it difficult , if not impossible , to provide a fair dividend upon the portion of its capital embarked in the trade . I do not , however , the less recognize the necessity of opening up the country and its communications . It is not at all clear to my mind how you are to secure a remunerative dividend upon the extra sum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formation of roads , &c.,; &c.; In a commercial point of view , I do not consider it safe to enter upon these extended operations till secure of a sufficient subsidy from the different Governments interested . " Upon a mature consideration of the whole subject , I entirely concur in the views expressed by Mr. Johnstone in his letter , of which I have already sent only an extract to Sir Edmund Head , viz. , that with the government of the country the territorial right should also revert to the Crown , upon whatever terms might be arranged . Anything short of a full measure of this sort would fail to satisfy the settlers and the public at large , who seem inclined to view with distrust the present position of Her Majesty 's Government in its supposed alliance with the new Board of Direction . " It is a question for consideration whether the northern region of the country beyond the limits of probable settlement should not still remain under the control of the Company , with such a monopoly of trade as would induce them to undertake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the introduction of ardent spirits . I make this suggestion solely on behalf of the Indians , upon whom free intercourse with white men will , in my opinion , be ultimately destructive . " Having already impressed upon you the necessity of procuring from Her Majesty 's Secretary of State for the Colonies such instructions to the Governors of Vancouver 's Island and British Columbia as may put an end to all proceedings against us in the local courts , and place us in possession of proper titles to our lands , I have now , in reminding you of the importance of the matter , to hand you the enclosed extract of a private letter which I received yesterday from Mr. D. Mactavish , senior member of our Board of Management in Victoria , which speaks for itself . " Though I have marked this communication ' private , ' I shall be obliged by your laying it before Sir Edmund Head , as I am so very hurried that I have not time at present to write officially to the Board . " I remain , dear Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E. WATKIN , Esq. , London . " P.S.  --  The undoubted discoveries of gold diggings in the Saskatchewan and other portions of the territory is another strong reason why the land should revert to and be administered by the Crown . Large grants to the Company would be looked upon with great disfavour by the public . " A. G. D. " Extract private letter from D. Mactavish , Esq. , to A. G. Dallas , dated Victoria , Vancouver 's Island , 13th July , 1863 :  --  " We hear nothing of our land question from the Governor , and there is no getting him to give titles for the Company 's lands at Hope , Yale , and Langley . Orders have come out for the Royal Engineers to go to England immediately after the new year , so that Colonel Moodie and his staff of surveyors will do no more work , their time being so nearly up  --  this is worrying , but can not be helped . The Governor has so much to do , making roads and so forth in British Columbia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when we do call on him to act , his invariable answer is , that he can not get Moodie to do anything , and I daresay there is some truth in it , as it is shrewdly surmised that His Excellency has had more to do with the recall of the Engineers home than anyone else , and they all feel that they are leaving under a cloud . " " MONTREAL , " 17th Augt. 1863 . " MY DEAR MR . WATKIN , " Along with this I send you a letter which , though marked private , treats only of our affairs , in such a manner that it may be laid before the Duke of Newcastle . It ought , I think , also to be laid before Sir Edmund Head , and I shall refer him to it for my views . It is very important that the whole of Johnstone 's letter , and of my account of affairs at Red River , in regard to the Corbett riots , addressed to the Board , should be read along with the above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make anything out of our lands , Footnote : Experience has shown that this was an error. and I am therefore strongly of opinion that they should be transferred to the Government upon certain terms , excepting only such lands around our forts as may be necessary for our business , and our farms , &c.; in actual occupation . " Although a great outcry has been raised against us on account of our being a ' stop in the way , ' and enjoying a monopoly of trade , the cry is groundless . It may , therefore , be well for you to know that for a number of years past we have enjoyed no monopoly of trade whatever , and that there is no impediment to the settlement of the country by any one who pleases . A settler may squat wherever he thinks fit , without question , or being called upon to pay for lands yet unsurveyed , and of which the Indian titles are not yet extinguished . The small portion of surveyed land in the district of Assiniboin has been all long since occupied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there would be no difficulty in obtaining payment for these lands from the occupiers . " In erecting the telegraph , the Indian titles to the land ought to be extinguished by annual payments ; but the absence of a recognized and respected Government will be of itself a great bar to the successful erection of the apparatus , and the preserving it and the various stations in good order . Though , by increased energy and supervision , the fur trade may for a time be maintained , yet you must not count upon increased profits , as with the opening up of the country the furs are costing us more , and many of our posts are so distant that they can not , from that and a variety of causes , be placed all at once upon a proper footing , and it is very difficult to exercise a proper supervision over them . It behoves the Company , therefore , to look out for other sources of profit . One of these is that of banking operations , both here and at Red River , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other suitable locality in the U. S. On this head I may again address you from Red River , and Mr. Hopkins will afford you every information in regard to the prospects at this place , which are represented to be very great , when you come out in September . " I am just about starting for Lake St. John 's on the Saguenay River , and shall be absent about ten days . Upon my return I shall be ready to return to Red River  --  say , about the 1st September . " Hoping you have had a pleasant passage , believe me , " Yours very truly , " E. WATKIN , Esq. , London . " A. G. DALLAS . " P.S.  --  I do not see how the Company can make anything out of placer gold diggings in such a country . The miners must be encouraged , and mining licences can not be expected to do more than pay the cost of collection , magistracy , police , &c.; The surrender of all this territory to the Crown , however , is a question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to disabuse you of the idea that the Company can of itself turn the territory to profit by sale of lands , mining rights , making roads , telegraph , &c.; " A. G. D. " " MONTREAL , " 18th August , 1863 . " MY DEAR MR . WATKIN , " I left New York the evening of the day I parted from you , and reached this place on the Saturday night , via Boston and Portland , quite done up , having travelled two nights without undressing . The crowds were such as they were on the Hudson , and my mind often reverted to the good things I left at the door of the steward 's pantry in the ' Scotia , ' " Brydges is not yet back from Quebec , and Hopkins and I start to-morrow for the Saguenay and St. John 's Lake , where affairs require to be looked after . " I have a letter to-day from St. Paul , in which Kittson says that the railroad gentry were anxiously expecting you , and making much capital out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State will not be so blind to their own interest as to decline to undertake to complete the portion of telegraph required . I have no doubt that a company could immediately be formed to accomplish the object . ' " Reverting to my grievance against the old Board , I wish to state what I complain of , viz. , that I am charged with my passage across the Atlantic , and with a sum of L50 , drawn to cover travelling expenses to Montreal . These were charged against me in February , 1862 , and have borne interest against me since then . " 2ndly . I complain that I am charged interest on all sums drawn by me in each year  --  though within the amount of that year 's salary . I surely am entitled to draw my pay from time to time to cover my expenditure ? Officers in this country manage under the existing system of accounts to get the benefit of funds , even in excess of their pay , for two years without interest . " 3rdly . I had charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with great labour , I placed upon a satisfactory footing  --  including the recovery of large sums from Government , and the terminating complicated and ruinous engagements with bailiffs or tenants and partners . I paid my expenses to Vancouver 's Island , and devoted my whole time to the above matters , from 1st January , 1857 , to the period of my leaving the Island in 1861 , without having received one shilling of recompense . For the latter portion of the time I was paid by the H. B. Co. , when I had the sole charge of its affairs during a most anxious and harassing period  --  constantly involved with all around me defending the rights of both companies . " I say nothing as to my scale of pay under the old Board , but in making the changes which they did I think they ought not to have assumed that I should continue to act for the same remuneration . " The pay was not my inducement to come to the country , but when overtures were first made to me , nothing being said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least receive the same pay and be placed on an equally good footing with the late Sir George Simpson , who for a number of years past lived at his ease at Lachine , and attended more , apparently , to his own affairs than to those of the Company . The latter bear evidence in every district of having been left entirely to themselves , while extreme discontent prevails in consequence of favouritism having regulated the promotions . " Though not a ground of complaint , or a matter requiring redress  --  yet I may call attention to the inadequacy of my pay hitherto , when it is taken into account , that , from the unsettled life I have led in the Company 's service , I have been obliged to neglect my private affairs . I have never received anything for outfit , and I was unlucky enough on my way out to have the most of our traps burnt the night before we embarked at Liverpool , in the Adelphi Hotel . The clothes ordered to replace these have all gone to the bottom in the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these matters now with the view of obtaining higher pay for the future , as you know my intention is to return to England in the spring , and with the business in fair working order I can be of more avail there . " It so happens that the fruits of my labours in America , both as regards the Hudson 's Bay and Puget Sound Companies , will be reaped mainly by the present proprietors . At the same time , all such claims as the above ought to have been settled up to 31st May last by the old Board . " A grumbling fellow is , I know , looked upon with great disfavour , especially when there is nothing more to be got out of him . This , therefore , is intended for your own eye alone . The substance of my complaint you may make use of as you see fit . " Excuse this scrawl , and believe me in haste , " Very truly yours , " A. G. DALLAS . " E. WATKIN , Esq. , London .

" After parting from you I went to the Saguenay River and Lake St. John 's , where I need say no more than that my presence was very much wanted . No practical supervision had ever been exercised over the posts in that district , so far as I could learn . " Brydges accompanied me to St. Paul ; but I could not induce him to come any further , as he said he had a wife , eleven hundred children , and six miles of railway ( more or less of either ) to look after .

The more I consider the subject the more satisfied I am that next year 's operations ought to be confined to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Fort Garry . In addition to sending a practical man , I would recommend that Mr. Wood himself come to Fort Carry . By following the ' Crow Wing ' route he will get a perfect idea of the difficulties to be encountered along the whole line , as perfectly as a pinch of flour would represent the contents of the whole sack . " I wish to call your particular attention to a letter which I have this day addressed to the Board , upon the subject of Indian claims to lands , and the officious part taken by the editor of the ' Nor ' Wester , ' in the hope that you may be able to exercise some influence over the Duke of Newcastle in prevailing upon him to discourage such men in some marked manner . As my residence in that country will now be a very short one , and as I have no pecuniary interest in the Company or the country , I write disinterestedly , and this knowledge may induce his Grace to pay some attention to my warnings .

" My interest in the old Company was a nominal one , merely sufficient to qualify myself for a seat on the Direction . That interest I sold out on accepting my present appointment . During my residence at Vancouver Island and on this side , I have been working for honorary occupation  --  my pay having formed no inducement , and being quite inadequate in countries where , in matters of expenditure , a dollar passes for little more than a shilling in England , and liable , as I was , from my wandering life , and with a family  --  to the losses incurred by a frequent breaking up of establishment . I allude to these matters , not for the purpose of complaint , but in support of the position that , as a disinterested and impartial administrator of the affairs entrusted to my charge , I was actuated by no selfish or pecuniary motives .

At the same time . Her Majesty 's Government can not continue much longer to ignore this territory . By such a course they are only sowing the seeds of further trouble , which I shall not be sorry to escape .

" A few weeks ago , the venerable Chief of the Red River Indians , William King , or ' Pegowis , ' left his home at the Indian Settlement  --  a most unusual thing for him  --  and came up to Fort Carry to make a formal statement , once for all , of the arrangement made by the late Earl of Selkirk with the Indians of this region in regard to their land . This statement , which he made voluntarily and deliberately , for the benefit of all whom it may concern , and for future reference if necessary , he desired to be published in this journal , and a copy thereof to be forwarded to the Duke of Newcastle . His immediate reason for doing this at present , is , he says , because he is now the only surviving Chief of the five who treated with Lord Selkirk , and as there have been many misrepresentations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he passes off the earthly stage . " The following is his account , taken down at his own request , by one of the editors of this journal :  --  " ' This transaction happened a long long time ago . I am now a very old man  --  I was then in the prime and vigour of manhood . We were taken by surprise when , all of a sudden , those who came before , disembarked . We had not been apprised of the coming of the foreigners  --  when they landed , we were greatly surprised and wondered what they meant . We were in this neighbourhood at the time . They only spoke among themselves , while the agents of the North-west Company were here . We did not know what it meant , when they asked the North-westers into the plain . As soon as they were done speaking among themselves the cannons were fired . We said , " What can it mean ? It must be some great affair . " The apparent harmony of the two Companies did not last long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : they fought twice that summer . We wondered at their proceedings  --  meeting in friendly council together , and then , immediately after , taking each others ' lives ! " ' As soon as the fighting was over , the report came that Lord Selkirk had arrived at Fort William . The ensuing winter , I called together all the Indians round here  --  those at Red Lake , at the Manitobah , and at the mouth of the Red River ; I also invited the Crees on the Upper Assiniboine . " Come , " said I  --  " assemble here  --  come and listen  --  this great man can not be coming for nothing . " A large multitude had gathered here early in the spring , when the Earl arrived with 30 canoes . " ' The day after he arrived , about noon , he sent for us . There were many of us , and we all left our tents at his call , and marched to the place of conference . There lay before us six kegs . He said  --  " Friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a day was fixed for a Council . Two personages were appointed to meet us . On the day named , one gentleman arrived , the other did not . He said  --  " Let us do without him who did not come . " But the other soon came . " ' As soon as we had taken our seats , he said  --  " Friends , I have come to ask you about the lands , if you will give them to me . I do not want much  --  give what you choose . Will you give me as far from the river as you can distinguish the belly of a horse ? It is to put settlers here  - -  people far off , who have misery in their own country . This is why I want it . They will not trespass upon or spoil your lands that you retain outside of the limits I have named . I wish to put inhabitants upon it to cultivate the soil . I will endeavour to make the country like my own country . If I succeed in accomplishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from one end of the Settlement to the other , who will furnish you with goods . They will be at a little distance from each other , and you will have a chance of seeking out the best places for trading . All this I will do , if we can arrange about the land . " " ' We were five Chiefs . I represented this district , the other Chiefs , other districts . The Earl said to me  --  " Speak you first  --  how much land will you give me ? " I said  --  " I will speak last : let the others speak before me . " KITCHE OTTAWA ( Grand Courte-Oreille ) spoke first . He mentioned Riviere aux Rose Aux . The Earl made no reply to this ; whereupon the Chief mentioned as far as Pembina . The Earl said  --  Yes . Then he appealed to Mahkatayihkoonaya , Le Grand Noir , and asked what he would give . He said , from Pembina to Red Lake . Then he turned to La Robe Noir , who said as far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves for a little , and the end was a question from the Earl . Is there no stream about there which you could mention as a limit ? Mahkatayihkoonayai replied  --  Yes , there is la Riviere Champignon , a little beyond . The Earl said  --  There , that will be the limit . Then he asked Senna the Cree Chief , who said  --  No , I do not want agriculturists , I only want traders ! The Earl said  --  Do you think you will ever see your trader again ? ( referring to the North-West Company ) . Never : he ( the N. W. Co. ) has done a bad thing  --  he has killed people . The Earl added  --  Then you do not wish to get a load of powder , a knife or a steel from settlers ? Well , work diligently at the furs , and you will find a trader ( meaning the H. B. Co . ) . The nobleman then said to me  --  Your turn , speak . I said  --  This is my place . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Rapids ? I will then go below that . He said  --  a little further down , if you will . I replied  - -  Yes , I will give you to the bend of the river above Sugar Point . That point I like very much  --  I can not part with it  --  it is for my children . This satisfied the Earl , and he said further  --  Fear not : the people I plant here will not trouble your wild animals  --  they will merely work the soil . If they pass beyond the two-miles limit , do not allow them : they have no right there . At present we can not conclude the arrangement , for I have nothing to pay you with . Let us leave the matter as it stands . I will come back , and then we will close the negociations . I am in a hurry , and can not remain longer , but I will be sure to return . I want to go to the States and get cattle , that we may eat . That is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get some of our cattle when you see them with the inhabitants here . But before I leave , I would like to give you something in consideration of the arrangement , which is to be made when I come back . What would you like to have ? I said  --  Powder is useful to Indians , and tobacco they like  --  rum , too , they would fain have . We got what we asked . When we were done speaking , the Earl said  --  I want you to put your names to a paper , to show in England what we propose to do . We all said , No  --  wait till you come back . He asked us again to sign , but we refused , saying it would be time enough when the arrangement was completed . The Earl said  --  If your names were down , it would be easier for me to conclude the affair when I get back ; besides , your young men would see , in the event of your deaths , what you had proposed to do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . We did not see why he pressed us to sign ; but I now think it was in order to have us in his power , should he not do what he promised . He did not tell us what was in the paper , and I regret to say we did not even ask him what was in it . That was our ignorance . It was a great mistake , as after events showed ; Lord Selkirk never came back , and never completed the arrangements about the lands . Our lands have not been bought from us  --  we have not received payment for them . We got some things from time to time  --  small supplies  --  but less and less as time rolled along , until we got nothing . These little presents we looked upon as a consideration for the use of our land until a bargain should be properly made . Besides , we were friendly to the settlers , and often saved them from harm . We thought this also a reason why we got things . For my part , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , irrespective of the land . I was the means one time of saving Lord Selkirk 's life . When he was going off , some half-breeds wished to kill him  --  they asked us to take pemican to an ambush ahead . I refused , and prevented them doing it . The Earl thanked me for this . The things we got , I repeat , were not in payment for our lands . We never sold them . We only proposed to do so ; but the proposal was never carried out , as Lord Selkirk never came back . At the time we held council with him , there was no mention of the Hudson 's Bay Company . They were not spoken of , or taken into account at all . All of a sudden , some years afterwards , it turned out that they were claiming to be masters here . " ' And now I wish this statement to go across the waters to my great and good Mother , and I pray her to cause a proper settlement to be made with us for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children 's children , whose lands are being taken possession of by foreigners , may receive what is just and fair for the loss of their lands . I am old and feeble . I am the only surviving Chief of those who spoke to Lord Selkirk . I pray the great Mother , whose medal I have , to feel for us and help us . " ' ( Signed ) " WILLIAM KING . ' " I should like here to add a very interesting letter from the agent of the Hudson 's Bay Company in the United States :  --  " 52 , CEDAR STREET , NEW YORK , " 24th August , 1863 . " DEAR SIR , " If in addressing you , and expressing a sincere hope that you had a pleasant voyage to Liverpool per the steamer ' Scotia , ' I seem to take too much liberty , I beg your pardon , as it is not my nature to be intrusive ' . " A friend , knowing that I am interested in the fur and skin trade , handed me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Economist ' of 4th ulto. , calling my attention to the article headed ' The Hudson 's Bay Company . ' As you are interested in the ' International Financial Society , ' I thought it proper , even at this late date , to call your attention to the ignorance , if not malice , displayed by the editor . " He says : ' Civilization destroys wild animals , we all know . An eager trade destroys them , too . The moment they become either valuable to man , or disagreeable to man , they cease to live . ' This sounds very like Dr. Johnson , without Dr. Johnson : for any farmer , trapper , or trader knows , that as the United States territory becomes settled , furred animals increase , because the refuse of civilization  --  the hen-roosts , the corn-fields , &c.;  --  feed , directly and indirectly , the smaller animals , such as musquash , minks , foxes , racoons , opossums , skunks , and others ; but the larger animals , such as buffaloes , bears , wolves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilization were it not that they retire to the deserts , of which there will be enough for hundreds of years . Germany ( it is said ) produces more red-foxes than all America ; and wolves are plentiful in France . As to an ' eager trade , ' or excessive hunting , destroying wild animals , it is impossible . If the ' catch ' is excessive this year , the supply will exceed the demand , and prices will fall ; the hunt will be less eager next year , and the animals will increase . In the March sales in London this year , there were only 3,094 skunks , and the demand was greater than the supply , so that the price was as high as 7s. 2d. , which stimulated the United States collectors so much that very likely C. M. Lampson &; Co. will have about 100,000 in their September sale , and prices will very likely fall to 1s. , or lower . The result will be , that the skunks will live in peace , and increase and multiply for some years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' of animals to man ; but it is not , therefore , destroyed . I have a catalogue ( Row , Row , Goad &; Reece , brokers ) of a fur sale ( by the candle ) at the London Commercial Sale Room , Mincing Lane , on the 21st and 22nd March , 1821 , which I compare below with catalogues of fur sales in London on 27th and 28th January , and 2nd , 3rd , 4th , 5th , 6th , 9th , and 11th March , 1863 . I include January , because musquash and beaver are sold in that month . This statement does not embrace many other , but lesser , sales , which take place about the same time . A vast quantity goes direct from here to Germany , which , in past years , went to London . 1821 1863  --   --   --   --  300 Musquash 1,289,773 6,380 Bears 3,962 None Beaver 95,557 8,290 Otter 12,933 3,280 Fisher 5,485 108,850 Martens 66,827 10,340 Minks 25,989 8,190 Foxes 28,369 2,500 Wolves 3,322 370 Wolverines 918 57,100 Racoons 204,888 None Skunks 3,094 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lynx 4,276 2,285 Cats 100 " Do the above data of forty-two years prove his assertion , that ' the fur trade , by which old profits were made , is a peculiar trade , tending to disappear ' or do they prove the reverse ? The value or price of furs has steadily advanced also . " Again : ' The hunters in the Hudson 's Bay Company are as perishable a race as the animals hunted . ' Any trader knows this is false , except in the sense that we are all perishable . Applied to the United States Indians , it is true , from the cause assigned  --  rum  --  and worse causes  - -  the vices of civilization . The cost of transportation to any portion of the Hudson 's Bay territory heretofore has been so great that the rum used there must , to be profitable , be the purest that can be found , as there is water enough in Prince Rupert 's Land with which to dilute it : so that what the Indian gets will not hurt him . The rivers in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yellowstone , the Arkansas , the Platte , and others ) easily and cheaply carry ' rot-gut ' and death to the United States Indian . It seems to be the aim , and will be the gain , of the United States to exterminate the Indian ; it ought to be the aim , and would be the gain , of the ' International Financial Society ' to preserve him . " Again : ' The climate forbids effectual fertility , and the distance from more habitable regions forbids effectual transit . The regions to be colonized are mostly very cold and very barren . ' If such is the case , of what value , applied to the new Company , are his assertions : ' Civilization destroys wild animals , ' &c.,; and ' The hunters are as perishable , ' &c.?; The shareholders of the International Financial Society need have no fears of a failure of the fur trade , whatever may become of the ' sale of lands to new settlements , and the communication with British Columbia . ' " Again : ' In fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it is , is best accessible from the United States , and , in case of war , would be exposed to an inroad from Minnesota , which adjoins it , without the possibility of aid from England . ' If the editor would undertake to travel from St. Paul to Pembina ( about 600 miles ) , and also read the accounts of expeditions in pursuit of hostile Indians in Minnesota , he would quickly get rid of his fear of the Americans ever invading the British North Western Territory . One of my correspondents , an old Indian trader , writes me on the 30th ult. that he had just reached Pembina , after a ' dirty and disagreeable trip ' of 25 days from St. Paul . So long as the British Indians are treated as they have been , they could , and they would , sweep Minnesota clean of any army , even although as invincible as the ' army of the Potomac . ' Even if the redskins did not want help , the United States Indians would unite with the British Indians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " To my mind , the worst feature in the new Company is that of allowing a foreigner ( American ) to hold office . He owes allegiance to the United States , and his position gives him , knowledge which no American should possess . ' Blood is thicker than water , ' says the proverb . Besides , he has his own fur trade to attend to , and it is as true now , as it was in old times , that ' no man can serve two masters . ' Although he should withdraw from his own firm , still ' blood is thicker than water . ' As to the idea that , being in the fur trade , his experience and influence will benefit the new Company , will any furrier believe that ? If the new Company will sell all the furs they may have in their warehouse at the time of their regular sales , HOLDING BACK NONE TO RAISE PRICES , they will always have the confidence of the buyers , always get full value , and never require the influence or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself , not a shareholder in either the old or the new Company , but if I were , I would never rest satisfied while an American was in the management .

I suppose because it exposed their blunder , and attacked the Government . I had written both to the ' Pall Mall ' and ' Saturday Review ' in summer , pointing out that we had virtually surrendered our position by departing from the words of the Treaty of 1846 , on the American demand ; but for certain reasons they would not publish the letter , and you will observe that they now refrain from laying the blame on our Government . You must read carefully the articles in the ' Times ' of 18 , 25 and 26 October , and in the ' Standard ' of Saturday last . The ' Standard ' attacks our Government fairly and ably . You may give my name as the writer of the enclosed letter , but not for publication , as I do not wish to make an enemy of the ' Times .

The Duke of Sutherland and others with whom he had gained a footing , have given him the cold shoulder , and I hope you will , by some means or other , enlighten his friends at the Egyptian Embassy .
