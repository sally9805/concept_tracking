" Philosophy can bake no bread ; but she can procure for us God , Freedom , Immort ality. " - Nova is. *F HE apparent futility that has attended I all efforts to prove the immortality of man springs largely from the fact that a sense of immortality is an achievement in morals , and not an inference drawn by logical processes from the nature of things . It is not a demonstration to , or by , the reason , but a conviction gained through the spirit in the process of human life . All truth is an achievement . If you would have truth at its full value , go win it . If there is any truth whose value lies in a moral process , it must be sought by that process . Othd*r avenues will prove hard and uncertain , and will stop short of the goal . Eternal wisdom seems to say : If you would find immortal life , seek it in human life ; look neither into the heavens nor the earth , but into your own heart as it fulfills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minds for seeing and hearing truth , but beings set in a real world to achieve it . This is the secret of creation . But if demonstration can not yield a full sense of immortality , it does not follow that discussion and evidence are without value . Mind is auxiliary to spirit , and intellectual conviction may help moral belief . Doubts may be so heavy as to cease to be incentives , and become burdens . If there are any hints of immortality in the world or in the nature of man , we may welcome them . If there are denials of it that lose their force under inspection , we may clear our minds of them , for so we shall be freer to work out the only demonstration that will satisfy us . Whatever is here said upon this subject has for its end , not demonstration , but a clearing and paving of the way to that demonstration which only can be realized in the process of moral life - that is , by personal experience in a spirit of duty . Or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open and hospitable place for it in the domain of thought . This result would be nearly gained if it were understood how the idea of immortality came into the world . It can not be linked with the early superstitions that sprang out of the childhood of the race - with fetichism and polytheism and image-worship ; nor is it akin to the early thought that personified and dramatized the forces of nature , and so built up the great mythologies . These were the first rude efforts of men to find a cause of things , and to connect it with themselves in ways of worship and propitiation . But the idea of immortality had no such genesis . It is a late comer into the world . Men worshiped and propitiated long before they attained to a clear conception of a future life . A forecasting shadow of it may have hung over the early* races ; a voice not fully articulate may have1 uttered some syllable of it , and gained at last expression in theories of metempsychosis and visions of Nirvana ; but the doctrine of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the consciousness of the world with the growth of man ,  --  slowly and late ,  - -  and marked in its advent the stage of human history when man began to recognize the dignity of his nature . It does not belong to the childhood of the race , nor can it be classed with the dreams and guesses in which ignorance sought refuge , nor with the superstitions through which men strove to ally themselves with nature and its powers . It belongs to them neither in its history nor in its nature . It came with the full consciousness of selfhood , and is the product of man 's full and ripe thought ; it is not only not allied with the early superstitions , but is the reversal of them . These , in their last analysis , confessed man s subjection to nature and its powers , and shaped themselves into forms of expiation and propitiation ; they implied a low and feeble sense of his nature , and turned on his condition rather than on his nature-on a sense of the external world , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immortality is a triumph over nature - a denial of its forces . Man marches to the head and says : " I too am to be considered ; I also am a power ; I may be under the gods , but I claim for myself their destiny ; I am allied to nature , but I am its head , and will no longer confess myself to be its slave . " The fact of such an origin should not only separate it from the superstitions , where of late there has been a tendency to rank it , but secure for it a large and generous place in the world of speculative thought . We should hesitate before we contradict the convictions of any age that wear these double signs of development and resistance ; nor should we treat lightly any lofty assertions that man may make of // himself ; especially when thos@* assertions link themselves with truths of well-being and evident duty . The idea of immortality , thus achieved , naturally allies itself to religion , for a high conception of humanity is in itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and became also its atmosphere and its main postulate , its chief working factor and its ultimate hope . It is of one substance with Christianity - having the same conception of man ; it runs along with every duty and doctrine , tallying at every point ; it is the inspiration of the system ; each names itself by one synonym - life . Lodged thus in the conviction of the civilized world , the doctrine of immortality met with no serious resistance until it encountered modern science . It may have been weakened and obscured in the feature of personality by pantheistic conceptions that have prevailed from time to time , but pantheism never will prevail in a hurtful degree so long as it stands face to face with the freedom of our Western civilization . A slight infusion of it is wholesome , and necessary to correct an excessive doctrine of individualism , and to perfect the conception of God ; and it has never gone far enough in its one line to impair the substantial validity of the doctrine of immortality . We may repeat without hesitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Godhead found . " But when modern science - led by the principle of induction - transferred the thought of men from speculation to the physical world , and said , " Let us get at the facts ; let us find out what our five senses reveal to us , " then immortality came under question simply because science could find no data for it . Science , as soch , deals only with gases , fluids , and solids , with length , breadth , and thickness . In such a domain and amongst such phenomena no hint even of future existence can be found , and science could only say , " I find no report of it . " I do not refer more to the scientific class than to a scientific habit of thought that diffused itself throughout society , and became general by that wise and gracious contagion through which men are led to think together and move in battalions of thought ,  --  for so only can the powers of darkness be driven out . We do not to-day regret that science held itself so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it refused to leap chasms , and to let in guesses for the sake of morals . If it held to its path somewhat narrowly , it still went safely and firmly , and left no gaps in the mighty argument it is framing and will yet perfect . The severity and even bigotry that attended its early stages , even with its occasional apparent damage to morals , were the best preparation for the thoroughness of its future work . If its leaders - moved by the conviction that all truth is linked* together - at times forsook the field of the three dimensions , and spoke hastily of what might not lie beyond it , they are easily forgiven . When scientists and metaphysicians are found in each other 's camps , they are not to be regarded as intruders , even if they have not learned the pass-word , but rather as visitors from another corps of the grand army . The sappers and miners may undervalue the flying artillery , and the cavalry may gird at the builders of earthworks ; but as the campaign goes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and perhaps , in some dark night of defeat when the forces of the common enemy are pressing them in the rear , they will welcome the skill of those who can throw a bridge across the fatal river in front to the unseen shore beyond . But science has its phases and its progress . It held itself to its prescribed task of searching matter until it eluded its touch in the form of simple force - leaving it , so to speak , empty-handed . It had got a little deeper into the heavens with its lenses , and gone a little farther into matter with its retorts , but it had . come no nearer the nature of things than it was at the outset . I may cleave a rock once and have no proper explanation of it , but I know as little when I have cleaved it a thousand times and fused it in flame . In these researches of science many useful facts have been passed over to man , so that easier answer is given to the question , What shall we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came no nearer to an answer of those imperative questions which the human mind will ask until they are answered - Whence ? How ? For what ? Not what shall I eat and how shall I be clothed , but what is the meaning of the world ? explain me to myself ; tell me what sort of a being I am - how I came to be here , and for what end . Such are the questions that men are forever repeating to themselves , and casting upon the wise for possible answer . When chemistry put the key of the physical universe into the hand of science , it was well enough to give up a century to the dazzling picture it revealed . A century of concentrated and universal gaze at the world out of whose dust we are made , and whose forces play in the throbs of our hearts , is not too much ; but after having sat so long before the brilliant play of elemental flames , and seen ourselves reduced to simple gas and force under laws for whose strength adamant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and take up again the old questions . Science // has not explained us to ourselves , nor compassed us in its retort , nor measured us in its law of continuity . You have shown me of what I am made , how put together , and linked my action to the invariable energy of the universe ; now tell me what I am ; explain to me consciousness , will , thought , desire , love , veneration . I confess myself to be all you say , but I know myself to be more ; tell me what that more is . Science , in its early and wisely narrow sense , could not respond to these demands . But it has enlarged its vocation under two impulses . It has pushed its researches until it has reached verges beyond which it can not go , yet sees forces and phenomena that it can not explain nor even speak of without using the nomenclature of metaphysics . In a recent able work of science the word " spirit " is adopted into the scientific vocabulary . Again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with other sciences-finding itself on their borders . Chemistry led up to biology , and this in turn to psychology , and so on to sociology and history and religion , and even to metaphysics , whose tools it had used with some disdain of their source . In short , it is found that there is no such thing as a specific science , but that all sciences are parts of one universal science . The broad studies of Darwin and Herbert Spencer have done mPch toward establishing this conviction , which has brought about what may be called * comity of the sciences , or an era of good feeling . The chemist sits down by the metaphysician and says , Tell me what you know about consciousness ; and the theologian listens eagerly to the story of evolution . Unless we greatly misread the temper of recent science , it is ready to pass over certain phenomena it has discovered and questions it has raised to theology . And with more confidence we may assert that theology is parting with the conceit it had assumed as " queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humility-is ready to accept a report from any who can aid it in its exalted studies . This comity between the sciences , or rather necessary correlation , not only leads to good feeling and mutual respect , but insures a recognition of each other 's conclusions . Whatever is true in one must be true in all . Whatever is necessary to the perfection of one can not be ruled out of another . That which is true in man s spiritual life must be true in his social life ; and whatever is true in social life must not contradict anything in his physical life . We might reverse this , and say that no true physiologist will define the physical man so as to exclude the social man ; nor will he so define the social and political man as to shut out the spiritual man ; nor will he so define the common humanity as to exclude personality . He will leave a margin for other sciences whose claims are as valid as those of his own . If , for example , immortality is a necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its content ,  --  the chemist and physiologist will not set it aside because they find no report of it in their fields . If it is a part of spiritual and moral science , it can not be rejected because it is not found in physical science . So much , at least , has been gained by the new comity in the sciences ,  - -  that opinions are respected , and questions that belong to other departments are relegated to them in a scientific spirit . But this negative attitude of natural science toward immortality does not by any means describe its relation to the great doctrine . The very breadth of its studies has made it humble and tolerant of hypothesis in other fields . It is parting with a narrow and confining positivism , and is keenly alive to the analogies and sweep of the great truths it has discovered-truths which , as science , it can not handle . More than this : while it has taught us to distrust immortality , because it could show us no appearance of it , it has provided us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ namely , the principle of reversing appearances . The whole work of natural science might be described under this phr*ase ; it has laid hold of the physical universe and shown that the reality is unlike that which first appears . It has thus bred a fine , wholesome skepticism which is the basis of true knowledge and of progress . Once men said , This is as it appears ; to-day they say , The reality is not according to the first appearance , but is probably the reverse . The sky seems solid ; the sun seems to move ; the earth seems to be at rest , and to be flat . Science has reversed these appearances and beliefs . But the Copernican revolution was simply the beginning of an endless process , and science has done little since but exchange Ptolemaic appearance for Copernican reality , and the process is commonly marked by reversal . Matter seems to be solid and at rest ; it is shown to be the contrary . The energy of an active agent seems to end with disorganization , but it really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The appearance in nature is nearly always , not false , but illusive , and our first interpretations of natural phenomena usually are the reverse of the reality . Of course this must be so ; it is the wisdom of creation - the secret of the world ; else knowledge would be immediate and without process , and man a mere eye for seeing . Nature puts the reality at a distance // and hides it behind a veil , and it is the office of mind in its relation to matter to penetrate the distance and get behind the veil ; and to make the process valuable in the highest degree , this feature of contrariety is put into nature . What greater achievement has mind wrought than to turn the solid heavens into empty space , and fix the moving sun in the heavens , and round the flat world into a sphere ? Truth is always an achievement , and it becomes such by reversing appearance - turning rest into motion , solids into fluids , centers into orbits , breaking up inclosing firmaments into infinite spaces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance ; science. - more than any other teacher - tells it that it may not . But it is this premature confidence in first appearance that induces skepticism of immortality . No one wishes to doubt it ; our inmost soul pleads for it ; our higher nature disdains a denial of it as ignoble . No poet , no lofty thinker suffers the eclipse of it to fall upon his page , but many a poet and thinker , is - nay , are we not all ? - tormented by a horrible uncertainty cast by the appearance of dissolving nature , and rei*nforced by the blank silence of science ? The heavens are empty ; the earth is resolving back to firemist ; what theater is there for living man ? Thought and emotion are made one with the force of the universe , shut up for a while in a fleeting organism . What is there besides it ? Brought together out of nature , sinking back into nature ,  --  has man any other history ? What , also , is so absolute in its appearance as death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast locked is the door of the grave . How speechless the speaking lips ; how sightless the seeing eye ; how still the moving form . Touch the cold hand ; cry to the ear ; crown the brow with weed or with flower-they are alike to it . It is an awful appearance ; is it absolute-final ? Say what we will , here is the source of the dread misgiving that haunts the mind of the age . Science has helped to create it , but it also has discovered its antidote . The minister of faith stands by this horrible appearance and says : " Not here , but risen . " He might well be joined by the priest of science with words like these : " My vocation is to wrest truth out of illusive appearances . I do not find what you claim ; I find instead an appearance of the contrary ; but on that very principle you may be right ; the truth is generally the reverse of the appearance . " I do not advance this as an argument , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of death under Ptolemaic illusion ; we have not yet learned the secret of the world , the order of truth - inverting the landscape in the lens of the eye that the mind may get a true picture . To break away from the appearance of death - this is the imperative need ; and whatever science may say in detail , its larger word and also its method justify us in the effort . Hence the need of the imaginative eye and of noble thought . Men of lofty imagination are seldom deceived by death , surmounting more easily the illusions of sense . Victor Hugo probably knows far less of science than do Biichner and Vogt , but he knows a thousand things they have not dreamed of , which invest their science like an atmosphere , and turn its rays in directions unknown to them . Goethe was a man of science , but he was also a poet , and did not go amiss on this subject . I pass now to more positive ground - speaking still of science , for the antagonist of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from science that permeates common thought . Assuming evolution ,  --  it matters not now what form of it , except the extremest which is not worthy of the name of science ,  --  I remark that the process of development creates a skepticism at every stage of its progress so great that one has no occasion even to hesitate when the claim of immortality is made . Doubt has so often broken down that it is no longer wise to doubt . Improbability has so often given way to certainty and fact that it becomes almost a basis of expectation . One who traces evolution step by step , and sees one wonder follow another , should be prepared at the end to say , " I will wonder no longer at anything ; I have turned too many sharp corners to be surprised at another . " Take your stand at any stage of evolution , and the next step is no stranger , no more to be anticipated , it is no broader leap than that from death to future life . Plant yourself at any given stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and report what you can see ahead . Go back to the time when the swirl of fire-mist was drawing into spheres and predicate future life ;  --  the raging elements laugh you to scorn . Life from fire - no dream of metempsychosis is so wild as that . You detect a law of progress ; but to what are you now listening- to the elements or to mind ? The elements can tell you nothing , but mind detects a law in the elements that affords a ground for expectation . The appearance silences you ; the hint leads you on , and you become perhaps a very credulous and unscientific believer , confronted by entirely scientific facts to the contrary . If one is skeptical of the reality of the spiritual world on scientific grounds , or on the score of simple improbability , the best practi // cal advice that can be given him is  --  to transport himself back into early geologic or chemic ages , and then attempt to use a positive philosophy to find out what shall or shall not be , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the development of life from nebulous fire is a fact so immensely improbable , that mind can not be conceived of as accepting it . Take later contrasts ,  - -  the headless mollusk glued to rock in a world of water , and an antlered deer in a world of verdure ; or the huge monsters of the prime , and thinking man . Here are gulfs across which contemporaneous imagination can not leap , but looking back we see that they have been crossed , and by a process of orderly development . We see the process and the energy by which it was wrought , but of the source of the process or of the energy we know nothing until we postulate it . But , shut off as we are at every stage of the process from the next by its improbability , and only able to accept it as we look back upon it , and even then with an essential unknown factor at work ,  --  what right have we , with so confounding a history behind us , to cut it short and close it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we not rather taught to expect other wonders ? I am quite ready to hear the answer of science , that the process under which immortality is claimed is unlike that of development ,  --  that it can not be gained under the same laws nor according to the same method . Evolution dbes not spare the individual nor the class . Life , as we see it , is a functional play of something - we know not what - set in favorable relations to an environment , and ending when the relations become unfavorable . When environment ceases to play well into the organization , and the organization fails to adjust itself to the changing environment , life ends ; and the life of that organization can not go on because it was simply a thing of relations which have been destroyed . This seems logical , and would be final if all the factors and all their processes were embraced and understood in the argument . This , we claim , is not the case , but , on the contrary , claim that there are factors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another history . Science responds : This is all we find ; we can not go outside of the facts and the processes . Life is a functional play of something - we know not what ; but , not knowing it , we have no right to deal with it , and so set it aside . This is the crucial point upon which immortality as a speculative question turns . Shall it be silenced in its claim on such evidence ? Is there no higher tribunal , of wider powers and profounder wisdom , before which it may plead its eternal cause ? We turn to that which is the substantial method of all ages - the necessary habit of the human mind - to philosophy . We now have the grave question whether we are to be limited in our thought and belief by the dicta of natural science . In accounting for all things , are we shut up to matter and force and their phenomena ? Science as positivism says : Yes , because matter and force are all we know , or can know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all things- thought , and will , and consciousness ; a position denied by still another school , which admits the existence of something else , but claims that it is unknowable . If any one of these positions is admitted , the question we are considering is an idle one , so far as demonstration is concerned ; it is even decided in the negative . The antagonist to these positions is metaphysics . Faith may surmount , but it can not confute them without the aid of philosophy . And how goes the battle ? I think an impartial judge of this friendly conflict , in which a man is often arrayed against himself , would say that metaphysics not only holds , but is master of the field . At least , science is speechless before several fundamental questions that itself has put into the mouth of philosophy . Science begins with matter in a homogeneous state of diffusion ,  --  that is , at rest and without action , either eternally so , or as the result of exhausted force . Now , whence comes force ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phrase " an unknowable cause , " which is a contradiction of terms , since a cause with a visible result is so far forth known . Again , there are mathematical formuke , or thought , in the stars , and in matter , as in crystallization . The law or thought of gravitation necessarily goes before its action . What is the origin of this law as it begins to act ? - and why does it begin to act in matter at rest ? - a double question to which science renders no answer except to the latter part , which it solves by polarization ; but this is simply putting the tortoise under the elephant . Again , evolution , as interpreted by all the better schools of science , admits teleology or an end in view ; and the end is humanity . But the teleological end was present when the nebulous matter first began to move . In what did this purpose then reside ? - in the nebulous matter , or in some mind outside of matter and capable of the conception of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action of the brain to consciousness ? Science does not undertake to answer , but confesses that the chasm is impassable from its side . // What , then , shall we do with the fact and phenomena of consciousness ? Again , what right has science , knowing nothing of the origin of force , and therefore not understanding its full nature ,  --  what right has it to limit its action and its potentiality to the functional play of an organism ? As science it can , of course , go no farther ; but , with an unknown factor , on what ground can it make a negative and final assertion as to the capability of that factor ? Again , you test and measure matter by mind ; but if matter is inclusive of mind , how can matter be tested and measured by it ? It is one clod or crystal analyzing another ; it is getting into the scales along with the thing you would weigh . These are specimens of the questions that philosophy puts to science - or rather , as I prefer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one 's five senses . The observing senses are silent before the thinking mind . But these questions are universal and imperative . No further word of denial or assertion can be spoken . until they are answered . And as science does not answer them , philosophy undertakes to do so , and its answer is-Theism . The universe requires a creating mind ; it rests on mind and power . Metaphysics holds the field , and on its triumphant banner is the name of God . Science might also be pressed into close quarters as to the nature of this thing that it calls mailer , which it thinks it can see and feel ; and how it sees and feels it , it does not know . When Sir William Thompson - led by a hint of Faraday 's - advances the theory that all the properties of matter probably are attributes of motion , a surmise is awakened if matter be not a mere semblance or phantasm ; and if force , or that which creates force , is not the only reality - a true substance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . Under this theory of advanced science , it is no longer spirit that seems vague , illusive , unreal , but matter-slipping away into modes of motion , dissolving into mere activity , and so shading off toward some great Reality that is full of life and energy-not matter , and therefore spirit . Science itself has led up to a point where matter , and not God , becomes the unknowable . A little further struggle through this tangle of matter , and we may stand on a " peak of Darien " in " wild surmise " before the ocean of the Spirit . The final word which the philosophical man within us addresses to our scientific man is this : Stop when you come to what seems to you to be an end of man ; and for this imperative reason , namely , you do not claim that you have compassed him ; you find in him that which you can not explain-something that lies back of energy and function , and is the cause or ground of the play of function . You admit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is not tissue nor the action of tissue , and therefore may have some other ground of action ; you admit an impassable chasm between brain-action and consciousness . What right has science as science to leap that chasm with a negative in its hand ? And why should science object to attempts to bridge the chasm from the other side ? Physical science has left unexplained phenomena ; may no other science take them up ? Science has left an entity- a something that it has felt but could not grasp , just as it has felt but could not grasp the ether . May not the science that gave to physics the ether try its hand at this unexplained remainder ? Let us have , then , no negative assertions ; this is the bigotry of science . But a generous-minded science will pass over this mystery to psychology , or to metaphysics , or to theology . If it is a substance , it has laws . If it is force or a life , it has an environment and a correspondence . If it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment ; and if the correspondence is perfect and the environment ample enough , this mind and spirit may have a commensurate history . This is logical , and also probable , even on the ground of science , for all its analogies indicate and sustain it . My conclusion is this : Until natural science can answer these questions put by other sciences , it has no right to assume the solution of the problem of immortality , because this question lies within the domain of the unanswered questions . Not to the Trojan belongs the wounded immortal Diomed , but to the Greek , who vindicates the claim of his heart by the strength of his weapons . BUT has science no positive word to offer ? The seeming antagonist of immortality during its earlier studies of evolution , it now seems , in its later studies , about to become an ally . It suddenly discovered that man was in the category of the brutes and of the whole previous order of development . It is now more than suspecting that , although in that order , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merged in it , and exempts him from a full action of its laws , and therefore presumably from its destinies . It has discovered that because man is the end of development he is not wholly in it  --  the product of a process , and for that very reason cut off from the process . What thing is there that is made by man , or by nature after a plan and for an end , that is not separated from the process when it is finished , set in entirely // different relations and put to different uses ? When we build a wagon , we gather metal and wood , bring them together , forge , hew , fit , and paint till it is made ; but we do not then break it into pieces , cast the iron into the forge and the timber into the forest ; we trundle it out of the shop and put it to its uses which have little to do with the processes by which it was framed ,  --  made under one set of laws but used under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing done is to sever the cord that binds it to its origin and through which it became what it is . And what is creation with its progressive and orderly development ,  --  heat acting upon matter overshadowed by the Spirit ; then a simple play of forces ; at length a quickening into life , and then a taking on of higher and more complex forms , till at last the hour comes and man is born into the world ,  --  what is creation but a divine incubation or gestation within the . womb of eternity ? The thought is startling , but I disclaim a rhetorical interpretation and offer it as a generalization of science . What then ? The embryotic condition and processes and laws are left behind , and man walks forth under the heavens - the child of the stars and of the earth , born of their long travail , their perfect and only offspring . Now he has new conditions , new laws , new methods and ends of his own . Now we have the image of the creating God  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such conclusions that recent science is leading . Nowhere have they been indicated so clearly and ably as in the recent work of Professor Fiske , " The Destiny of Man . " It is indeed meager , though not weak , as a plea for immortality , not touching fields where the considerations are strongest , the moral nature and history of man ; but it meets successfully and unanswerably the main point which , if not met , renders all after arguments vain , or leaves them in an empirical state . The march of Hannibal into Italy was a triumph of military genius , but the difficult part was a few miles on the summit of the St. Bernard pass . Mr. Fiske 's book conducts us over the Alps of the question . The imperative requirement is to take man out of the category of physical nature and the process of evolution as it has been going on , and put him into another category , and under laws that are . the reverse of those heretofore acting in material and brute development . The author I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his confr ? res in science usually indulge in . Briefly stated , the thought is this : Man is the end or product that nature had in view during the whole process of evolution ; when he is produced , the process ceases , and its laws either end at once VOL . XXX. - 8. or gradually , or take on a form supplementary to other laws , or are actually reversed . Thus , the struggle for existence ceases , and a moral or humane law of preservation takes its place . The secret of history is the dethronement of the strong by the weak , or rather the introduction of a force by which the meek become the inheritors and rulers of the earth . Natural selection gives way to intelligent choice . Instinct ends , and thought determines action . The whole brute inheritance is being gradually thrown off ; its methods constitute evil - the serpent whose head the seed of woman is bruising and shall finally crush . The imperative conclusion follows that man is not to be regarded as in the process , nor under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order from which he has been evolved or created . The leaden suggestion of nature , as it destroyed the individual and the type , no longer has even scientific weight . The thing that has been is the very thing that shall not be ; and Tennyson , with this fresh page of science before him , could now stretch out towards his great hope hands no longer lame , and gather something more than dust and chaff as he calls to the Lord of all ; for it is the appearance and analogy of nature that crush our hope . But science itself bids us turn our back upon physical nature , or but look to it to find that we are no longer of it . The importance of this generalization or revelation of science can not be exaggerated . Canon Mozley , in his great sermon on Eternal Life , says substantially , " It does not matter how we came to be what we are ; we are what we are , " and from that builds up his masterly argument for immortality . Still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by our previous history or freed from it . It is possible , indeed , to scale the heights of our hope burdened with the clay out of which we were made ; but why bear it , when friendly science offers to take it off ? Besides , man is a logical being , and he can not be induced to leave unexplained phenomena behind him , nor to leap chasms in his thought ; nor will he build the heavenly city upon reason while it is confused by its relations to physical nature . So freed , we have man as mind and spirit , evolved or created out of nature , but no longer correlated to its methods ,  --  correlated instead to contrasting methods ,  --  face to face with laws and forces hitherto unknown or but dimly shadowed , moving steadily in a direction opposite to that in which he was produced . Receiving man thus at the hands of science , what shall we do with him but pass him over into the world to the verge of which science has brought him - the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has become // 74 a true person . What now ? The end of the demiurgic strife reached , its methods cease . Steps lead up to the apex of the pyramid . What remains ? What , indeed , but flight , if man be found to have wings ? Or does he stand for a moment on the summit , exulting in his emergence from nature , only to roll back into the dust at its base ? There is a reason why the reptile should become a mammal : it is more life . Is there no like reason for man ? Shall he not have more life ? If not , then to be a reptile is better than to be a man , for it can be more than itself ; and man , instead of being the head of nature , goes to its foot . The dream of pessimism becomes a reality , justifying the remark of Schopenhauer that consciousness is the mistake and malady of nature . If man becomes no more than he now is , the whole process of gain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on itself and reverses its order . The benevolent purpose , seen at every stage as it yields - to the next , stops its action , dies out , and goes no farther . The ever-swelling bubble of existence , that has grown and distended till it reflects the light of heaven in all its glorious tints , bursts on the instant into nothingness . The question is , whether such considerations are subjects for thought ; whether they have in them an element of reason that justifies a conclusion ; whether they are phenomena , and may be treated scientifically ; whether they do not address us in a way as impressive as physical science could address us at any particular stage of evolution . Having thought up to this point and found always a path leading through the improbabilities of the future , shall we think no longer because we face other improbabilities ? We can not , indeed , think facts out of existence - the world is real ; but natural science justifies us in regarding man as under the laws of the intellectual and moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown us the chemical coming under the subjection of the dynamic , and the dynamic yielding to the organic , and the organic , with man in it and over it , working miracles of his own - a power over nature , under laws that are neither chemical nor dynamic nor organic , but creative in their essence and spiritual in their force . He is therefore to be measured , not by the orders behind him , but by that into which he has come . Proceeding now under theistic conceptions , I am confident that our scientific self goes along with our reasoning self when I claim that the process of evolution at every step and in every moment rests on God , and draws its energy from God . The relation , doubtless , is organic , but no less are its proc esses conscious , voluntary , creative acts . Life was crowded into the process as fast as the plan admitted ; it was life and more life till the process culminated in man  --  the end towards which it had been steadily pressing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expectation that God will croWn his continuous gift of life with immortal life . When , at last , he has produced a being who is the image of himself , who has full consciousness and the creative will , who can act in righteousness , who can adore and love and commune with his Creator , there is a reason  --  and if there is a reason there will be found a method-why the gift of immortal life should be conferred . God has at last secured in man the image of himself-an end and solution of the whole process . Will he not set man in permanent and perfect relations ? Having elaborated his jewel till it reflects himself , does he gaze upon it for a briefer moment than he spent in producing it , and then cast it back into elemental chaos ? Science itself forces upon us the imperious question , and to science also are we indebted for a hopeful answer-teaching us at last that we are not bound to think of man as under the conditions and laws that produced him ,  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Such is the logic of evolution , and we could not well do without it . But we must follow it to its conclusions . Receiving at its hands a Creating Mind working by a teleological process toward man as the final product , we are bound to think consistently of these factors ; nor may we stop in our thought and leave them in confusion . If immortality seems a difficult problem , the denial or doubt of it casts upon us one more difficult . We have an intelligent Creator starting with such elements as cosmic dust , and proceeding in an orderly process that may be indicated under Darwin 's five laws , or Wallace 's more pronounced theism , or Argyll 's or Naudin 's theory of constant creative energy ,  --  it matters not which be followed ,  - -  developing the solid globe ; then orders of life that hardly escape matter ; then other orders that simply eat and move and procreate ; and so on to higher forms , but always aiming at man , for " the clod must think , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  all pressing steadily toward man , for whom the process has gone on and in whom it ends , because he-being what he is - turns on these very laws that produced him and reverses their action . The instincts have died out ; for necessity there is freedom ; for desire there is conscience ; natural selection is lost in intelligence ; the struggle for existence is checked and actually reversed // and the strong perish unless they protect the weak . A being who puts a contrast on all the ravening creation behind him , and lifts his face toward the heavens in adoration , and throws the arms of his saving love around all living things , and so falls into sympathetic affinity with God himself and becomes a conscious creator of what is good and true and beautiful- such is man . What will God do with this being after spending countless eons in creating him ? what will God do with his own image ? is the piercing question put to reason . I speak of ideal man - the man that has been and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rule over it in the sovereign power of love and goodness . How much of time , what field of existence and action , will God grant to this being ? The pulses of his heart wear out in less than a hundred years . Ten years are required for intelligence to replace the loss of instinct , so that relatively his full life is briefer than that of the higher animals . A quarter of his years is required for physical and mental development ; a half - perchance a little more - is left for work and achievement , and the rest for dying . And he dies saying : I am the product of eternity , and I can return into eternity ; I have lived under the inspiration of eternal life , and I may claim , it ; I have loved my God , my child , my brother man , and I know that love is an eternal thihg . It has so announced itself to me , and I pass into its perfect and eternal realization . Measure this being thus , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitiful three score and ten is a reasonable existence . There is no proportion between the production of man and the length of his life ; it is like spending a thousand years in building a pyrotechnic piece that burns against the sky for one moment and leaves the blackness of a night never again to be lighted . Such a destiny can be correlated to no possible conception of God nor of the world except that of pessimism-the philosophy of chaos - the logic that assumes order to prove disorder - that uses consciousness to show that it is a disease . But any rational conception of God forces us to the conclusion that he will hold on to the final product of his long creative struggle . If man were simply a value , a fruit of use , an actor of intelligence , a creator of good , he would be worth preserving ; but if God loves man and man loves God , and so together they realize the ultimate and highest conception of being and destiny , it is impossible to believe that the knife of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man to fall back into elemental flames ; for , if we do not live when we 75 die , we pass into the hands of oxygen . Perhaps it is our destiny - it must be under some theories ; but it is not yet necessary under any accredited theory of science or philosophy to conceive of God as a Moloch burning his children in his fiery arms , nor as a Saturn devouring his own offspring . I am well aware that just here a distinction is made that takes off the edge of these horrible conclusions ,  --  namely , that humanity survives though the individual perishes . This theory , which is not recent , had its origin in that phase of nature which showed a constant disregard of the individual and a steady care for the type or class . It found its way from science into literature , where it took on the form of lofty sentiment and became almost a religion . It is a product of the too hasty theory that we may carry the analogies of nature over into the world of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though they compassed him . Science no longer does this , but the blunder lives on in literature and the every-day thought of the world . But suppose it were true that the individual perishes and humanity survives , how much relief does it afford to thought ? It simply lengthens the day that must end in horrible doom . For the question recurs , how long will humanity continue ? For long , indeed , if man can preserve the illusion of immortality and the kindred illusions of love and duty and sacrifice that go with it , and can be kept apart from an altruism that defeats itself by cutting the nerve of personality . Humanity will stay long upon the earth if love and conscience are fed by their proper and only sustaining inspirations ; but even then how long will the earth entertain that golden era when the individual shall peacefully live out his allotted years , and yield up the store of his life to the general fund of humanity , in the utter content of perfect negation ? I might perhaps make a total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down with the pessimists sooner than sacrifice myself for a temporary good ; the total can not be correlated to the temporary . If such sacrifice is ever made , it is the insanity of self-estimate , or rather is the outcome of an unconscious sense of a continuous life . How long do I live on in humanity ? Only till the crust of the earth becomes a little thicker , and days and nights grow longer , and the earth sucks the air into its interlunar caves** - now a sister to the moon . Chaos does not lie behind this world , but ahead . The picture of the evolution of man through " dragons of the prime " is not so dreadful as that foreshadowed when the world shall have grown old , and environment no longer favors full life . HumanIMMORTALITY // ity may mount high , but it must go down and reverse the steps of its ascent . Its lofty altruism will die out under hard conditions ; the struggle for existence will again resume its sway , and hungry hordes will fish in shallowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dying world , breathing a thin atmosphere under which man shrinks towards inevitable extinction . Science paints the picture , but reason disdains it as the probable outcome of humanity . The future of this world as the abode of humanity is a mystery , though not wholly an unlighted one ; but under no possible conception can the world be regarded as the theater of the total history of the race . A modification of this view is the theory that sets aside personality and asserts a return of the individual life into God . Mr. Emerson in his essay , the suggestive value of which is very great , says : " I confess that everything connected with our personality fails . " - It would be easy to quote Emerson against himself , but that were no gain . He wrote this sentence too early to have the advantage of recent science . Jn that play of nature on which he fixed his gaze years before Darwin , he saw indeed that " nature never spares the individual , " but his prophetic soul did not reveal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as now given , tells us that when man is reached in the process of development nature does spate the individual , or , more properly , the person . It is the very thing nature has been aiming at all along , namely , to produce a person and then preserve him . The whole trend of the laws in social and intelligent humanity is toward securing a full personality , and a defense and perpetuity of it . Emerson apparently never caught sight of the fact that in humanity there is a reversal of those laws by which matter and brute-life led up to man . He looked at nature more closely than Plato dared , and was dazzled . This altruism that assumes for itself a loftier morality in its willingness to part with personality and live on simply as influence and force , sweetening human life and deepening the blue of heaven ,  --  a view that colors the pages of George Eliot and also some unfortunate pages of science ,  --  is one of those theories that contains within itself its own refutation . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general good ; it is but selfish to claim existence for self . It may be , indeed , but not if personality has attained to the law of love and service . Person*ility may not only reverse the law of selfishness , but it is the only condition under which it can be wholly reversed . If I can remain a person , I can love and serve ,  - -  I may be a perpetual generator of love and service ; but if I cease to exist , I cease to create them , and leave a mere echo or trailing influence thinning out into an unmeaning universe . Such an altruism limits the use and force of character to the small opportunity of human life ; it is so much and no more , however long it may continue to act ; but the altruism of ideal and enduring personality continues to act forever , and possibly on an increasing scale . This altruism of benevolent annihilation cuts away the basis of its action . It pauperizes itself by one act of giving - breaks its bank in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the difficulties in the way of immortality , but quite another thing to erect annihilation into morality ; and it is simply a blunder in logic to claim for such morality a superiority over that of those who hope to live on , wearing the crown of personality that struggling nature has placed on their heads , and serving its Author for ever and ever . The simple desire to live is neither moral nor immoral , but the desire to live for service and love is the highest morality and the only true altruism . I shall not follow the subject into those fields , of human life and spiritual experienceit being a beaten path - where the assurances of immortality mount into clear vision , my aim having been to lessen the weight of the physical world as it hangs upon us in our upward flight . We can not cut the bond that binds us to the world by pious assertion , nor cast it off by ecstatic struggles of the spirit , nor unbind it by any half-way processes of logic , nor by turning our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path behind us if we would have a possible one before us . There are three chief realities , no one of which can be left out in attempts to solve the problem of destiny : man , the world , and God . We must think of them in an orderly and consistent way . One reality can not destroy nor lessen the force of another . If there has been apparent conflict in the past , it now seems to be - drawing to a close ; the world agrees with theism , and matter no longer denies spirit . 1f at one time , matter threatened to possess the universe and include it under its laws , it has withdrawn its claim , and even finds itself driven to mind and to spirit as the larger factors of its own problems . Mind now has full liberty to think consistently of itself and of God , and , with such liberty , it finds itself driven to the conclusion of immortality by every consideration of its nature and by every fact of its condition ,  --  its only refuge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  knowing ourselves to be what we are ,  --  but out of the mystery of ourselves , may we draw this sublime hope ; for we are correlated not only to the known , but to the unknown . The spirit transcends the visible , and by dream , by vision , by inextinguishable desire , by the un ceasing cry of the conscious creature for the Creator , by the aspiration after perfection , by the pressure of evil and by the weight of sorrow , penetrates the realms beyond , knowing there must be meaning and purpose and end for the mystery that it is .
