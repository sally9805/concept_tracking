ARTICLE V.-HORACE BUSHNELL . Life and Letters of brace Bashnell . New York : Harper &amp; Brothers . THIS volume meets a long and deep felt and widely experienced want . The name of Horace Bushnell is one of the great names of modern theological literature , and one destined to become still greater and more widely honored as his quickening thought penetrates more deeply the thought and theology of the age . To some this name is , or has been , one of reproach and heresy , cast out as evil , as that of all good and great reformers has been ,  --  as that of the divine Master and of his first disciples were ,  --  the disturber of the churches , and the great antagonist of orthodoxy . To many it is that of a brilliant but erratic genius , of unsurpassed intellectual force and acumen , a thoughtful and eloquent preacher , a fi-esh and original writer , whose words have a wondrously vital and quickening power , beyond all rhetoric to explain ,  --  a deep feeling and poetic soul , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a poet , and who carried the imaginings and fancies of poetry into the realm of religious truth , mistaking often , his own visions and poetic , conceptions for divine revelations and the truth of God . To a few , and a continually increasing number , he is no mere heretic , or poetic dreamer , and not simply a writer of genius and an eloquent divine , but a great religious teacher and reformer , a true prophet and interpreter of the ways of God , one of the few raised up and inspired of God to enlarge the boundaries of truth by discovering and exploring new continents in the world of revelation ; as Columbus enlarged those of geography , and Copernicus and Newton of science , and Augustine , and Luther , and Edwards of theology , which discoveries necessarily displaced and reconstructed the old boundaries of knowledge . We are aware that to those who hold the assumption that all religious truth and doctrine is immutably fixed by the // decrees and creeds of councils , such a claim must seem preposterous ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God bath more truth yet to break forth ont of His holy word , " beyond what Luther and Calvin taught ; or with that other puritan , John , that inspiration is a gift still to be sought and obtained " by devout prayer to that Eternal Spirit who can enrich with all utterance and knowledge , and sends out his seraphim , with the hallowed fire of his altar , to touch and purify the lips of whom he pleases . " That this prophetic gift , the illumination of the Spirit to discern , and the power of utterance to declare divine truth , was vouchsafed to Horace Bushnell , if to any in modern times , no thoughtful and unprejudiced reader of this memoir will be disposed to question . He will here see by what divine methods of inward leading and outward discipline this great and good man was led to be what he was , and to hold and teach just those views of truth and Christian doctrine which he did . He will see the close and vital connection between his religious experience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devout meditation and a close and holy walk with God , and those doctrines which have given so much offence to the mere theologian ; a connection as close and legitimate , we venture to affirm , as the theology of Paul held to the revelation of the Son of God within him , or as the profound and mystical utterances of John held to his more intimate and spiritual knowledge of Jesus on whose bosom he leaned . Here , too , he will see the reason of that profound admiration and love which his friends felt and still feel towards him ; which is not wholly accounted for by the subtle magnetism with which every man of tine genius attracts an ( l holds other minds ; which can only be explained by the presence of that quality which held the disciples of Socrates to their teacher , and was seen in its supreme measure in the reverent affection with which the eleven disciples clung to their great Master . For it is not necessary to suppose that any dogmatic belief in his divinity held them to his person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repelled them in awe ;  --  but superior wisdom and spiritual force mingled with pure goodness and greatness of soul , is of // itself a divine quality which inevitably either attracts and holds men , if they believe in it and have intellectual and moral sympathy with it , or repels them if they have not ; makes the most devoted of friends or the bi'tterest of enemies . The revelation here made of Dr. Bushnell 's inward life and character , unlike many so-called great men of the literary sort , so far from discounting our impression of his greatness or his genius , adds immeasurably to its depth and power , by disclosing the genuineness of its quality . We see that there was nothing artificial or strained or hollow within , below the surface of the man or behind his outward life , but that he was through and through the same original , unique , outgoing power ; a genius absolutely without an equal in its combined intellectual , spiritual and practical energy ; an earnest , sincere , and great soul , simple and tender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the daylight in the expression of his real thought , and withal as playful in the delicacy of its artistic touch and coloring ; as much a hero to his domestics and children as to his outmost admirers , and even more great and admirable because they saw and felt more of the real man . Of the execution of this memoir we wish to speak a word before coming to its contents . It is the work chiefly of a daughter of Dr. Bushnell , Mis . Mary Bushnell Cheney , aided by a few others most competent to assist in so important and sacred a task . Besides the able contribution of Dr. Leonard Bacon reviewing the Bushnell controversy , originally prepared for this memoir and afterward published in the New JJnglander for September , 1879 , interesting reminiscences are furnished by the IRev . Dr. Bartol , his intimate and life-long friend , and by Bishop Clark , formerly rector of Christ Church , Hartford , also by others who knew him in his earlier days . The IRev . Dr. E. P. Parker of Hartford contributes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his " ministry at large , " from 1861 to 1870 . And the story of the closing years of his life is graphically and beautifully told by his eldest daughter , Miss Frances Louisa Bushnell . IRich materials are also furnished by the many letters , journals , and published writings of Dr. Bushnell , extracts from which are given so far as they help to unfold or illustrate the character and genius of this wonVOL . III . // derful man . A " Fragment of Autobiography , found dimly penciled on a stray sheet of paper , " entitled " God 's Way with a Soul , " and evidently written in the later period of his life , fitly introduces the daughter 's biography . Written in the author 's peculiarly fresh and racy style , with the added spiritual flavor and holy tenderness of a soul nearing its heavenly port and looking hack over the way in which God has led him , it is a rare and precious document , and awakens an infinite regret that he did not live to complete it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Inspiration . This beautiful " Fragment " is so characteristic , and strikes so truly and strongly the tone of the author 's mind and character , and so the key-note of his biography , that we can not forbear quoting it : " I have been told that my arrival or advent in this earthly sphere was on the 14th of April , 1802 . I have no recollection of any other state from which I came . and have no reason to judge that I came from any other state at all . I suppose that I was not made , but generated , being the son of one soul which was the son of another , which was the son of God . But these parent souls out of which I came I do not remember as having been conversant with their substance . I have only heard of some of them by report . Indeed , I came , as I suppose , scarcely knowing myself , and haviug it for a great part of my errand here to find , get a knowledge of , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only a tender rubicund mollusk of a creature at the time when I came out in this rough battle with winds , winters , and wickedness ; and so far from being able to take care of myseig I was only a little and confusedly conscious of myself , or that I was anybody ; and when I broke into this little , confused consciousness , it was with a cry-such a dismal figure did I make to myself ; or perchance it was something prophetic , without inspiration , a foreshadow dim and terrible , of the great battle of woe and sin I was sent hither to fight . But my God and my good mother both heard the cry and went to the task of strengthening and comforting me together . and were able ore long to get a smile upon my face . My mother 's loving instinct was from God , and God was in love to me first therefore ; which love was deeper than hers , and more protracted . Long years ago she vanished , but God stays by me still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she did in my infancy , and giving to me as my joy and the principal glory of my life that he lets me know him , and helps me with real confidence to call him my Father . Would that I could simply tell his method with me and show its significance . " My figure in this world has not been great , but I have had a great experience . I have never been a great agitator , never pulled a wire to get the will of men , never did a politic thing . It was not for this reason , but because I was looked upon as a singularity-not exactly sane , perhaps , in many things-that I was almost never a president or vice-president of any society , and almost never on a // committee . Take the report of my doings on the platform of the world 's business , and it is naught . I have filled no place at all . But still it has been a great thing even for me to live . In my separate and merely personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transacted than was ever written , or could be . The little turns of my way have turned great changes ,  --  what I am now as distinguished from the merely mollusk and pulpy state of infancy ; the drawing out of my powers , the correcting of my errors , the winnowing of my faults , the washing of my sins ; that which has given me principles , opinions , and , more than all , a faith , and , as the fruit of this , an abiding in the sense and free partaking of the life of God . Oh that I could trace the subtle art of my Teacher , and show the shifting scenes of the drama which he has kept me acting ! What a history of redemption and more ! I will try , as I best can , to show it . Help me , 0 my God ! Refresh my memory . Quicken my insight . Exalt my conceptions of thy meanings , and give me to see just how thou hast led me , that I may quicken others to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as great , and greater things to do for them . " The volume , though modestly called a " composite " work , is really a model of biographical composition . The impress of one mind , and that a mind of rare taste and judgment , is visible throughout-selecting , arranging and combining into unity the multiform materials , gracefully linking the sundered parts , and carrying on the narrative not as a bare recital but as an organic and progressive whole , and in reverent and loving sympathy with the great subject , as if endowed with a portion of the same genius . The stye is admirable , combining simplicity , terseness , force , and beauty in a degree seldom seen in such productions . One fault , too common with biographies , that of diffuseness , or of too much matter , is here avoided . Indeed , the regret is more likely to be felt that much which might well have been included is left out ; that a man who never repeated himself and who never said or wrote anything but what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his journals and letters published except what sacred privacy forbids . But notwithstanding the loss , we are persuaded that the course pursued is wiser . It is not quantity but quality that tells . A few characteristic traits and touches that reveal the inmost of a character , go farther in the way of impression than whole chapters of detail . We are not sure that the world would have had a better knowledge of Jesus if it had contained and preserved the many books of his sayings and doings which might have been written , instead of the brief and simple narratives which John and the other evangelists have left us. // The book is enriched with two very fine steel portraits ; one representing the Doctor as he appeared in his early manhood ,  --  a smooth , thoughtful , and truly prophetic face , with eyes bent downward , and his whole soul absorbed in the book he is perusing . Such a countenance , so pure , and spiritual , and meditative , might have stood for the Apostle John studying the Holy Scriptures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , represents him as he appeared in his later years , and as most of his friends remember him-his broad , high forehead scarred with the thought-conflicts and battles he has fought for the truth ,  --  his loose gray hair and full white beard , forming a grand ani venerable setting for the finely cut intellectual features , while from under his shaggy eyebrows glow those clear gray eyes , which whoso has seen can never forget - not dark and thunderous , like those of Webster , nor open and inquisitive with child-like wonder , like those of Channing , nor yet keen and fierce with the eagle ken of Park , but with a penetrating force and lustre that looks through all shams and disguises to the very core of things  --  and yet with a softness and playfulness in their clear depths , *gleaming from the soul behind the intellect , that reveals the inner gentleness and loving sensibility of his nature . If other marks of this were wanting , the delicate contour of his mouth-that unfailing sign of true sensibility-would reveal it . This is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we are truly thankful to the artist and engraver that such a true and admirable likeness is made to accompany the intellectual and moral portrait given in this bio*raphy . In coming to the subject matter of the book before us , we confess to an embarrassment amounting to fear ; embarrassment at the difficulty of selecting from such a rich and many-sided subject , those aspects of his life and character which will most truly represent him ; a fear also lest the ideal conception formed from a perusal of the volume , aided and exalted by personal recollections , may fail in the transmission , or fall below the reality , while it may seem to some to transcend it . We know not how the reading of such a biography , especially its deeper spiritual disclosures , may impress others , but to us this self-revelation of so grand and pure a soul , so wondrously // endowed and so manifestly led and taught of God , leaves an impression of wonder and admiration akin to awe . We approach the review of it in no critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amid whose lofty columns and gorgeous windows and solemn music we walk softly . The remembrance of what he was and what he accomplished in those forty years of his public lifc and ministry , more than twenty of which were an almost constant struggle with disease , is a humbling rebuke to most men , and a conviction of sin and incapacity . " The true history of a man is his character , " says Goethe . This is especially true of Dr. Bushnell . His outward life is marked by few incidents or changes , and is less remarkable probably than that of many New England clergymen . But the spiritual history , underneath , the development of his thought and opinions , and how they came to be what they were , with the influences which helped to form this grand total of his genius and character , these constitute his true history ; and to this we now turn . What impresses us first of all in this life is the divine lead . ing and ordering of it , the preparation for him and within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of just those conditions which best qualified him for the work he was ordained to do . In our belief , not Paul or Augustine or Luther was more truly called and led of God to the work specially assigned them than was Horace Bushnell ; and surely no one surrendered himself more obediently to this divine guidance . He was himself the best illustration of one of the best of his sermons : " Every Man 's Life a Plan of God . " In the brief survey we propose to take of his life and character , we shall follow this clue , noticing chiefly those traits which are most characteristic , and those " turns of his way , " or points of his history and experience which have most vitally to do with his opinions and character as a theological reformer . Horace Bushnell was born April 14 , 1802 , in the attractive and delightful town of Litchfleld , Connecticut , in a region distinguished as the birth-place or residence of some of the greatest names in New England history . Bellamy and Bates // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , and the air was physically , morally , and intellectually quickening . No better place existe ( l foi a child of genius to be born and grow up in than tbe hill country of Connecticut at the beginning of the present century . " The birth-place was an old house , now gone , at the fork of the roads and opposite the Episcopal Church , in the little village of Bantam , two miles west of Litchfield HilL The parents , Ensign Bushnell and iDotha , his wife ( whose maiden name was Bishop ) were but lately married-this their first home , Horace their first child . They were plain farming people , known to their neighbors as well for their excellent abilities as for their uprightness , industry , and kindliness . They were both religious , but belonged to different denominations , he to the Methodist , she to the Episcopal Church . The little family removed in 1805 to New Preston , a village about fourteen miles from Litchfleld , and in the most picturesque part of the same county . The home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the southeastern slope of a broad-backed hill which stretches a mile upward and westward to a rounded summit , where stands the church . " The home was a roomy and cheerful farm-house which , facing south , stands back a little from the road behind its row of shady maples , with that expression of reserve and comfortable independence so familiar in New England . But in those days no such green shadow fell at noonday to curtain the house from the dust and travel of the road ; for it was Horace Bushnell , then but a stripling , who brought the young trees upon his back from the mountain and planted them there . Just below the house the hill pitches down into the hollow where the stream rushes and the mill hummed in old days . The home , the early surroundings , introduce us to the man , and upon this natural background we can see him best . Nay , the very soil is allied to him , and the air is a subtle suggestion of his spirit . " These glimpses of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed are significant , not only as having an interest for future pilgrims to this spot , destined to become classic , but as influential in forming his character and genius . That poetic love of nature and natural beauty which was the aesthetic element of his character , and which afterward blossomed out in his discourses , as well as that strong simple // naturalness and bold independence of thought and feeling which was so marked a trait , was here inhaled with his breath from the free air , and woods , and hills of his native county . The moral elements of his character , his conscientiousness that never swerved from4he pole of duty , his intense love of truth , and his practical habits of industry and thoroughness . are explained by the insight given us of his home-training . " In this home grew up a lively family of boys and girls-four of the former , two of the latter . Reared in the simplest habits ; taught from childhood to work and contribute , each his share , to the plain family living ; ignorant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew undisturbed as flowers do in the wild recesses of a mountain , straight up , and keeping each an aroma all its own . The father of the household was a sturdy and spirited man , pleasant in his ways to child or neighbor , full of New England grit , resolute in work . and of a steady cheerfulness in all the ups and downs of life . He did not by constaut chiding worry his children ; but if he punished , it was thoroughly done . His eldest son once told one of his own children that his father never whipped him but once , and then he flogged him ' ; and also said to a friend that he remembcred this tremendous discipline as one of the best things that ever happened to him . " His youngest brother , iRev . George Bushnell , gives this pleasant reminiscence of the religious life of the household , and it may serve to correct some impressions that have become current , as to his early scepticism . " He was born in a household where religion was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwelcome visitor , but a constant atmosphere , a commanding but genial presence . in our father it was characterized by eminent evenness , fairness and conscientiousness ; in our mother it was felt as an intense life of love , utterly unselfish and untiring in its devotion , yet thoughtful , sagacious , and wise , always stimulating and ennobling , and in special crises leaping out in tender and almost awful fire . Jf ever there was a child of Christian nurture he was one ; nurtured , I will not say , in the formulas of theology as sternly as some ; for though he had to learn the Westminster Catechism , its formulas were not held as of equal or superior authority to that of the Scriptures ; not nurtured in what might be called the emotional elements of religion as fervently as some , but nurtured in the facts and principles of the Christian faith in their bearing upon the life and character ; and if ever a man was true to the fundamental principles and the customs which prevailed in his early home , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is significant also , in connection with this experience of Christian nurture , that his mother " had , besides , secret hopes , nourished silently in her own heart for years , and reaching back even to the time berore his birth , when she had , in the enthusiasm of that new experience , made an offering of her unborn to God , dedicating him forever to his service and ministry . From this hidden purpose she never swerved , and when he went into the study of law , after leaving college , she said , If heis not a minister , I shall not know what to make of it . ' One chapter of the book is devoted to sketches of his grandmother and mother , written by Dr. Bushnell at the request of friends . We wish that our space permitted more than a reference to these admirable descriptions of these truly wonderful Christian women , whose greatest honor now is that they were the mothers of Horace Bushnell , as it is not the least of his honors that he was descended from such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak , in " his grandmother Lois and his mother Eunice , " was in him also , and of such precious and heroic quality . Of the former he says : " I can think of this dear grandmother only with a certain respect that carries the sense of wonder . It is not simply that she brought up her twelve children to be men and women of mature age and heads of families , sprinkled all the way between Illinois and Vermont . never one of them to falter in character or suffer any least stain of dishonor ; neither is it that the little church in the house ' first planted by her , still lives to bear witness for her ; but I have her somehow in a more immediate , more interior witness . Though I knew her only in my childhood , and then only on visits twice made of a few days each , she has been almost visibly with me , and going as it were through me by a kind of subtle waft , down to the present hour . * * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , felt as a silent , subtly operative presence of good . " We cite a single passage from his account of his mother , as showing the sources whence he derived some of his views of Christian nurture . " Whether she had any theory for it I do not know ; but it came to pass somehow , that while she was concerned above all things to make her children Christian , she undertook little in the way of an immediate divine experience , hut let herself down , for the most part ; upon the level of habit , and condescended to stay upon matters of habit , as being her humanly allotted field , only keeping visibly an upward look of expectation that what she may so prepare in righteous habit , will be a house builded for the occupancy of the Spirit . Her stress was thus laid on industry , order , time , fidelity , reverence , neatness , truth , intelligence , // prayer . And the drill of the house in these was to be the hope , in a great degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need say , come very near being a gate of religion for us all . No child of us ever strayed so far as not to find himself early in a way of probable discipleship . " The teaching of home was early supplemented by that of the district school , which he entered at the age of five years . A single glimpse of the youthful scholar is given us in the very impressive etching from his own hand . Questioned when a gray-haired man by a New Preston friend as to the time when he first became conscious of his own powers , his reply was , " In a little old school house that stood in your pasture lot , when I was sitting on a slab with legs in it so long that my feet did not touch the floor , then I first got the idea that I was a power . " A more finished picture of that school , of the church , and of the hardy home-training is given in his address entitled " The Age of Home-spun , " delivered at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New England life in the olden time ever drawn , or possible to be drawn . Here the same vivid image stands out , showing how strongly it was imprinted on his childish memory : " Oh , I remember ( about the remotest thing I can remember ) that low seat , too high , nevertheless , to allow the feet to touch the floor , and that friendly teacher who had the address to start a first feeling of enthusiasm , and awaken the first sense of power . He is living still ; and whenever I think of him he rises up to me in the far background of memory as bright as if he had worn the seven stars in his hair . " Many incidents and recollections of his boyhood are given , 8howing in all a growing consciousness of power , a masterhood of mind and an ingenuity of thought and invention which foretold the future man and intellectual leader . He was fond of fishing and bathing and other active sports incident to outdoor life . " He was keenly perceptive of natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only the picture which filled his eye and kindled his imagination , but the recesses of nature-something unknown , which he could study and intellectually explore . It was his habit to survey by his eye the lines of the hills and valleys , and to print thus upon his mind a map of the surfaces . This became a favorite study in afterlife , and he carried it so far that if a railroad were projected // through a region which he knew , he could mark out from memory its most feasible route . " This he did during bis visit to California , predicting the very route which the future railroad to the Pacific actually took . The religions impressions of childhood which he was able to recall in later life , we are told , " were of the simplest and most natural kind , coming to him unforced , often in the fields , and quickened by his delight in nature , impressions , as he said , not of fear , nor in a sense of wrong , but in a sense of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine gray boulder in the pasture back of the house , and above it , where he sometimes went , when only a boy , to watch the sun rise , and where in morning freshness the boy 's heart rose too , in prayer . He has also told us how , one Sunday , on his way home from church , he was moved to stop and pray under the shadow of a haystack . All this he called , in his brief record of the facts , early ( lew , dim  --  the natural heaven-refreshing of the young soul mistily remembered . " In all the days of youthful labor on the farm or in the mill - ( for his father had added to his farming occupation the business of cloth-dressing ) - Nature was his chosen companion and foster-mother of his imagination in craft beyond the skill of the schoolmasters . They were days of victorious health , sound digestion , peaceful sleep , and youthful spirits buoyant as the wing of the bird , and fresh as its morning song . ' " Ma ywe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , practical training in the school of nature , with the poetic and religious inspirations that came to him there , and the broad , exhilarating , well-balanced and spiritually wholesome tone of his theological views-so different from the narrow or purely theoretical and logical systems of some theologians . If Calvin had had his imagination fostered and his heart enlarged by such influences , instead of repressed and stifled in the school of Aristotle , he would hardly have taught the decreturn horribile , or have burnt Servetus for heresy . Young Bushnell entered Yale College in September , 1823 , after he was twenty-one years old , an age when others were already entering on their professional life . The reason of this delay he himself tells us in his account of his mother : // " Her first offer to me of a liberal education I peremptorily declined ; for how could an awkward country boy think of going in among the great folk of a college . But about five years later , when brought distinctly under motives of religion , I asked the opportunity for myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going rapidly out of use , and the business concerned in its production was growing less and less profitable . But my mother , who in this could hardly submit even to necessity , called a congress of the family , where we drew the calculation close and made up our bill-I to wear homespun to the end , use only second hand books , and pay the bills of my last year myself ; the family to institute a closer economy for my sake , which they somehow found a place to do , though I never could see where . " But though he entered college late , he was not behind hand in his course oi slow in finding and taking his position . His appearance at this time was that of " a full grown man , of a remarkably robust physique and of a strong and wiry frame . His head , which was of unusual size and broad as it was high , appeared yet larger under its thick masses of black hair which also served to heighten the ruddiness of his complexion , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew him only in later life , when the intellectual and spiritual had eclipsed the physical , can hardly imagine him to have looked as his classmates describe him in the vigorous days of his youth . His dress and manners were homespun , ' not careless , but possessed rather of a certain rude propriety . The self - confidence apparent in his bearing had its root in so much vigor and genuine power that it did not offend . It was perhaps fortunate for him that he had not entered college earlier . His growth was not of that succulent kind that ripens early . He resembled rather those hardy northern fruits which mature their rich flavor and mellow their strong fibre only after a long season of out-door air and sunshine . In full and conscious possession of his very original powers , he was yet probably not in advance of his class in mental training , since his schooling had been of so meagre a kind and so often interrupted . But the foundations on which he was now to build were good . He had sound health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure tastes . He loved nature , music , and bodily activity ; and deep down was the spring of that religious life which was to make its way underground through the darkness of years , and up into the light at last . " // Of his college life we have several portraitures given by classmates and others which show him quite distinctly as a student . Rev. Dr. Coleman , his college tutor , says : " His examination for admission indicated a rude , original , discriminating mind - self- possessed and self-reliant , foreshadowing the future man . In his class he soon came to the front , and retained his position without any ambitious strife for preferment . To the contests for distinction in recitation he never condescended . He studied for a nobler end , and by his native talent became a ready proficient in any study to which his attention was directed . . . . While kindly to all , he had , according to my impressions few confidential friends or intimates . He lived the life of a scholar , original , retired , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which neither stranger nor friend could intermeddle-never less alone than when alone with himself and his books . " A classmate and chum ( Rev. Joseph Towne ) , bears this tes-timony : " He was a conscientious as well as a successful student . No college duties were neglected , none slighted . He was always master of his task . . . . He thought for himself and he thought vigorously . There was no task to which he was called that he hesitated to attempt ; and whatever he undertook he accomplished . There was a wonderful consciousness of power . . . . His moral and social qualities were hardly less remarkable than his intellectual . He was frank and open as the day . Nothing mean could find a lodgment in his heart . I never knew him to exhibit ill temper . He was always kind , always cheerfuL If there were times when I would begin to feel touched by some good-natured witticism of his , the germ would invariably flower into a hearty laugh . Witty and keen , his incisive shafts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was impossible to take offence . " His favorite studies throughout his college course , we learn were scientific , especially chemistry , geology , and astronomy . " us recreations were of the simplest . Never going into what is called society , and living in fact a good deal alone , he found one of his chief pleasures in the active sports of the play ground . There his classmates remember him as an athletic leader , and there he won the free-and-easy soubriquet of Bully Bush . ' He enjoyed heartily whatever he did , and pursued bis objects with an intense zest and relish . His highest delight was in music . He joined the college choir and gave it the support of his enthusiasm and of his powerful voice . " Another classmate , Rev. Dr. McEwen , furnishes some interesting reminiscences : " When I first saw Dr. Bushnell as a fellow-freshman , in 1823 , he seemed a fullgrown man to me. for he was twenty-one , while I was but fifteen . He was mature // every way . Even that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully formed as ever . He was all energy . both on the play-ground and in the division-room . The ambition of his later years bore him on through college from the first moment , springing forward to excel in all things , physical or intellectual ; for he was behind no one of the class in athletic feats . He was the same man *s an undergraduate that he has been all these later years , with the same marked characteristics , except as they have been toned down and softened , or developed into truer forms by a deep religious experience . " One or two incidents will show the kind of influence and spirit he manifested while in College . " When his room-mate was forced by ill-health to leave College , another young man asked for the vacant place . He was a bright and attractive fellow , whose social gifts drew around him a rather tempting company of careless spirits , and he sought for himself the shelter of Bushnell 's maturity and well known character . The reply of the latter was decisive . Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you room with me , you must cut loose from those idle fellows and go to work too . ' The pledge was given and firmly held , resulting in the lasting benefit and lifelong gratitude and affection of the rescued student . " Another incident related by Dr. McEwen shows what Horace Bushnell , the confessor of Christ , for seven years was in conscientious care of bis influence over others : " Our class had a rebellion over conic sections , and all but about thirteen of us were sent home by a slow decimation of a few a week . I had been drawn out of the ranks of the rebels by my father 's authority . But the ostracism I endured through those sad days was not worse than the dying by inches of men of charncter , like Bushnell , waiting their turn for execution . One day , when passing South Entry , North Middle , lower floor , front side , corner room , a voice thrilled me : Mac , come in here . ' It was Bushnell 's . As I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . He said , Mac , I have to say to you that you have done your duty to your father in backing out . Do not mind what the fellows say , I am in for it , and I shall go through . But you have done right . Hold your head up . ' He was just the man that could not have failed to do his own heart as much good as he did mine by that act . How the boy did thank the man for that word I There was not another than Horace Bushnell that could have said it . " He graduated with honor in the summer of 1827 . After leaving College he went to Norwich , Coun. , to teach school , but finding the employment uncongenial to him , he left it at the end of six months and accepted a position in New York as associate Editor of the Journal of Commerce . Here he worked assiduously and successfully for ten months , writing editorials by night on free trade and other subjects of interest , which attracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the day . The paper passing into other hands , // he was released from what he found " a terrible life , " in which he did riot wish to invest his future , and returned to New Haven to enter the Law School , having saved from his salary of one hundred dollars per month enough to support him till the following autumn . The following summer , having spent a half year in the Law School , he went home to say farewell . His plans were made to go to some western city , there to enter a law office and work his way into the arena of politics . He was twenty-seven years old , had tested his powers and gained some knowledge of public life in his newspaper experience , and now felt that he had chosen his course in life on well considered grounds . It was not strange then , that receiving while at home an invitation to become a tutor in Yale College , he gave the matter no very serious consideration , but wrote declining the proposal . Here we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those little turns of his way which have turned great changes ' not only in his own experience and destiny , but in the history of thought and theology , whose issues are not yet seen . As he has himself described this crisis in his account of his mother , it is fitting that he here tell his own story . " I was graduated , and then a year afterwards , when my bills were paid , and when the question was to be decided whether I should begin the preparation of theology I was thrown upon a most painful struggle by the very evident , quite ineontestable fact that my religious life was utterly gone down . And the pain it eost me was miserably enhanced by the disappointment I must bring on my noble christian mother by withdrawing myself from the ministry . I had run to no dissipations ; I had been a church-going , thoughtful man . My very difficulty was that I was too thoughtful , substituting thought for everything else , and expecting so intently to dig out a religion by my head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unbelief , in fact , had come to be my element . My mother felt the disappointment bitterly , but spoke never a word of complaint or upbraiding . Indeed , I have sometimes doubted whether God did not help her to think that she knew better than I did what my business was to be . At the College vacation two years after my graduation , when I had been engaged in law studies for a year , 1 was appointed to a tutorship . But I had decided on going into a law office in Ohio , and had no thought of taking my appointment . A fortnight after reaching home I wrote a letter to President Day , declining the appointment . As I was going out of the door , putting the wafer in my letter , I encountered my mother and told her what I was doing . Remonstrating now very gently , but seriously , she told me that she could not think that I was doing my duty . You have settled this question without any consideration at all that I have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision till you // have at least put your mind to it . This you certainly ought to do , and my opinion still further is - she was not apt to make her decision heavy in this mannerthat you had best accept the place . ' I saw at a glance where her heart was , and I could not refuse the postponement suggested . The result was that going on a wedding excursion with friends the next day , I was so long occupied by it that I felt a little delicacy now in declining the appointment . And then it followed , as a still further result that I was taken back to New Haven , where , partly by reason of a better atmosphere in religion I was to think myself out of my overthinking and discover how far above reason is trust . A short ma.tter , then , it was to find my way back into the plan of life in which I started , and which I still regarded with longings scarcely abated . And now , as I look back on the crisis here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should finally be . No other calling but this ministry of Christ , I am obliged to feel , could have anywise filled my inspirations and allowed me to sufficiently be . " Thus was his life , remarks his biographer , unconsciously to him , swayed by the faith hidden in his mother 's heart . She knew him better than he knew himself , and turned him to the higher purpose he did not recognize . But though his way was turned in the direction where faith pointed , he was not yet inwardly and thoroughly converted . His return to New Haven to enter on his tutorship did not divert him from his purpose to be a lawyer , but only deferred its execution . Of ' his success as a tutor , we have the testimony of his friend Dr. MeEwen , who was co-tutor with him for two years , that " he was more than ordinarily successful as a teacher in ' college , imparting the same manly , enthusiastic spirit of inquiry and investigation so characterKtic of himself : just one of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ division of students , that they literally sat at his feet . ' Though negatively religious , his moral bearing was most positively of the highest order . His purity and integrity were felt to be impreg. nable , and he was remarkable as combiniag a sternness of discipline with a certain generosity of procedure in practical cases . There was strength in all he did , and ajbrce of ' influence that came of the ruggedness of his intellectual and physical deportment . . . . It seems to me that his style of conception and expression as a writer was already stamped , in his freshman year , with the image and superscription of his latest day . As a man indeed he came to college all made , and in no respect more decidedly than as a thinker and writer . There was in him then just that poetic coinage of idea and phrase and illus // tration so unusually blended with a rugged argumentation in the treatment of subjects . He was at once the most pugnacious and the most gleesome of disputants , culling flowers while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for he was always climbing and in the steepest places . " With all this positive force , intellectual and moral , he was only negatively religious , ' and it was not for Horace Bushnell to be negative in anything . How this man of splendid intellect and rarest genius , with such grand capacities within him and such possibilities before him , was at length converted , and became as a little child before God , to receive the inspiration and the mission appointed for him , and to which he had been chosen from the very beginning , is one of the most interesting facts in the history of religion , and one which can not be too well known or carefully studied among the modern evidences of Christianity . We give the story therefore somewhat in detail . " The labors of the tutor and those of preparation for the bar went on thus for a year and a half hand in hand . In the winter of 1831 his two years of law study were completed . He had passed his examination , and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward , and he would have fairly entered upon that path which he had marked out for himself . But at this point unlooked.for influences changed all his plans and purposes . " The winter was marked in Yale College by a great religious revival . The history of this revival , so far as it concerned Horace Bushnell , is graphically given by Dr. McEwen . What then in this great revival was this man to do , and what was to become of him ? Here he was in the glow of his ambition for the future , tasting keenly of a new success-his fine passage at arms in the editorial chair of a New York daily , ready to be admitted to the bar , successful and popular as a college instructor ; but all at sea in doubt and default religiously . The baptism of the Holy Ghost and of fire compassed him all about . When the work was at its height , he and his division of students who fairly worshiped him , stood unmoved apparently when all beside were in a glow . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own , and all were now united in it but Bushnell . What days of travail and wondering those were for him ! None dare approach him . He stood far more than primus inter pares among all . Only Henry Durant tried carefully and cautiously to hit some joint in the armor . But even he , though free in his confidence , seemed to make no advance . When , all at once , the advance came boldly and voluntarily from Bushnell himself . Said he to Durant , I must get out of this woe . Here I am what I am , and these young men hanging to me in their indifference amidst this universal earnestness on every side . ' And we were told what he said he was going to do  --  to invite these young men to meet him some evening in the week , when he would lay bare his position and their // own , and declare to them his determination , and the decision they ought with him to make for themselves . Perhaps there never was pride more lofty laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met those worshipers of his . The result was overwhelming . That division room was a Bochim , a place of weeping . When , then , he came at once into the confidence of the daily meeting of his fellow-tutors , was it not Paul , that was called Saul , and was there ever such a little child as he was ? On one occasion he came in , and throwing himself with an air of abandonment into a seat , and thrusting both hands through his black , bushy hair , cried out desperately , yet half laughingly , 0 men ! what shall I do with these arrant doubts I have been nursing for years ? When the preacher touches the Trinity and when logic shatters it all to pieces , I am all at the four winds . But I am glad I have a heart as well as a head . My head wants the Father ; my heart wants the Son ; my heart wants the Holy Ghost  --  and one just as much as the other . My heart says the Bible has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by my heart . I nm glad a man can do it when there is no other mooring , and so I answer my own question-What shall I do ? But this is all I can do yet . ' These incidents I may say , have held me for my dear friend Bushnell , when his day of question in other minds came ; and I understood , in that last incident or germinal fact , his Christ in Theology . " Another of his college friends has said : " As might be expected , Bushnell threw all his manhood into his new life . He labored at once to bring his pupils into the same purposes with himself . " One of these pupils wrote later , " I can not but think of him now , as he seemed to me when I was permitted to sit at his feet as a learner . He was a very handsome man , classical and sharp-cut in his features , of superior dignity , and yet winsome in his manners . Next to old President Day , perhaps he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was a man of great independence of character and thought , as I remember him ; and in 1831 when the whole college came under the power of truth in a signal manner , he shot clear beyond his doubts , and caine with a bound into clear sunlight , and with a noble Christian manhood took his place with Christ . His history from that day rose in grandeur and development until it culminated in glory . " This vital " experience of religion " in its deepest and most central point  --  the turning or transition from darkness to light , from the blankest unbelief to a clear and rejoicing faith-was an experience not only needful for himself as the basis of his religious character and teaching , but as a help and guide to others . He afterwards used its history as an illustration in his sermon " On the Dissolving of Doubts , " first delivered in Yale College Chapel , and which every one sceptically inclined , and who wants to believe , ought to read . The memorable passage describing his own experience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the truth of religion second only to the conversion of Paul , and even more con vine // ing in this age of scepticism and denial of miracle . For the sake of those who may not have read it in the above named sermon , we give a condensed citation : " Suppose that one of us , clear of all vices , having a naturally active-minded , inquiring habit , never meaning to get away from the truth . . . finds his religious beliefs wearing out and vanishing , he knows not how , till finally he seems to really believe nothing . He has not meant to he an atheist ; hut he is astonished to find that he has nearly lost the conviction of God , and can not , if he would , say with any emphasis of conviction that God exists . " Such an one " pacing his chamber , some day comes suddenly upon the question , Is there , then , no truth that I do believe ? Yes , there is one ; there is a distinction of right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not see how I can ; nay I am quite sure of this . ' Then forthwith starts up the question , Have I then ever taken the principle of right for my law ? I have done right things , as men speak ; have I ever thrown my life out on the principle , to become all it requires of me ? No , I have not , consciously I have not . Ah ! then , here is something for me to do . No matter what becomes of my questions-nothing ought to become of them if I can not take a first principle so inevitably true , and live in it . ' . . . Here then , he says , I will begin . If there be a God , as I rather hope there is , and very dimly believe , he is a right God . If I have lost him in wrong , perhaps I shall find him in right . Will he not help me , or perchance even be discovered to me ? ' He drops on his knees and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking for help that he may begin a right life . The very words of the prayer , as he once related the experience to us , were- ' 0 God-if there be a God ! show me the truth , if there be any truth . ' It is an awfully dark prayer , in the look of it ; but the truest and best he can make ,  --  the better and the more true that he puts no orthodox colors on it ; and the prayer and the vow are so profoundly meant , that his soul is borne up into God 's help as it were by some unseen chariot , and permitted to see the opening of heaven even sooner than he opens his eyes . He rises , aud it is as if he had gotton wings . The whole sky is luminous about him . It is the morning , as it were , of a new eternity . After this all troublesome doubt of God 's reality is gone . A being so profoundly felt , must inevitably be . ' . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room of one of these dormitories , which I pray God his recording angel may note , allowing it never to be lost . ' " This grand crisis passed , henceforth his path was clear , and he turned from the law to the ministry , as from his own human purpose to the greater and wiser purpose of God concerning him . In the summer of 1831 be relinquished the duties of tutor and bade farewell to his pupils in a short address . As this is the first of his discourses of which we have any record , we quote its closing words for the insight it gives into his own character and principles : In conclusion he offers " two rules which ought to govern every man . The first is , to be perfectly honest in forming all your opinions and principles of action . // It is one thing to take a position and use your reason to defend it , and quite a dIfferent thing to use your reason in selecting a position . In one case reason obeys the will ; and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule which I would have you observe is this : never to swerve in conduct from your honest convictions . Decide because you see reasons for decision , and then act because you have decided . Let your action follow the guidance of your judgment- and if between them you go down the falls of Niagara , go ! it is the only course worthy of a man ! " In the autumn he entered the Divinity School at New Haven , then under the leadership of Dr. N. W. Taylor . It was regarded at that time , as it is now , the school of progress in religious thought , and even regarded by some with suspicion for that i-eason . But such a mind as that of Bushnell could call no man master upon earth , and it soon asserted its independence . That spiritual philosophy , of which Coleridge is the great expounder , had begun to take root in his intuitional , deep-thinking soul , and he revolted from methods of thought which seemed to him mechanical . The theology to satisfy him must be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bat one that harmonized with the deepest and truest intuitions of his own spirit , and left scope both for human freedom and divine enlargement as more of God and truth should be discovci-ed and this he must find or work out for himself . The working of his mind during this period is shown in a philosophical essay written in May , 1832 , where he analyzes and compares the methods of natural and of moral philosophy , endeavoring to show that the systematized science which is possible and even necessary to the former , is impossible in the latter . " We may , ' he says , " systematize in nature , because nature is a system , because everything there fulfills its end , and therefore acts in accordance with its fitness to that end but we can not systematize in morals , because a great share of the acts of men are in conti-adiction to those properties of their constitution which fit them for the end proposed by their existence ; because they are the proper expressions of a frustrating power , a power as effectual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essay is chiefly interesting as disclosing the germ of his greatest work , which took thirty years to mature . On the man uscript is pencilled in his own bold hand- " This article // shows the ferment out of which my Nature and Supernaturalism grew into shape thirty years after . " The next chapter in his history opens with his call and settlement in Hartford , where , under the same guiding hand which had led him hitherto , he was to find his place and his work for life . His first introduction to the North Church of Hartford , and his early experiences as pastor are graphically described by himself in a review of his ministry in a sermon preached on the twentieth anniversary of his settlement . Referring to the two theological parties , the Old and New School , into which the church was divided , he humorously speaks of " the very delicate condition prepared for the young pastor who is to be thus daintily inserted between an acid and an alkali , having it for his task both to keep them apart and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the other . " In a more serious vein he continues : " When I look back on the place and the occupant , I am scarcely able to recognize either the one or the other , so great is the change accomplished in both . I had many and great difficulties on my hands , ' in respect to the gospel truths , which are now gone . In the list of my qualifications at that time for a preacher of Christ , I discover nothing which moves my respect but the very small mustardseed of Christian experleuce I seem to have had , together with a certain honesty of determination to find , if possible , the truth ; to violate the integrity of my understanding by no forced assent to received dogmas ; to be warped by no fear of man , hurried by no impatience ; never to go in advance of my convictions ; and if possible never to fall behind them . hi these two conditions I see , indeed , possibilities of good ; but how slender a furniture for the work actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of ' reason or philosophy , and of course bad small conception of it as a faith and a supernatural gift to the race . Now it is a faith Luminous , glorious , vital , and clear , and of course it is as little of u philosophy . " Dr. Bushnell was ordained on the 22d of May , 1833 . The writer remembers this , as the first ordination he ever attended : how as a boy he looked down from the gallery over the pulpit on the imposing ceremony of the " imposition of hands " on the head of the new minister  --  and how black that head then was , contrasted with the pale and delicate features underneath He remembers , too , his first sermons , although from an external and childish standpoint , and the enthusiastic remark of one appreciative listener , an educated man and physician , on re* turning home-that " that was preacbing to edification , it set // one to thinking if he would follow it . " On the 13th of September of the same year he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lineal descendant on her mother 's side , of John Davenport , the first minister , an ( l first colonist of New Haven , and of Judge Abraham Davenport , whose name and strength of purpose are associated with the " Dark Day , " famous in colonial history . The marriage of horace Bushnell and Mary Apthorp was one which comprehended in the thoughts and wishes of both , the highest objects and pursuits of the future , and was so compacted by the unity of their joint purpose as to reinforce greatly the effectiveness of his work . " This " union of two lives bound together by the closest sympathy in Christian truth and works , and by a faith which transformed a mortal into an immortal love , " was a rare one in ministerial or even human experience , and had a most felicitous influence on his character and work . Dr. Bushnell has himself acknowledged this influence , in the dedication of his book on Women 's Suffrage " to the woman I know best and most thoroughly ; having been overlapped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the last thirty-six years , " - the whole of which " Acknowledgment** is one of the most beautiful tributes ever offered by a husband to his wife . The reality and beauty of this spiritual as well as conjugal union appears in the letters written by Dr. Bushnell to his wife which are scattered through the biography , and constitute perhaps the richest part of the volume , since they unfold his deepest and most spiritual thoughts and experiences in language of the most tender affection . As this side or rather heart of his character has been hitherto nnknown except to his intimate friends , we subjoin one or two extracts from these letters to show the nature of the influence spoken of and how deeply and truly he lived in his affections . In a letter written to his wife from Cabotville , eleven years after their marriage , he says : " I have had no little enjoyment of my dear wife and children this afternoon . Sitting here over my fire alone , with nothing to do and my mind at ease , my heart has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh , this rest , this unoccupied day-how I do long , for my heart 's sake , to have rest ! It sweetens my family , makes my love conscious , makes it an enjoyment , and I really seem to live . Never did I realize so convincingly the great power you have over me , and how necessary you are to my well-being . I am sure , too , ihat there is nothing // 826 more beautiful , and more to be envied by the poets , than this same charm of power by which a good wife detains her husband . It is not an ambitious , noisy power ; it is silent , calm , persuasive , and often so deep as to have its bold deeper than consciousness itself . She does not take him away from the rough world and its drudgeries-does not make him less than a man , but still he will , in all he does , be her man ; and if the rough calls of duty which worry him give away for a time , then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , as a very small helm , guiding his way . He is proud of her without knowing it , loves her when he is too weary or too much heat on his objects to be conscious of his love , deposits his soul in hers , and thinks it still his own . She ministers , and yet is seldom ministered unto . She makes his future and ascribes it to himself . " Later , in 1861 , when broken in health , but strong in spirit he was revolving the great theme of his " Vicarious Sacrifice , " he writes from Clifton Springs : " It will be delightful to me to sit down with you and talk over these things , as we have both these and many others . These blessed communings that I have had with yen for so many years , and especially the last ten or fifteen , come across me every few days , like waves in the memory , and my soul is bathed in their refreshment , as by nothing else in this world . I count just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that God has bestowed upon me , next to the gift of his dear Son himself . And it ought to be a very great comfort to you to know that I connect all my best progress in truth and character with your instigations thus received . I have some hope that I may have helped you somewhat in return , though in a different manner. ** To return from this prolepsis . His habits of labor during the first years of his pastoral life are thus pleasantly sketched : " The winter was spent in constant study . The writing of two sermons for almost every Sunday occupied him the whole week . In those days he wrote slowly , and with a good deal of labor . The work that should have ceased with the morning was too often carried on through the day and into the evening hours . He wished also to visit and become well acquainted with all of his people , and these pastoral duties were so new and strange to his student 's habit , that they were at first the most difficult and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , however , but made a point of visiting every one in the congregation at least once a year , and more frequently among familiar friends , or where he knew that he was needed . He acknowledged this to have been the defective branch of his service , and that for which he had least aptitude . . . . It became a custom with him and Mrs. Bushnell to make the annual visitation together in the pleasant days of autumn , sometimes walking , or sometimes driving into the country , to the more distant homes . Those bright October days , ' she says , still spread their soft haze on the background , where are pictured the bright faces and cheerful welcomes that have long ago faded from earthly recognition . ' " His manner as a preacher at this period is thus described : " His preaching had in those days a fiery quality , an urgency and willful force , which in his later style is still felt in the more subdued glow of poetic imagery . // There was a nervous insistence about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right arm from the shoulder , which no one who has ever heard him is likely to forget . It seemed as if with this gesture he swung himself into his subject , and would fain carry others along with him . His sermons were always written out in full and read ; never extemporized , never memorized . For the latter method and its results he had no liking . For the former not sufficient confidence ; though that came to him later , when driven to extempore work by illhealth . His early manner betrayed this want of confidence , and was at times a little constrained and labored . The same was true of his prayers , which lacked ease and flow , such as came to him with fuller inspiration . The whole effect of his services , was , however , always pointed and practicaL Prayers , hymns , Scripture reading , text , sermon , all converged on the same central theme , and went to heighten the impression of the leading thought . " We have lingered longer on this earlier and formative period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the influences which helped to shape his character and genius , especially the divine moulding of it , might he more clearly seen . As no one can understand thoroughly the genius and poetry of Wordsworth without reading his autobiographical poem , " the Prelude , " in which he unfolds the growth of a poet 's mind , so Horace Bushnell can only be understood through the prelude of his youth and early manhood . We shall now proceed more rapidly , although the book thickens and deepens in interest as we advance . To be continued.
