txt In the Malley trial this afternoon State Attorney Doolittle announced that the prosecution had closed its case . Mr. Jones , of counsel for the defense , stated that the defense had nothing further to offer , and then proposed to submit the case to the jury without argument , this being done with Blanche Douglass 's consent . Mr. Doolittle objected to a change from the ordinary method of procedure , and Mr. Bush , assistant to Mr. Doolittle , then made his argument . To-morrow either Mr. Case or Mr. Jones will follow for the defense . The first witness called by the State this morning was Lawyer Charles F. Bollman , who acted as Coroner at the West Haven investigation . He contradicted Miss Foissey , the dress-maker , in minor points of her testimony , and then read from his notes of the West Haven testimony to show that James Malley 's sisters testified differently there regarding a few minor points than at the present trial . Mrs. William E. Hunter , of Southington , testified that she was at Sevin Rock Friday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Miss Hendrick . She stated that she saw the party riding on the flyinghorses that evening and recognized the body of Jennie Cramer as one of the party . She was certain that Maggie Kane , who claims to have been the one to exclaim " My God , I 'm paralyzed , " was not the woman she saw . In this impression her husband . William E. Hunter . corroborates her . Dr. M. C. White was called as an expert to eontradlct the experts for the defense relative to the condition of bodies after drowning and the effects of arsenic on the system . At the conclusion of his testimony the State rested . Mr. Bush , assistant to the State Attorney , in his argument said the State claims that there have been a series of crimes in this case . Two of the defendants formed a conspiracy to ruin Jennie Cramer , and to accomplish this object they brought a prostitute from New-York . The conspiracy was successful , but not until force and violence were used . Then , fearing discovery and the consequences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way by murder . In its various features the State claims it is one of the foulest crimes of modern times . The body of Jennie Cramer was found on the inside of a bar over which the water was barely breaking , showing it could not have drifted there from outside . Tho first inference was that death resulted from drowning . But suspicion was excited and an inquiry was made , and it appeared that the body did not present the first sign of death from drowning . A medical examination showed that some one had the strongest possible motive for taking her life ; it showed she had been raped within 48 hours of her death . A chemical examination of the body showed the presence of 3 2-10 grains of arsenic , a fatal dose . It was peculiarly distributed , those organs nearest the heart containing the largest quantites and very little being present in the bowels . From this suf. ence drew the conclusion that the poison used had been but a short time in the body  --  not long enough for it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large quantity or arsenic found in the brain indicated that it was taken in a liquid form , which helped to explain the absence of inflammation in the stomach . Ho held that the conditions of her body showed that Jennie Cramer was not a habitual user of arsenic . She had no object in committing suicide . She was young , handsome , attractive , and fond of pleasure . The theories dr suicide and accidental poisoning are both untenable . Whoever committed the crime or rape , he claimed , murdered tue girl . Then he reviewed the story of how the acquaintance between Jennie and the Malleys was formed , and claimed its purpose was to lead up to her ruin , which he held was accomplished in the Malley residence . The fact that the party were on the West Haven shore the night before the murder he claimed was proved by it. ; witnesses . Ile held that the alibi attempted to be established by the Malley girls was not trustworthy . as they had every reason for creating an alibi for the accused .
