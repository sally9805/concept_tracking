txt Sir EDWARD REED has recently invented an improvement in armor-plated men-ofwar which is expected to render them to a large extent secure against the attacks of torpedoes . Instead of placing the engines and maga-zine in the lower part of the hull , where they could be injured by the explosion of a torpedo , Sir EDWARD REED places them in the upper part of the hull of his newly designed vessel . To this vessel he gives great breadth above the . water line , and he covers her with a , dome-shaped turtle-back deck , intended to be entirely shot proof  --  partly in consequence of its thickness and partly in consequence of its inclination . The hull of this vessel is intended merely to float the armored upper , part , and is not to be used either for , engines , ' stores , or quarters for the men . It is to be furnished with a vas t number of small watertight cells , and even if the whole of it is blown to pieces by torpedoes the upper part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be made with lines adapted for great speed , and no matter what breadth of beam may be given to the vessel above the water line it can not affect her speed except by the resistance its surface may offer to the wind . Of course , the value of this invention can be determined only by experience . It certainly promises well , and it is . of peculiar interest to Americans just at this time . ; As we have neither ships nor guns , we are accustomed to console ourselves by assuming that we can defend our. , harbors with torpedoes against a hostile fleet . If , . however , a man-of-war can be made practically impregnable to assault by torpedoes , there is nothing whatever to hinder one of Sir EDWARD REED 'S vessels from stearaing-up our Bay annombarding our City at short range . which would have given them much more pleasure . than their new steam yacht club , with ' i ? fleet of steam-boats , on board of which sea-sickness inevitably awaits the yachtsman who ventures outside of the Bay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reorganize the " American Yacht Club " under the name of the " Elevated Yacht Club , " and to sell its fleet of steam-boats and build palace cars in their place .
