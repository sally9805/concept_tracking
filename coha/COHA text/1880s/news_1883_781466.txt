txt " The New-York Association for the Protection of American Industry , " which held a meeting in this City last evening , is sadly behind the times . It is appealing to the people of New-York , and through them to the people of the country , to maintain the " protective " features of the tariff enacted during the war , at a moment when the force of public opinion is compelling Congress to modify those features . It enters very late into the k , contest , and on the wrong side . That , . however , . is not a matter to be wondered at , because , so far as can be judged from the list of managers of the association , it is largely made up of men interested directly in the legislation which they seek to promote  --  not as citizens merely who share with their fellowcitizens the general advantages of the laws , but as men who profit by the barriers to competition raised by those laws . That such pen should sincerely believe that it is to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very natural . That they should hope at this late day to convince their fellow-citizens of the beneficence of public taxation for private profit only shows that with them , as with other much abler men , the wish is father to the thought . In , the address which the managers of the association have placed before ' the public they  --  rest their argument on the broad general statement that " in our history disaster and distress have uniformly followed every resort to free trade , and prosperity has , without exception , attended the proper protection of our industries . " It is hardly worth while to examine very closely the grounds of such an assertion . The student who reads our commercial history with this conclusion is in a condition of mind where he can neither convince others of its correctness nor himself be convinced of its singular fallacy ; he may , therefore , be disregarded . We will only call attention to two facts bearing on this amazing declaration . One is that the only instance in which we have ever " resorted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which can not be said to have been followed by disaster and distress . The other is that the most general , lasting , poignant , and deep-seated distress from which this country ever suffered reigned from 1873 to 1878 , under the highest protective tariff ever enacted , the rates of which were rendered very much higher by the premium on gold . In this distress , no interests in the community were more deeply involved , and none had so much trouble to get free from it , as the manufactures which enjoyed the greatest protection . But the association does not confine itself to these generalities . In its call for last eveninfr 's meeting it assumes that the City and State of New-York , and the former especially , are interested in the maintenance of protection . The call says : " The yearly product , as shown by the census of 1880 , ' of the manufacturing industries of the City of New-York alone is $450,000,000 , " and it adds , after giving the product of the State and the Union , " ' Free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosperity and wealth . " Now , it so happens that of the manufactures of New-York , the most extensive as to capital , prod uct , and the labor employed is that of men 's clothing , which has a capital of over $22,000,000 , a product of over $60,000,000 , and employs over 46,000 hands . The product of this industry , when imported , pays a duty of 50 cents a pound and 40 per cent . if of wool , or an average of from 56 per cent . to 59 per cent . The materials of which it is made pay as follows : Woolen cloths , 50 cents a pound and 35 per cent. , or an average of 72.63 per cent . ; cotton , from 35 per cent . to 45 per cent . ; thread , from 75 per cent . to 79 per cent . In other words , the most extensive and prosperous industry in New-York City is not protected , but oppressed , by the tariff . It is prosperous in spite of the tariff because it gets its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starvation rates , and because it makes the most of American ingenuity and invention in labor-saving machinery . In like condition is the manufacture of women 's clothing , with a product of nearly $19 , - 000,000 , and of shirts , with a product of $6,000,000 . The next most extensive New-York industry is meat-packing , which , with a capital of only $1,800,000 , turns out a product of $29 , - 000,000 . Akin to . this is the manufacture of refined lard , which , with a capital of only $786,600 , produces nearly $15,000,000 annually . Sugar and refined molasses have a product of $11,000,000 ; confectionery , $5,000,000 ; flouring and grist mills , $6,000 , - 000 ; bakery products , $9,000,000 ; grease and tallow , $7,000,000 ; carpentering , $7,000,000 ; furniture , $10,000,000 ; marble and stone work , $7,000,000 ; plumbing and gas-fitting , $4,000,000 ; while the printing and publishing trade produces annually nearly $22,000,000 . A glance at this list will show that it is made up of industries which have little or no advantage from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less heavily on imported raw materials . Their combined product is over $217,000,000 , or nearly one-half that of the City of New-York . It would be easy , did our spaoe permit , to add to their number other industries situated in the same way with reference to the tariff , until the total product of unprotected or taxed industries in this City could be shown to be over $300 , 000 , 000 . In the face of such facts as these , contained in the document from which it draws its specious totals , the declaration of the Association for the Protection of American Industry that ' free trade ' is destructive of this immense source of our prosperity " is rather worse than an impudent and baseless assumption . It is of a character for which a polite vocabulary furnishes only an approximately complete designation , and which the " immense resources " of the late lamented ' HORACE GREELEY would be required to describe . The association , in its address , concedes that the revenue from import duties must be reduced . It pleads that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protection to our own industries and labor against destructive and . pauperizing competition from abroad . " All that our industries and labor require is that the taxes on raw materials , levied to carry on a war closed 18 years since , and continued for the profit of favored manufacturers shall be gradually but surely taken off . When that is done we can defy " competition from abroad , " not only in our own
