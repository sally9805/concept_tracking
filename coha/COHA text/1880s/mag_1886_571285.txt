ARTICLE 11. - THE STATES GENERAL OF FRANCE . V. THE CAUSES OF THE DECLINE OF THE STATES GENERAL . See Art . I. , vol. xliii. , p. 765 ; II. , vol. xliv , p. 25 ; III. , p. 690 ; IV. , p. 818 . No subject connected with the history of France has received a more inadequate treatment at the hands of historical and political writers than the causes of the failure of the States General to become a recognized institution and a regularly constituted member of the government . Some appear to think that the decline of the assembly was merely the result of the action in 1439 , by which the Crown was authorized to impose a regular tax for the support of a standing army . But although this is now seen to have been a fatal mistake , it was only the outcome of natural causes , which must be sought for below the surface of things . There were antecedent conditions that determined the course of the deputies . It is idle to suppose that any single action or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a body so fully embodying the interests and representing the rights of a nation as the States General . Others again point to the unsteadiness of the French people as the chief cause of the failure of the nation 's assembly . Given at the start these two elements , they maintain , a persistent , unprincipled monarchy and a nation fickle by nature , the result must inevitably be a complete victory of the continuous policy , backed up by claims of authority and unceasing efforts , over the uncertain and unorganized resistance of the people ; a single will must sooner or later come to direct the affairs of State . True , indeed , this excitability , this love of novelty and change , passed from the ancient Gauls to the modern French as a national characteristic . But since the Revolution it has been brought forward to account for altogether too much . From their Celtic ancestry the French inherited also an intense love of liberty and independence , and a federative tendency , which under normal conditions would have been apt to offset the national weakness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arbitrary power . Why then did not the States General , like the English Parliament , in the name of the nation force the Crown to respect the rights of the people , and establish a constitutional monarchy ? The answer will be found not in one but in many reasons , and will give a glimpse of those fundamental causes which lie behind the trend of French politics , and of whose operation the events of French history are only a manifestation . In the first place , the geographical position of France rendered the free , untrammeled development of national institutions exceedingly precarious . The natural outgrowth of Feudalism was everywhere the limited monarchy ; wherever this was replaced by absolutism the normal course of development was somehow interfered with . In the case of France the great disturbing force was war . The feudal system indeed left to modern times a heritage of discord . Boundary lines were uncertain , shifting with every new marriage and almost every battle , while a restless and ill-curbed military aristocracy gave neither king nor free city long peace . The time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to bring order out of chaos and to control discordant elements . But France had not only its own difficulties to contend with ; in the period following the decline of Feudalism it was the battle field of Europe . Its borders were fortified with no natural bulwarks , such as to shut off a foe . Strong and jealous powers , England , Spain , Germany , and Italy , hemmed it in on every side , all of them ever watching for an opportunity to attack and conquer . Not till a late period did France become comparatively free from hostile complications with neighboring States . Few nations have had to struggle as the French for an independent national existence , against dismemberment on the one hand and the permanent supremacy of an invader on the other . Under certain conditions a foreign war may aid the development of a nation . It has a tendency to merge individual , local , and partizan interests in the general good , compacting and solidifying a people through external pressure . But a series of wars one after another bringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interfere with the natural unfolding of a national constitution . In France the absence of marked divisions of // surface , the abundance of watercourses making the communication between different parts comparatively easy , together with a unity of blood and speech , furnished the proper conditions for the npbuilding of a nation . But constant and prolonged wars wonnded and scarred the national life and rendered impos8ible the easy adjustment of internal relations . The tendency of war moreover is imperialistic . Of necessity it centres great powers in the hands of one man . It demands the use of abrupt means , quick decisions , arbitrary command , and energetic action . It exalts the victorious general into a hero and gives him a dangerous prestige . He is not so closely held to account for his actions as other men . The outworking of this tendency of war is clearly manifest in French history from the time of Hugh Capet . It did not however reach its climax until after paid soldiers had replaced the old arri*re-ban , and the establishment of the standing army had revolutionized European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , at the same time they forced on it the king , just as at Rome the wars of conquest and the civil wars paved the way for imperialism . Far different was the case of England . There were external wars indeed , bat for conquest , not defence . Since the time of William the Conqueror no foreign foe has set foot on English soil . There were also internal wars , but with one exception these were for the rights of the nation , not for plunder . The War of the Roses , the nearest parallel in English history to many wars on the continent , was a great blessing to the country ; for , although it scourged the people for a time , it well-nigh exterminated the turbulent nobility and gave the realm a lasting peace . The foreign wars moreover , planned by an ambitious court , could not be carried on without money , and money could not be wrung from the nation through Parliament without concessions ; thus indirectly they were advantageous to the cause of popular liberty , in France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger , and , harassed to desperation by continuous wars , were willing to purchase peace and security at any price . The money that the English Parliament voted for the waging of foreign wars the French States General must give to assure life and property against destruction . In furnishing the // king with means to defend the realm they had not the heart to insist upon the strict observance of concessions made from time to time in exchange for grants , or to force the crown to accept the conditions they laid down . They were compelled* to ask favors of the monarchy rather than enabled to dictate to it . It is difficult for us of to-day , with a commercial and industrial civilization in a high state of development all about us and in an atmosphere permeated with advanced political ideas , to realize the condition or appreciate the feelings of strife-torn France during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries . The nobility were fond of war ; but the clergy and the third estate , who made up by far the greater part of the nation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the king . To him they looked for succour . Thus the onward march of events gave no opportunity for a gradual adjustment of authorities , as in England , through action and reaction , for a counterpoise resulting from the free and undisturbed operation of national forces , in a word , for the settling of the elementary powers into fixed relations under constitutional forms . Secondly , the predominance of local over national tendencies made united and harmonious action on the part of a national assembly an impossibility . Down to a late period France was peculiarly a land of cities . The influence of the municipal organizations was everywhere such as to place the special before the general interest , the city before the nation . Paris alone at times exerted an influence that determined the course of the nation . The local spirit of the distinct city govern . ments could be merged into a consciousness of national existence only after centuries of external pressure and internal unity of jurisdiction and firm administration had crushed out special rights and welded together discordant elements . Arising from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success of the States General ; but when the representatives of the different sections met in the assembly of the estates , national interests too often gave way to petty selfishness and narrow devotion to place . Discord was the inevitable result . Against a foreign foe , just as the Greek States against the Persians , all united in harmonious effort ; but with the removal of the danger the old jealousies and bickerings returned . // On one occasion the mere proposal that the assembly should itself apportion the assessment that had been voted so aroused the selfish passions of the deputies that the session was thrown into utter confusion . Not only were departments a variance with departments , even different bailiwicks of the same department were at swords ' points , each proclaiming the unfairness of the apportionment , that the others wished to assign to it . Only the interposition of the royal authority was able to quell the disturbance and give the matter a final adjustment . Another result of this sectional division of the nation is to be found in the existence of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree undermined that of the States General and hastened their decline . It is well-established that the boundaries of several of the sub-divisions of France to-day correspond almost exactly to those of Gallic States . In all the changes of time these have maintained their individuality , and well illustrate the tenacity of local distinctions . It is not surprising , then , that several of the provinces ( pays d%*lection ) had local or provincial Estates for the management of their own affairs . In some cases these seem to have existed prior to the States General and to have been kept up after the larger assembly had sunk into obscurity . They comprised the three orders as orders with additional representation from important cities . To them the monarchy had recourse when it was in need of funds and did not think it best to convoke the States General , or when the States General did not grant as much as was desired . This treating with the nation piecemeal , by encouraging local distinctions and flattering local prejudices , gave the Crown the advantage . The provincial Estates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were convoked at different times , appealed to with different arguments and pleas , dealt with in different ways , and hence readily brought over to the wishes of the Court . In some such way as Ca*sar conquered Gaul by taking it part by part and setting one portion against the other , the French kings gained their points over the nation as a whole by taking advantage of local divisions . But , in the third place , local divisions and sectional interests were not the only ones that stood in the way of the success of // the States General . Far more sharply defined than distinctions of locality and bitterer than local jealousies were those of class . The tendency of representative institutions in general is to break down barriers and bring all to the same plane of political privileges . Among the French the differences of rank that came down from Feudalism were too deeply impressed to allow the free outworking of representative ideas . There was no common interest , no bond of sympathy , between the three estates ; there was only a mutual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Each was in constant fear lest the other should somehow hinder it or interfere with its special prerogatives . The privileged orders desired to shift all bnrdens upon the third estate ; this , on the other hand , never failed to insist on the reduction of privileges . Of this state of feeling a natural result was the organization of the States General by orders instead of by chambers , which was fatal to all harmony and unity in deliberations . There could be no free play of parties , for class prejudices were too deeply rooted to admit of it . How in such a state of affairs could a national assembly either lay down or maintain vigorously and consistently a course of policy ? Nothing can be more disheartening to the advocate of free institutions than the record of the disgraceful strifes of the estates , that characterized the later meetings of the States General . The climax was reached in 16 t4 , when the whole session was a bedlam of disorder and passion . With such a state of feeling between the estates , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain of royalty . For with the nation 's representatives so divided among themselves the Crown had little to fear . Thus both the pride of place and the distinctions of rank played into the hands of the monarchy . Fourth , the coalition of the elements of power in France from the beginning was such as to assure the ultimate victory of the Crown over all other authorities and jeopardize the existence of an assembly representing the nation . This may be well illustrated from the history of England . The English nobility , or at least a great part of them , early espoused the cause of the commons . Three results followed . First , by the coalition of the secular orders the clergy as a political body were // forced to take a secondary position . They could not even hold the balance of power between the monarchy on the one hand and the other two orders combined . The effect of this was most salutary . It prevented the direct maintenance of papal interests in the Parliament , rendering impossible , or at any rate without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and devotion to the See . It also precluded that intimate relation between the Romish Church , with its temporal assumptions , and the State , which has been so detrimental to the political progress of the nations of Southern Enrope . As between the king and the other two orders , the clergy could hardly fail to cast their lot with the latter , thus setting a united nation over against the power of the Crown . Again , the three estates once brought together in sympathy and united action , became more and more united as time passed on . Any external pressure or collision with the Crown only made the compact closer , the alliance more firm . Finally , without taking the clergy into account , the coalition of the nobility and the third estate made a counterpoise to the monarchy of so great weight and resisting force that the extinction of the power of either order was no longer possible . Centuries of action and reaction settled and defined rights and prerogatives . The nation stood united ; the court recognized and respected its authority . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the Crown learned by experience that its faith with them must be kept . From such conditions have been developed the firm guaranties of Anglo-Saxon liberties ; hence the fine balance of the English Constitution . Now if either of the secular orders had in the beginning sided with the monarchy , the clergy for a time would have had an undue political prominence , the Crown would have been able to gain a victory over the other secular order , and then gradually to undermine its ally , remaining absolute . This is precisely what happened in France . In France the towns had not , as in England , grown up largely under feudal protection . Many of them dated far back of the feudal regime and resisted to the bitter end the encroachments of the nobility , which hated and feared them . In this they were at one with the rising monarchy , which for its own pur // poses favored them , and with which they naturally entered into an alliance to crnsh the power of the turbulent nobility . Thus the nation was divided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and as it were held the balance of power , since they had the same authority as the secular orders ; there followed all the evils consequent upon a mixture of ecclesiastical and secular interests . The monarchy , supported by the third estate , was stronger than any possible coalition of the elements of national strength that could rise up against it . With the prestige of royalty to aid it , directed moreover by the ability of the legists and backed up by the financial resources of the towns , it gradually crushed out the opposing power of the nobilitv . The clergy generally sided with the Crown . After the decline of the feudal nobility the third estate remained the only political factor that could ever become a counterpoise of the monarchy ; but of course either single handed or aided by the clergy it could offer no effectual opposition . Thus the monarchy became victorious over the nation , and no assembly of the nation 's representatives could ever bind or control it . As a fifth cause of the decline of the States General may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies of the realm . The division of the functions of government into the legislative , the judicial and the executive goes back beyond the time of Aristotle ; but the clear separation of one from the other , the sharp designation of the sphere of each and the adjustment of their mutual relations , belongs to modern times . In any well-administered government there must be a sympathy and spirit of cooperation between the lawmaking and the law-interpreting powers . While the former can only indirectly and slightly affect the latter , this by the character of its decisions may effectually neutralize the efforts of the powers . The bitter state of feeling existing between the States General and the Parliament of Paris was noticed in a former article . While the opposition of the latter to the ordinances that had their origin in the desires of the assembly seriously interfered with their execution , the evil by no means ended here . The hostile attitude of the two bodies of State towards each other discouraged the nation ; but it made the king rejoice , for in the division @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority . A combined effort of the States General and the Parliament , especially if aided by the University of Paris , which was always ready to throw the weight of its influence on the side of the nation , might have won from royalty many a concession of real benefit to the nation , while with the high courts in sympathy with the measures proposed by the States General these would have been enforced and could not so easily have become a dead letter . That the crown did not discourage the conflict of authorities is shown by the fact that the repeated requests of the States General for an adjustment of their relations with the Parliament of Paris remained unnoticed . Sixth , upon the monarchy rests the responsibility of having done all in its power to render futile every attempt of the States General to achieve an independent authority , and of having made every effort to bring to naught the results of their work except in so far as these furthered , or at least did not hinder , its own designs . But here we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken to task for its undying opposition to popular institutions . Kings are but men ; and human nature ought not to be judged by too high a standard . From the nature of the case a king looks upon himself generally as better able to rule than his subjects . To expect , moreover , that the Crown would willingly share with others an authority gained by so many struggles , would have been absurd . Then , too , the kings were taught that their power was from on high . Surrounded always by flatterers and having a weight of traditions to sustain , it was but natural that they should seek to maintain the prestige of the throne and , if possible , to increase its power . That phrase of the evolutionists , " the survival of the fittest , " embodies a wide-reaching political principle . A stable government contains a counterpoise of authorities , among which there is always a tendency to reach out after the mastery . If one becomes in any way superior to the rest , from the nature of the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French monarchy , gradually emerging above all other elements of national strength , naturally and with perfect propriety , according to the canons of statesmanship and the political morality // of the times , sought to fortify itself on every side and to suffer no opposing power in the State to rise beside it . But while thus the monarchy may be freed from some of the sentimental censure that has been heaped upon it for its opposition to the * States General , it is nevertheless still exposed to the gravest charges . The means employed by many of the kings of France to undermine the influence of the nation 's assembly were such as to brand them with eternal infamy . Never have rulers in their dealings with their subjects shown less good faith , or more grossly violated the first principles of justice and humanity . Frequent breaches of the most solemn obligations , the ignoring of direct promises , inexcusable evasion of the most manifest concessions , and unfeeling deception of those who appealed to the king 's good name , characterized the royal policy as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often said that Louis XI . was the first to introduce into France the Machiavellian statecraft , which indeed was so effectively made use of by his , successors ; but subterfuge , evasion , and deception were from the first the tactics that the kings brought to bear against the States General . Upon them therefore rests a stain that can not be removed , a responsibility in the failure of the States General that can not be shaken off . Seventh , the States General as a body representing the people had no firm support in a general desire to assert and maintain the people 's rights . During the whole period of the life of the States General there was in France no wide-spread public opinion in favor of popular liberties . The intelligence of the masses was not great enough to grasp fully the meaning of the word freedom . The first essential to the success of representative institutions lies in the individual consciousness of the possession of inalienable rights , and in the disposition of the individual to assert them . The States General had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the tendencies , or even the encroachments , of the monarchy . Occasional efforts to withstand the power of the Crown were not lacking ; but they were spasmodic , and for the most part inspired by class or party interests . This was especially true during the period of the religious wars . Protestants and Catholics , each questioned the authority of the other to rule , // and both practically accepted the principle that the king is the servant , not the divinely directed ruler , of the governed . The Catholic League embodied the most democratic principles of political organization known in France previous to 1789 . The general tendency of Catholicism towards centralization here for a time was lost sight of in an impulse to emphasize the individual and make the will of the majority paramount . Yet it was not a gradual realization of the rights of man as man , but a blind hatred of Protestantism , that united the Catholics into a compact against the monarchy . Even then it was only the leaders that well understood the significance of the movement ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educated some of the truths of personal liberty and civil rights in later times found lodgment . Philip Pot in his earnest defence of the sovereignty of the people by no means stood alone . But these political reasonings and the new thoughts of freedom did not reach the masses , the rank and file of the nation . In the general diffusion of political intelligence and aspirations France was far behind her neighbor across the channel . lit was not till the latter part of the eighteenth century that the fierce utterances of friends of freedom , edged with satire and caricature , appealing directly to the sense of manhood , flew from hamlet to hamlet , from house to house , till the French awoke to a full sense of their rights . Then they realized for the first time that government is a thing " of the people and for the people . " Too late they found that once there had been in the nation 's hands a natural means by which it could have maintained its proper place in the government , and could have made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost opportunities they demanded a meeting of the States General . But these through neglect had become so far a matter of the past that none could tell how the elections to them were conducted , or what their powers and functions were . When finally the deputies assembled , it is no wonder that , having a support in the nation that all former meetings had lacked , they broke loose from the trammels of centuries of oppression and took matters into their own hands . Eighth , the decline of the States General was doubtless hastened by certain defects in their organization and faulty // methods in their transaction of business . These were due partly to causes already noticed , and partly to the political inexperience and partizan animosities of the deputies . Tliere are seven points of weakness worthy of special notice . 1 . The complications of the elective system , by removing the representative several degrees from his constituents , tended to check enthusiasm and to destroy interest among the people in the success of the assembly . These were derived from the elective processes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspicion , in a desire to guard against all danger of collusion . Suspicion is indeed a bad element on which to found an institution . A representative assembly to assure success must have its representatives as intimately connected with their constituents as possible , directly responsible to the people , not removed by several boards of electors . To the French provincial often the most tangible result of a meeting of the States General was an increase of taxation for the payment of deputies , of whom he knew little and for whom he cared less . 2 . The deputies who met in the States General were clad with special , or circumscribed , powers . They were therefore more properly delegates than representatives . Each deputy before leaving his district received from his electors a statement of the subjects on which he could deliberate and render decision for them . These , as previously remarked , were determined by the letter of convocation , and beyond them he dared not go without renewed and enlarged powers . When unforeseen events brought before the States General for consideration matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not feel authorized to take action and were obliged to return home for further directions . Such a crisis came at the death of Francis I. when the delay proved of great hurt to the interests of the nation . On many occasions the success of the assembly was effectually blocked by the restriction of powers . 3 . In the organization of the States General the practice of electing the presidents and the orators before the formal opening of the session was followed by most unfortunate results . Since debates and other exercises had not yet brought to the front the leading minds , often men were chosen for these important // positions who were in every respect unfitted to fill them . There were several occasions when fruitful measures and salutary reforms were thwarted , principally because the presidents and orators of the estates failed in force of presentation , or were wrought upon by the bribery or coercion of the court . 4 . The system of voting by departments materially affected the harmony of action and hurt the influence of the States General . It gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sectional at the expense of the national spirit . A more unwise plan of getting at the sentiment of the deputies could hardly have been adopted ; yet it was only a natural outgrowth of the state of the country . 5 . There was an excessive employment of committees , especially by the third estate . In large bodies of men acting together the use of committees is a necessity ; but the relation of the work of committees to that of the whole is , nevertheless , difficult of adjustment . In the States General the division into committees was often carried so far that it diminished the enthusiasm among the deputies as a whole , and thus weakened their influence . 6 . The States General failed to develop a system of parliamentary practice . The lack of it was a perpetual source of confusion in the meetings and hindered the transaction of business . Parliamentary law is a contrivance not merely to protect the rights of minorities , but also to facilitate the conducting of declarations and to enable the sentiment of an assembly to be formulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed to develop any such code of rulings ; and in 1789 , notwithstanding the utter confusion of the session , the deputies indigna*ntly rejected a carefully digested manual of the usages of the English Parliament , which had been prepared for them by one of their own number . 7 . The proceedings of the States General show a marked lack not merely of political experience but also of political intelligence and sagacity on the part of the deputies . IMlen trained in municipal affairs or having no experience whatever in politics often found themselves helpless in the presence of questions of national concern . It is difficult for us to form a conception of that state of society to which Rousseau 's " Social // Contract , " with its assertion of the rights of man , " came like a revelation from Heaven . " The deputies in political matters could not be far in advance of the people they represented . Finally , notwithstanding the trend of national tendencies* and unavoidable defects in the organization and methods of the States General , they are in some degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion shortsighted and narrow selfishness stood in the way of the nation 's good . They did not always act in accordance with the light they had . Their course was such as to remind one of the old Spartan jibe at the Athenians : " The Athenians know what is right but are unwilling to do it . " Fine rhetoric , firm and noble expositions of the principles involved , earnest statements of the right , gave way before an indisposition to act and were lost in inertia . Greater brilliancy than practicability characterized their eloquence , more boldness than persistency their action . Often valuable time was wasted in quibbling over matters of no significance , while the interests of the nation hung trembling in the balance . Moreover , the rhetorical vagueness of the most important propositions sometimes gave the king an opportunity to evade them ; the fault of bad literary style however was one common to the age . Th* resistance of the States General also was always passive , never aggressive . Many a crisis came up when a single energetic stroke might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity was presented by the minority of Charles VII. , and again by that of L6nis Xlii. , but internal strifes and hesi. tation gave the Crown the advantage . But in passing censure on this score it should not be forgotten that the deputies looked upon themselves as having only restricted powers , and were not sustained by an enlightened public sentiment . Had the nation that sent them up as its representatives been stirred with an earnest desire for the maintenance of its rights against the encroachments of the Crown , little donbt that they wonld have gained for the States General a permanent place in the State . Less excusable , however , was the yielding of the depnties on so many occasions to the sednctive influences of bribery and corruption , the wiles of a crafty and nuprincipled Court . // In the series of articles of which this is the last , attention has been called to some of the important facts connected with the States General of France and their failure as a national institution . In regard to the ideas of personal liberty *nd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the national life were from the first toward representative institutions with a constitutional monarchy . But the natural course of development was interfered with , the rise of the States General as a counterpoise to the growing power of the Crown was checked , the monarchy little by little gained the advantage , and absolutism was the outcome . Yet the States General were not without salutary and enduring results . While they lasted they did much to keep the monarchy within the proper bounds of authority . Furt , her than this , they had great influence in shaping the legislation of the country . Every department received from them suggestion* of laws , the moral effect of which was often farreaching . Notwithstanding the opposition of the Crown and the interference of the Parliament , traces of the influence of the States General are to be found in the laws of France even down to the Revolution . Finally , the States General created a tradition in favor of the nation 's rights , which formed the starting point of energetic action when in 1789 the people rose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequence of the earnest impulsiveness of the national character , there was a reaction from absolutism to license . To-day , settling down calmly to a mean between the two extremes , the French seem to be realizing in no small measure the blessing of a well-balanced constitution based upon the rights of the citizen . This is the proper outcome of the national tendencies , this is the result for which the nation has been made fit and ready by centuries of political experiences . May the French take warning as well as encouragement from their past , and meet with continued prosperity and success in the maintenance of stable free institutions ! For , in the words of one of the greatest of living Frenchmen , " Time and space are as nothing in the mysterious development of God 's designs towards men , and it is the privilege of mankind to get instruction and example from the far-off memories of their history . " FRANCIS W. KELSEY.
