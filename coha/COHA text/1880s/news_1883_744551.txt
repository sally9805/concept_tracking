txt In the death of Mr. MORGAN New-York loses another of that group of its able public men which has of late been so rapidly dwindling . Though born in Massachusetts and receiving his first business training in Connecticut , Mr. MORGAN had lived so long in this City , and had rendered such great and valuable services both to the City and the State , that his name is closely identified with New-York . He was a bold , sagacious , and successful merchant , and few men have given such evidence so early in life of the qualities which , steadily applied , can command almost unlimited wealth . But Mr. MORGAN had a strong taste for public life ' and the capacity which is sure of recognition , and he was yet in the prime of young manhood when he turned his attention to politics . Thirty-four years have passed since he occupied the position of President of the Board of Assistant Aldermen , but many of our older citizens can remember the energy , courage , and fidelity with which , in that post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . Shortly after , elected to the State Senate , he promptly took a leading position in a body which included some of the foremost men of the State . It was a critical time in the political history of the country . The Whig Party , with which Mr. MORGAN had zealously acted , was hopelessly divided on the slavery question . By many of the qualities of his mind he was strongly conservative , but it was in methods rather than in purpose that his conservatism showed itself . His convictions of duty as well as his sagacity , which prevented him from believing that the aggressive temper of the slave power , the product of unyielding economic necessity , could be safely ignored or successfully compromised with , placed him naturally by the side of Mr. SEWARD in the division of the party . He was among the first to see the need of a reorganization of parties , and , as was his custom , he acted promptly on this perception . He was an active and prominent member of the famous Pittsburg Convention of 1856 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prepared to carry them out . In the Fremont campaign he was Chairman of the National Committee , and the rapid progress which the new organization made  --  a progress which startled the South and awoke the free North to a new sense of its power and its duty  --  was largely due to his indefatigable labors and his extraordinary administrative qualities . He was quickly recognized as a leader , and in 1858 the new party put him forward as its candidate for Governor . He was elected , and in his first term proved to the country that the " fanatics , " " freedomshriekers , " and " revolutionists " were equal to the task of orderly , thorough , vigorous , and economical management of public affairs . At that , period it was a service to the cause of Freedom as great as its most eloquent orators could render , and one far more difficult . Nor should it be forgotten that Gov . MORGAN 'S skillful administration of the State Government during his first term made possible the magnificent achievements of the second term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State more than ready to do its full duty in defense of the national Government . The history of the work of 1861 and 1862 at Albany bas never been adequately written , and has hardly been fairly known . Looking back at it now , we see that nearly a quarter of a million of men were sent into the . Union ranks , but the significance of these figures is felt only when we remember that this vast force  --  larger than that which the warlike empire of France was able to put into the field when it declared war on Germany in 1870 ? was drawn from the , bosom of a peaceful community , by volun- tary enlistment , equipped , armed , and sent to the seat of war , the greater part of it pledged for service " for three years or the war . " It was characteristic of Gov . MORGAN 'S way of doing any work to which he set himself that he made his preparations from the start " to see the thing through , " and he secured enlistments for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months or two years men . Besides the task of recruiting , equipment , and organization , the sea-board of the State was placed in condition for defense against invasion , and the finances of the Government , strained by an unprecedented burden , were kept in perfect order . In the labors which these achievements involved no one bore so large a part as the chief Executive . Possessed of an iron constitution , with unbounded energy and industry , and with rare precision of purpose as well as capacity for systematic labor , the Governor was at his post early every day , and it was often long after midnight when he left the Executive Chamber . He literally wore out the most active of his subordinates who tried to keep up with his unflagging energy . And in the rush and confusion about him he was as calm , collected , and accessible as if engaged in directing the well-ordered routine of his Front-street warehouse . There are not a few of the military men whose names figure conspicuously in the history of that momentous struggle who rendered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GOV . MORGAN . When the Governor declined a renomination at the close of his second term , he only changed his field of work . In 1863 , he took his place in the United States Senate as the successor of PRESTON KING . In that body he showed.the same qualities that had distinguished him in the executive office . Laborious , faithful , far-sighted , and intelligent , he contributed largely to the performance of the difficult task which still awaited the national Government in crushing the rebellion , and in repairing the waste and disorder which followed the war . He took an active part in legislation affecting the finances and commerce , as well as in military matters , and was always listened to with respect on the rare occasions when he participated in debate . He declined the office of Secretary of the Treasury in 1865 , and practically retired from public life on leaving the Senate in 1869 . His death even at the age of 72 seems premature , for his strong constitution appeared fitted for a longer life . But the extraordinary labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , overtaxed even his great powers . The people of his State and of the whole country owe to his remarkable services the tribute of grateful remembrance .
