txt A terrible accident happened at 3:15 this afternoon on the Market-street bridge . In patting up the fourth span of the bridge one of the hangerg which uphold the flooring and are suspended from the iron trusses above was not finished by bolting to the flooring on account of the nuts not fitting . but was suspended by a chain in place of the solid hanger which would take its place when the bridge was completed . The temporary trestles , with the exception of one , had been removed to-day from under the span , and when a lumber wagon driven by Burt Thompson attempted to cross the chain parted , allowing one end of the heavy iron girder which it supported and about forty feet of the flooring to fall into the river . The horses , wagon , driver and six or seven mon who wore on this part of the bridge fell with it into the river , or fortunately grasped the part still standing and saved themselves .

The horses were drowned , and , with the wagon , are lying about 200 feet below the bridge , stuck on an old bridge span . The workmen claim that when Thompson 's team approached they yelled to the driver to stop , but that he drove right on , either not hearing or not heeding them .
