txt The excitement incidental to the enormous emigration of the colored people from South Carolina continues unabated , and grave apprehensions lre entertained that the agricultural interests of the entire State will suffer irreparable injury the coming season through lack of necessary labor , It has been ascertained from intelligent colored men that the exodus is not confined to the county of Edgefield , though more colored people have thus far left that county than any other , but that it extends to nearly all the counties in the western part of the State . Persons competent to judge , visiting in the places which have suffered most from the movement , estimate the total number of the emigrants who have thus far departed at 10,000 , two-thirds of whom are represented as able-bodied men above the age of 21 . It was ascertained from the same authorities that fully as many more will leave the State within the next two months , and that the reason the colored people do not all go is because they have not the necessary means to seek homes elsewhere . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the event  --  such as the enactment of the Stock law , high rents , short ; crops , and heavy and , in most cases , unjus liens ; but the real principle involved was briefly stated by a very prominent representative of the colored race as follows " Our people are suffering under a worse bondage in this State than they did before the war . We have no rights , civil or political , which the party in power respects . Congress gave us the right to vote , yet we are not allowed to exercise that right : or , when we are allowed to approach the ballot-box , our ballots are not counted . Before we were freed the white man reaped the benefit of our labor , but he clothed us , fed us , and looked after us in sickness ; now the situation is only changed in this , that we have to feed and clothe ourselves , and if we have not the means to employ a physician when sick we are allowed to die like clogs . Who can blame us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we , and our children in time to come , can enjoy the rights and privileges conferred on us by an all-wise Providence ' - " This is the whole grievance in a nut-shell , and , unfortunately for the Bourbon journals engaged in misrepresenting the condition and aims of the colored people , there are abundant stubborn facts ? many of which were at various times published in THE TIDIES  --  to prove the truth of the abeve assertion . " It required no prophet to foretell this departure of the colored people , " said one of the most eminent jurists of this State a few days ago . " I knew it had to come , and in the Summer of 1879 , while at one of the springs in Virginia , I told several of our best-known politicians that unless the colored man was allowed to exercise the rights of citizenship unmolested ho would leave the State and go where his rights are not interfered with . For the ballot is his emblem of freedom . ' White men who have voted all their lives can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You may take away his wife and children and his property , but you must permit him to cast that vote , and you must count that vote , if you want him to remain in South Carolina . " The most influential of the Bourbon organs , the News and Courier , goes to much trouble to prove that the colored people have no real cause for grievance , and " that they stand on the same ' footing , in every respect , as their white fellow-citizens . " One need only peruse the files of that journal as to be wholly untrue . It further states : " The courts of the State are open and the scales of justice are held even . " True , a marked improvement has been worked in the judiciary system of late , but how about the many thousand cases of injustice to Repupiieans in the State courts which have been put on record since the Democracy stole the control of the State ? A case in point will show hew juries are manipulated by the underlings of the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers charged with that duty were drawing the names of jurors to serve on the grand and petit juries at the Court of General Sessions , County Auditor Eason , of Charleston , tore up and cast aside a number of slips bearing the names of respectable citizens . When asked by Jury Commissioner Holloway why he acted thus , Eason replied : " They were the names of Republicans and none of that political creed should go on the juries . " Halloway offered further remonstrance , and told Eason he would have to assign a better reason than that for rejecting tax-paying citizens . Eason replied that he would be ? if he would , and , as Halloway was soon after removed from his position by the Governor , he believes it is owing to his interference with the Auditor 's unlawful acts . Several newspapers , among them the Greenville News , treat the exodus lightly , and suggest that the planters have it in their power to supply the place of every departed colored tenant or laborer with a white one . Experience has proved that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The few who have from time to time been brought into this State found fault with the mode of living ? " hog and hominy " and windowless log huts weije not to their taste  --  and they almost invariably went away as soon as they obtained the means . If it has been found impossible to retain immigrant labor in the upland counties , how much more so must it prove incapable of being done in the lower , miasmatic districts , where the " country fever " would kill them in less than a month during the season when their services are most needed . Great stress is laid upon the fact that many colored families have moved into Beaufort County  --  by some persons  --  as evidence that the colored people find no fault with the State Government . The real reason why they selected Beaufort is because the county is almost exclusively Republican . Here are settled the several thousand colored soldiers mustered out after the war on the seacoast , and who purchased honaes ou the lands sold by the Government for taxes .
