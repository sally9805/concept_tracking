From Maryland Phelps went to Evanston , Ill. , 12 miles from Chicago , taking Fannie Thayer and a colored ' servant with him . From Evanston he went to Fargo with Ken Webster . chief of the Springfield detectives , and unknown to his wife started a divorce suit , alleging in his affidavit that he did not know his wife 's whereabouts , when the fact was that he had met her only a few clays before at the Grand Pacific Hotel , Chicago .

Phelps next went to St. Paul , Iklinn. with Fannie Thayer and married her , and went ! with her to Washington , where they learned that the divorce had been set aside , and at once started for Canton , in the northwest backwoods of Dakota , and Phelps there started another divorce proceeding , and asserted that he had the Judge " fixed , " and that if the proceedings were not made known to his wife he would have everything all right . He told Detective Hartman ' he had paid lots of money for help to get the second divorce started , and offered the detective money if he would not tell his wife of it .

At the opening of the court , however , Judge Mart Bangs , formerly United States District Attorney in that locality , of up and told the Judge that he represented Helen -E . Phelps , who was the legal wife of Phelps , and was ready for trial . This was a bombshell , and at once the case on the part of Phelps was adjourned and has not come up since . Then Phelps went to St. John , New-Brunswick , with Fannie and remained there until recently , when they came to New-York . Two months ago the legal wife of Phelps accidently met him on Fourteenth-street , New-York , and attempted to follow him , but losing track of him she wrote to Detective Hartman , at Chicago , and asked him to come on to New-York and help to locate her husband . The detective did so , and finally learned that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the arrest followed .

The document is now being contested in the Massachusetts courts . When Detective Hartman and Officer Willis Van Buren entered Phelps 's office this morning the latter was busy writing letters . Looking up , he recognized the detective , with an expression of astonishment on his face . The officer made known his business , when Phelps said : " Well , I am ready to go , but I would like too to see a lawyer , and go to the house and change my clothes and get some papers . " The detective allowed him to do so in. company with Officer Van Buren , and Phelps secured the services of H. H. Hustis , of Fishkill Landing . when it was agreed that all should appear before some Judge in this city this afternoon for an inquiry into the case . Mr. Phelps claims that the arrest is a persecution for the purpose of obtaining money from him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in Massachusetts , and that he has a certified copy of it . He says that he , too , has a divorce from her , and holds the original document . The prisoner arrived at Poughkeepsie on the 12:35 P.

Phelps , the prisoner 's legal wife , is a splendid looking woman , and I do n't see why he acts so . She is not over 35 years old , of splendid physique , and highly educated . She is thoroughly infatuated with him , and is determined that he shall not live with Fannie Thayer . She also loves her son , who has just graduated . Phelps has charged her with inconstancy , but the charge is absurd . have been on the case four years and have always found her to be a true lady . " After Judge Guernsey decided to deliver Phelps to the detective , Phelps and the latter had a talk in which the prisoner hoped he would not be handcuffed .
