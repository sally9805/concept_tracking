Mi DEAR CoLoi*EL INGERSOLL : I RAVE read your Reply to my Open Letter half a dozen time8 , and each time with new appreciation of your skill as an advocate . It is written with great ingenuity , and furnishes probably as complete an argument as you are able to give for the faith ( or want of faith ) that is in you . Doubtless you think it unanswerable , and so it will seem to those who are predisposed to your way of thinking . To quote a homely saying of Mr. Lincoln , in which there is as much of wisdom as of wit , " For those who like that sort of thing , no doubt that is the sort of thing they do like . " You may answer that we , who cling to the faith of our fathers , are equally prejudiced , and that it is for that reason that we are not more impressed by the force of your pleading . I do not deny a strong leaning that way , and yet our real interest is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , I have tried to give due weight to whatever of argument there is in the midst of so much eloquence ; but must confess that , in spite of all , I remain in the same obdurate frame of mind as before . With all the candor that I can bring to bear upon the question , I find on reviewing my Open Letter scarcely a sentence to change and nothing to withdraw ; and am quite willing to leave it as my Declaration of Faith , to stand side by side with your Reply , for intelligent and candid men to judge between us . I need only to add a few words in taking leave of the subject . You seem a little disturbed that " some of my brethren " should look upon you as " a monster " because of your unbelief . I certainly do not approve of such language , althougli they would tell me that it is the only word which is a fit response to your ferocious attacks upon what they hold most sacred . You are a born gladiator , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy blows , which provoke blows in return . In this very Reply // you manifest a particular animosity against Presbyterians . Is it because you were brought up in that Church , of which your father , whom you regard with filial respect and affection , was an honored minister ? You even speak of " the Presbyterian God ! " as if we assumed to appropriate the Supreme Being , claiming to be the special objects of His favor . Is there any ground for this imputation of narrowness ? On the contrary , when we bow our knees before our Maker , it is as the God and Father of all mankind ; and the expression you permit yourself to use , can only be regarded as grossly offensive . Was it necessary to offer this rudeness to the religious denomination in which you were born ? And this may explain , what you do not seem fully to understand , why it is that you are sometimes treated to sharp epithets by the religious press and public . You think yourself persecuted for your opinions . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it because you express your opinions . Nobody would de4y you the same freedom which is accorded to Huxley or Herbert Spencer . It is not because you exercise your liberty of judgment or of speech , but because of the way in which you attack others , holding up their faith to all manner of ridicule , and speaking of those who profess it as if they must be either knaves or fools . It is not in human nature not to resent such imputations on that which , however incredible to you , is very precious to them . Hence it is that they think you a rough antagonist ; and when you shock them by such expressions as I have quoted , you must expect some pretty strong language in return . I do not join them in this , because I know you , and appreciate that other side of you which is manly and kindly and chivalrous . But while I recognize these better qualities , I must add in all frankness that I am compelled to look upon you as a man so embittered against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated with cant , bigotry , and hypocrisy . In such a state of mind it is hardly possible for you to judge fairly of the arguments for its truth . I believe , with you , that reason was given us to be exercised , and that when man seeks after truth , his mind should be , as you say Darwin 's was , " as , free from prejudice as the mariner*s compass . " But if he is warped by passion so that he can not see things truly , then is he responsible . It is the moral element which alone makes the responsibility . Nor do I believe that any // man will be judged in this world or the next for what does not involve a moral wrong . Hence your appalling statement , " The God you worship will , according to your creed , torture ( ! ) through all the endless years the man who entertains ' an honest doubt , " does not produce the effect intended , simply because I do not affirm nor believe any such thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man will be judged according to the deeds done in the body , and that the judgment , whatever it may be , will be transparently just . God is more merciful than man . He desireth not the death of the wicked . Christ forgave where men would condemn , and whatever be the fate of any human soul , it can never be said that the Supreme Ruler was wanting either in justice or mercy . This I emphasize because you dwell so much upon the subject of future retribution , giving it an attention so constant as to be almost exclusive . Whatever else you touch upon you soon come back to this as the black thunder-cloud that darkens all the horizon , casting its mighty shadows over the life that now is and that which is to come . Your denunciations of this " inhuman " belief are so reiterated that one would be left to infer that there is nothing else in Religion ; that it is all wrath and terror . But this is puttng a part for the whole . Religion is a vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : it is but one doctrine of many ; and indeed some whom no one will deny to be devout Christians , do not hold it at all , or only in a modified form , while with all their hearts they accept and profess the Religion that Christ came to bring into the world . Archdeacon Farrar , of Westminster Abbey , the most eloquent preacher in the Church of England , has written a book entitled Eternal Hope , " in which he argues from reason and the Bible , that this life is not " the be-all and end-all " of human probation ; but that in the world to come there will be another opportunity , when countless millions , made wiser by unhappy experience , will turn again to the paths of life ; and that so in the end the whole human race , with the exception of perhaps a few who remain irreclaimable , will be recovered and made happy forever . Others look upon " eternal death " as merely the extinction of being , while immortality is the reward of pre-eminent virtue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wages of sin is death , but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord . " The latter view might recommend itself to you as the application of " the survival of // the fittest " to another world , the worthless , the incurably bad , of the human race being allowed to drop out of existence ( an end which can have no terrors for you , since you look upon it as the common lot of all men ) , while the good are continued in being forever . The acceptance of either of these theories would relieve your mind of that " horror of great darkness " which seems to come over it whenever you look forward to retribution beyond the grave . But while conceding all liberty to others I can not so easily relieve myself of this stern and rugged truth . To me moral evil in the universe is a tremendous reality , and I do not see how to limit it within the bounds of time . Retribution is to me a necessary part of the Divine law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no law . But I rest the argument for it , not on the Bible , but onprinc*ples which yon your8e*f acknowledge . You say , " There are no punishments , no rewards : there are consequences . " Very well , take the " consequences , " and see where they lead you . When a man by his vices has reduced his body to a wreck and his mind to idiocy , you say this is the " consequence " of his vicious life . Is it a great stretch of language to say that it is his " punishment , " and none the less punishment because self-inflicted ? To the poor sufferer raving in a mad-house it matters little what it is called , so long as he is experiencing the agonies of hell . And here your theory of " consequences , " if followed up , will lead you very far . For if man lives after death , and keeps his personal identity , do not the " consequences " of his past life follow him into the future ? And if his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? And what is this but endless retri-bution ? But you tell me that the moral effect of retribution is destroyed by the easy way in which a man escapes the penalty . He has but to repent , and he is restored to the same condition before the law as if he had not sinned . Not so do I understand it . " I believe in the forgiveness of sins , " but forgiveness does not reverse the course of nature ; it does not prevent the operation of natural law . A drunkard may repent as he is nearing his end , but that does not undo the wrong that he has done , nor avert the consequences . In spite of his tears he dies in an agony of shame and remorse . The inexorable law must be fulfilled . And so in the future world . Even though a man be forgiven , he // does not wholly escape the evil of his past life . A retribution follows him even within the heavenly gates ; for if he does not aufer , still that bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diminish his power of enjoyment . There are degrees of happiness , as one star differeth from another star in glory ; and he who begins wrong , will find that it is not as well to sin and repent of it as not to sin at all . lie enters the other world in a state of ipiritual infancy , and will have to begin at the bottom , and climb slowly upward . We might go a step farther , and say that perhaps heaven itself has not only its lights but its shadows , in the reflections that must come even there . We read of " the book of God 's remembrance , " but is there not another book of remembrance in the mind itself  --  a book which any man may well fear to open and to look thereon ? When that book is opened , and we read its awful pages , shall we not all think " what might have been ? " And will those thoughts be wholly free from sadness ? The drunken brute who breaks the heart that loved him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with her dying lips ; but he can not forgive himself , and never can he recall without grief that bowed head and that broken heart . This preserves the element of retribution , while it does not shut the door to forgiveness and mercy . But we need not travel over again the round of Christian doctrines . My faith is very simple ; it revolves around two words : GOD and CHRIsT . These are the two centres , or , as an astronomer might say , the double-star , or double-sun , of the great orbit of religious truth . As to the first of these , you say " There ean be no evidence to my mind of the existence of such a being , and my mind is so that it is incapable of even thinking of an infinite personality ; " and you gravely put to me this question : " Do you really believe that this world is governed by an infinitely wise and good God ? Have you convinced even yourself of this ? " Here are two questionsone as to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benevolence . I will answer both in language as plain as it is possible for me to use . First , Do I believe in the existence of God ? I answer that it is impossible for me not to believe it . I could not disbelieve it if I would . You insist that belief or unbelief is not a matter of // choice or of the will , but of evidence . You say " the brain thinks as the heart beats , as the eyes see . " Then let us stand aside with all our prepossessions , and open our eyes to what we can see . When Robinson Crusoe in his desert island came down one day to the seashore , and saw in the sand the print of a human foot , could he help the instantaneous conviction that a man had been there ? You might have tried to persuade him that it was all chance ,  --  that the sand had been washed up by the waves or blown by the winds , and taken this form , or that some marine insect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would not have moved him a particle . The imprint was there , and the conclusion was irresistible : he did not believe-he knew that some human being , whether friend or foe , civilized or savage , had set his foot upon that desolate shore . So when I discover in the world ( as I think I do ) mysterious footprints that are certainly not human , it is not a question whether I shall believe or not : I can not help believing that some Power greater than man has set foot upon the earth . It is a fashion among atheistic philosophers to make light of the argument from design ; but " my mind is so that it is incapable ' * of resisting the conclusion to which it leads me . And ( since personal questions are in order ) I beg to ask if it is possible for you to take in your hand a watch , and believe that there was no " design " in its construction ; that it was not made to keep time , but only * happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freak of nature , which brought together its parts and set it going ? Do you not know with as much positiveness as can belong to any conviction of your mind , that it was not the work of accident , but of design ; and that if there was a design , there was a designer ? And if the watch was made to keep time , was not the eye made to see and the ear to hear ? Skeptics may fight against this argument as much as they please , and try to evade the inevitable conclusion , and yet it remains forever entwined in the living frame of man , as well as embedded in the solid foundations of the globe . Wherefore I repeat , it is not a question with me whether I will believe or not-I can not help believing ; and I am not only surprised , but amazed , that you or any thoughtful man can come to any other conclusion . In wonder and astonishment I ask , " Do you really believe " that in all the wide universe there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creatures that creep on // this earthly ball ? For myself , it is with the profoundest conviction as well as the deepest reverence that I repeat the first sentence of my faith : " I believe in God the Father Almighty . " And not the Almighty only , but the Wise and the Good . Again I ask , How can I help believing what I see every day of my life ? Every morning , as the sun rises in the East , sending light and life over the world , I behold a glorious image of the beneficent Creator . The exquisite beauty of the dawn , the dewy freshness of the air , the fleecy clouds floating in the sky-all speak of Him . And when the sun goes down , sending shafts of light through the dense masses that would hide his setting , and casting a glory over the earth and sky , this wondrous illumination is to me but the reflection of Him who " spreadeth out the heavens like a curtain ; who maketh the clouds His chariot ; who walketh upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do we find the evidences of goodness in man himself : in the power of thought ; of acquiring knowledge ; of penetrating the mysteries of nature and climbing among the stars . Can a being endowed with such transcendent gifts doubt the goodness of his Creator ? Yes , I believe with all my heart and soul in One who is not only Infinitely Great , but Infinitely Good ; who loves all the creatures He has made ; bending over them as the bow in the cloud spans the arch of heaven , stretching from horizon to horizon ; looking down upon them with a tenderness compared to which all human love is faint and cold . " Like as a father pitieth his children , so the Lord pitieth them that fear Him ; for He knoweth our frame , He remembereth that we are dust . " On the question of immortality you are equally " at sea . " You know nothing and believe nothing ; or , rather , you know only that you do not know , and believe that you do not believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admit a bare possibility , that there may be another life , though you are in an uncertainty about it that is altogether bewildering and desperate . But your mind is so poetical that you give a certain attractiveness even to the prospect of annihilation . You strew the sepulchre with such flowers as these : " 1 have said a thousand times , and Isay again , that the idea of immortality , that like a sea has ebbed and flowed in the human heart , with its countless waves of hope and fear beating against the shores and rocks of time and fate , was not // born of any book , nor of any creed , nor of any religion . It was born of human affection , and it will continue to ebb and flow beneath the mistsand cloudsof doubt and darkness as long as love kisses the lips of death . " I have said a thousand times , and Isay again , that we do not know , we can not say , whether death is a wall or a door ; the beginning or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soar , or the folding forever of wings ; the rise or the set of a sun , or an endless life that brings rapture and love to every one . " Beautiful words ! but inexpressibly sad ! It is a silver lining to the cloud , and yet the cloud is there , dark and impenetrable . But perhaps we ought not to expect anything clearer and brighter from one who recognizes no light but that of nature . That light is very dim . If it were all we had , we should be just where Cicero was , and say with him , and with you , that a future life was " to be hoped for rather than believed . " But does not that very uncertainty show the need of a something above Nature , which is furnished in Him who " was crucified , dead and buried , and the third day rose again from the dead ? " It is the Conqueror of Death who calls to the faint-hearted " I am the Resurrection and the Life . " Since He has gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grave , we need not fear to follow , resting on the word of our Leader " Because I live , ye shall live also . " This faith in another life is a precious inheritance , which can not be torn from the agonized bosom without a wrench that tears every heartstring ; and it was to this I referred as the last refuge of a poor , suffering , despairing soul , when I asked : " Does it never occur to you that there is something very cruel in this treatment of the belief of your fellow-creatures , on whose hope of another life hangs all that relieves the darkness of their present existence ? " The imputation of cruelty you repel with some warmth , saying ( with a slight variation of my language ) : " When I dens , the existence of perdition , you reply that there is something very cruel in this treatment of the belief of my fellow-creatures . " Of course , this change of words , putting perdition in the place of immortal life and hope , was a mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character of what I wrote . As I described " the treatment of the belief of my fellow-creatures , " I did think it " very cruel , " and I think so still . While correcting this slight misquotation , I must remove from your mind a misapprehension , which is so very absurd as to be absolutely comical . In my Letter referring to your disbelief of immortality , I had said : " With an air of modesty and diffidence // that would carry an audience by storm , you confess your ignorance of what perhaps others are better acquainted with , when you say , This world is all that I know anything about , 80 far a I recollect . ' " Of course " what perhaps others are better acquainted with " was a part of what you said , or at least implied by your manner , ( for you do not convey your meaning merely by words , but by a tone of voice , by arched eyebrows , or a curled lip ) ; and yet , instead of taking the sentence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand it as an assumption on my part to have some private and mysterious knowledge of another world ( ! ) , and gravely ask me , " Did you by this intend to say that you know anything of any other state of existence ; that you have inhabited some other planet ; that you lived before you were born ; and that you recollect something of that other world or of that other state ? " No , my dear Colonel ! I have been a good deal of a traveler , and have seen all parts of this world , but I have never visited any other . In reading your sober question , if I did not know you to be one of the brightest wits of the day , I should be tempted to quote what Sidney Smith says of a Scotchman , that " you can not get a joke into his head except by a surgical operation ! " But to return to what is serious : you make light of our faith and our hopes , because you know not the infinite solace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the idea that religion can be " a consolation . " Indeed ! Is it not a consolation to have an Almighty Friend ? Was it a light matter for the poor slave mother , who sat alone in her cabin , having been robbed of her children , to sing in her wild , wailing accents : " Nobody knows the sorrows I 've seen : Nobody knows but Jesus " ? Would you rob her of that Unseen Friend  --  the only Friend she had on earth or in heaven ? But I will do you the justice to say that your want of religious faith comes in part from your very sensibility and tenderness of heart . You can not recognize an overruling Providence , because your mind is so harassed by scenes that you witness . Why , you ask , do men suffer so ? You draw frightful pictures of the misery which exists in the world , as a proof of the incapacity of its Ruler and Governor , and do not hesitate to say that " any // honest man of average intelligence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your way , you would make everybody happy ; there should be no more poverty , and no more sickness or pain . This is a pleasant picture to look at , and yet you must excuse me for saying that it is rather a child 's picture than that of a stalwart man . The world is not a playground in which men are to be petted and indulged like children : spoiled children they would soon become . It is an arena of conflict , in which we are to develop the manhood that is in us . We all have to take the " rough-and-tumble " of life , and are the better for it-physically , intellectually , and morally . If there be any true manliness within us , we come out of the struggle stronger and better ; with larger minds and kinder hearts ; a broader wisdom and a gentler charity . Perhaps we should not differ on this point if we could agree as to the true end of life . But here I fear the difference is irreconcilable . You think that end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not believe that the highest end of life upon earth is to " have a good time ; " to get from it the utmost amount of enjoyment ; but to be truly and greatly GOOD ; and that to that end no discipline can be too severe which leads us " to suffer and be strong . " That discipline answers its end when it raises the spirit to the highest pitch of courage and endurance . The splendor of virtue never appears so bright as when set against a dark background . It was in prisons and dungeons that the martyrs showed the greatest degree of moral heroism , the power of " Man 's unconquerable mind . " But I know well that these illustrations do not cover the whole case . There is another picture to be added to those of heroic struggle and martyrdom-that of silent suffering , which makes of life one long agony , and which often comes upon the good , so that it seems as if the best suffered the most . And yet when you sit by a sick bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which it rests , do you not sometimes mark how that very suffering refines the nature that bears it so meekly ? This is the Christian theory : that suffering patiently borne is a means of the greatest elevation of character , and in the end of the highest enjoyment . Looking at it in this light , we can understand how it should be that " the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared or even to be named with the glory which shall be re // vealed . " When the heavenly morning breaks , brighter than any dawn that " blushes o'er the world , " there will be " a restitution of all things " : the poor will be made rich , and the most suffering the most serenely happy ; as in the vision of the Apocalypse , when it is asked " What are these which are arrayed in white robes , and whence came they ? " the answer is , " These are they which came out of great tribulation . " In this conclusion , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt , after the experience and the reflection of years , I feel " a great peace . " It is the glow of sunset that gilds the approach of evening . For ( we must confess it ) it is towards that you and I are advancing . The sun has passed the meridian , and hastens to his going down . Whatever of good this life has for us ( and I am far from being one of those who look upon it as a vale of tears ) will soon be behind us . I see the shadows creeping on ; yet I welcome the twilight that will soon darken into night , for I know that it will be a night all glorious with stars . As I look upward , the feeling of awe is blended with a strange , overpowering sense of the Infinite Goodness , which surrounds me like an atmosphere : " And so beside the Silent Sea , I wait the muffled oar ; No harm from Him can come to me On ocean or on shore . " I know not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 only know I can not drift Beyond His love and * Would that you could share with me this confidence and this hope ! But you seem to be receding farther from any kind of faith . In one of your closing paragraphs , you give what is to you " the conclusion of the whole matter . " After repudiating religion with scorn , you ask " Is there not room for a better , for a higher philosophy ? " and thus indicate the true answer to be given , to which no words can do justice but your own : " After all , is it not possible that we may find that everything has been necessarilv produced ; that all religions and superstitions , all mistakes and all crimes , were simply necessities ? Is it not possible that out of this perception may come not only love and pity for others , but absolute justification for the individual ? May we not find that every soul has , like Mazeppa. been lashed to the wild horse of passion , or , like Prometheus , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of all philosophy , it is equally the end of " all things . " Not only does it make an end of us and of our hopes of futurity , but of all that makes the present life worth living-of all freedom , and hence of all virtue . There are no more any moral distinctions in t3he world-no good and no evil , no right and no wrong ; nothing but grim necessity . With such a creed , I wonder how you can ever stand at the bar , and argue for the conviction of a criminal . Why should he be convicted and punished for what ht* could not help ? Indeed he is not a criminal , since there is no such thing as crime . He is not to blame . Was he not " lashed to the wild horse of passion , " carried away by a power beyond his control ? What cruelty to thrust him behind iron bars ! Poor fellow ! he deserves our pity . Let us hasten to relieve him from a position which must be so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to punish him for an act in which he only obeyed an impulse which he could not resist . This will be " absolute justification for the individual . " But what will become of society , you do not tell us . Are you aware that in this last attainment of " a better , a higher philosophy , " ( which is simply absolute fatalism ) , you have swung round to the side of John Calvin , and gone far beyond him ? That you , who have exhausted all the resources of the English language in denouncing his creed as the most horrible of human beliefs-brainless , sotiless , heartless ; who have held it up to scorn and derision ; 110W hold to the blackest Calvinism that was ever taught by man ? You can not find words sufficient to express your horror of the doctrine of Divine decrees ; and yet here you have decrees with a vengeance-predestination and damnation , both in one . Under such a creed , man is a thousand times worse off than under ours : for he has absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can not suffer forever . You do not know even that ; but at any rate he suffers as long as he exists . There is no God above to show him pity , and grant him release ; but as long as the ages roll , he is " lashed to the rocks of fate ) " with the insatiate vulture tearing at his heart In reading your glittering phrases , I seem to be losing hold of everything , and to be sinking , sinking , till I touch the lowest depths of an abyss ; while from the , blackness above me a sound like a death-knell tolls the midnight of the soul . If I believed this I *hould cry , God help us all ! Or no-for there would be // no God , and even this last consolation would be denied us : for why should we offer a prayer which can neither be heard nor answered ?
