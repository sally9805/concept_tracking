txt deleted paragraph In his fast day proclamation , Gov . BUTLER , with his characteristic piety , - exhorted the ministers of the various churches and sects throughout the State to preach the Gospel on fast day rather than to deliver political speeches . It is evident that the Massachusetts ministers are either totally devoid of any sense of humor or that they regard the Gospel as something entirely unfit to be preached on fast day . They became extremely indignant at Gov . BUTLER , and many of them not only disre4 garded the Governor 's recommendation , but denounced him from the fast day pulpit in a way that was suggestive of anything but a humble state of mind on their part . Indeed , they seem to have devoted the religious exercises of fast day to as attempt to " get square " ? speaking after the manner of the worldly  --  with the Governor , and they succeeded in accomplishing the almost incredible feat of forcing a comparison between their own piety and that of the Governor which is rather to the credit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an opponent has two resources . He may either preach at him or pray at him . The latter method has been used with great success by Mr. TALMAGE , who utterly discomfits wicked journalists who criticise him by publicly praying at them . A Pittsfield minister adopted this course toward GOV . BUTLER . He informed the Lord at much length and with great plainness of speech that Gov . BUTLER is a wicked man , who " cares for none of those things which he enjoins upon others , " that he " is a protector of thieves , " and a man who " disregards his sacred oath of office , " and who " cares not for the great cause of temperance . " There was a certain element of false pretense in this prayer . Did the minister ' really think that the Lord was ignorant of Gov . BUTLER 'S character , and needed to be enlightened as to it ? If not , why did he give Him this entirely unnecessary information ? . Obviously , the prayer was designed not to enlighten the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mind of the minister . It may be a gross outrage to require a minister to preach the Gospel on fast day , but was it quite manly for the Pittsfield minister to make a prayer for tile express purpose of saying unpleasant things about the Governor ? The number of sermons that were preached against the wicked Governor is not known , but it is evident that a large number of the Massachusetts ministers " got square " with him in their sermons . The Rev. JAMES FREEMAN , CLARKE said that the Governor was a bramble chosen by the trees in a foolish moment to reign over them . It is not strictly libelous to call a man a bramble , but in this case it seems to have been a relief to MY . JAMES FREEMAN CLARKE 'S mind . When , however , he intimated that Gen. BUTLER seeks office to " use it only for private ends and selfish purposes ; " that he , is " a wicked ruler , " and that while he rules " the people will be sure to suffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insulting his congregation . Mr. JAMES FREEMAN CLARKE certainly ought to assume that the members of his congregation know something , and it is strange that they did not resent the implication that they needed to have selfevident facts as to Gov . BUTLER 'S character solemnly set before them . Does Mr. JAMES FREEMAN CLARKE inform his people from the pulpit that two and two make four , or repeat to them the axioms of geometry ? The Rev. C. A. BARTOL appears to have preached BUTLER and him pilloried on fast day , and to have preached nothing else . He represented the Governor , in a general way , as the embodiment of all evil . Mr. BARTOL is probably a philosopher , for there is a certain profound obscurity in his denunciations of the Governor which will perhaps amuse that eminently plain-spoken person . Mr. BARTOL said that Gov . BUTLER was a man who spoke " on purpose to send vibrations to the Rocky Mountains . " The human mind naturally shudders at the thought of such a crime , but would it not shudder more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vibrations to the Rocky Mountains were to be explained ? Mr. BARTOL also said that Gov . BUTLER " betrays in his expression or course our sires ' consecration of themselves , in a sincerity as supreme as the sun ever saw , to that ser vice of GOD which they identified with the idea of equal rights and chances for all mankind . " Good heavens ! If Gov . BUTLER has really done this , what punishment would be severe enough for him ? He has heretofore been accused of many offenses , but no one has ever before accused him of having betrayed the consecration of Mr. BARTOL 'S sires . For such a crime there can be no pardon either in this world or the next . Perhaps in the course of a year it may occur to the  --  Massachusetts ministers that the best way to oppose the dangerous demagogue now in the Governor 's chair is not to abuse him in prayers or sermons for the offense of reminding them that they are ministers of the Gospel . If fast day is anything but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fasting , humiliation , and prayer , " and the transformation of it into a day for the abuse of BUTLER will lead many people to believe that the Governor has a better sense of what is decent and becoming than have the-Massachusetts ministers .
