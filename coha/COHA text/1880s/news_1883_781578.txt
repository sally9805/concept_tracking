txt The big curtain has fallen on the mammoth stage in Cincinnati , and quiet is restored to the banks of the Ohio . It has been a great week for Shakespeare , the American drama , and the free , untrammeled West . " The eyes of the world , " said one of the local critics , deeply affected by the spectacle , " with wondering and admiring gaze . are again fixed on Cincinnati . " It is almost unnecessary to add , in the language of the kcal press , that " no event in the history of the drama in this country has made so great a stir in the world " as this on which several acres of green baize curtain have just now been let down . in reviewing this truly Monstrous Dramatic Festival we are impelled to ask what it has done for art and what for dramatic criticism . In Cincinnati , it appears , there is a third interest  --  that of trade  --  to be also considered . A Western newspaper recently attempted to forecast the drama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would . appear in 1983 . A notable feature in dramatic art , as thus whimsically imagined , was a mammoth theatre covering four blocks of ground , in which the twenty leading Hamlets of the world recited the famous soliloquy in unison . Cincinnati has anticipated 1983 . She has given us the monster stage , the real armies of supernumeraries , the gigantic pasteboard lions , and everything but the twenty Hamlets . A local critic laments that the part was not recited through a fog-horn in order that it might have been audible to the people who were ironically called " the audience " because they could not hear . The stage was ' big , so big that the actors seemed to be small . And the local critic complains that the " galaxy of stars " " produGed the effect of a nebula , " whatever that may mean . " It could be seen in the " Hunchback " that LA.witiondm BARRETT looked like an old man , and that MARY ANDERSON and KATE FORSYTHE looked like young women . It could be seen at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . And even this effect was lost when there was a sound like that of rain on the roof , " when the audience unanimously turned the libretto leaves to take a rapid glance at the book to learn what they were saying . " " The general effect was that of pantomime , and the librettos were essential as a key to it . " As Cincinnati is confessedly the Paris of America , we must follow the new fashion . The libretto was used in all of the plays . Even in " Julius Caesar , " we are told , the audience was " laboriously engaged in closely following the lines , and at the same time furtively glancing at the players . " This is a new departure in dramatic art of which old and effete communities mat make a note . The fine and subtle shades of meaning , the play of feature , and the delicate modulation of the voice must be dismissed . as unworthy of the highest dramatic art if we are to have tragedy at long range and comedy in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field-glasses , audiphones , and the fog-horn . Bigness is the thing . Bigness in paint , canvas , carpentry , electric-lighting , and seating capacity are the real tests of the highest excellence . This being true ' of what is called the actin* we are prepared for bigness in everything . A " floral offering " to Miss MARY ANDERSON , which was hoisted over the foot-lights-by a detach. ment of ushers , was six feet long , four feet wide , and weighed 150 pounds . It had a tin back , and bore on its floral front the legend , " The Pride of America . " It is obvious that dramatic criticism , as well as dramatic art , must be the gainer by this mammoth Shakespearean revival . For example , concerning the gifted actress just mentioned , the Local Critic declares that one of the notable features of the performance of the " Hunchback " was " the marvelous manner in which MARY ANDERSON twisted herself around in her trail . " Of MunDOCR 'S Hamlet it was said that " age sat lightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Of Mile , RHEA 'S acting it was said that her " Kill Claudio 1 " in " Much Ado " was " delivered with a vim that would teach something to some actresses " who speak better English than she . But Mr. MunDoca 's oration as Antony " would have put a ward meeting to sleep , " and the Romans of the time of C2ESAR were " - about as tough a lot of politicians as ever disgraced history . " These are gems of criticism taken at random . But these are minor matters . The Mammoth Dramatic Festival nail . There is money in the box after all demai , ds are liquidated . The local business specifically mentioned as benefited by the Shakespearean revival is as follows : " Railroads , hotels , newspapers , dry goods , milliners , dressmakers , jewelers , tailors , the gas companies , the street railroads , and all minor classes of business , as well as the United States Government , through the mails . " To be sure , the wholesale dealers complain that their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retail is improved . " But these sordid souls who would thrust their ledgers and cash accounts into the sacred domain of art should be contemptuously brushed aside . Dramatic art , dramatic criticism , and the retail trade have been plenteously boomed by the Monster Dramatic Festival . No wonder that proud Cincinnati cries for more .
