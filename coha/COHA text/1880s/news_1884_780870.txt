txt Gov . Crittenden 's peculiar policy has again triumphed , and the people of Missouri are balked in their desire to do justice to the last of the James boys . At Kansas City , this morning , State 's Attorney Wal- , lace entered a'nolle pros . in the care of Frank James and Charlie Ford , jointly indicted for participation in the robbery at Blue Cut in the Fall of 1881 . Wallace submitted his reasons to the court in writing . He says that the refusal of Gov . Crittenden to issue a full pardon to Dick Liddill leaves him without any positive testimony by which to convict James and Ford , which would have been easy had Liddill 's testimony been admitted and with it the corroborating evidence in possession of the State . Mr. Wallace further says that the case against James at Gallatin will also be dismissed to-day , and thus the State of Missouri will have no charge against Frank James , the greatest living outlaw . James , when released from custody , immediately went before Judge Krekel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , followed by a crowd of the curious . Frank said he spent most of his time reading the Bible . He did not seem to care whether he was sent to Alabama at once or not . He seems to stand in considerable fear of the Ford boys still . The scene when Wallace announced his dismissal was dramatic in the extreme . Wallace was pale as a ghost , and the dismissal seemed to be a blow to him personally . The public generally condemn the Governor for refusing to pardon Liddill and thus make him a competent witness against James . Judge Krekel refused to accept bail on the N ussel Shoals robbery case , and remanded James to the custody of the Marshal . James will be taken there this week . It is believed if he gets off there he will be taken to Minnesota .
