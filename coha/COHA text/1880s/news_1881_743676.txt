txt Gen. George H. Sharpe , of Ulster , is again the unanimous nominee of a Republican caucus , after a short , dull , and almost uneventful contest . It was remarkable only in that the opposition to the popular candidate was upheld by a few members of the Senate , and for the extraordinary effort made to-day , in the name of Gen. Garfield , to arouse an interest in a cause that has been without effective supporters trostalie very beginning . The friends of Mr. Skinner entered into the fight this morning with new vigor , although it did not appear to the observer that they were possessed of any more strength in numbers than they had held at any previous time during the contest . The struggle became more interesting during the morning , when Senator Forster , Senator Sessions , and others went about showing an editorial in the Tribune , pretending to be an official utterance from President-elect Garfield , which was evidently published just at this juncture to stiffen the purpose of their weak-kneed associates . The supporters of Gen. Sharpe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look upon this declaration . It was so unlike Gen. Garfield , seemed to lack prudence so entirely , they said , that they were inclined to reject it as an exaggeration , to say the least . Some denounced it as a misconstruction of his ' views , and others declared it must be inspired by Jay Gould , and intended to affect the Senatorial fight rather than that for Speaker , in which Gen. Garfield could scarcely be expected to interfere , even remotely . Soon after the New-York morning papers , arrived Mr. Whitelaw Reid , the editor of the Tribune , appeared at the Delavan House himself , and entered personally into the contest for Mr. Skinner . Ho established himself in the rooms of Gen. Misted , and then the Senators and outsiders who were working for Mr. Skinner went about in the halls and apartments of : le hotel inviting members of the Assembly to call upon Mr. Reid and have some conversation with him . Men from the counties or districts represented by Mr. Skinner 's Senatorial friends were most sought for . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come  --  and Mr. Reid , after some general remarks about the Tribune and Horace Greeley , expressed the hope to all readers of the paper that they would vote according to its precepts . He rang the changes on his double-leaded editorial , and in more explicit terms told his listeners that they need not bo afraid of making a fight ; that their opposition to the machine would not at all damage their 2hances of receiving patronage at the hands of the new Administration . One of the counties picked out for Mr. Reid to convert was Chautauqua . This is in Mr. Sessions 's district , and Mr. Skinner 's friends have regarded its members as belonging to him by right . Mr. Sheldon and Dr. Fenner were treated to a rehearsal of the editorial announcement , and then urged by Gen. Husted to vote for Mr. Skinner . Dr. Fenner heard the General through , and then said that while he was from a county where it was supposed the people were against the " machine , " there must have been some mistake about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said ; " and , General , we wish you would look this matter over . If you can find it in your heart to vote for Gen. Sharpe , we should like to have you with us  --  and you must not forget that we always take care of our friends . " Another : nernber who was called up loft Mr. Reid indignant , and immediately went into aen . Sharpe 's room and declared himself ** determined to vote for him . One member was very roughly accused by Senator Forster with having voted for Sharpe last year in order to get a place on a committee , and was told that the friends of Gen. Sharpe only wanted him now to use him and then throw him overboard . The member indignantly " You did n't know me last Winter , Senator , and I do n't think you know me now . I shall vote for Sharpe if I am omitted from the committee altogether . " The interview between Mr. Reid and such members as could be induced to listen to him was kept up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing in the men while Mr. Reid talked . Gen. Husted ran over a list of members who were said to he for Mr , Skinner , claiming that he would have 45 votes in the caucus . Some of the members who heard this presentation of the ease went about telling the story to their friends and laughing at its nonsensical extravagance , while others expressed their indignation at what they denounced as presumptuous interference in the name of a President not yet inaugurated . One man is said to have told Mr. Reid that be doubted his authority to speak as he did , and that he considered it more than questionable whether so prudent a man as Gen. Garfield would sanction such intermeddling in his name . Mr. Reid disappeared after a while and it was said that he dined privately with Gen. Husted in one of the Westchester member 's rooms . From 4 o'clock until 6 the air was full of reports that Mr. Skinner was about to withdraw , or that he had withdrawn . There was visible of his canvass at that time just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Mr. Brennan , Mr. Steele ; Mr. Crapser , and Congressman Warner Miller , and the Senators , led by Forster and Sessions , reinforced by J. J. Belden . Mr. Skinner declared at 6 o'clock that he was still in the race . His Senatorial supporters were rushing about , affecting to make an attempt to collect votes for Mr. Skinner . Their consultations came to - naught , and Mr. Skinner , who had been depending upon the help of men who had made many promises , saw that these men were unable to perform them . He determined to call the men about him whom he knew to be stanch . To them he left it to be deemed whether or not he should go into the caucus . They decided that he had better decline to oppose Clem Sharpe , and Mr. Chickering was sent to Gen. Sharpo ' s room at 7 o'clock to make the announcement . Mr. Crapser immediately went to offer his vote to Gen. Sharpo , and expressed himself as ashamed of himself for having gone into a canvass , the capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the meantime , had ended his mission extraordinary and taken the train for New-York . Long before 7 o'clock the Assembly Chamber was crowded with new and old members and the crowds of visitors who had come to see the organization of the House . Ex-Gov . Alvord , conspicuous by his long gray hair and beard , occupied the seat chosen by him last Winter . Mr. Skinner sat in his old seat at the front and right , with Mr. Chickering and Major Brennan by his side . The seats behind those occupied by members of the caucus , the aisles and spaces at the sides of the chamber , . as well as the galleries , were thronged . Precisely at 7:30 Gen. Husted , Chairman of the Caucus Committee , called the body to order , and presented the name of Henry J. Hurd , of Erie , for Chairman . Mr , Hurd was unanimously chosen , and was escorted to the chair by Mr. Duguid , of Onondaga , and Mr. Hamilton , of New-York . Mr. Hurd , in a brief and graceful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done him , congratulated the Republican Party on its continued success , and then awaited its further pleasure . On motion of Mr. Russell , of Kings , Mr. Brodsky , of New-York. and Mr. Waring , of Kings , were made Secretaries . Mr. Haste 1- then offered a resolution that the Chair appoint a Caucus Committee to call future caucuses of the assembly . Mr. Carpenter , of Suffolk , promptly followed with a substitute , calling for a Caucus Committee to act jointly with the Caucus Committee of the Senate . Mr. Husted accepted the substitute , which was adopted . The roll was called , and every Republican member except Gen. Sharpe answered to the call . The motion of Mr. Potter , of Saratoga , that the caucus proceed to nominate a candidate fur Speaker . was adopted , and Mr. Chicken= of Lewis , and Mr. Morgan , of Allegany , having been selected as tellers , nominations were in order . Col. B. F. Baker , in a carefully prepared speech , at once eloquent and earnest , prell'ented the name of Gen. Sharpe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commanding ability , heroic devotion to his country , of undisturbed courtesy to his opponents when Speaker , and at once frank , fair , and ready to right a wrong when it lay in his power to do it . Mr. Skinner was the observed of all observers when . he rose to second the nomination . His voice trembled with emotion when ho spoke of the good-will that had characterized the contest for ' the Speakership , and expressed his thanks to the friends who by good deeds and good words had shown their friendship for him . " It is the doctrine of the Republican Party , " ho said , " that it does not go behind the returns , and holds no . post-mortems in politics . For the good of the grand old party , which is better than any man in it , and for the harmony of the session , I say that if there is any other candidate for the Speakership against Gen. Sharpo , of Ulster , it is not myself . " Mr. Skinner was applauded when he finished , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few words in commendation of his colleague . Mr. Alvord , who thought there had been speeches enough , bluntly said : " I have known George H. Sharpe for a long time , and I know him to be a very clever man and a good speaker . I move that his nomination he made unanimous . " Mr : Phillips , of Orleans , called for a separate:announcement by each member , and the caucus so ordered . Each of the 80 members voted for Gen. Sharpe , and he was declared to be the choice of the caucus for Speaker of the Assembly of 1881 . The caucus then proceeded to choose candidates for the other positions to be filled by election . Mr. Russell , of Kings , nominated Mr. Edward M. Johnson , of Otsego , for Clerk , in a speech which found approval in every old member 's heart . He spoke warmly but not extravagantly of Mr. Johnson 's services to the Republican Party , and with truth of his efficiency as an officer of the Assembly . Ho was chosen unanimously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robinson , who held the position last year , was nominated by a majority of 43 over John H. Kemper , of ' Wayne .
