txt Uncle Sam has lost the faithful steward who for several years has held his strong box and been responsible for the safety of its contents . It has been this steward 's duty to take into his keeping from day to day all the revenues of the old gentleman 's great estate , and to furnish out of his box the money with which to pay current expenses . He has taken up some of his employer 's outstanding notes from year to year , so far as the condition of his funds would allow , and has paid interest upon the remainder . From time to time lie has made reports setting forth the work done , the amounts of money received and paid , and the amount remaining in the box . Now be has decided to engage in other business , and his employer has taken the keys and is counting the money stored away , to see if the steward 's statements have been correct ; not because he suspects that the steward has been dishonest or incompetent , but because a proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protection and satisfaction of the employer , the outgoing steward , and the man who is hereafter to hold the box . Sixty nimble-fingered persons began to count the money last Saturday night , and at file last report they had found , so far as they had gone , all the money which ought to be there . and four cents more . The Government 's strong box holds a great deal of money , and such a count as is now going on reveals its capacity and the value of its contents . Money has been rolling into it at the rate of about $1,300,000 in each working day , or almost $1,000 a minute , and nine-tenths of it have come from Customs duties and internal revenue taxes . The enormous sum of $403,000,000 came into the box last year , and $258,000,000 went out of it . The remainder of the amount received was spent in paying a part of the Government 's debt . But these figures do not show how great is the task of the counters . The Treasury also holds a great sum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of business or is packed away as a guarantee and foundation for the greenback notes now in circulation all over the land . It bolds , either in Washington or in the Sub-Treasuries established in large cities , nearly 4,000 tons of silver dollars and small silver coins . When the work of counting began the value of the gold and silver , coin and bullion , in the Treasury was $320,550,465 , and notes and other deposits raised the assets to $412,774,511 . There were also in the Treasurer 's custody United States bonds amounting to $374,000,000 as security for the circulating notes of national banks and for the public money deposited in national banks . Millions of dollars in national bank notes , sent in to be redeemed ; hundreds of packages of worn or mutilated notes ' ; from $200,000,000 to $300,000,000 worth , it is said , of brand-new crisp notes , just made , and ready for distribution among the national banks , and more millions in trust funds for Indians and others , were there , awaiting examination . Part of the coin and bonds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SubTreasuries at San Francisco , Chicago , and elsewhere , for convenience , and it is announced that these deposits Will not be counted . The official reports do not show how much is stored in Sub-Treasury vaults , so that the exact amount to be counted in Washington can not be stated . If all this precious metal and precious paper were in the Washington vaults the counters would be confronted by about $1,000,000,000 in money . There is plenty of work for weary fingers in counting a billion , or even half a billion , or dollars . If it were all in dollar bills , one good counter would require many years in which to complete the work . But while millions of the Treasury 's money are in silver dollars or even smaller coin , the gold is in pieces of greater value , and many of the bonds are for $1,000 each . The work may seem to advance slowly , while the counters are handling a ton of ten-cent coins or smoothing out and deciphering the dirty and ragged notes which have absorbed the slots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days or a few weeks the great heap of gold and silver and printed paper will melt away under the skillful hands of expert clerks . Uncle Sam will have taken his account of stock on hand , and the packages will be laid once more in the box . There is satisfaction in the thought that this count is a formal matter , and not an examination required to prove or disprove any allegation of fraud . The people have learned to trust the management of the Treasury , and the announcement that four cents more than were looked for have been found in it may please but will not surprise them .
