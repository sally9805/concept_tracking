txt At the hour of writing , the returns of the national election are not entirely conclusive . This State is very close , with the result doubtful . The city of New-York gives CLEVELAND 55,000 ; Kings County gives him only about 12,500 . The plurality in this city is less than had been looked for , but much nearer what it should be than that in Kings County . In New-York there has been a good deal of trading ; in Brooklyn there has been extensive buying of votes ; in the State outside of these two cities there has been enough knifing of CLEVELAND by the Hill men to complete the loss of the State . The margin is so narrow on so large a vote that it is plainthat New-York has not been , and could not be , carried by the Republicans on the merits of the issue between revenue reform and high protection . The incomplete returns from other States indicate that the Democrats have carried Connecticut , New-Jersey , and Indiana , and Illinois and Colorado are in doubt . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ votes to Mr. CLEVELAND he will be elected without New-York . This is the situation at the . present writing on a careful and impartial analysis of the returns . If it shall turn out that the returns , when complete , give the Presidency to Mr. HARRISON , he may be happy ; ho can hardly , be proud . Mr. CLEVELAND may , on the contrary , regard that result with no loss of self-respect . He has , with courage and honesty , presented - to his countrymen an issue of supreme importance . His party has loyally supported him . Had . the country given its judgment against him on an honest canvass , it would be no cause for humiliation . But the canvass of the Republicans has not been an honest one . It has been disgraceful . Appeals to prejudice of the most ignoble sort , intimidation of workingmen by their employers , misrepresentation descending to forgery , and above all the lavish and unscrupulous use of money in sums never before used in American politics ? these and not reason or argument are what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been resorted to in vain , and if . despite them , the country has placed its government for another Presidential term under the guidance of Mr. CLEVELAND , then he will have only the approval he , has honestly deserved .
