TO MY PARENTS HULINGS AND MARGARET WITT MILLER PREFACE Years ago when the " Songs of the Sierras " had made some stir in London , an alert actor there , liking the new and musical name " Sierras , " helped me put two of my magazine sketches together , " The First Woman in the Forks " and " The Last Man of Mexican Camp , " as a play , called the first " Fam'lies of the Sierras . " Then I put it into book form and published it in London and Chicago under this name . Soon after a retired actor , Fitzgerald of Philadelphia , put it again into a play for Kittie Blanchard , a deserving actress who produced it in New York . She paid me the better part of ten thousand dollars royalties , and as she was very capable and popular , she was allowed all sorts of liberties in the story . For example , having a child she wished to put on the stage , the little tot is shot to death in the first act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , intended as comedy , is made almost a villain , simply to please the gallery . But all this sort of thing , as in the other plays here published , must be brushed aside , and the better strains must be told on the stage hereafter , if told at all , as here set down . The Chinese are not thieves ; nor are the Mormons murderers . True , some of their fanatics led the Mountain Meadow massacre , but they were no worse , and certainly not better , than the Missouri mob that butchered Joseph Smith and his brother , Hiram , founders of the Mormon Church . But it is not likely they will see the footlights soon again . For we are fast forgetting open and honest nature . The wild woods , the mountains , the robust , sincere and half wild men of the open air we have put aside for clothes and " curled darlings " ; while the play of today must not only smell of the lamp but smell of something even more " shady , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The play " Forty Nine " was also a book and play together . It has much the same setting as the Danites , but is a better play with a higher purpose . An illustrated story of the patient Argonaut , a modern Ulysses struggling to again see his wife , babe and dog . An " Oregon Idyl " was likewise a story and book together . I like it the best of all my plays ; maybe because I love the woods and loved nearly all the characters herein . " Tally-Ho " was founded on Horace Greeley 's spirited sketch of his crossing the Sierras with Hank Monk , the dashing stage driver . This play started off with great promise . Joe Jefferson was its godfather ; John Sousa wrote the music , and the present leading member of Congress from San Francisco played a part . Hank Monk was a most lovable man , but he went all to pieces , as you see him in the play . In fact , the bottle , the bowie knife and the rope are most monstrously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But this is literally the truth of those stormy old days ; " the brief and abstract chronicle of the time . " However all these hard and tempestuous days are well behind us and we may hope soon to see a drunken man as seldom on the stage as on the street . The fact is there has long been too many men on the stage ; too many men , both drunk and sober . The stage is really and truly no place for a manly man . As for the " matinee idol , " he ought to be put with the extinct animals . As the Greeks never allowed a woman on the stage , so we of today should never allow a man on the stage save perhaps as the " heavy villain . " With more women and fewer men on the stage we surely would have far less drunkenness there , either real or affected , and the demand for " cloves " would not be nearly so great in front as now . You and I may not live to see it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write it down in red , that the next generation will see the stage almost exclusively in the hands of women . And women , who are so much finer and far seeing than men , will begin to write our plays ; as they should have done long since . The hope and possible salvation of the Stage is Woman .

The old clothes was there , but the gold  --  well , that had evaporated . Judge . The Judge Yes , you had been there , Tim . I do n't want any more old clothes , and come to think , I do n't want any gold that comes to a fellow 's hand like that . Why , boys , that little old cabin is haunted , and that boy a livin ' in it . Tim . LIMBER TIM And all alone , boys . Judge . The Judge Well , if that boy do n't see ghosts in that cabin , livin ' all alone by hisself like that  --  there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's he been there , Tim ? Tim . LIMBER TIM I do n't know .

SANDY .  --  That shot  --  that hunted down the last of the Williams and shot , shot her  --  that pretty , that sweetly pretty girl that , that we found , Judge , and tried to save and bring back to camp to the boys ? Judge . The Judge The same hungry , Bible-howlin ' varmits , I do believe . Sandy . SANDY .  --  Judge , I 'll be revenged for that poor girl 's death if it takes me ten years . Why , there she came to us just at the gray of dawn , just as we seed the gold of the mornin ' star croppin ' out of the heavens ; came to us , weary , torn , half-dead with hunger and fright , flyin ' into camp like a wounded dove , there on the bank of the deep , foamin ' Truckee river . " Why , poor little bird , " I said , and I put my arms about her and took her up when she fell at our feet , boys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the bank , Judge , you know , and watched over her , we two did , Judge , as if she 'd been our own kid . And then , Judge , when she waked up , you remember , and we fed her , and she talked and told us all . And how we promised and swore to save her , Judge . And then , just as we got all packed up and ready to come back , the Danites came burstin ' in upon us , leadin ' the Ingins , and all of ' em a shootin ' at that poor , helpless baby , that never did anybody any harm . Judge . The Judge ( Crying and wiping eyes . ) That alkali dust out there hurts my eyes yet . ( Rushes to bar and drinks . ) That strengthens the eyes . Sandy . SANDY .  --  And then , boys , after the battle was over and I turned to look for her  --  Gone ! Gone ! Only the deep , dark river rollin ' between its willow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ugly river gurglin ' , sweepin ' and rollin ' by , and the willows leanin ' over it and drippin ' and drippin ' and bendin ' to the ugly waters . Leanin ' and weepin ' as if in tears for her . Only the dark river rollin ' there under the bendin ' willows and  --  and  --  and my heart as cold and empty as a dead man 's hand . Tim . LIMBER TIM Why , Sandy , my poor old pard , we 'll all stand by you and help you git even on ' em . Parson . THE PARSON .  --  Stand by you agin the Danites , Sandy , till the cows come home ; and thar 's my hand . Sandy . SANDY .  --  ( Wiping his eyes and going . ) If them 's them , Judge , I 'll find ' em and raise ' em out of their boots . No , you need n't come , boys . If I can find ' em , that 's all I ask . Let me have ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. ) Judge . The Judge Poor Sand . He loved her , boys . And she was pretty . So sweetly pretty . And to go and get shot and drowned like that , when we was fightin ' for her . Tim . LIMBER TIM Why he talks about her yet in his sleep , Parson . But he would n't know her if he seed her . Judge . The Judge Only seed her by the camp-fire , boys . But he hai n't been the same man since . Parson . THE PARSON .  --  Always was a little soft here . ( Taps heart . ) But he 's good , Tim . I ai n't sayin ' nothin ' agin ' your pard . Only he 's tender hearted . ( Enter Washee Washee , L. C. ) Washee . WASHIE WASHIE.  --  ( Down stage . ) I say , Plosson , plack tlain comee . Judge .

( Kicks at him and Washee exits , L. C. ) Lie ! Why , that Chinaman can lie the bark off a tree . ( All laugh . ) Judge . The Judge Guess he can steal some , too , Parson . Parson . THE PARSON .  --  Steal ? He even steals from himself , just to keep his hand in . ( Enter Sandy , L. C. ) Sandy . SANDY .  --  Could n't find ' em . And that 's what makes me think it was Danites . Judge , they come and go as if they came up out of , or sink into the ground , like that . Tim . LIMBER TIM Maybe they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Judge . The Judge Oh , do you know , Parson , Stubbs here , says he 's a wearin ' of them dead men 's old clothes ? Parson . THE PARSON .  --  Hold on , I 've got an idea ! That boy Billy Piper 's a Danite ! Sandy . SANDY .  --  Now look here , Parson , you do n't like that boy , I know . Parson . THE PARSON .  --  No . I do n't like nobody that lives all alone by hisself and in a place like that . Why , the blood ai n't hardly dry yet , where them three men died , and he a livin ' there . Sandy . SANDY .  --  Well , now , maybe he ai n't got no other place to stay . And he ai n't strong , you know . Why , the first time I ever seed him , I met him in the trail , and he got out of it as I come by , and held down his head , all for the world like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I said , " boy , what 's your name ? " he stammered , and as if he wanted to get away , Judge , and at last , with his head still held down , he told me his name  --  Billy Piper  --  then smiled so sadly , like her , Judge , and went on . Judge . The Judge Well , Sandy , ai n't nothin ' wonderful ' bout it , is there ? Sandy . SANDY .  --  No , Judge , not that . It 's only Billy Piper , that 's all . That 's his name , boys . And do n't you go for to nick-name him . But , Judge , that smile was like her  --  like her smile , her 's . Tim . LIMBER TIM Oh , now , Sandy , do n't ; that 's a good fellow . Forget all about that . Judge . The Judge Yes . Talk about  --  ' bout suthin ' new , talk about the weather  --  this glorious climate of California , and  --  and  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Why , of course , boys . That 's all right . But you , Parson , do n't be too hard on little Billy Piper . I know it does make one feel kind o ' skeery to think where he lives , and how he lives . But he 's squar ' , squar ' , Parson . Tim . LIMBER TIM And a poet . Yes . Says pretty things as he stands lookin ' up at the moon , a wheelin ' through the pine tops ; prettier things than you can find in a book . Sandy . SANDY .  --  And says things as sets you a thinkin ' , too . Why , he says to hisself today , kind o ' quiet like , when some of the boys was tauntin ' Bunker about the hump on her back , says he , takin ' Bunkerhill 's hand , says he , " God has made some women a little bit plain , in order that He might have some women that is perfectly good . " Tim . LIMBER TIM Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Judge A little shaky here . ( Taps head . ) Maybe he 's had trouble . Sandy . SANDY .  --  Jest so , Judge , jest so . O , but I say , boys .

THE PARSON .  --  Do they take us for Cannibals out here , in this ' ere camp ? Judge . The Judge He 'll want to be Judge and everything else . Parson . THE PARSON .  --  It is an insult . A roarin ' , howlin ' insult , for that ' ere storekeeper to let ' em come in here on his mules . And if he sets foot in here , boys , and he will set foot in here , he 'll come in here to take up a collection right off  --  O yes , I know ' em . I seed ' em in Missouri and on the Mississippi , and seed ' em when I went down the river and took ship . Oh I know the white choker gentry . They will have the best in the land and pay nothing . They never miss a meal and never pay a cent . A Boston missionary , bah ! Judge . The Judge ( Shakes pickhandle . ) Well , then , gentlemen , it 's my official opinion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd best find him guilty on the spot , and execute him when he arrives . Parson . THE PARSON .  --  Tried , and found guilty . All . All Yes ; let 's all go for him . Tim . LIMBER TIM O , but he wo n't come in here . Parson . THE PARSON .  --  Wo n't he , though ?

SANDY .  --  Well , guess we 'd better all go for him , eh , boys ? Parson . THE PARSON .  --  O , no . Do n't let 's go for him . Let 's pass around the hat for brother Tompkinsonsonson ; let 's take up a collection ; do suthin ' religious . Tim . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all be baptized . ( All laugh . ) Parson .

SANDY .  --  Well , we 'll make him think he 's a dipper . Parson . THE PARSON .  --  Wo n't he look funny though , with his broad-brimmed Quaker hat all wilted down like a cabbage leaf ? Tim .
