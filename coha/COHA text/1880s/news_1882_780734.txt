txt Nearly 50,000 bids for star service in the Territories were filed in the Post Office Department on Jan. 7 , and the contracts will be awarded in March on about 3,000 routes . These routes are in that section of country where the ring scored its largest profits . Experience has shown wherein the Government is weak and the contractors are strong in this mail service . Some changes should be made before the Government in trusts these Territorial routes to contractors for another term of four years . The form of contracts should be improved . The law provides that a bid must be accompanied by a bond in which the sureties are held as guarantors that the bidder will , if the contract is awarded him , enter , into an obligation with good and sufficient sureties to perform the service proposed . It was required that the bids should be accompanied by bonds in order that straw-bidding might be prevented . These bondsmen are held in a penal sum . It is generally supposed that there is a good and sufficient bond in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are sureties on the contract , but they are held in no penal sum . Whenever the Government has been compelled to proceed against a contractor 's sureties for dainag-es , it has passed by the so-called bondsmen on the contracts , and has taken action against the bondsmen on the bill , which is retained on file . It is generally acknowledged and has been asserted by counsel for the Government that contraet bonds are of no account , and that the Government 's only protection lies in the bid bonds It was for using worthless bid bonds that Boone , Caball , and Jackson were recently ar-rested . In his letter to Mr. James on Dec. 30 , 1S81 , Col. George Bliss said : " The legal remedies for default are much better under the bonds or proposals than on contracts , and it is the former which are ordinarily sued . " The ring contractors used worthless bondsmen on their bids and responsible men on their contracts , knowing that only the bid bonds could be of any service to the department . The Dorsey party used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. Wheeler , of New-York , and S. N. Hoyt , of Colorado . The responsibility of these persons was shown in the Tidball and Shallcross report , but as sureties on their contracts they used the late John 0 . Evans , a millionaire , and W. B. Mosese , a merchant of Washington . This is an example of the ways of the ring contractors , who well knew that the form of contract rendered it out of the question for the Government to proceed against the contract bondsmen . ' The saving clause which gives the Government an opportunity to proceed against the bid bondsmen is that which requires the bidder to promise to perform the service . These bonds were originally intended only to prevent straw-bidding and not to hold a men to his contract . It seems plain that the plan of contract ought to be changed before the Territorial service is turned over to contractors for another term . The change , it is said , can be very easily made within the next five weeks . It is not enough that good names should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some good purpose .
