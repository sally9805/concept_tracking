AND WHEN Pyrrhus had won a battle over the iRomans , near Heracica , and was congratulated upon it , the historians tell us , that he replied : " One more such victory and I am undone ! " And he followed it up by sending an ambassador to Rome , and proposing peace . It has occurred to many , that history repeated itself in this respect at Springfield , Mass. , at the annual meeting of the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions , held October 4th to 8th nIt. , when the " conservatives " outvoted the " liberals . " The numerical victory , in our opinion , did not represent the moral victory . And so it struck the more sober minded of the conservatives themselves . Thus Rev. Dr. Edward N. Packard , Assistant Secretary of the meeting , in a subsequent communication to the N. Y. Independent , remarks , that " one could not properly use the word victory in regard to the results reached at the Springfield meeting , even if he were the most stalwart conservative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force to the new movement , and // make work harder in our churches ; " that the speech of Dr. Walker " was an immense concession for a master in Israel to make , and will have great influence in strengthening the New Departure ; " and that " aside from all votes taken , on the liberal side there was a manifest advance since last year , whatever be the local issue in the Board . " And he candidly adds : " If I were a New Departure man , I should take courage from the Springfield meeting . " The facts which justify such a view are easy to state . After the decision at Des Moines had been under discussion an entire year , in the periodicals , the newspapers , the ministers ' meetings , and the Associations , the minority vote of the staid , sober-minded , experienced men , who compose the corporate membership of the Board , given at a place equally favorable to both parties , instead of being decreased , rose from 13 at Des Moines to 56 at Springfield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatest disadvantages . In every Society the administration , that is , the managing Committee and Secretaries , usually and deservedly carry an immense preponderance of influence ; so that seldom is it possible to overrule their action , or even to array a strong minority vote against them . Never before in the history of the American Board have the Prudential Committee and the Secretaries found such a formidable opposition among the corporate members , after a year of deliberate discussion . And this too , when they received the unbroken support of the Congregational religious papers , re-inforced by the Independent , which circulates throughout our denomination ; so that it was difficult for the minority to gain more than an occasional hearing . Add to this the heavy loss sustained by the minority in the death of Dr. Mark Hopkins , President of the Board for the last thirty years , and of Alphens Hardy , Esq. , for twenty-nine years Chairman of the Prudential Committee ; both of whom , if spared to be present , would have powerfully antagonized the conservative policy , and would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We know , from an hour 's private conversation with Dr. Hopkins , a few weeks only before his lamented death , how strongly he felt upon this subject , and how anxiously he desired that wiser counsels might prevail , when the Board should // assemble at Springfield . It will be remembered , that his last public act was to publish a remonstrance against the position of the Prudential Committee . But , besides this significant increase of the minority vote , there came out the noticeable weight of character of the men who cast it  --  a fact which opened the eyes of not a few in that vast assembly , and made a deep impression upon the majority itself . The ambassador of Pyrrhus reported , on his return , that every Roman citizen seemed a king ! And here it was found , that the opposition to the policy of intolerance came not from hot-headed youngsters , and not from men of small intelligence and obscure position , but from some of the ablest , most renowned and most venerable members of the Board . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes its stand in the meetings of the Board , and embraces such ministers and laymen as Porter , Harris , Fisher , Carter , Smyth , Walker , Parker , Bu ckham , Seelyc . Buckingham , Gordon , Merriinan , McKenzie , Vose , Jenkins , Whittlesey , Shipman , Eddy , Angell , Fairchild , Fairbanks , Emerson , Hazard , and others who might be named , it is more than a tempest in a tea-pot that is threatened . These men know what the issue is , act from deliberate thought , and have the courage and the persistence of their convictions . And the influence of this fact is augmented , when it appears that in them , in the Senior Secretary , Dr. Clark , and in numerous Honorary Members of the Board who agree with them , is represented the position of three of the four theological seminaries of New England , of all of our colleges ( male and female ) except Dartmouth ( possibly Middlebury may also be an exception ) , and of the leading pastors of such cities as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , again , that the strength of antagonism was sufficient to lead fifty-six corporate members to so extreme a measure as to withhold their votes for President from so eminent a man as Rev. Richard S. Storrs , D.D. , because of his identification with the conservative policy , and forty-four to do the same with reference to the re-election of Dr. Alden , as the Home Secretary , and the case will seem to be serious indeed . It is no matter of wonder , that Dr. Storrs , remembering that the President has always heretofore been unanimously chosen , wanted " a few weeks** to consider whether // to accept the result of such an election ; and that he intimated , Pyrrhus-like , the desirableness of peace ; that it would be well to seek for some basis upon which to restore cooperation and harmony , a result of which , he said , that he did not wholly despair . His letter of acceptance , since published , makes a suggestion to that effect If now we add the influence of the debate , especially as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reputation for ability and orthodoxy can not be assailed , and who squarely advocated the sending forth of missionaries who favored the " Andover hypothesis , " as well as of those who rejected it , the moral effect of the meeting will be seen to have varied considerably from the numerical result of the corporate votes . The meeting was highly educatory of popular sentiment . The impression left upon the public mind was far more favorable to the minority-position , than was the case a year since . A stage of progress was made , and the future , inevitable , liberal result was brought a twelve-month nearer . The difficulty is not a new one . Conservative men have previously made the vain attempt to " prevent a future " in our Congregational policy . Their temporary successes always deceived and disappointed them , when they fought against a policy of liberal comprehension . Fifty years ago , they sought to rule out the hypotheses of IDrs . Taylor and Fitch , which they called the " New Haven heresies ; " and they needlessly created division and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , and some years later they were negotiating for union , to see if the scandal of two seminaries in the little State of Connecticut could not be removed ! They ruled out the Oberlin brethren , as long as possible , from missionary service and from the denominational fellowship , and tried in vain , at the ordination of the present writer , to extort a pledge , that he would not admit Mr. Finney ( who was preaching in the neighborhood ) to his pulpit ; this on the accusation of Perfectionism . But one day they attended a national convention of the Congregational churches held at Oberlin , which by a unanimous rising vote , invited the once obnoxious and still unrepentant Mr Finney to address the body on the subject of the baptism of the Holy Spirit . And they heard the // Moderator , Dr. Budington , pronounce it " the grave of buried prejudices . " They made similar ecclesiastical and religious newspaper war upon Dr. Bushnell , and succeeded in getting such abundant utterances in his condemnation that they thought they had carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Councils everywhere accept , as a matter of liberty , the men who favor the Bushnell theology , and to find Dr. Bushnell regarded as one of the illustrious names in our theological history . They similarly assailed Professor Park , who in those days was an advocate of an improved theology ; charging him with false doctrine and with varying from the Andover creed . But these accusations have long since ceased to be heard , and Professor Park has come to be regarded as the expounder of orthodoxy . They denounced , as a departure from the time-honored Congregational doctrinal basis , the effort to make our denominational fellowship simply evangelical , and in our ministry as well as our lay-membership to ignore the distinction between Calvinism and Arminianism . They even denied , at first , that the constitution of our Triennial Convention took that position . But the discussions of a few months sufficed to decide the case against them , and no one has even mooted the question for the last fifteen years ! They are now repeating a similar process , and congratulating themselves on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they come out , and how quietly , one of these days , they will accept the situation ! It is a great pity , that many thoroughly good men have so little of the quality of the " seer . " They do not read aright " the signs of the times , " as manifest in the trend of grand truths drawn from the word of God , in the movings of the Divine Spirit through the universal church , and in the instructive events of Providence . They do not perceive that " the stars in their courses fight against " them , but resist progress , till the INEVITABLE has come ! If anything further were needed to show the superficial character of the conservative victory at Springfield , it may be found in the continuous efforts made ever since in the Independent and other conservative quarters , to explain and defend the action taken . They have set some of their ablest workmen to threshing vigorously the old straw . They have labored hard to reassure themselves of the result , by mutual congratulation and // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of it has seemed like talking to keep up courage , and to conceal the real seriousness of the situation , and Dr. Pentecost himself announced in the Independent , " that the churches and the Christian public generally have not reached the end of this discussion , " and that " we all foresee and anticipate an extensive future debate on this question . " Let us now consider the questions on which there was a division of opinion in the American Board . There were two such questions ; one of method , and one of principle ; and these need to be carefully distinguished . The question of method came up first , and was connected with a special report of the Prudential Cominittee , in response to a resolution adopted the year previous at Des Moines , directing the comuiittee " to consider , in difficult cases , turning upon doctrinal views of candidates for missionary service , the expediency of calling a Council of the churches . " It will hardly be believed , but so it is , that to the discussion of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the three hundred and sixty-eight lines of their report ! After admitting that , in the resolution referred to them , " only one class of candidates is named ; difficult cases turning upon doctrinal views , " and spending eight lines upon it , in order to make the insignificant objection of " invidious publicity " ( which surely has einiuently characterized the natural result of their own course , in its world-wide notoriety ) they ingeniously shift the discussion to the question , whether it would be expedient to have a council called to pass upon the doctrinal soundness of all missionary candidates , and to make the actual appointment to service under the Board . It was easy to show that this would be cumbersome and unnecessary , as well as inapplicable to occasional Presbyterian candidates , and inconsistent with the responsibility of the committee and the Board . Hence there was little opposition to that judgment , which was affirmed by a vote of 110 to 19 ; two-thirds of the liberals voting with the conservatives , as the writer himself did . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejoiced over by many , as if it were . But while the practical conclusion as to the inexpediency of the council method , as a // substitute for the responsible action of the Prudential Committee , in the appointment of missionaries , met with slight dissent , decided and just objection was taken to the numerous depreciatory ntterances respecting councils themselves scattered through the report . These were precisely such as Presbyterians , especially at the West , have been accustomed for years to offer against councils , as the characteristic feature of Congregationalism ; charging that they are small , local , temporary , brief , irresponsible , not representative of the whole body of the churches , and often , or at least occasionally , reaching undesirable conclusions . Against the tenor of such accusations , the writer and others felt bound to protest strongly , on the spot , as unbecoming on the part of the Prudential Committee of a Board originated and now sustained by the Congregational churches ( no Presbyterian churches , as such , at present contributing to it , and but few individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fact that , under this seemingly weak ecelesiasticism , we have attained to such noble results in ministers , churches , and benevolent action . Not a few , after listening to the report , quoted the proverb : " It is an evil bird that fouls its own nest I " But the most singular thing in this connection remains yet to be mentioned . Amid the multiplied , ingenious and plausible reasons given for not employing councils to judge of the doctrinal qualifications of missionary candidates , the Prudential Coiuuiittee did not even mention , what there is ground for believing to be their principal objection ! Shall we say that they did not dare to mention it , though it could be read everywhere between the lines ? It was this : they could not trust councils to decide as they wished to have them decide ! They had reason to believe , that a truly representative council would not have hesitated in the case of the return of Rev. Mr. ilume , and would not have refused to pass favorably upon the young men whoiu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual faith and wishes of our Congregational churches ; and are charging the minority with proposing action contrary thereto ! This does not strike many of us as being consistent ; to bring forward ancient creeds and to ignore modern ones , disregarding also the consensus of opinion found in // the continual action of Congregational associations and councils , all over the country , as they license and ordain candidates who hold the very views treated with intolerance by the Board ! The other question before the Board was one of principle , in two respects which run into each other , doctrinal and ecclesias* tical ; and these again must be carefully distinguished , in order to do justice to all concerned . The doctrinal issue may best be introduced by a historical anecdote . Early in the eighth century , when Northern Europe was missionary * , round , Wulfram went to convert the heathen of Friesland , and had a famous interview with IRadbod , king of the country , whom he sought to convince , and through whom he hoped to reach the entire nation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christianity as the only true religion , and of Christ as the only Saviour , and then said to Wulfrain : " If all this be so , if my gods are no gods , and my religion is a lie , and man can only be saved through Jesus Christ , then what has become of my forefathers , who died knowing nothing of this new religion ? " Wulfram , being an orthodox theologian of that day , promptly answered , that they had all gone to hell , as such sinners deserved to do . " Very well , " said the grim old king , " I will not separate from my forefathers ; I will share their fhte , whatever it may be . " Opinions will differ as to the wisdom and as to the truthfulness of Wulfram 's assertion ; but it cost Christianity , for many years , the conversion of that nation . Every missionary is liable to meet this same most natural and most reasonable inquiry ; and he must be prepared with a satisfactory answer , or he will repel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to win . It will thus be seen , that the question as to the salvability of the heathen , who have lived and died without any knowledge of the gospel , is not a mere matter of speculative theology , to be discussed with other abstractions in theological lecture rooms , but is of a very practical nature to the missionary and to those whom he addresses . His opposers and his converts will press it upon him almost daily . What now shall he say ? What shall those who send him out instruct , or permit him to say ? We do not propose to discuss , at this time , what he ought to say , but only the liberty of choice in his answer , which the Board grants or refuses . // Five different hypotheses of probation for the heathen have been brought forward by the various theologians ; four of which the American Board allows to be propounded by its missionaries , but interdicts the fifth . The cnrious fact in the case is , that no one of these five is directly affirmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probation , " or any synonymous word , in Greek or English . They are suppositions , which are thought , by those who favor them respectively , not indeed to be dogmatically asserted , but to be warranted by the implications of Bible language , where that is not only quoted , but is explained , and is set in its relations by a careful exegetical aro'ument . Our friend , Mr. Henry L. Bowen , who is the enterprising and snccessful publisher of the Independent , a most skillful organizer of a Fourth of July celebration , and , as we know from happy experience , a most royal entertainer of guests , thought that any theory on this subject ought to be capable of demonstration by a naked qnotation of Scriptural texts ; and he insisted on this idea in a famous correspondence printed in his paper . It was enough to make every living theological professor leap from his chair , and the dead ones turn in their graves . For , such a claim would set aside half the theology of Christendom ; which depends not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Imagine a Baptist calling on Mr. Bowen simply to name the texts in the New Testament , without argument , which clearly and specifically teach infant baptism ! What would Mr. Bowen do ? Or suppose him required to prove by naked texts the salvation of all who die in infancy , and to show consequently , either that they , half the human race , never have a probation , or that they have it successfully in the next life ! And because he could not produce a single text , which directly and unequivocally teaches either of these doctrines , think how his antagonists , using his own principles , would twit him with this inability , and with his proposal , in place of texts , to offer " a Biblical argument ! " Theologians well know , that there never was a greater farce than in the publication of that correspondence . The five hypotheses referred to we give as follows , for description simply , and not for argument in behalf of any one of them . 1 . The probation of the heathen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the person of Adam , their constituted representative . They utterly failed in it , and are carrying out that failure in their earthly lives . The salvation of Christ was only provided for the elect ; and if any of the heathen do not learn of Christ 's death , it shows that they are among the reprobate , for whom He did not die . Not a few missionaries have gone to the heathen with this theory in their minds and on their lips . They were reputed to be orthodox , and no man protested against their being sent ; while those who sent them held to this theory of Augustine and Calvin , and thought it was the gospel ! 2 . The probation of the heathen is a legal probation of work8 , in this life . Either Christ did not die at all for those who remain unevangelized at death , or if He did , they can not have the benefit of His death , from not having had Him offered to them ; and so they are left to be judged by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them , and as sinners are condemned by it to eternal death . This leaves absolutely no hope for them , and was the theory largely adopted by those who in former days founded the American Board and other missionary societies , and was relied on as furnishing the chief and necessary motive for missionary effort . No one can be saved , said they , without the preached gospel ; therefore send it to the perishing millions of heathen . This is the appeal found in the reports , the sermons , the addresses and the publications , and was supposed to be justified by the language of Paul in the first three chapters of IRomans ; and this view is distinctly affirmed in the Westminster Confession and Saybrook Platform . 3 . The probation of the heathen is an evangelical probation , in this life . Though they are sinners , they may , in consequence of the atonement , be forgiven , for Christ 's sake , even if they die without having heard of Him ; provided , they penitently avail themselves of such light as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is to be presumed that they would accept Christ if He were offered ; and this is taken as an implied faith in Him . This view ( advocated by this writer thirty years ago in the Bibliotheca Sacra , and then regarded by most of his brethren as so liberal as to be almost heretical ) // was set forth in the sermon preached before the Board by Rev. Dr. Withrow last year at Des Moines . On this ground it has become common to admit of late , that a few nnevangelized heathen might be saved ; but the preacher there claimed-not thinking how it might " cut the missionary nerve " - that great multitudes would thus be saved . On this theory , once considered new and dangerous , the conservative majority of the Board probably stand ( as do most of the liberal minority ) , although it is a wide departure from the old Presbyterian and Congregational standards , and from the faith on which the Board was established and its funds were given . Mark that fact ! But such plain departure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not occasioned the rejection of any candidate ! 4. like probation after breath theory , as it has humorously been termed ; or the idea attribnted to Mr. Joseph Cooke , the ever vigilant guardian of orthodoxy , that perhaps , at the very instant of death , just as the soul is leaving the body , when it is unconscious of terrestrial affairs , Christ may be made known to the unevangelized heathen , giving them the opporturtity of accepting Him . This reminds one of the epitaph on the ungodly man who died instantly , by a fall from his horse * which runs thus : " Between the saddle and the ground , He mercy sought and mercy found . " It comes perilously close to the idea of probation in the next life , being parted from it but a few seconds , if at all ! It has not yet been decided to be unsafe to send out missionaries who teach , without any texts to sustain it , this extreme view , or this theory of salvation in extremis ; contrary as it is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mass of its supporters . 5 . Lastly comes the hypothesis that the probation of the unevangelized heathen may continue after death long enough for Christ to be offered to them , and accepted or rejected* This is popularly called " the Andover hypothesis , " although held by large numbers of evangelical Christians in Great Britain // and on the Continent , who are actively engaged in missionary operations . * Kow none of these five theories is free from objection , on the ground of reason or of Scripture . Pastors at home and missionaries abroad must choose , as best they can , between them . The minority at Springfield did not advocate the fifth or Andover theory , and in fact but few of them believe it ; though Dr. Pentecost grossly insulted them , and without any subsequent apology , by stating that , notwithstanding their disclaimers , he thought that they did believe it " thoroughly and utterly . " This was the worst utterance of the whole excited meeting , in which Christian courtesy and charity wonderfully prevailed ; and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the words : " Why , he must mean that we all are liars " ! The minority did not propose that the Board should in any way endorse the Andover view . They made no theological argument in its behalf , though the majority made a long one against it . When a missionary is sent out , not because of some peculiar view , but * A standard work of an eminent scholar is Kurtz 's Sacred History , to which Dr. J. Addison Alexander used constantly to refer his students as authority . In 1854 it was translated into English , and published by Smith , English &amp; Co. , Philadelphia . In Section 195 , Observation , will be found these words : " when the circumstance is considered , that the gospel must be preached to all men , before the end can come , a question arises concerning the condition in this respect of the many millions of pagans who have died without obtaining any knowledge of Christ . Before a Scriptural answer to this question can be given , it is necessary that two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that God will have all men to be saved ( 1 Tim . ii . 14 , 2 Peter , iii . 19 ) ; and secondly ' that out of Christ there is no salvation , either in heaven or on earth ( Acts iv . 2 ) , for he is the propitiation for our sins ; and not for ours only , but also for the sins of the whole world ' ( 1 John , ii . 3 ) . Now , if it is equally clear and certain , that man can appropriate this salvation to himself by faith alone , and that faith comes by the preaching of the word ( nom. x , 13 , etc. ) , it seems to follow necessarily that the gospel will yet be preached in Hades ( 156 , Ohs. 1 ) to those who , without any fault of their own , obtained no knowledge of Christ in this life , in order that they too may adopt or reject that gospel . But the truth can not be overlooked , that the mind of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may draw , and that he can emily cause these pagans to ripen according to their own decision , either for the judgment of life or the judgment of condemnation . Still , if we are informed ( 1 Pet . iii . 19 , 20 ) that , after Christ descended into hell , he preached to the unbelieving spirits in prison , and if the same Apostle immediately adds ( 1 Pet . iv . 6 ) that the gospel was preached also to them that are dead , that both the dead and the living might be judged , the inference above seems to be justified in express terms . And it does not in the least degree diminish the great importance and necessity of Missions , nor impair the obligation of Christendom to sustain them . " // in spite of it , and because he is so good and able a man , that is no endorsement of his peculiarity of belief . The Board tolerates in its officers and missionaries many exegetical and theological views , which it does not adopt or endorse , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It has sent out missionaries irrespective of their belief as to limited atonement or general atonement , and as to the sinner 's ability or inability to repent ; irrespective of their pre-millennial or post-millennial theories of the Second Advent ; irrespective of their Arminian or Calvinistic creeds . The minority only contended for liberty in behalf of the missionary ; that when he met the heathen objection which confronted Wnlfram , he might not be shut up to any one of the theories named , but be free to offer that which best commended itself to his judgment , or to reject them all and confess total ignorance , without being called on positively to deny the fifth or any other theory , if he preferred so to do . So argued the minority report presented by Prof. Fisher , and such were his resolutions . President Seelyc 's substitute for the majority report also took this ground , " declining to give specific instructions in respect of doctrinal questions , " but instructing the Committee " to guard the soundness of faith and efficiency of service of its missionaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are . " But this was rejected by a vote of 88 to 51 , which was the nearest to a test vote of the parties , on this point , of any taken . Then was passed the intolerant action of the majority , reaffirming , as if the Board were a Church Court , the doctrinal deliverance made at Des Moines , and directing its application by the Prudential Committee to the cases of missionary candidates , so as to exclude those who held to the fifth view mentioned above . This leads us to the remaining question of principle , that purely ecclesiastical ; which pertains to the willingness or unwillingness of the Board to ascertain what the present faith of our churches is , as to positive affirmation and as to Christian tolerance , " by their actual usages , " as Prof. Fisher 's minority report put it . The Prudential Committee refuse so to do , and this seems the secret of their antagonism to councils , which express the present views of the ministers and churches . This is the reason that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creeds of Christendom ; to the creed of the Evangelical Alliance ; to the summary of belief set forth by the National Congregational Council at Boston , in 1865 ; and to the latest Confession of our faith , presented to the churches by the recent Creed Commission selected from all parts of the laud and all our schools of theologic thought , by a Committee of our Triennial Council . Secretary Alden was a member of that Commission ( as was this writer ) , and in that able body he found himself in a final minority of 3 to 21 . He tried in vain to introduce into the creed a clanse which should contradict and exclude the Andover hypothesis . We were meeting in Dr. Taylor 's church , New York city , and on calling for a copy of his churchereed , behold there was not a line in it contradictory of that hypothesis ; and the same was found to be true of the creeds of vast numbers of our churches , which are wholly silent on that subject . Dr. Alden thus learned that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet not contradictory of the faith of our churches , as expressed in many of their creeds and as re-affirmed by their Creed Commission , and was therefore entitled to tolerance ( not endorsement ) by our Board of Missions . Yet Dr. Alden sent to candidates his own creed rejected by the Commission , and he quoted to them other creeds of local churches , and insisted that the Committee were only obeying the will of the churches , and protecting their faith , by requiring certain positive statements denying that Christ might be offered to the heathen after death . And the Committee rely not on the Triennial Convention , nor any body in which the churches as such are represented , but on the majority vote of a Board which is a close , self-perpetuating corporation , not representative of churches , or even of the donors to its own treasury . What the minority claim is , that the Board , so long as it is our missionary agency , shall be just as liberal and tolerant as are the Congregational churches ; and that the actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general confessions and the COfl8Cfl8U8 furnished by the action of Councils and Associations throughout the land , in licensing candidates , and in ordaining and installing ministers . As a matter of fact , these have licensed , ordained and installed men favoring the Andover hypDthesis , and even some of the very candidates re // jected by the Prudential Committee of the Board . Hence Dr. Fisher offered the following resolution : " The missionaries of this Board shall have the same right of private judgment in the interpretation of God 's Word , and the same freedom of thought and of speech , as are enjoyed by their ministerial brethren in this country . In the exercise of their rights they should have constant and careful regard to the work of their associates , and to the harmony and effectiveness of the missions in which they labor . " It might have been supposed that this would be unanimously adopted ; but it was voted down by fifty-two majority ! How , after such a vote , a Secretary of the Board can have the face to appear before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and urge them to become the Board 's missionaries , on condition of such intellectual and spiritual bondage , and on terms of such inequality with pastors at home , we do not see . It is positively known , that scores of young men and women , of high character and rare qnalifications , have already refused , on this very account , to offer themselves as missionaries . The minority claim that the whole spirit and practice of Congregationalism is in favor of a large evangelical liberty on disputed and doubtful points ; a liberty which rises above attachment or opposition to any school or party . And for justification of this policy they refer to the Master 's own example ; for in the gospel of Mark we read : " And John answered ( or addressed ) him , saying : Master , we saw one casting out devils in thy name , and he followeth not us ; and we forbade him , because he followeth not us . But Jesus said , Forbid him not ; for there is no man who shall do a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of me ; for he that is not against us is on our part . " This is a case in which we prefer to be with Jesus in the minority , rather than with the apostles in the majority ! Yet their majority was twelve to one ! Can it be credited , that this Master , who uttered such a reproof , and who made a heretical Samaritan , instead of an orthodox Jew , the hero of his famous parable , would have us , in our day , forbid a devoted missionary to cast out the devils of heathenisin , because , while he accepts every truth of the gospel for which we contend , and which we have stated in our latest creeds , he adds the supposition or hope , that the souls whom // Christ is finally to judge will previously have had Christ offered to him , before or after death ? lie may be entirely in error , in entertaining such a hypothesis ; but shall that debar him from preaching Christ to the benighted pagans ? Why should it , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make every appeal which would be made by any of us ? And in speaking of a missionary appeal , it is a significant fact , that the excellent discourse before the Board at Springfield , by that firm conservative , Dr. Noble of Chicago , contained not a sentence which could not have been uttered by one of the minority , or even by an Andover Professor ! In the whole array of motives for carrying on the missionary enterprise with holy zeal , he did not include one inconsistent with the Andover hypothesis . And yet we must not send out a missionary , who could accept that missionary sermon in its entirety , unless he would add , what the preacher did not , a denial of Andover peculiarities ! Think of debarring a man , on so slender a ground of difference , from carrying the gospel to the living pagans in Africa or India , in China or Japan ! And we do debar him , so far as we are concerned , as a denomination , if the only agency we have for foreign missionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when , on the home field , a local church declines to call a man to be its pastor , or a local council declines to settle him over that church , leaving 4000 other Congregational churches to call him , if anyone of them should please . There are indeed various missions of the Board , which would call these rejected candidates , if they might . But not a single mission or mission church on the foreign field can act in the matter . The Prudential Committee , at Boston , stands between the whole heathen world and these vonng men , so far forth as the Congregational churches are concerned ; assuming by its own close corporation to represent them , although declining to accept their action made according to their established usages . This adoption of a standard different from any which the churches have authorized , raises a grave ecclesiastical question for the Congregational churches to consider ; for it plainly and practically touches the question of their fellowship . The Board indeed disclaims being one of our Congregational benevolent societies . But how can it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when , for sixteen years , // it has sent one of its Secretaries to sit in o'u*r Triennial Council , under * 4 , of Article II . of the Constitution , to wit : " Such Congregational general societies for Christian work and the faculties of such theological seminaries as may be recognized by this Council , may be represented by one delegate each , such representatives having the right of discussion only . " It is too late to back down from its virtual denominational position , to serve a purpose . To do so is to bring on a controversy as to the way in which we shall succeed in having a Congregational foreign missionary society ; whether by remodeling the American Board , or by organizing a new Society . But it would be the action of the conservative majority , which would bring on the controversy . Already many of them are favoring some modification of the Board , to avoid this serious objection . And now what shall be done by those dissatisfied with the action of the Board at Springfield ? Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to organize a new Society on our own principles ; and here and there a man of the minority may be inclined to act upon that advice . But the writer , judging from a membership of twenty years and an observation of the Board for over forty years , sees no sufficient reason , at present , for taking such a step . It would involve great and unwise expenditures of money and labor , to create and operate a new agency , and it would carry bitter controversy into everyone of our 4000 churches . Nor is such a step probably necessary to the ultimate triumph of the liberal policy . The meeting at Springfield did but increase its strength , and every day will add to the number of its defenders . We must not be in too great haste . Good men , confronted with new questions , must have time to adjust their thoughts , to rectify their mistakes , and to modify their methods . The American Board has changed its policy on other disputed questions ; notably on that of slavery . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its Committee , or more probably in the practical way which such bodies have , of allowing the present new and unfortunate policy to fall into " innocuous desuetude . " The Board will be brought back to its old methods for which we contend . Never before has it assumed to decide theological controversies among its own constituents , and it will not long continue in so perilous a path . // Our churches will not divide , and the Board will not be wrecked , although for a time there will be earnest discussion . Time , argument , prayer and providential events will bring everything right ; for they are true Christian men , equally devoted to the missionary cause , who are having this honest difference of judgment ; and the Spirit of God will lead them eventually into " the truth as It is in Jesus , " whatever that may prove to be . Surely , when we think of the savagery aud cruelty of heathenism , of its moral abominations , of its utter impotency for good in life and its despair in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and its ignorance of his love for this lost world as revealed in Jesus Christ , and remember our Redeemer 's last command , to " go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature , " we have motives enough for missionary effort , without touching the disputed point over which this controversy has been waged . And so let us close up the ranks , and move unitedly to the battle-field against " the powers of darkness , " led by Him , who " hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written , KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS . " And then will the vision of John in Patmos prove itself true : " After this I beheld , and lo , a great multitude , which no man could number , of all nations , and kindreds and people and tongues , stood before the throne and before the Lamb , clothed with white robes and palms in their hand , and cried with a loud voice , saying , Salvation to our God , who sitteth upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WM .
