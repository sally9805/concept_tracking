txt Near the Atlantic Highlands camp-meeting grounds , last September , the body of a colored man named Henry Lane was found floating in the Shrewsbury River , and no inquest was held at the time , it being believed that Lane had accidentally fallen over-board from the steam-boat Sea-Bird , plying be-tween Red Bank and New-York . A few days ago one of the white members of the Drum robber band , who was accused in Drum 's confession as being a robber and incendiary , told a story to Chief of Police Patterson , of Red Bank , stating that several colored members of the band had waylaid the negro Lane , while he was intoxicated , at Sheriff Thompson 's Hotel at the Highlands , and that after robbing him of nearly $100 , they knocked him senseless with a club , and carried him to a boat , which they set adrift . When Henry Jackson , colored , with Frank Reddly , alias Rusty , both members of the band of desperadors , were brought from NewYork on Thursday night , Jackson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Coroner John P. Cooper , of Middletown , with the informer 's statement that he had the remains of the alleged murdered man exhumed and brought to Red Bank . Dr. James H. Patterson , the County Clerk , and Dr. Alfred Prafford , the town physician , examined the body , and the head revealed marks of blows that might have caused death . The physicians , however , could not say that the contusions on the head might not have been caused by the body coming in contact with rocks after death by drowning . Many people believe that no murder was committed , because of a statement made by one of the prisoners that bogus confessions have been forced from three of the arrested men by Marshal Patterson and his men , under a promise that they would be dealt leniently with as State witnesses .
