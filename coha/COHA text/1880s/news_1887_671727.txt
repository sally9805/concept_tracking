txt It does not appear whether the men in the employ of the Reading Railroad who are now meditating a strike are doing so in their capacity of Knights of Labor , and whether they intend to involve the whole order in their dispute . Nevertheless their reasoning processes are evidently derived from the methods of the Knights . The company demands that the men upon whose ability to distinguish the colors of signals the lives of passengers and of train men and the property of the road may depend shall submit to tests of this ability . It is this demand of the bloated oppressor that the men are prepared to resist , even to striking and boycotting . A color-blind man who insists upon risking his own life and the lives of other - people through his infirmity does not occupy a very noble attitude . He is by no means so absurd an object , however , as the men who are not color blind and who threaten to quit work if he is not allowed to endanger human life . Both the physically and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Reading Road seem to be dimly aware that they will not receive much sympathy if they make a frank statement of their position . Accordingly they say that they are not opposed to " color examinations conducted in a practical way , by means of boards , flags , and lights with red , white , green , and blue colors. " - The company , however , determined to crush out the last vestige of self-respect among its workingmen , has prescribed an examination by skeins of yarn . This is well known to be the method . that is employed in the military and naval service , and that has lately been introduced into the civil service where a color test is needed . It has been so introduced at the behest of theorists , dudes , Pharisees , and British free traders , and these hateful classes resort to skeins of colored yarn in their efforts - to build up a , permanent office-holding aristocracy . Hence , it is to be presumed , the Reading Railroad men spurn a submission to the yarn test as unworthy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason , it is not easy to see what the reason can be . A man who can tell " red , white , green , and blue colors " apart when they are painted on boards or dyed in bunting or stained in glass can surely distinguish them when they are submitted to him in the coloring matter of yarns . He can not even offer the excuse that , according to Joseph Miller , was made by the candi date for a schoolmaster 's situation who was asked of What country Vienna was the capital . " Well , Sir , " he at last made answer , " I know what country Vienna is the capital of probably as well as you do , but I have n't the flow of language to express it . " This-will not serve the Knights of Reading . If their vocabulary does not enable them to name the primary and . secondary colors when presented in yarns they will be equally at a loss to designate them when displayed on boards , flags , and lights . The sepoys , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cartridges , but the Reading men do not allege any theological objections to yarns that do not equally apply to signals . The impartial observer must conclude either that they are hopeless fools or else that their.action has some motive which they do not avow . As there is no reason to suppose that the men are absolute idiots. it is safe to take the other supposition . It is probable - that many of them either know or suspect that they are color blind , and . are afraid of losing their situations if they submit to a test for color blindness . Their action suggests that they . hope , by coaching or otherwise , fraudulently to pass an examination conducted by means of boards and flags , while they ' see no chance of " beating " the . test by skeins of yarn . That is to say , those of them who believe that they can not pass a fair test nevertheless insist upon being employed in situations where their service is a continual danger to life . They propose to submit to " abitration " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The proposition is at once monstrous and ridiculous , and . it is not to be supposed that the company will entertain it for a moment .
