691 THE EMPEROR WILLIAM . THE death of this venerable prince , the first Emperor of the new Germany , removes one of the most stately , most impressive , and in some respects most agreeable figures of the present generation . With the possible exception of Lincoln , no man since Napoleon has been prominently associated as a ruler of men with events of such magnitude , with revolutions of such transcendent importance , with transactions which have so completely overthrown the traditions and relations of the past , and given name to a new era in history . On the hasty student the full significance of these events is perhaps sometimes lost . They are still recent ; they were bewildering in their rapidity ; they lack perspective . Wars were fought , and battles were won . The Austrians were crushed at Sadowa . The French were crushed at Sedan . The victor took the spoils , and among these was the crown of Germany , now for the first time placed on the brow of a conquering Hohenzollern , the lucky leader in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of several points in an audacious game , might have ruined . Such is perhaps the popular view of a series of events to which only a deeper acquaintance with the earlier facts of history , with the antecedents of the great German problem , can give their true proportions and meaning . But the person of William himself and the part which he played appeal to the most sluggish imagination . At an age greater by several years than that at which by law American generals are placed on the retired list as unfit for active command , the late King of Prussia led his hosts into Bohemia ; and four years afterwards , still vigorous and undaunted , he conducted campaigns in the country of another enemy , and received the crown of reunited Germany in the palace of the Bourbons . These wars , but more especially the last , made the name , the person , and the services of William familiar to every household in the civilized world . Even those who were ignorant of the merits of the great struggles could not fail to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defying fatigue , defying exposure , defying even his own years , in the accomplishment of what he conceived to be his duty ; and then , after the campaigns were over , returning , not to enjoy a well-earned repose , but only to a different kind of labor , performed with the same patient and scrupulous exactitude . He was felt to be a large man , - large in his sense of duty , large in his aims and ends , large in the associates with whom he surrounded himself , large in the physical proportions , which are natural and not unworthy objects of admiration . It is not too much to say that , among the contemporary princes of Christendom , he was the one who filled the greatest place in the estimation of mankind . In all the outward , and in many of the inward , qualities which seem to belong to wearers of the purple , William was an ideal monarch . Carlyle says that Frederic the Great was every inch a king . By that he means that Frederic had a royal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and in that sense he is correct . But the outward dignity and decorum of the royal office the greatest of Prussian kings often and even purposely neglected : he was slovenly in dress , undignified in manner , careless in the choice of companions ; a rationalist on the throne , he despised its Pomp , and forms , and ceremonials . But William , while equally jealous of the power of his office , never lost sight of its proprieties . Even if royalty is measured by inches , he stood above his great // predecessor . His stalwart , massive form , his stately carriage , his portly demeanor , suggested the heroes of the Niebelungenlied . He could be affable , courteous , condescending , but never undignified , never coarse , flippant , or familiar . He never forgot that much was due to the elevation of his office , and he suffered nobody else to forget it in his presence . In matters of state and ceremony he always sacrificed his personal tastes , which were extremely simple and plain , to the necessity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of checking any tendency to believe that the king was a mere clerk of Parliament or the ministers , of enforcing the principle that the chief personage in the state was bound to set an example of decorum and dignity . Undoubtedly , this conscientiousness often descended to the trivial and the puerile . It was the foolish boast of his majesty that lie alone knew the uniform of every grade , in every branch of the military service ; that he alone knew how to place every decoration that any German officer was entitled to wear . These were foibles , of course , but they were foibles which , though revealing a rather petty side of the Emperor 's nature , were , nevertheless , characteristic of his minute sense of duty , and of his desire to neglect nothing which seemed necessary to the lesson of thoroughness and discipline . In a larger sense , his appearance on public occasions - at banquets , parades , reviews , at the reception of foreign sovereigns and as the guest of friendly courts - was always noble , stately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and character ; such as relieved the office of king from the contempt of the cynical or the familiarity of the vulgar . This is no small part of government . Mere pomp without power is indeed ludicrous , especially when it is used to conceal weakness , as it often is , or to furnish a vain substitute for force ; and Germany has illustrations of this kind , as well as of the other . The Spanish etiquette of Dresden is notorious . The smaller and poorer the prince in Germany , the greater his love of display , the keener his solicitude about forms , the more sumptuous and elaborate the ceremonies of his court ; and this has increased , relatively at least , since imperial unity has stripped these princes of some of their real power and dignity . But if it be true that the Emperor William , having the substance of power , could afford to dispense with some of its tinselry , and was personally of simple tastes , it is still true only in a sense which it is important to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that though he made some concessions in detail to his subjects , lie was careful not to let them encroach on the general stock of the prerogative . It was so in regard to the late Emperor . He was careful not to relax anything from the essential dignity of his rank , and punctiliously exacted the most solemn state and ceremony on all occasions where their omission would have been noticed . The grandeur of royalty was as clear to him as its usefulness . In this respect , in the massive , stately , splendid form which he gave to that institution , he has no rival since Louis XIV . Thus , as a mere figure or type , he filled a large place in the horizon , and every one is sensible of the vacancy that is left . It is not for these things , however , that William will live in history , but for the prominent part which he had in a momentous historical drama . The very length of that drama , if Jena and Sedan be taken as the first and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emperor may be called an actor through the whole of it . In this respect he stands alone . Opinions may differ about the proper assignment of credit to the king on the one hand , and to Bismarck and Moltke on the other , for the final achievement ; but neither the great statesman nor the great soldier had , like their master , walked the stage during // the whole course of the play . Bismarek was unborn when Jena was fought and lost . Moltke was not a Prussian by birth , and is a Prussian to-day only by acquired allegiance , as Prince Eugene was an Austrian , or Marshal Saxe a Frenchman . But William was a youth of nine when the old Prussian system went down under the blows of Napoleon ; and though too young to understand the folly which brought on the catastrophe , or its crushing significance , he followed his parents into their cruel exile , learned to feel the afflictions of his country , and entered the army before the hand of the tyrant was lifted . It is easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had for him an import deeper than any felt by his two chief lieutenants . For Moltke it was scarcely more than a game of chess , - played , indeed , with great bodies of mortal men as pieces , yet played by him , at least , with little feeling beyond the desire to win . Even with Bismarck it was only the means to an end . The end was German unity , and the defeat of France being necessary to that , he felt a profound interest in the victory ; but the retributive side of it appealed to him only as a student of history , who had not personally felt the iron hand of the first Napoleon . It was , however , this side or aspect of the great contest which pubMe opinion made most prominent in the view of the Emperor , and some of his own expressions support such a theory . If his object had been unity alone , it is by no means certain that he would have felt that unity dependent on a previous victory over the French . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to habits of political thought , who believed that the South German states could be taken into the larger confederation by a mere treaty in time of peace , and kept in without the cementing principle of a common victory over France ; and there was much in the king 's tone or temper of mind to incline him to such a solution of the problem . Everybody now sees that Bismarck was right . The victories in France and the overthrow of Napoleon gave Prussia two great elements of strength in the negotiations for imperial unity , and reduced the terms on which otherwise the southern states might have been disposed to insist . The one was the fierce enthusiasm and the thoroughly national spirit aroused by the victories themselves . The other was the prostration of the power which would have aided them to drive a hard bargain with Prussia . But to a man like King William these considerations might have seemed , as they seemed to deeper thinkers than hiniseif , not a little strained , and hardly worth the experiment of a bloody and doubtful war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national revenge was concrete , simple , easy to understand , and easy to obey . For though a humane man , the Emperor was not a forgiving man , but cherished resentments with great tenacity . This was the case even with personal injuries , or what he conceived to be such . It is a part of the secret history of Berlin poi* itics that no career was open , with his consent , to any man who in the conflict period from 1862 to 1866 had made himself personally obnoxious to the palace ; and common rumor specified certain eminent politicians , whom Bismarek himself had long since forgiven , who afterwards joined the government ranks , but who were prevented from taking seats in the cabinet by the absolute veto of the Emperor . If he were thus severe toward personal enemies , it was naturni that he should take even greater pleasure in punishing the enemies of his house and country . In France he saw the enemy of both . He saw the government of France in the hands of a ruler whose only hereditary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oppressor of Prussia , the oppressor who had driven his father into exile , had insulted his mother , and hurried her into an early // grave ; and even a prince with a shorter memory than William 's , or a weaker historical sense , or a more forgiving spirit , would have longed for the hour of retribution , and have grasped it eagerly when it came . In this vivid sense , then , of wrongs to be redressed and injuries to be avenged is to be found one secret of the king 's personal interest in the war with France . The Austrian war of 1866 had a somewhat different color or complexion . It was mainly political , in its origin and in its ends ; and the force of historic vengeance , the impulse of national animosities , hardly entered into it . A long course of political rivalry had indeed preceded it , so that it was the outcome of organic causes . It was as inevitable as the struggle between Athens and Sparta for the hegemony in Greece . But though the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came was one of the most deliberate , most artificial , and in its moral aspects most causeless that have ever been undertaken . The means for the war were obtained by the government of Prussia through a long and systematic defiance of the national constitution . It involved a breach of the federal compact . Regarded throughout the confederation as a wanton scheme of aggression , it was bitterly opposed by the people of Prussia , alike by those who feared defeat and those who feared victory defeat , because that would mean the loss of Prussian independence under the imperial supremacy of the Hapsburgs ; victory , because that would mean the loss of Prussian liberty under the dynastic absolutism of the Hohenzollerns . Either result seemed menacing to the cause of constitutional freedom in the several states , and to the cause of German unity and liberal institutions . The people did not look upon Austria as a national enemy ; for the arrogance of her tone , the haughty insolence of her diplomacy , and her jealous intolerance of Prussian equality were rather fitted to exasperate statesmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a nation . The alternative , so far as it presented any voluntary choice to the King of Prussia , was thus a trying one . He might live at peace with his own people and with other princes , endure the insults of Austrian policy , tolerate the anarchy of Germany , and expose Prussia to deeper and deeper degradation ; or he might face the issue of power bravely , trample on the laws in order to get ready for war , and , choosing his own time for battle , take the chances of failure and success . Only a man of great determination could choose the latter course , and since Frederic the Great no such man had sat on the throne of Prussia . It was to the credit of the new king that he made his choice with gravity , indeed , but without fear and without hesitation . This concession may appear inconsistent with what has just been said of the artificial and aggressive character of the war of 1866 . But these terms describe only its immediate , outward , and superficial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been able to see , and not the deeper substance which made it seem a virtual necessity to the king . For such , in fact , it was . In that character , as an act performed under the law of political necessity , the attack upon Austria found its justification among the leading Prussian statesmen , was afterwards ratified by the Prussian people , and will be approved by future historians . Even the Austrians themselves have learned to view the matter in this light . Yet to rest here would leave a way open for misapprehension . There are two kinds of political necessity . One is absolute , the other relative ; one is immediate and peremptory , the other is ultimate and contingent ; one commands , the other exhorts ; one is obeyed perhaps most abjectly by the timid , the other is obeyed most promptly by the bold // and strong . Burke has a description of the former . " It is the first and supreme necessity only , " he says ; " a necessity that is not chosen but chooses ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and demands no evidence , which alone can justify a resort to anarchy , " - or , he might have added , a resort to many other extreme and violent measures in political life . Webster expressed the very sentiment , if indeed he did not have this same passage in his mind , when , in the case of the Caroline , he wrote of a necessity " instant , overwhelming , having no choice of means and no moment of deliberation . " Such a necessity arises in case of any sudden invasion , a formidable outbreak , or any immediate and unexpected peril , which compels instant and justifies arbitrary measures . Of course no crisis of this kind confronted William I. when he came to the throne . If such a crisis had existed , the policy which he adopted would have found an easier justification ; but the ease of the justification would have been purchased at the price of his reputation for political insight and political courage , - in a word , for statesmanship iu the larger sense . The foolish man knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The timid will fight when no quarter is offered , and it is impossible to run away . It follows that the political necessity which William obeyed was of the other kind . It was a necessity which did not overrule judgment , but invited and even needed it ; which did not appeal to the desperation of cowardice , but to the calm reason of courage ; which imposed , not released , responsibility ; which did not choose , but was chosen . The difference may be illustrated by many examples from history . There was a political necessity imposed on the United States to put down the rebellion , and there was a political necessity recognized by them to expel the French from Mexico ; but it is evident that the two duties were not the same in urgency and peremptoriness . The responsibility of Russia in opposing invasion by Napoleon was different from the responsibility of securing internal and external security by attacking Turkey in 1877 . The same distinction may be extended for the benefit of William . Prussia was in no immediate danger , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system had continued . It would have been possible to accept the existing . state of things ; to endure the weaknes*s of Germany , the arrogance of Austria , the , relative inferiority of Prussia ; and in a material sense the near future would have been full of ease , indolcnce , and comfort . But the moral or political degradation would have been always present . Even physical danger , though remote , was not improbable nor invisible ; and the question was whether that danger should be awaited with a blind trust in fortune , or anticipated by a bold , audacious , and therefore hazardous policy . It was inevitable that the rivalry between Austria and Prussia in the German confederation must end in the supremacy of one or the other . The supremacy of Austria would mean the reduction of Prussia to the rank of a power of the second class , and this could be averted only by a successful war . Thus we return to the dilemma already described . Austria would not yield without fighting , - so much was certain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leadership or even equality ; and if she decided to fight , there remained the further question whether she would light at a time chosen by Austria , and only as a desperate struggle for existence , or would choose her own time , and prepare for the struggle in her own way . This was the problem of political necessity as it presented itself to William . He saw the alternative . He felt the responsibility which rested upon him , and he was equal to it . The necessity which // he obeyed was chosen , but he obeyed it , and took all the consequences . The result was equally creditable to his foresight and his courage . It is not alone , however , from the censures of those who condemn the entire policy of Prussia in the first ten years of his reign that William has suffered . Even the friends of that policy have perhaps done injustice to the king by exalting the relative merits of his great minister . In cases of this kind it is difficult to 4ecide . The language of courtiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have only assented ; while , on the other hand , the panegyrists of statesmen have not infrequently overlooked , or underrated , the part taken by those who stood above the statesmen , and anticipated rather than sanctioned their plans . Between Bismarck and William no dispute over the division of merit could indeed arise . Bismarek was always careful to give the king full credit for all that had been done , and the king , with his theories of divine right and the omniscience of royalty , could only acquiesce in such a method . Nothing , indeed , is more characteristic of the two men , of their relations , and of their theories of government than the attitude which each assumed toward the triumphs of the past . But there was glory enough for both . It is trite to say that without the aid of Bismarck 's unrivaled sagacity , coolness , and resolution the great plan would probably never have been carried through ; whether it would never have been formed without Bismarek , whether in fact it was not formed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different question . It is related that when William , then Prince of Prussia , met the future chancellor he exclaimed that he had at last found a man to do his work . To know such a man when he found him was wisdom . To have the work planned , and only awaiting the opportunity , at that early date , when he was only heir presumptive to the throne , shows that the brain of the prince had been busy , and that he could form his own ideas . The period from the fall of Napoleon to the middle of the century was indeed a great school for the formation of political character . Its beginning saw the restoration of the old dynasty in France and the universal triumph of reaction ; it ended with new outbursts of popular impatience , seeking , often wildly , rashly , and blindl*r , to throw off the shackles of tyranny . The interval was Metternich . Rarely could it be more correct and more suggestive to give the name of a great man to the age in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , courtly , and splendid high priest of reaction , who for a whole generation made the princes of Germany slavishly repeat after him the articles of his political creed , and enforce the same beliefs upon all who obtained or desired their favor . This was the era of repression . The French Revolution had planted its seeds in Germany ; those seeds had sprouted ; and all through this period the tiny blades and shoots of liberalism were pushing their way to the surface , modestly and unobtrusively searching for air and light in which to grow , but only to be cut down and trodden back in the earth from which they came . No matter in what form the popular aspirations presented themselves , it uls Metternich 's maxim that they must be summanly crushed before they attained any dangerous vigor . No freedom of speech , or of the press , or of public meeting ; no parliaments worth the name ; no free thought in the universities or in the pulpits , - such was the command of Metternich , and the servile little governments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Laybach , the suppression of gymnastic societies , the imprisonment of Jahn , and a long series of repressive acts and edicts , of police persecutions and military confisca // tions , make up the history of the period , over which , as if it were not already dark enough , the stern and gloomy Nicholas of Russia cast the shadow of his example and authority . This was not , however , the end . The German people are patient and docile beyond almost any other in the world , but even the worm will sometimes turn when trodden on . In 1848 and 1849 , again inspired by French example , the Germans , with arms in their hands , demanded their enfranchisement ; and all over the Fatherland princes and princelets trembled in the corners of their palaces , while angry mobs howled and stormed beneath their windows . While Metternich was rubbing his eyes with amazement at this ill-bred insubordination , he himself was swept away by the tempest , and left office , never more to return . The very air itself was full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , wanting concert , were early put down by the well-trained regular troops . But the old era was never fully restored . One prince after another issued a constitution ; parliaments were summoned ; and the people were admitted to a small share in the management of their own affairs . And then this new system , born of fear and viewed with distrust , was put into operatioii . It is important to recall this history , because William of Prussia liv*d through it , made part of it , and was educated by it . When it was finished , it left men divided as before into two groups , but with a completed experience to justify their respective places . One class said that the revolutionary uprisings were the natural outcome of Metternich 's policy , and that the lesson of events pointed to a further and franker development of the constitutional system , with larger concessions to the rights of the people and greater modifications of the royal prerogative . But the other set drew from the events preaisely the opposite conclusion . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one defeot of the old policy was its inadequate enforcement ; that thoroughness and determination would have awed discontent ; that the rebellious outbreaks should have been put down with merciless severity ; and that altar and throne should be fortified with irresistible bayonets . To this class it was well understood that the Prince of Prussia belonged . He probably had little sympathy with the Metternichean system of decrees , proclamations , and congresses , for he abhorred phrases , and was a man of deeds . He had more faith in soldiers than in diplomatists . But he believed in the old Frederician rules of government , with the principle of divine right added ; and he found little respect for these in the manner in which his brother , the king , had met the crisis of 1848 . Undoubtedly , the conduct of Frederic William IV . was open to censure , and to censure from every side . It satisfied neither those who were for sterner measures , nor those who were for larger concessions . It was timid , weak , fitful , and vacillating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wishes of the people ; it made radicals more radical , and reactionists more reactionary ; and , as not the least of its evils , it confirmed the heir presumptive to the throne in his extreme theories of the prerogative . For William the most satisfactory moment in the protracted Berlin crisis was , doubtless , when old Marshal Wrangel led his corps of soldiers into the city , and turned the national assembly out - ofdoors at the point of the bayonet . A mind originally autocratic was thus intensified by the stern , narrow life of a Prussian soldier , by the democratic volcano rumbling for so many years beneath the crust of German society , by the unctuous beatitude of the Holy Alliance , by the angry outbreaks of 1848 , and by the spectacle of his royal brother 's piti // able weakness . As he waited for the day when he should ascend the throne , he seemed the finest living representative of the old theories of absolute government . A strong man himself , he liked strength in all who held places of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exalted places of conimand , ought especially to be worthy of their office . But he would not have admitted that fitness itself was a title to royalty , whether the fit man seized the throne as a usurper , or was called to it by a people . Such a view might suit a pagan , or a rationalist , or a C*esar , but not the descendant of so many generations of Hohenzollerns . The power to rule might come from men , bat the authority could only come from above . Among all modern princes , he probably held in the purest form , more literally and absolutely , and with the simplest sincerity , the doctrine of the divine right of kings . This in the nineteenth century , and in a man with so many strong qualities of mind , - the influence of priests and confessors , of a mystical nature , or of a morbid religious spirit being out of the question , - is a bewildering paradox . If the matter were taken seriously , doubtless much edifying speculation might be produced . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction , into the Emperor 's own error , and pass by unperceived a principal explanation of the paradox . Negatively , at least , his quaint and solemn adherence to a grotesque superstition was largely due to his deficient sense of humor . this appears in many ways . It runs through his whole conduct of life , and often gives a tinge of the comical to the most excellent virtues and dispositions ; but it is specially conspicuous in the intense gravity with which he applied himself to affairs , or the frequent disproportion between the gravity and the subject . Not even Mr. Gladstone is so averse to trifling , or so unconscious of the humor of excessive earnestness . He used to go out to his hunting-seats , and shoot hares , pheasants , and other game by the hundreds as the beaters drove them by , and then have the record of his execution carefully made out , without the slightest apparent suspicion that it was all rather childish and silly . No sense of the humorous side of his military devotion ever seems to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course a useful one , and , like all others , should be pursued faithfully and earnest ly . Great armies may be necessary to the safety of a state . But with William the army was an end in itself ; and he was accustomed to parade his fine regiments before visiting sovereigns with as much solemn pride as if he were a Michael Angelo showing The Last Judgment in the Sistine Chapel , or some benefactor of the race explaining a new device for alleviating human misery ; as if it were a noble achievement , independently of other objects , to construct big , showy marching machines out of masses of men torn as it were from the ranks of honest industry to make a German holiday . Other princes held reviews , it is true , but hardly without sometimes reflecting that there was one side of it all just a little incongruous and absurd . Everybody remembers the pious bulletins which the Emperor used to send home to the Empress during the French war , - the fervor with which he used to thank God after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humor at once , in spite of its cruel meaning for them , and parodied the bulletins . One of these parodies , in verse , and supposed to be addressed by the Emperor to Augusta , may be translated roughly by this couplet : - " Ten thousand Frenchmen more laid low : Praise God , from whom all blessings flow ! " Bismarck would have laughed heartily over this . But it may be doubted if William , bad it been shown to him , would have seen the point of the fun , or felt the edge of the satire ; indeed , a // man who could appreciate the parody would hardly have sent the original dispatches . These illustrations will perhaps suffice to explain one feature or one defect of the Emperor 's mind which made it possible for him to accept the doctrine of divine right . The folly of an error is fatal to its success with persons who have a sense of the ridiculous . But William grew up with a belief in divine right , and without the sense of humor which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctrine ; so that , for all the world knows , he died in the firm conviction that Providence ordained the Hohenzollerns to rule , and all other Prussians to obey . This theory of the origin of royal authority naturally suggested a sympathetic theory of its extent . What God granted only God could limit ; and as it could not be discovered that any limitations had been made by divine power , it followed that it must be illimitable . This is of course the old Stuart theory of the prerogative . It is strange enough to find the preposterous metaphysics of the most pedantic of English kings gravely adopted more than two centuries afterwards by a busy , active , practical man of affairs , but there is plenty of evidence in William 's own words that this is not an exaggerated statement of his views . And these views had , unfortunately , a direct bearing on the actual course of Prussian politics . In Prussia there had been since the year 1850 a written constitution . That constitution limited the powers of the crown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the royal authority was derived from , or at least founded on , the irrevocable instrument which described it . In this sense the charter was in plain conflict with the doctrine of divine right , and presented a serious difficulty to William on his accession . It is to his credit for courage and honesty that he met it boldly , without sophistry or evasion . It was possi ble for him to explain that while he did not admit any right on the part of the nation to limit the prerogative , he recognized the right of his brother while king freely to introduce limitations , and his own duty , as his brother 's heir , to accept with the inheritance its burdens and conditions . It is possible to fijid in his public utterances some traces of such a mental compromise . But these are not conclusive , and the evidence of his conduct is strongly in favor of the theory that he looked on the charter as little more than a set of practical rules , which ought to be observed in normal circumstances , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposition it was an easy step to the further one , that a serious crisis was present whenever the constitution interfered with a scheme which he considered essential to the state . This too might have been drawn from the creed of the Stuarts , and William applied it with a rather fine logical discrimination . There was , for example , a marked difference between his policy during the period of his regency and his policy after his accession as king . While he acted as substitute for and in the name of his incapacitated brother , he was faithful to both the letter and the spirit of the constitution , introduced a liberal ministry , and rejoiced the hearts of the people . He reasoned , apparently , that as Frederic William IV . had voluntarily invited the nation to share the power of government , it was his own duty , while representing his brother , to give the most complete expression to generosity . But when he became king his conduct changed . At his coronation he announced the principle of divine right in terms which warned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and four years of open , deliberate violation of the charter . The charter stood in the king 's way , and he brushed it aside . If during the later years of his life be lived at peace with his parliaments , // and kept within the constitution , it is a sufficient explanation to say that his parliaments no longer opposed his plans ; and that as he had been supported and encouraged by Bismarek during the conflict period , so now , after the victory was won , he accepted the advice of the same , great minister , who knew better than himself the temper of the age , and the point at which illegality became unwise even in Prussia . But his principles he refused to abandon . He sternly insisted , on every occasion , that the ministers of the crown were the choice of the crown , and could not be turned out of office by adverse votes of the Diet . He refused to go to the hall of the deputies , either in person or by proxy , to open the annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the programme of his government ; and in the great hall of the old castle the speech from the throne was always read . In regard to the measures of recent years , it is , of course , impossible to say how much was the Emperor 's and how much the chancellor 's . His majesty certainly relaxed none of his belief , as he grew old , that he was truly the fons et origo of everything good in Prussian or German policy ; and the more he became incapacitated by years and infirmity for directing affairs , the more careful his ministers and attendants were to magnify his part . In the course of twenty - five years many disagreements must have arisen between Bismarek and himself . How many there were , and how they were all composed , can not even be conjectured ; but two lines of policy which the chancellor succeeded in adopting are known to have caused grave misgivings to the Emperor . In foreign politics , the gradual alienation from IRussia was not at all agreeable to William 's views . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Russian alliance , which he regarded as the chief support of Prussia 's interests in European diplomacy ; and the example of Austria 's magnificent ingratitude was one which he felt it peculiarly important not to follow . Ties of blood connecting him with the Romanofs , and a certain sentiment not wanting to his nature , strengthened this conviction . But Bismarck knew Russia better than he , and knew how far Germany could afford to link her policy with that of the Tsars on the Neva . The rupture began , too , at the Congress of Berlin , while William lay prostrate from Nobiling 's shots . When he recovered , the new path had been taken , and for better or worse it had to be followed . The chancellor 's war upon the Church of Rome , and indirectly upon ecclesiastical pretensions of every kind , aroused even stronger apprehensions . The party of the throne in Prussia was also the party of the altar . The Emperor had a deeply religious nature , which often found expression , indeed , as in the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but still was warm and genuine ; and his reluctance to interfere with the clerical prerogatives was artfully encouraged by many within and without the Church , to whom he lent a sympathetic ear . But notwithstanding his doubts , he behaved with great loyalty when once the policy of repression was adopted . The public knew that the Falk laws were not after his heart , that the palace had much sympathy with the clergy , and this was all . No official discord appeared . The department in which William made his own individuality most strongly felt was of course that of military affairs . Here he rendered undoubted service . His character and tastes evidently inclined him to this line of work ; and his practical experience , aided by prolonged and ardent study , gave him an almost unrivaled knowledge of the details and principles of army organization . He had , indeed , an admirable lieutenant in the minister of war , Count von Roon , a man whose share in the great events of the time is now perhaps not sufficiently // appreciated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bismarck or Moltke . In fact , the Emperor himself would have made an excellent war minister , if he had been a subject instead of a sovereign , and it is as an organizer rather than as a commander that his name deserves a great place in the annals of the Prussian army . Among his predecessors , he recalls not Frederic the Great , but Frederic William I. If Bismarck worked up the diplomacy of Prussia , and Moltke planned its campaigns , the king himself , aided faithfully by Roon , re-formed the army , and made it the tremendous machine which it is . This is an undoubted title to fame . To have been , besides , the discoverer of Bismarck and Moltke ; to have led the armies of Prussia in two great and successful wars ; to have overthrown an empire in France and founded one in Germany ; to have set all his subjects an example of courage . conscientiousness , and industry , as those qualities are rarely exemplified in kings ; to have reigned for a whole generation after the age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mightiest military empire that the world has ever seen ; and perhaps most remarkable of all , to have been escorted tenderly and mournfully to his grave by a nation which once regarded him as the very incarnation of evil , - to be , and achieve , and experience all of this is the assurance of a permanent place among the gTeat men of earth . " I have no time to be tired , " he said , even on his dying couch , and the words should be engraved on his monument as the interpretation of his life . This life of indefatigable and unconquerable industry , an industry often misdirected , often unnecessary , often unfortunate , yet always conscientious and sincere , is one which the present generation and the generations to come will study with great and ever-increasing admiration .
