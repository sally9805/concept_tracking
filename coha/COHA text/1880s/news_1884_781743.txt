txt No one ever accused Mr. BLAINE of being a lazy man . We have to-day a fresh proof of his energy and bustling industry in a remark-able " address " issued by the Republican National Committee at its " new Southern headquarters in Nashville . " The first paragraph betrays by two unmistakable tokens the authorship of this appeal for votes in that section of the Republic of which Mr. BLAINE , during his career in the House and Senate , was one of the most constant , conspicuous , and malignant vilifiers . In what is there written about the Republican appeal , " with earnest good faith and in the spirit of American fraternity , to the intelligence , enterprise , honorable ambitions , and American instincts and aspirations of the Southern people , " with other free-flowing gush and high-sounding humbug of like description , the pen of BLAINE is clearly visible ; and in perpetrating the startling Blaineism of the next sentence , in which it is asserted that this appeal to Southern . votes " has not been made until the Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a predestined success , " &c.,; the Republican candidate stands forth confessed , all his tattooed surface glowing with the light and joy of a new though not needless falsehood , his white feathers dancing merrily over his familiar features , and magnetism mixed with the rank odor of the Mulligan letters distilling from his every pore . The address throughout sounds but-one note . It is a bid for the Southern vote on the tariff issue , full of clap-trap , but claptrap too transparent to be dangerous , and abounding in figures pitchforked together in that loose way . which is Mr. BLAINE 'S only way , of handling figures . The Southern voters will be very little moved by this appeal . They are notthinking about the tariff this year , and if they were they would see no reason in all that this address contains for preferring the platform on which Mr. BLAINE stands to that on which Mr. CLEVELAND stands . This move of Mr. BLAINE and his National Committee is an unmistakable evidence of alarm . The great States of the North and West are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South . No drowning man . of Mr. BLAINE 'S stony aptness at sinking was ever . yet saved by a straw so slender as this one he clutches at from his " new Southern headquarters at Nashville .
