txt Is the Republican Party in a condition to go into the Presidential campaign in a defensive attitude ? That is an interesting question just now for all who believe , as we do , that the Republican Party is capable of managing the affairs of the country far more safely and successfully than the Democratic Party . A few facts from recent elections will throw light on the subject . Twelve years ago the Republicans elected Gen. GRANT for his second term by a majority of more than threequarters of a million in a popular vote of six millions and a half . Four years later Mr. TILDEN received a majority of 150,000 , in round numbers , in a vote of eight and a half millions . At the last election Gen. GARFIELD received a plurality of barely 9,000 in. a total vote of over nine millions . In 1882 elections were held in all of the States of the Union ; some - - 8,000,000 votes were cast , and the Democrats had a plurality of over 400,000 . Last year elections were held in 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the . Democratic plurality was 42,0002 Of the States which gave their Electoral votes to Gen. GARFIELD , can any one say how the following will go next Fall : New-York , Ohio , Indiana , Connecticut ? Together these States had 78 Electoral votes in 1880 and will have 80 this year . Is this a condition of things which justifies the belief that the Republican Party can elect any- candidate it chooses to nominate , can carry any burden , can , indeed , win at all except with a candidate who represents the progressive spirit of the party , who can lead and need not be dragged in. the contest ? The question answers itself . The party has no strength to spare to bolster a weak candidate . It needs all the strength the best of candidates can give . It can not start out with saying : " The man whom we would like to elect used to be a machine politician , and was undoubtedly ad-dicted to the vices of that class , but he 1 has since been in an exalted position and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than could have been expected . If he has not abandoned his old practices he has at least carried them on with great secrecy . It is true that he is supported and will , be nominated , if at all , by the exertions of a very disreputable lot of hack politicians , without principle , without scruple , who work for their personal advancement , and expect to be paid with office or patron- age if he is elected . But our candidate has publicly declared his devotion to the civil service reform law , and has done everything which the letter of that law required of him . It can not be proved that the corrupt machine of which he is the acknowledged boss has any pledges from him . and it is impossible to deny that he has won golden opinions from many business men . ' All things considered , he is a safe ' man , and not nearly so black as he is painted . He is not exactly a reformer ; we do n't pretend that he represents the conscience , or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courage of conviction of the Republican Party . His election would not be an inspiring event , but he is a prudent , ' conservative , " practical , ' and personally respectable ' man , and the country might go further and fare worse . " It needs no prophet to foretell the result of a campaign begun and continued in that style . On the other hand , the party can not afford to be forced to say : " We confess that our candidate has not a spotless reputation . He has been a long time in public life ; he is an aggressive ' man ; he has made a great many enemies , and there are scandals connected with his name which he has not dissipated as we should like to see him dissipate them . He has held important trusts ; he has amassed a good deal of wealth ; there are . acts of his which it requires much obtuseness to believe to have been honest acts and a good deal of charity to overlook . His own explanations of them are insufficient and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the destiny , of the American . Union on this continent are full of peril . Very probably he would , as President , be either mischievous or ridiculous , and might be both : No one knows what he believes in finance , ( except his profound belief in the money value of a Speaker 's decisions , ) and as to the revenue , we admit that he is the author of the maddest scheme that a shallow demagogue ever invented , a scheme which had only to be announced to instantly silence his most ardent admirers . But he is a sound Republican ; he can be relied on to prevent the payment of rebel war claims ; he has force ' and personal magnetism , ' and if he is surrounded by one of the most desperate gangs of adventurers this country has seen since the days of AARON BURR , that may not be his fault . " These are the ways in which the Republican Party must not begin the campaign . Suppose it should begin it with a candidate of whom it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able , sagacious , experienced , tried , spotless , disinterested . " In. that case it would win .
