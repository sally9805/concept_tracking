txt The Brooklyn Elevated Railway was vened in May last . In the preceding tnonth about 1,400,000 persons rode over ' , he bridge , or approximately double the number during the April before the fares mere reduced . In September the car receipts were $48,120 . As there are two rates of fares exactness is impossible , but there appears to have been an increase approaching half a million persons , or , my , roughly , 20 per cent . in four months . At times the passengers number over two per second one way . It took two years after the opening of the bridge to roll up ' the first 25,000,000 passengers : Up to this . time every increase of traffic has exceeded expectation , so that we will not be rash enough to estimate how many million fares will be paid in the next two years . Nor can we undertake to say what proportion these tens of millions bear to the total populations of the cities which paid for the bridge . The point we wish to make is that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built with public money , and because ( excepting possibly the Manhattan Elevated Railway ) no other enterprise comes closer to the daily life of greater multitudes . Upon these premises it appears to us reasonable to base the proposition that no private corporation should be granted a monopoly of access to the bridge . Yet that appears to be the character of the latest rapid transit enterprise in Brooklyn . The modest plan is to furnish " a con nection between the bridge railroad and a central depot " to be located in the neighborhood of Adams and Fulton streets . ' We are not very sanguine that " this scheme will harmonize all conflicting interests . " On the contrary , upon present . information it appears admirably . adapted to affront every one concerned . Every railway , for instance , must want to connect directly with the bridge and not with a railway connecting with the bridge . The effect of such indirect connection presents alternatives almost equally bad . If there is no change of cars there will be a crush and confusion of rolling stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tangle , where only two roads cross , and those two under the same management , is a hint as to what may be expected from a mingling of the traffic of several different roads . On the other hand , if the cars of the various companies are not sent over this connecting link there is a wholly unnecessary change of cars added to the journey . Every individual passenger would rightly feel aggrieved by such a nuisance , In both cases , of course , a separate toll would have to be levied and paid in some form . We heartily agree that " public necessity will be held to overbalance the opposition of merely local interests , " and we have no doubt that this proposed public improvement will be speedily accom-. plished in another shape . No one conapany , existing or projected , should be given the monopoly ' of approach to the bridge . even under cover of an asserted agreement among the railways to that effect . On the contrary , the bridge should be extended to the railway focus . There , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with economy to them and convenience to every passenger . Until the bridge reaches that strategic point its mission can only be partly accomplished , although the masses of humanity which sweep over it westward every morning and eastward every night are wonderful even now . Every man and woman of those crowds who has ever seen a map of Brooklyn knows that what is needed is the completion of the bridge , and not another rapid transit parasite which could only live by strength absorbed from travel which it would go far to lessen . No side issue should be allowed to obscure that fact , nor to complicate the plan which there is every reason to believe will be matured by the next Legislature . When such a bill was last pending we were told that the plan was too enormously expensive and too destructive of private interests . Now those loudest in such assertion are foremost in advocating the execution of the same task by private enterprise and capital .                   @ @
