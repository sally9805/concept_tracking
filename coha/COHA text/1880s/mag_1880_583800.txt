ELJHU VEDDER . WERE it possible to collect together , in a single gallery , all the pictures of an artist who has worked industriously at his profession for twenty years , it would be hard if a certain number were not admirable on one account or another . Suppose him a man of most ordinary make ; still , there will be one or two paintings out of the common , one or two which contain enough thought , enough expression of personal identity , enough individuality , to warrant a second examination . But suppose him specially endowed with a creative imagination , sportive every now and then , willful , ready , it may be , to overshoot the mark , and , at times , to disappoint his friends by crudities : comparison of all the pictures of such a painter will be sure to make a deep impression , all the more profound , perhaps , should it be felt that along with his extraordinary natural gifts run defects which hinder the full expansion of his genius . His brilliant qualities will shine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side . For have you not observed that symmetry , to be tolerable , has to belong to the very greatest of things and of men ? Seldom , nowadays , painters are found with the imaginations , grotesque but powerful , of the workmen on the Gothic cathedrals of France and Germany . Imagine one of those old sculptors of gargoyles in the thirteenth century come to life again , and submitted to the depressing influences of the haste and waste of the present day , which characterize life in the United States more completely , perhaps , than elsewhere in the world . The painter whose genius I shall try to appreciate , and whose development trace , in the following pages , sometimes appears to me such a master-workman , born in a time not quite suited to his talents , and struggling to express himself in ays that are less easy to his natural temperament than might have been of old . He is one whose pictures stand out in strong relief from those of others , the longer one passes in review the artists of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present day , does it not look as if he would stand a better chance of success in Europe , where work of the old iniaginative school has had its epoch , and still possesses its hereditary honors and emoluments , rather than in the United States , where of Gothic art next to nothing exists , save the wild absurdities of local architects ? It might look so . And yet Mr. Elihu Vedder , whose peculiar genius I would like to compare to those which accomplished the grandeurs and extravagances of Gothic art , was born in the United States , of people long settled there , and was there mainly brought up and educated in art . It is he who has painted scenes which are quite original and unexampled , whatever may be the objections to be made to them on other grounds . This holds good of his // 112 a second-rate Dusseldorf p*ainter ! A third inspection carries one back a little way toward the first stand-point , and establishes a certain equilibrium between the too favorable and too adverse opinions . How is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critic into an enthusiasm of which he had to feel ashamed ? Rome attracts the artist as naturally as a flower lures a bee . Her museums are full of statues belonging to the golden age of Hellenic art , or of copies of them hardly inferior to the originals ; her palaces contain some of the most glorious paintings finished during the intellectual epoch which reached work previous to 1870 . And even in respect to later work , it may be said that although in Europe for many years , he has never ceased to be an American ; he has even shown what may he termed extraordinary incapacity to assimilate the conventionalities of the art by which he has been surrounded . First impressions are not safe guides in anything out and out , but they often contain a germ of living truth . Coming suddenly upon an array of paintings by Mr. Vedder , the first sight is overwhelming . There seems so much thought expended upon them , so many stories are told , such strange regions of heaven and earth , of the THE CUMJEAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place of tortuous , dirty ways there are now boulevards lined with clean buildings of stucco , even in size , subdued as to tint , it is true , but grievously uniform and fatiguing to the sight . Yet these changes are only superficial . Rome remains what it was  --  a city which the artistic mind looks to as a paradise . Has not France a great palace on the Pincian for the special use of her students elect ? Is not Germany represented almost as well , and has not Spain a one new chateau , on a commanding height , for the use and encouragement of her chosen artists ? These picked men from three of the greatest nations of the world ought alone to form an " atmosphere , " a " milieu , " such as artists like to have about them . But in Rome there are Scandinavian artists ; besides , there are English , Russian , Polish . The Italians are naturally plenty , and America sends her usual number of students and professors of the fine arts ,  - -  perhaps more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a royal VOL . XXI. -8 . THE QUESTIONER OF THE SPHINX . court , with its obligatory unifor , reviews and cavalcades ; and of a papal court , shorn of its former splendor , indeed , but still forced on certain occasions to contribute something to the pageants of the year , and it is no wonder that , in the minds of all devout painters and sculptors , Rome should assume the proportions of an artistic Mecca . It is one thing to make a pilgrimage to Mecca ; another to settle there . I do not know whether it has ever occurred to any one to contrast the Italian artist who plies his profession in other countries than his own , with the foreigner who works in Italy . The expatriated Italian supplies a demand in the nation where he resides ; the foreign artist in Italy , however , sells his work in the main to his own countrymen , who are there on their travels . At first blush it may seem that , so long as an artist disposes of his work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing , however , is more untrue . It makes all the difference in the world whether he sells to persons who reflect long before they buy , and then take a picture for the // love of it , or to persons who are on the move , have plenty of money in their pocket , and are taking a rose-colored view of everything . In the former case he has exacting buyers , who are not to be caught by chaff ; in the latter he has undiscriminating purchasers , who , by large prices and frequent orders , encourage him to do undigested or slovenly work . This is the difficulty which besets the foreign artist , who , allured by the marvels of art in Rome , and delighted with the novelty , variety , and ease of life abroad , lingers on until he has *become in some sort a fixture . If he have any native force , he is sure to be too individual , too national , to become a citizen of his adoptive land ; he remains a foreigner while he loses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If he be a weak man , the results are fatal to his advance in art ; he remains stationary , if he does not actually retrograde and lapse into a mechanical fabricator of pictures or statues on a few fixed types . In art , stagnation is tantamount to degeneracy . If Mr. Elihu Vedder were of this latter class , to speak of him at all would be useless . But although he has been submitted to the influences mentioned , there has fortunately been too much that is original in his composition to allow him to succumb entirely . During and shortly after the war of secession , Mr. Vedder showed his original turn of mind in a very unmistakable fashion . He was then in the early prime of life ; his head was full of ideas ; he had seen Europe and got what could be got on a short visit , namely , suggestions . His hand was ready up to a certain point , in fact too ready , as it turns out , for his own good in the long run . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his teeming fancy , the imps and koholds , shadowy faces in clouds , original views of characters in the old mythologies . To this creative stage belong " The Lair. of the Sea-serpent , " defective only in* the absence of some object by which , approximately , the size of the monster could be measured ; " Gulnare of the Sea , " " The Djinn of the Bottle , " " The Questioner of the Sphinx , " a picture worthy of Emerson 's great poem on the same subject ; " The Roc 's Egg , " " The King of the Salamanders , " " Memory , " the exquisite little sketch called " Twilight , " and many more which the memory of the reader will supply . Here belong " The Shadow of the Cypress , " afterward amplified into " The Lost Mind , " a most noble and expressive work , which may well rank among the first paintings by Americans during the present century . Here is to be also placed " Old Mortality , " a landscape expressive of melancholy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every one of these was strictly original , but even those like the charming sketch from the fabulous lore of the Middle Ages called " The King of the Salamanders , " - which happens to be the same as the firm-mark of a Venetian publisher of the sixteenth century ,  --  and the picture of the " Medusa , " even those which are only novel applications of old ideas , bore the stamp of spontaneousness ; they were like Nathaniel Hawthorne 's play with mythological subjects-not , of course , new found , but newly arranged , newly spun . What similarity existed wa THE ROC 'S EGG . // plainly only the duplication of thought inevitable in all art , but in nowise plagiarism . And the backgrounds which Mr. Vedder loves so much , the desolate wastes , the hard , sterile mountains , and long , stern lines of plain that vanish in the distance , struck a true chord in the popular heart . The element of grandeur in them was felt at once , and felt all the more widely because , as a general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critically the methods by which they were presented . And the ideas which the figures in the landscapes suggested were in keeping with the scenegenerally easy enough to understand , but , where outside the range of the fancy of most men , so odd , that the dullest could not fail to have his curiosity stimulated and his wits set to puzzling out what the painter could have meant . And yet the fecundity of Mr. Vedder 's fancy was almost too great ; it interfered with a thorough grounding in the rudiments of his art , because what he did was so striking that even fellow-artists were ready to l ) ut aside in his case their common faultfinding in regard to technique , and agree with laymen in admiration for the idea designed . It may have been , in part , consciousness of his want in this particular that urged Mr. Vedder abroad ; certainly in i866 the severe discipline of foreign schools might well have seemed the very influence he needed most . Yet he was too firmly esgablished in his own profession , if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Atlantic and Central States had produced a large crop of landscape painters known , not entirely without a touch of malice , as the Hudson River School . Now art is like a butterfly which has crept out of its shell in the morning ; it needs sun to warm it  --  but it must not have too much . If it is forced into activity by too great heat , the chances are that its life is not long . If it be warmed gradually into activity by a judicious amount of sun and shade , then , " like a strong bird on pinions free , " as Walt Whitman sings , it launches itself for a full and strong period of existence . One hears complaints from artists that their fello*v-citizens do not encourage American work . It may be true that they do not encourage good work as they should , but it is denied that they have not been generous and even lavish in buying American pictures , such as they were . At the time we speak of , Americans were ruining American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the civil war encouraged the making of landscapes as well as figure pictures generally crude in treatment and color . As a natural result , the large and indiscriminate demand brought with it superficiality . Mr. Vedder was not entirely exempt . He was too strong to be ruined by the patronage of the ignorant rich . But no one can escape the influence of his neighbors entirely , nor of his , own countrymen , even though he expatriate himself . Even as Mr. Vedder had to suffer for the sins of his own land when he was in it , so when he is out of it he is forced to remain an American . The sturdy Hollandish race from which he springs has shown its power in tilling and enriching the great State of New York ; he himself could not make anything but an American of himself , even if he tried . Moreover , to this day , Mr. Vedder , in spite of his array of figure pictures , and of his preference for those which tell a human story directly , that is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps , but are certainly not in aim landscape , is most powerful , most unconscious , most himself , in purely landscape work , or those pictures which have landscape for a chief part of the composition . Examine , for instance , the landscape in " The Lost Mind , " and notice how much effect is produced by the background . With its severity and gloom the scene does more than assist the troubled face of the woman who is walking in the desolate spot . And so with " Old Mortality , " " The Roc 's Egg , " " The Cumiean Sibyl , " " The Siren " ; the landscape is fully as important relatively as the figures ; in " The Dead Abel " it holds a larger place than the figure of the slain man-which might be that of a sleeper as well as anything more tragic . The landscape is as striking in all these pictures as the figure itself ; in some cases it is more original and effective . And when we come to consider the newer development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is again the landscape which first attracts him . If his greatest strength is landscape , like the fellow-artists among whom he grew up , similarly his weakness was , if it be not still , drawing of the figure . It would be pleasant to think that Mr. Vedder felt this lack in his work , and went to Europe mainly for the purpose of studying the figure among men who make it their profession , and carry proficiency a great way . His powers in that direction have certainly improved , since the careful finish and good modeling found // GREEK ACTOR 'S DAUGHTER . i i6* ELIHU VEDDER. // in some of his figure studies of recent yearssuch , for instance , as the half-nude model of beautiful form who holds a cup in her hand and reflects her chin and shoulder in a glass , the easy , dignified pose and careful finish in " The Greek Tragedian 's Daughter , " the careful modeling of the nude in The Spirit of the XVater-fall , " in its larger and later edition-were certainly beyond his scope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and similar pictures with his earlier imaginative work , and see how dry and imperfect his drawing used to be , compared with what it is now . Another trait of this artist should not be forgotten , out of gratitude . Because it is found to be both easier and more profitable , many painters repeat their pictures nearly , or after the same general type , until their canvases become a weariness to the flesh . The opposite is true of this one : he has seldom repeated himself . The few cases where he has done so , apparently thinking to improve upon his first idea , prove to be variations which may possibly have some slight gain in grace , but are certainly weaker than the originals . Such are " The Young Phorkides " and " The Young Medusa . " To understand Mr. Vedder better , let us look closer at his antecedents . What intellectual life the United States possessed before the civil war had for its chief center of activity New England . From her went out the great body of earlier sculptors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a fair share . The cold and formal philosophy of New England , which strove to humanize itself all the more strenuously for the very reason that it felt its own coldness , but strove in vain , produced a cold and formal blossom in art , exhibiting a special predilection for sculpture of an unemotional and frigid kind . With these antecedents arose a school of painters , mainly of the landscape , in New York , who , finding no stimulus in the literature of New England , no criticism worth listening to , and little or no pabulum in the overwhelmingly commercial outgrowth of New York city , turned to nature with all of our national energy , but without the artistic surroundings or traditions which belong to lands having old civilizations . In the full bloom of this school , nourished on nothing better outside itself than the arid paintings of Dusseldorf , and the example of English artists settled in New York , Mr. Vedder made his appearance . After a course of drawing and landscape in a forced and formal system , he traveled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once remarked for the quickness and originality of his imagination . He seemed to have more ideas than all his fellow-artists put together ,  --  ideas , that is to say , which were striking , original , unhackneyed . It was a time of excitement and turmoil when he came back from Europe . There was more hurry in the United States than ever ; more money , apparently , being made , more false progress in literature and art . A mania for spending seized the nation , and pictures brought high prices . Is it strange that a man who felt himself possessed of unusual powers should be content with what he did , and , as long as he sold his pictures tolerably well , think little of the future ? All this while , Mr. Vedder had fQrgot that he possessed only one side of art , and that one the most dangerous , because the untutored public was dazzled by it , craved it , paid for it gladly . He had extraordinary imagination , or call it merely fancy , if you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , a writer in " L'Art " said harsh things about Mr. Vedder 's pictures at the Exposition , the attack being aggravated by the fact that permission to reproduce his work in that jotirnal had been asked as a favor , and that the engraver of the pictures was complimented at the foreign artist 's expense . One was the large painting of " The Cuma*an Sibyl , " a conception of that mythological figure quite at variance with the received notions , but eminently expressive of the character according to modern realistic ideas . The sibyl is a strange , swarthy hag , striding along with a roll of script under her arm . Her clothes are blown forward by the wind that sweeps the desolate , harsh landscape , and curl in lines suggestive of the drapery seen on the old sarcophagi at Rome . Smoke from the books which ' she has burned is also seen blowing wildly , and the whole picture is stern and strange . Per* haps nowhere else has Mr. Vedder subdued his natural leaning to the merely odd into something more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach the grand , and come but little short of the sublime . The other was his " Marsyas , " also a large picture , and still more different from the preconceived idea of the piper whom Apollo flayed . I do not remember that Marsyas has ever been represented as a satyr , with full legs of a goat , except in a fresco , of doubtful parentage , in the Borghese Palace at Rome . // one 's mind , if one is impatient of such things , and more concerned-as most artists are-. with the method rather than the story , one is led into saying  --  but surely most unjustly-that even in imagination Mr. Vedder is crude . For it is most difficult to keep separate the various impressions produced by the story , by the composition , the handling , the color . In Mr. Vedder , a painter is apt to feel the mechanism too much , and the critic , now that we have developed to so high a degree the merely J ) ainter 's side of painting , notices an awkwardness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three grades of merit which Goethe has acutely drawn . Mr. Vedder has a manner of his own , but he has still farther to go in long , patient , self-abnegating study of nature before he can consider himself fully graduated from manner into style . Nevertheless , Mr. Vedder had a right to consider Marsyas under that guise , and certainly made a very charming picture of the young satyr , distending his cheeks with his reed , while a half-score of rabbits , lured from their warren , gather around him in the snowy glade . It may be that exception should be taken to the length of leg which the satyr shows ; if he stood upright he would certainly be a person built after the general lines of a kangaroo , rather than of a human being or a four-footed beast . But for excessive length of satyrs , both ancient and medieval art may be searched for precedents not in vain . However this may be , these pictures exercised an irritating effect upon the French critic , an effect not to be understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in " L'Art . " His criticism seemed more than harsh ; it was entirely unjust , viewed from the stand-point of qwq deep and truthful painting of realists of the wh ich not only show that the mere technical qwq been with painters who lacked the gift , and that he had not in his own nature enough power in that direction to break through the double difficulty . It is therefore very satisfactory to see recent work of his which is not wanting in able combinations of color , perhaps not equal to those which the young artists of the day learn at Munich , but quite possibly all the better and more real because slowly self-taught . Considering the length of time he has been abroad , it may seem strange that a man of so much original force should not have profited more by the example of European workmen , and so left hardly a flaw to be picked by the most industrious critic . To account for such effects there may always be personal reasons belonging to the private life of the individual ; these the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others belonging to the profession which it is his duty to discover if he can . For the tardy use of his opportunities in regard to technique , and particularly for the slow development in color which Mr. Vedder shows , there is reason in abundance to be found elsewhere than in any personal matter . His residence in Rome is enough to explain them . Mecca is all very well as a place of pilgrimage , but the less you know of the residents of Mecca the better . And how much good does the reader suppose the resident artists of Rome get from the museums and public works of art ? A great deal at first , then less , then none . But put it this way How much ill does the resident artist get from the peculiar situation of Rome as a stopping-place for tourists of all nationalities , who have only one common trait , that of being able to spend some money ? Little at first , then more , then a great deal . Thus , as the advantages of Rome in a prolonged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relates to one side of artistic life , the practi&amp;al and commercial . Take another . Rome , although the Eternal City , the center of Catholism , and the capital of Italy , is not on the highway of development to-day . She sits apart on her seven hills , full of new youth , it is true , and admirably determined to struggle once more for the first rank in the arts and sciences . But long arrearages will have to be made up before she can compete , as a milieu for artists , with Paris , Munich , London , New York . She must always be visited , in order that the artist shall see masterpieces of classic art and architecture . But she is no longer in the current . Rome is therefore a poor place to make one 's work in , and a poor place in which to sell it . Rome is also inferior as a place in which to learn the finishing touches of the profession ; it is especially no place in which to study color . A born colorist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hues of the Campagna and its encircling hills , in the somber walls , gray stretches of aqueduct and green-brown orchards of olive , the most subtile effects , and can extract from Italian scenery as much color as the eye can bear . But learners are not given trigonometry before they reach vulgar fractions , and the secrets of Italian coloring are too recondite for any but the greatest masters . It may be said to offer too many problems to the painter , rendering him confused at the choice presented , and , unless he has pushed the delicate mechanism of his art to its very farthest mark , at a loss what among so many fine shades and distinctions of hue to abandon and what to keep . The Italian artists with whom foreigners are likely to come in contact are far from being colorists . I do not say that Italy nowadays produces no colorists . It would be hard to select any one thing in the fine arts and not find that branch represented in Italy by some one of very much more than respectable attainments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exhibition at Turin to convince oneself that the charge of want of taste brought against the modern Italians is quite unfounded . On the contrary , it is just the high average of good taste which forms the distinctive beauty of the exhibition , rather than any vivid examples of genius . And among the painters are those disciples of the school called after Fortuny , who , living for the most part in Naples and Rome , fairly run riot in brilliant color . There may be difference of opinion as to whether these carnival painters are true colorists or not ; at any rate , they show that not all the Italian artists are lacking in the sense . But , for the most part , formality and sterility seem to have them still in their clutches , as is , indeed , likewise the case so largely with us , with the Germans , with the English , the French . Among painters of this kind it is only too easy for a foreigner of talent to feel at ease . He is riot molested in his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art , since such technical excellence as his Italian friends exhibit is more than outweighed by the coldness of their // work and their want of novelty in design . So that , as regards the influence of Italian art in general upon the foreign workman , it may be said that , like the color of Italian cities and landscapes , in results it has little that is living and striking , little that insists upon being loved or copied . Like the bulk of modern French art , it has a monotony , a certain hardness . Perhaps both of these may be explained by a want of boldness . Italy does not present vivid contrasts of color , and her artists , with the exception of certain Neapolitans and their followers , seem to be afraid to paint even as vividly as the nature about them might warrant . Moreover , what with the restraint they exercised in the use of color , and the subduing effects of time , even the great masters are of use mainly as standards and suggestions to graduates in the art . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in art matters , especially in regard to the old masters . Suffice it to give as an opinion that neither Italian landscape , modern art nor THE LOST MIND . // teaching has the vital quality which brings out to the best advantage the genius or talent latent in painters or sculptors . This is not to say that the future may not have a quite different account to give . But of today it seems to me so true that it stands for one of the chief reasons why foreign artists , settled in Italy long , lose headway in their profession , and become fixed in manner instead of developing into style . Mr. Vedder also occasionally shows traces of the influence of the pre-Raphaelite movement , a movement by no means confined to England , but probably reaching America through British rather than German or Italian channels . It has left a hint of consciousness in many of his figures , notably in that long panel with many figures called , if I remember rightly , " A Florentine Festa , " and the scene by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a stately fashion , dancing , or looking out to sea . They have an air of posing like that which we see so often among the pre-Raphaelites , and if it be not the same as theirs in pitch , is still unfortunate where it occurs at all . It may seem to the reader that very little space is bestowed upon pointing out the beauty of this artist 's work compared to that employed in criticising it and accounting for its defects . But , in the first place , this paper is not meant for a eulogy . Notices of that kind are only calculated to please the artist  --  and they please him only relatively and for a time . In the second place , Mr. Vedder does not need-as indeed what really fine artist does ?  --  the aid of words to call attention to what he himself says in his pictures with far more intensity . But thirdly , Mr. Vedder 's temperament and the circumstances surrounding his career are too interesting to be passed over with the usual string of empty compliments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of artists suffering the effects of just his circumstances , without , it is to be feared , his capacity to get the better of them . Artists are continually mistaking the praise of uncritical friends for true gold , and evading the qualified approval of those who know , because the latter does not warm them enough . It is better to let the able engravers and printers tell how fine a genius we have in Mr. Vedder by showing the pictures themselves , so far as black and white can show them , and reserve the text for such examination of their weak points as may be discov * Reprinted from ScRIBNER for JGne , 1879. // erable , trusting that the mere discussion of such questions , if the conclusions themselves be ever so valueless , will prove suggestive to artists and amateurs . In the opinion of the writer , Mr. Vedder needs to look to impressionism for the next step in his profession . This may seem strange advice to those who regard impressionists as artists who , too lazy to make serious study of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bravura and trickery . There may be such men among them , but that the serious and thoughtful artists called impressionists are not of the number is quite certain . What Mr. Vedder would gain by impressionism is just that freedom from stiffness and coldness which forms the charm of the impressionist ; he might possibly render delicate , and render mobile , the vehicles of his conceptions in the manner which we see in the work of Mr. Whistler . The latter , for instance , is a fine contrast to Mr. Vedder , possessing , as he does , the artistic instinct to his very finger-tips , and yet apparently lacking entirely the creative , the solidly imaginative side , if I may be allowed the expression , which is the chief force of Mr. Vedder . What Mr. Vedder has already done is to turn more seriously than before to realism . All that is asked is that he shall go farther over into the domain of impressionism , and see if in that field there is not something which will break up what remains of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfortunate early associations . Instead of learning first to paint in the way in which painters now must , and then bringing in his ideas , he has poured out his ideas before learning to paint in the highest sense . Is this a crime ? Is it even a misfortune ? The man is bold who is ready to say that it is even to be deplored . For there is many an artist who starts with plenty of ideas in his head , but , by too narrow and too narrowing a devotion to technique , stultifies himself in some occult way . The longer one looks at art , the plainer it seems that dogmas as to art education are pitfalls . One man proceeds best from ideas to workmanship , from the general to the particular . Another would be wrecked by that passage , and finds that , for him , the only safe course is in working from paint to thought , from the particular to the general . It is evident that Mr. Vedder belongs to the former category . What a grand conception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a landscape ( in which the desert is represented with his usual truth ) , go the Magi . But the terrestrial scene is surpassed by the celestial . A shadowy circle of cloud figures are grouped about a brilliant light in their center , from which a stream of fiery vapor descends straight down to the plain , to indicate the spot where Christ is born . What a fine sense of distance and desolation in " The Last Sun-worshiper , " and what a combination of the horror of dgsert and sea-shore in the " Siren " ! A small sketch of the " Crucifixion " contains a good idea . The dead , walking in the crowd of cloaked Jews , Arabs , and Romans , are just beginning to be noticed by the living . As they pass , wrapped in their long mantles , some of the multitude start , others are horror-struck , convinced that specters are beneath , but many are quite unconscious . In the distance are Calvary and the crosses . Mr. Vedder is also a humorist , once in a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A series of panel sketches in oil show very amusingly the vicissitudes of the famous man of old who took people 's advice too quickly in regard to his donkey , and ended by losing the beast outright . Perhaps Mr. Vedder means in this series to make one common portrait of all his critics and advisers in art . Another brace of panels show three medieval jesters having a musical picnic near a stream , and luring several plump naiads out of the water ; their flirtations are rudely broken up by the sudden appearance of Triton astride of a dolphin , and winding his " wreath*d horn " in the faces of the terrified clowns . Good as the " Cumrean Sibyl " is , a sketch for another Sibyl " is better in some regards . The latter sits on a rough spit of land surrounded by water , and lets the wind blow her unheeded writings far away to sea . The drapery and movement of the sketch are most telling . It is not a bit of humor , like the foregoing , unless , indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sibyl , " the critic , whose advice is taken very much in the same way as was that of the wise women of old . Mr. Vedder is still a young man , considering the length of time needed to perfect oneself in art . He has a vigorous and prolific genius , and shows the most encouraging signs of knowing what his present condition lacks . His worst enemy heretofore was the chorus of admirers who were led astray by the impressiveness of his ideas . His worst now is a trait common to great talents , and rudely represented by the term laziness , for want of a better . But it is not common laziness I mean . It is the laziness of genius , laziness of quality , not of quantity . It is not a question of the number of hours a day such a man works , but of his will to concentrate himself to work with intensity . That is Mr. Vedder 's complaint at present , unless appearances greatly deceive . As to the anomaly which we see in his work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unimaginative well done , I trust to have found the reason in the fact that Mr. Vedder belongs to two epochs in AN OLD SAINT .
