Tins gentleman , a New Englander by birth , came to the West when a youth . A man of fine intellect and rare culture , he had a cold , unimpulsive temperament , that gave to his manners a dignified reserve that repelled familiarity , and interfered materially with his popularity . His fine presence , for he was tall , erect and admirably proportioned , with his grave manner , impressed the crowd , and created respect without liking . These qualities are , however , more potent in the end than more genial ones . Many a statesman , honored in his grave , owed his success in life to the prima facie evidence of wisdom , so acceptable to the popular mind , that is found in silent gravity . The late Tom Corwin , of Ohio , a man of genius and infinite humor , on one occasion , when lecturin* me for my disposition to joke with a crowd , said : " Do n't do it , my boy . You should always remember that the crowd looks up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which amuses . The clown is the more clever fellow of the two , but he is despised . If you would succeed in life , you must be solemn , solemn as an ass . All the great monuments of earth have been built over solemn asses . " Salmon P. Chase was anything but a solemn ass . His intellectual attainments put him at the head of his profession , that of lawyer , before they made him conspicuous as a politician . He was a hard student , and his thoughtful processes assimilated , well and rapidly , the information he acquiied . Looking at Chase through life , and regarding his characteristics since his death , I find now , as I found when we were friends , a mystery in the fact that he was ever a reformer . For his motive for action was not in his heart . He had no impulses of that sort that I could ever discover . The elevated plane upon which he guided his life , a singularly pure and just one , came of his stern sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no youth . He // was born an old man in that respect , and had no heartfelt impulses to impel him to indiscretions . He never used tobacco in any form , nor wine , save as social decorum called for its use . He had passion without sentiment , and when he married it was with more regard for the proprieties of life than the gratification of a lover 's mad impulse ; and herein lies the contradiction that makes him a mystery . He had a high regard for these proprieties of life , and none whatever for the law . Now reform is not reputable . Intrenched wrong finds its most powerful defense in its respectability . They who seek to undermine the respectable are low fellows , and the very name assumed by the reformer becomes one of reproach . Long after the death of our Saviour , to be called a Christian was to have applied a term of fearful stain which justified immediate and shameful death , as cruel and shameful as that awarded our God by the respectable classes of Jerusalem . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-slavery cause , he was called an abolitionist . He might as well , considering the effect , have been denounced as a thief or a burglar . His reputable friends ( and having married into a wealthy and aristocratic family , he had many such ) looked down on him with pity and contempt . Chase , in his shy , awkward way , cultivated young men remarkable for their evidences of intellect or show of eccentricity . I was one of his prot6g6s . I wijte this without claiming any compliment on that score . One defect in this eminent statesman was his ignorance of human pature . He did not know one man from another , save in the man 's professions . He took those very men at the valuation acquaintance put on them . This ignorance added greatly to his success ; for we lose more through our suspicions than we cain through our credulousness . We are given to the strange belief that back of every man 's act lies a selfish motive , and this , although we are taught by a study of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from circumstances over which we h8ve no control , or from both , and seldom , if ever , from a cold , calculating consideration of how we may use others to our own advantage . At the same time , Chase 's confidence gave his upright character its only taint in the eyes of the world . He had around him , from first to last , about the worst set of men that ever environed a leader , and these gave interpretation to many of his acts . These fellows , of course , used him to enrich // or elevate themselves , and the people at large held their master responsible . On this matter of good or bad human nature Mr. Chase could reason , in a general way , with the terse epigrammatic force so peculiar to him , without being able to make personal application of his knowledge . I remember , for example , visiting the Ohio penitentiary with him while he was governor of the State . Returning , we walked to the Capitol . After a long silence the governor said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in those walls and the ordinary run of people outside . " This did not surprise me , for I had long before learned my friend 's character blindness ; but when he continued I was surprised : " These poor fellows are not wicked , they are weak ; they have not sense enough to be cautious , nor have they enough strength of character to resist temptation . The law catches the small rogues ; the big rascals are too wary to approach the net . I think sometimes that our criminals are not in the penitentiary , but in the churches . The cool , selfish villains wear the cloak of religion , and hedge themselves about with the intensest respectability . They are our bad men , and from them we suffer . " " Yes , " I added ; " that was the sort that crucified Christ . He suffered not for his treason , but that he was a low person-the associate of the poor , and an agrarian who taught that property was continuous theft , before that Frenchman made his discovery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aristocrats of that day and placo , just sicken&amp; over such vulgar notions . " " You do wrong , " said my faend , " to habituate yourself , as I perceive you do , to vulgarizing the great truths of r.evelation . It was an awful event , let the motives and passions of poor human nature have been what they may . We should see only our Christ crucified , and not the horrible crowd that did the deed without knowing what they did . " Here was no cant , not the slightest shade of hypocrisy in this rebuke . Chase was truly of a deep religious nature . He believed with the trusting faith of a child in the truths of revelation , not as an abstract thing separate and apart from his daily life . It colored all his character , and entered into the most minute details of his life . In common with half a dozen other young men admitted to the bar , but not admitted to legal practice , I had the honor of Chase 's intimacy , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which we sought to protect him . Of all shades of political opinion save that of anti-slavery , we felt a sorrow that our great man should be engaged in such a vile business as acting and laboring with abolitionists . To us , as to the community generally , an abolitionist was not only a negro thief , but an associate of negroes and a disturber of the peace . None the less did we cling to and seek to give Mr. Chase our protection . He was to speak one night at a little school-house some four miles from Cincinnati , and notice had been served on him that if he did , he would be mobbed . This had no effect on Chase . He was a brave man , , and a threat of violence only made him the more determined to fill his appointment . Find&gt;* our persuasion of no effect , we armed ourselves and made part of the little crowd assembled in the school-house to hear the anti-slavery advocate . Save ourselves , the audience was mostly made up of the longhaired men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was small and lighted by a few tallow dips , which flared and sputtered from the air through the open windows ; for it was summer . The meeting being organized , Mr. Chase was introduced and began his argument . He was not a fluent speaker , and had a voice more guttural than resonant . With few gestures , he spoke in an even , unemotional way , as if addressing a court . He got little aid from the expression of his fine face , for being extremely nearsighted , he had a way of contracting his eyelids , as if he were turning his sight in on himself . He had uttered but few sentences , however , before a wild yell from outside , which seemed to go up prom every quarter , startled the little audience , and immediately several eggs were thrown in , with great force , through the windows . The audience rose to its feet , the women screamed , more in wrath than fear , and the men gave utterance to more profanity than I thought the fanatical were capable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our pistols right and left , doing no harm that I ever heard of , but putting the ruffians so effectually to flight that we had no further interruption of that sort . Pistols were things not counted on by the crowd accustomed to ride over abolitionists without resistance . When we returned to the house , Mr. Chase was wiping a rotten egg from his bosom with a delicate linen handkerchief , and he then went on with his speech with no other sign upon him than a heightened color on his handsome face . Through this sort of thing a refined , dignified gentleman // came up to be recognized , in the end , as the able leader , if not orator , of a party destined to conduct a great war , and control the government for a quarter of a century after . How he came to be un abolitionist in the first instance , is as strange as that , in the end , he should be thrust aside by the party that he had done so much to make possible . It was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Gincinnati , that the Republican party of to-day was born . Doctor Gamaliel Bailey , a man remarkable for his combination of thought ? nd action , called the little group of strong men together . There were present Chase , Birney , Lewis , and others whose names I have forgotten , and before them Doctor Bailey laid his plan of an organization . He said it was absurd to have a party outside of the con*titution making war on the government itself . While the organic law might be a compact with hell , it could not be successfully assailed in an open rebellion . The proper course was to accept the guarantees of the constitution as to slavery in the States , but to oppose its extension . This in the end would be the death of the iniquity , for as slave labor exhausted the soil it lived on , more territory was as necessary for its existence as the air we breathe . This shrewd proposition was at once adopted by the leading minds of the anti-slavery class . The fanatics , however , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Whig and Democratic parties . It was not until the fight grew fierce over Kansas and Nebraska that the rank and file swung into line , and , by holding the balance between the evenly-divided parties , as to numbers , became a power in the land . I have often thought since , that , had the Southern slaveholders possessed the ability which distinguished these early abolitionists , what a different result we would be putting to record . If , instead of setting up a government of their own , these Southern leaders had fought for what they were pleased to term their rights , under the constitution and the flag of our Union , they would have had the sympathy of a majority of the North , and the co-operation of nearly the entire Democratic party on the free side of Mason and Dixon 's line . But when they seceded into a confederacy , threw out an alien flag , and fired on Sumter , they changed the issue from a question of States rights , under the constitution , to an armed conflict between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to save or destroy slavery , but to save or destroy the nation . // This was Chase 's thought , as well as my own . I have often heard him say that we owed more to Jefferson Davis for his folly than to Abraham Lincoln for his cautious wisdom . The Whig party that was born of the old Federal organization and Henry Clay , and had great men and great measures , without principles other than a conservatism of property privileges , went to pieces , and the anti-slavery organization fell heir to its votes . Before this , however , Chase , holding the balance of power , was first made Senator and afterward Governor of Ohio . That man is great who rises successfully to the emergency in which he is called to act . Chase , in the Senate , represented nobody save Morse and Townsend , the two pivotal votes on which he was returned ; but his dignity and power made his sovereign State glad to recognize him as her Senator , at a time when our House of Lords held the highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as now , an incompetent collection of millionaires . As governor , he not only consolidated and held the Whig vote , but he drew over a large Democratic support of young men glad to recognize a leader of such brain and power . When the newly-organized party met at Chicago to nominate a Presidential candidate , Chase stood prominent as an available man . The Seward party , fighting Chase , fortunately opened the way to the nomination of Abraham Lincoln . President Lincoln called Chase to the Cabinet as Secretary of the Treasury . This was a casualty . Had Mr. Lincoln known of the war that was to follow his inauguration , it is not likely that he would have selected a man so entirely ignorant of finance , and all that pertains to that vexed business , as this man who had never given the subject a thought , let alone any study . An illustration of this is found in the secretary calling in the good Father Edward Purcell , of Cincinnati , to advise with him as to what measures were the best to carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strangely intrusted to his untried hands ! The Secretary of the Treasury proved an eminent secretary , on the fact I see demonstrated every day ; and that fact is that the man is the most successful in the business which he knows the least about . The man who buys to gratify his own taste , is the man who will be his own only customer when it comes to selling again . The ignorant man , seeking to cater to the tastes and wants of his patrons , is eager to learn and open to all information in that // direction . The manager of a theatre who does not know Shakespeare from iDion Boucicault , and looks to the box-office for guidance on the stage ; the bookseller , ignorant of the inside of all books , who looks solely to the purchaser of books ; the editor who writes down to the depraved tastes of the multitude ; the shoemaker who looks to the corns and bunions of his buyers instead of his own , are all illustrations of what I say . Salmon P. Chase not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listened with inexhaustible patience to the practical financiers , who knew less on the subject that made their business than any other class of men in the country . The war came on . It was the costliest war ever known to a civilized people , for we had to pay cash for our experience . To get up a regiment called for as much money as to govern a State - not less than a million dollars per year for each thousand men . To put an army of seventy-five thousand armed men into the field , and to keep them there , bid fair to bankrupt the government . The secretary , in this awful emergency , found at his back an empty treasury and a ruined credit . There was no time to levy and collect taxes , and , had there been , the secession of the Southern States carried out our great staple on which our wonderful prosperity had been built , and the artillery that shot down our flag at Sumter utterly prostrated the business of the country . The only way open was to borrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Washington . Capital is not only sensitive to danger , but from that very fact is selfish , and with no touch whatever of patriotism . We read of noble women contributing their jewelry to a cause , of pious men of God melting their bells into cannon , but we never read of money-getters fetching out their hidden bags under patriotic impulse in aid of a forlorn hope . The country was aroused to a frenzy by the insolence of the South in firing on the flag of the Fathers , and men-God bless them ! - volunteered to fight in such numbers that the government found difficulty in enrolling and arming them . Capital was also vociferous . It took the iron-bound oath of allegiance at all hours . It made speeches of much sound , if not eloquence , urging men to volunteer , but no man brought out his hoarded gold to aid the struggling government in its hour of peril . The able Secretary lost no time in appeals to the Shylocks . He // turned to the noble , patriotic people , who were wheeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the credit he needed , and issued the greenback . A history of this transaction is curiously illustrative of the two men , Lincoln and Chase , concerned therein . Of course , the idea of issuing money directly by the government to meet an emergency was as old as governments themselves . But Amasa Walker , a distinguished financier of New England , had a thought that was new . He suggested that the notes thus issued directly from the government to the people , as currency , should bear interest . This for the purpose not only of making the notes popular , but for the purpose of preventing inflation by inducing people to hoard the notes as an investment when the demands of trade failed to call them into circulation as a currency . This idea struck Mr. David Taylor , of Ohio , with such force that he sought Mr. Lincoln and urged him to put the project into immediate execution . The President listened patiently , and at the end said , " That is a good idea , Taylor , but you must go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and has time to consider your proposition . " Taylor sought the Secretary of the Treasury , and laid before him Amasa Walker 's plan . Chase heard him through in a cold , unpleasant manner , and then said : " That is all very well , Mr. Taylor , but there is one little obstacle in the way , that makes the plan impracticable , and that is the constitution . " Saying this , he turned to his desk as if dismissing both Mr. Taylor and his proposition at the same moment . The poor enthusiast felt rebuked and humiliated . He returned to the President , however , and reported his defeat . Mr. Lincoln looked at the would-be financier , with the expression at times so peculiar to his homely face , that left one in doubt as to whether he was jesting or in earnest . " Taylor , " he exclaimed , " go back to Chase and tell him not to bother himself about the constitution . Say that I have that sacred instrument here at the White House , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taylor demurred to this , on the ground that Mr. Chase showed by his manner that he knew all about it , and did n't wish to be bored by any suggestion . " We 'll see about that , " exclaimed the President , and taking a card from the table , he wrote upon it , " The Secretary of the // Treasury will please consider Mr. Taylor 's proposition . We must have money , and I think this a good way to get it . A. Lincoln . " Armed with this , the real father of the greenbacks again sought the Secretary . He was received more politely than before , but was cut short in his advocacy of the measure by a proposition for both of them to see the President . They did so , and Mr. Chase made a long and elaborate constitutional argument against the proposed measure . " Chase , " said Mr. Lincoln , after the Secretary had concluded , " down in Illinois I was held to be a pretty good lawyer , and I believe I could answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel called upon to do it . This thing reminds me of a story I read in a newspaper the other day . It was of an Italian captain , who run his vessel on a rock and knocked a hole in her bottom . He set his men to pumping , and he went to prayers before a figure of the Virgin in the bow of the ship . The leak gained on them . It looked at last as if the vessel would go down with all on board . The captain , at length , in a fit of rage , at not having his prayers answered , seized the figure of the Virgin and threw it overboard . Suddenly the leak stopped , the water was pumped out , and the vessel got safely into port . When docked for repairs , the statue of the Virgin Mary was found stuck headforemost in the hole . " " I do n't see , Mr. President , the precise application of your story , " said Mr. Chase . " Why , Chase , I do n't intend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I mean the constitution , but I will stick it in the hole if I can . These rebels are violating the constitution to destroy the Union ; I will violate the constitution , if necessary , to save the Union ; and I suspect , Chase , that our constitution is going to have a rough time of it before we get done with this row . Now , what I want to know is whether , constitution aside , this project of issuing interest-bearing notes is a good one . " " I must say , " responded Mr. Chase , " that with the exception you make , it is not only a good one , but the only way open to us to raise money . If you say so , I will do my best to put it into immediate and practical operation , and you will never hear from me any opposition on this subject . " The people eagerly accepted the loan , which the capitalists were prompt to depreciate and dishonor . No one can measure correctly the masterly management of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulties that beset his ways . The intense selfishness of this class , that owed its all to the government he was struggling to sustain , bid fair to be more fatal to us than all the armed legions of the South , fierce and valiant as they were . While our soldiers in the field , and the labor left at home , accepted the greenback at par , hungry , unpatriotic capital higgled over its marble counters , discounting the currency that was the life-blood of our government . It was not until after the fortunes of war took a turn and the " Lost Cause " through exhaustion staggered from fields that were disasters to it , although shouted over as victories , that the money power came out cautiously at first , not in aid of the Government , but to invest for a profit . Government bonds were bought with greenbacks got at a ruinous discount , and these same bonds were pledged for redemption in coin . I write this without feeling against the capitalist . We must take the world as it is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as any other objectionable factor the necessity for the existence of which is a mystery . He does live , but his living was a sad obstacle in the way of success to our imperiled nationality . To appreciate , as I have said , the eventual triumph of Salmon P. Chase , we must know and appreciate the capitalist . The peculiar power , the sacredness , that attaches to money , in the eyes of men , has always been a mystery to me . Now , it is accepted as the right of government , when threateued with violence , to go to the poor man 's hut and bid him come out and shoulder his musket to fight for his government . The poor fellow , with more or less tearful leaving of the family of which he is the humble bread-winner  --  and without waiting to negotiate a gold-bearing bond-marches out to be killed or mutilated , with no other compensation than his miserable pittance , that , if wounded , attenuates into a pension if his government survives . If killed , there is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heart thrills to the memory of the noble response our poor men made to this demand ! One remembers those broadshouldered , handsome fellows , in the bloom of life , crowding the cars in laughter , amid the roll of drums , the waving of banners , with flowers thrown to them from trembling hands , and farewell smiles that covered aching hearts . And one remembers how they returned in wooden boxes , or limped home with mangled bodies , // or never returned , but filled unknown graves in far-off battle-fields . One recalls , too , the desolation that was like a low wailing undertone to the strains of triumph all over the land . Well , if the government , in this way , can take the poor man 's life , can it not take the rich man 's money ? What is there so sacred about this thing that it must be guarded above life ? What is it in gold that the blood-stain does not tarnish , and why is it that what God shuts out from heaven as accursed should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this as demagogism , as insincere and not true . iDoes not capital pay the taxes ? Does not capital give these soldiers their wages and insure them their pensions ? No , it does nothing of the sort , and you add insult to injury by the assertion . For a thousand years the wisest lawmakers have been striving to make accumulated capital pay its share of taxation , and they are as near the impossible now as when they began . As well try to make the pyramid support itself on its apex . Taxation reaches down to the base ; the base is labor , and labor pays all . The man riding to mill on a sack of grain does not relieve the horse under him by shifting the sack , even if he transfers it to his shoulder . The sons of the men who went out to fight are paying the debt that grew out of their fathers ' service , are paying the pensions , and , more than all , are paying for bonds that have in fact been paid twice over before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the government labored can be given than the creation of the national banks . To bring these moneyed corporations , the banks , into accord with , not to say support of , l*he government that gives them protection , the most extraordinary privileges were granted them . To farm out the fiscal agency found in the creation of a circulating medium was no new thing , but to permit these corporations to purchase government bonds in depreciated currency , at a heavy discount , and then accept the same bonds at par as a basis for a circulating medium , was an arrangement that nothing but the poverty and distress of the treasury could justify . Secretary Chase claimed , in extenuation , that he meant this to be only a war me&amp;iure , to cease when the armed conflict ended . That this extraordinary system rests entirely on the indebtedness of the government , and must cease when that indebtedness is paid , gives plausibility to his plea . // A national debt , however , of the magnitude of that left us by the war , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the consequence of his blunder , and that a costly and oppressive system of banking had been fixed upon the people for all time to come . It had a certain hold upon tfre favor of business men , from a false contrast that it offered between our present system and that of the old State banks which preceded it . This contrast is false , for the evil complained of in the banks of a State 's creation was not in the legitimate banking they did , but in the currency they issued and on which they did their business . These were notes of the banks authorized by the States , and were at a heavy discount beyond the limits of their several territories . The war which obliterated State lines that existed under the old colonial superstition of sovereignty gave us a nation and a nation 's credit for a currency . The national banks are precisely the same as the old State banks-no better , no worse ; but the currency in which their business is done differs , and in this difference lies the benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had inflicted upon the people he had served , and his anxiety to secure the presidency originated in his earnest desire to correct this one great blunder of his administration . He had called into existence a financial system , that instead of being firm , uniform , and safe , lived on a fluctuation which swings continually from one extreme to the other , and is , therefore , uncertain , unstable , and dangerous . To understand this , it is necessary to recognize the fact that money , as a measure of value , is an abstract idea made practical by the government . Based on coin , it gets its use through the stamp or sanction of the government . The trading world , in the ages past , selected the material through which to express this idea of valuea material which above all others has a quality that prohibits its use as a circulating medium , and this is its scarcity . Were coin , gold and silver , abundant enough to serve as a currency , it would lose its great quality and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then , coins and stamps the precious metal , it merely takes the necessary step to keep alive the visible symbol of an abstract proposition . Money for circulation , through which exchange is facilitated , like all other commodities , is measured by the great measure of value . When therefore a note , of the value of one dollar , is issued , // it is not itself the dollar , for we read on it a promise to pay that amount , and its value rests on the credit of the government making the issue . In this the government does not differ from the individual . If the people have confidence , the promises of the government pass at par ; if not , they fall below until , like the old Continental paper , or that of the Southern Confederacy. they cease to possess any value whatever . It is , therefore , a popular delusion which tells us that the scarcity or abundance of this circulating medium affects prices . It is the paper that is fluctuating and not the products . We , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that during our greatest depression in business there is a heavier volume of currency out than when trade is active and the times prosperous . The government , in its ordinary expenditures , may issue promises to pay as money , to the fullest extent , without creating trade or restoring confidence . A man may have his coffers stored with gold , let alone greenbacks , and he will not use five dollars to purchase a barrel of flour until he can see where that barrel can be placed at a profit . What we mean by the evil of a swollen or a contracted currency is the evil of an over-stimulated or depressed credit . And this power we have placed in the hands of a few corporations . All our business is done on credit , from the greenback of the government to the book account of the grocer . Now , were trade dependent on the actual wants of the community , it would be in a measure stable , uniform , and safe . To stimulate this in a healthy manner the natural greed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as artificial stimulation , and such a thing as gambling , and herein lies the evil of farming out the credit of the government to a few corporations . It is in accori. with their selfish interests to stimulate credit when trade is healthy and active , as it is their safety to contract when over-excited speculation ends and pay-day arrives . Now , while a man will not employ five dollars in the purchase of a barrel of flour until satisfied that he can sell at a profit , he may be induced to believe that a profit will be found in the future , or , what is more common , to make one of a combination which , controlling the market , can force a profit . It is the duty of a government to give the people a circulating medium , and this to the fullest extent of its credit . Mr. Chase // saw this fact , and in it the error of his act in creating the national banks ; but he never could divest his mind of the popular confusion about money as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Chief-Justice of the Supreme Court , he joined the majority in deciding that notes of the government were not legal tenders under our constitution . Whether unconstitutional or not , to one 's common sense the absurdity of the conclusion confounds him . What the government issues the government is bound to receive , and that which the government deals in as money is , of necessity , money . A man of culture seldom fairly appreciates the mind , however strong , that has not passed through the ripening process of educational training . This fact stood between Chase and Lincoln . The secretary felt rather than saw the superiority of his President , and attributed the masterful control of the greater man to the power of his higher position . In addition to this , Salmon P. Chase was the only member of the Cabinet who was shocked at the coarse humor of their chief . The Secretary of the Treasury had little of this quality in him , and the little he possessed was a refined sort quite foreign to the indelicate , coarse wit of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the Cabinet was called together to consider the Emancipation Proclamation , the President opened proceedings by reading to the amazed secretaries nearly all of Artemus Ward 's book , then just published . All the Cabinet , except Mr. Chase , laughed loudly over Artemus , and the President , looking in the face of his solemn Secretary , persisted , and with his constitutional advisers , laughed more boisterously than ever . The fact had come to be recognized , by President and Cabinet , that Chase 's disturbed condition was in itself a source of amusement , and Mr. Lincoln seldom lost an opportunity to entertain himself and others in this direction . Some of these occasions both Stanton and Chase related to me , the one in an aggrieved tone , and the other between bursts of laughter , and the reader may judge of their sort when I state that scarcely one would bear printing . To these small matters may be attributed Chase 's withdrawal from the Cabinet . The place was not only overladen with heavy responsibility , but rendered irksome by the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the labors and success // of his subordinates . All that Chase , St*anton , and Seward accomplished in their several departments was taken as a matter of course , and something by no means unusual . He expended no anxiety on the cares of his own position , lost no sleep , nor appetite , nor flesh , under the enormous weight placed upon his shoulders , and he could not comprehend why his subordinates should be troubled by a sense of responsibility , or seek comfort in praise . Salmon P. Chase has been severely commented on for what is called his intriguing against his chief for the place of President . This is unjust . To seek the presidency is an honorable ambition , and Chase not only felt under no obligation to the man he honestly believed he had made a success , but his ambition was stimulated by the loftiest patriotism . He knew that unless he continued to hold command of the system of finance he had introduced , that system would cause more evil in time of peace than it had accomplished good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wisdom of his prophecy . To-day , the government is kept on a war-footing by the very measures Chase inaugurated to end the war . In addition to this , our Secretary saw the evil of an irresponsible military rule , which Seward and Stanton , under sanction of the President , had made possible . Chase never approved of this arbitrary power in which his associates delighted , nay rioted . " We are doing more to destroy self-government by these arbitrary arrests and illegal punishments in the North than the Confederates of the South in their attempt to wipe us out as a nation . " " Again , " he said , " the evil of war comes after the war ; it leaves an army of cripples , an army of thieves , and an army of prostitutes . We shall suffer more from West Point than we have suffered from the rebellion . The taste for military glory will give us a succession of military imbeciles for rulers . " Having succeeded to all that made him eminent through independent votes based on Democratic doctrines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He nearly succeeded . A drunken harangue , made by an eminent democrat the night before the nomination , lost him Ohio , and just enough votes to insure defeat . The elevation of this troublesome subordinate to the position of Chief-Justice of the United States Supreme Court is generally // attributed by thoughtful minds to Mr. Lincoln 's shrewdness in thus shelving a dangerous rival . I do not concur in this . Abraham Lincoln felt no fear of a civilian . He did have a wholesome regard for the military men the war had brought to the front , and the one man of all others he was careful to keep from that front , was the first idol of the Free-Soil , afterward Republican party , John C. Fremont . He recognized in the popular pathfinder a man of genius , who to a thoughtful mind added the qualities which go to make a leader of men . He sent Chase from the noisy arena of the political world to the solemn quiet of our highest court , with no other thought than that which generally actuated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The real biographer of this great man will regret that the subject was ever called to other duty than that which he last adorned . Salmon P. Chase had , to an eminent degree , a judicial mind and temperament . He heard with patience and judged with impartiality the testimony of all sides , and , to a quick appreciation of the truth , he added the highest courage to judge and determine . He found the silk robes of this high office only after the care which kills had sapped the most precious vitality of his perfect physique . What he might have done as a jurist in his prime may be learned from what he accomplished as ChiefJustice in his decline . His stay upon the bench was brief , but long enough to leave on the annals of the court the name of the one rival of the great Chief-Justice Marshall . No account of Salmon P. Chase is complete without reference to his domestic life . It made , if not the larger , . certainly the more important and more graceful part . Married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after marriages the fair women he had selected , and , tenderly devoted to his household , he lived to be both father and mother to the two charming girls , in whose sunny presence he seemed to garner all the peace and comfort he possessed on earth . No one can remember him , who knew him at all , separate and apart from the daughter who , inheriting his intellect and force of character , added the charm of tact and womanly beauty that made his home a salon , where the gracious being , queenly in her deportment and popular in her sweet condescension , wielded an influence strange to this coarse American world of ours . This lovely and accomplished woman lived in her father , sharing alike his cares and his ambitions . She seemed to // die in his death ; for her brilliant career clouded intopersonaland domestic sorrow from the date of his funeral , so that the sad event is doubly sorrowful , and on the monument to his memory we may write a double epitaph .
