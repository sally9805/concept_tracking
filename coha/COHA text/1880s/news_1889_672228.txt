txt The telegram reporting that . all Americans are to be expelled from China does not embody a fact of the greatest intrinsic importance , since there are only 1,022 Americans in China , including all ages , sexes , and occupations . ? But the moral embodied should , and doubtless will , be preached from many pulpits . We do not expel the heathen when they come to this land of enlightenment and civilization . We " nip the mouse in the bud " by slamming the door in their faces . And when , a few years ago , they came hither by scores of thousands we employed them to build railways , wash soiled linen , and to do any other sort of labor . Of course , the lowest wages were enough for the heathen , and when hoodlums murdered them and burned their homes over their heads . this Christian Nation actually paid smart money , to some extent , after a few years ' delay .

Thus it happens that of the regiment of Americans in China 506 are preachers of our Gospel . And now they are to be expelled , it is said . At least , this is better than our way of stoning , robbing , underpaying , and making outcasts of Chinese immigrants . But how comes it that no exception is made for these 506 good men ? Can it be that the pagan Celestials , having examined our ways , our civilization , our religion , actually prefer their own ? Have they a charity , a morality , a religion , and even a civilization which they think stands comparison with our Christianity , as judged by its fruits and taught by its chosen agents V The worldly minded care . little for such questions , since they scarcely affect the price of wheat , pork , or stocks . But the religious and the philosophical will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flowery Kingdom when the net result is the expulsion of the missionaries after they have had qualified freedom to teach and . exemplify their religion for a generation .
