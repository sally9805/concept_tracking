DIFFERENCE of opinion has arisen as to the proper course of the Secretaries and the Prudential Committee of the Board in deciding as to applications of candidates for appointment as missionaries . The following seems to me the right course which , if adopted , would at once relieve the Board from all embarrassment and in the long run secure the best men for missionaries . And as a change of the method has been proposed and is now before the Board and the churches , I present it as a contribution towards reaching a practicable and wise conclusion . The great majority of candidates are not ordained . When such a young man offers himself for appointment , let the Secretary and Committee obtain the usual recommendations and make inquiries of him and about him as they see fit . If they are satisfied , let them accept him with the proviso that in due time he obtain licensure and ordination according to the established usage of the churches . This involves no material change ; for in such a case the proviso of approval by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not formally expressed . If , however , they are not satisfied with his belief on some points of theological doctrine , but aside from this find him qualified for the missionary work , let them accept him with the same proviso as in the former case . When the time for his ordination comes , let the church of which he is a member call a Council of the churches in its immediate neighborhood . It has always been customary for a Secretary or some representative of the Board to be present at the ordination of a missionary . Let this good custom be kept up . This representative would lay before the Council any information or suggestions which the Committee might wish to present . It would be accordant with the usages of our churches for the church calling the Council to invite personally some one connected with the Board to be a member of the Council and thus to participate in all its deliberations . Let the Council thus constituted , after full examination and deliberate consideration of all the facts bearing on that particular case , decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministry in the foreign field ; and let that decision be final . The Board at Des Moines recommended consideration of the expediency of calling a Council " in difficult cases turning on the doctrinal views of the candidate . " The plan here proposed meets all these eases . The Board further recommended careful consideration of the manner of constituting such a Council . In reference to this point the plan here suggested is , that in the case of candidates not ordained , the case be referred to the ordaining Council . Such a reference has some important advantages . It involves no multiplication of Councils , since an ordaining Council must be called in every case . It gives the candidate time for further study and consideration , and for the influence of further spiritual development and growth . It removes whatever might be invidious in calling a special Council to consider a special difficulty in an exceptional case . This objection has been publicly urged , and it is not without force . The calling of such a Council would have some appearance of a trial for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been the confidence of ministers , and churches in the Board , that the candidate would be subjected to prejudice // before the case was opened . But on the plan here suggested there could be none of these embarrassments . The acceptance of candidates is in all cases provisional , and all alike appear before the ordaining Council before they are finally appointed . It has also been publicly objected that such a Council might be " packed . " But this is impossible on the plan proposed . And we may reasonably expect that , with very rare exceptions , these Councils would come harmoniously to a result satisfactory to the missionaries in the field , to the Board , and the churches . This plan is simple , easy , practicable , and in strict accord with the Congregational polity . Now and then an ordained minister offers himself for appointment as a missionary . If in such a case the Committee is not satisfied with some of his doctrinal views , and declines to appoint him , or for the same reason recalls a missionary already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called on the case ought always to be recognized . Such cases would be very rare . But on the plan proposed they are the only ones calling for an exceptional Council on a special difficulty . The following are reasons for adopting this plan : 1 . It is necessary in order that the action of the Board may be in harmony with the polity of the Congregational churches . If the Committee in its selection of missionaries has in spirit been in harmony with the churches , the form of its action has been incompatible with the church polity . For the Committee takes into its own hands the determination who shall be the ministers of the churches in that great part of their church work which lies in the foreign field . The form of its action implies that the Committee , in this great sphere of the work of the churches , assumes independence of the churches and their Councils , and the right to disregard their decisions . It thus tends to bring Councils into disrespect . If the proposed plan should be adopted the change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But as showing a decent regard to the churches and their Councils , as making them constantly see and feel that the Board is in accord with them in their ecclesiastical polity and one with them as their agents in doing their work , the change would be important as a matter of principle and in its practical results . // 2 . The change is necessary , in the interest of the churches , as the most effective method of conserving true evangelical doctrine and its right application to life , together with a legitimate freedom of thought and a due regard to the rights and liberty of the churches . To any proposal to refer the appointment of foreign missionaries to an ecclesiastical Council the objection has been repeatedly urged that it would be unsafe ; that some further safeguard for purity of doctrine , beyond that of a Council , must be had . This objection is a condemnation of the Congregational polity itself . It demands some more stringent and authoritative government subversive of Congregationalism and restablishing the very restrictions on Christian liberty to escape which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible to have the liberty of Congregationalism and the summary authority of a national and hierarchical organization both at once . It is a sufficient answer to this objection that it is subversive of the Congregational system . Tn the excitement and alarm attendant on a theological controversy this call for something incompatible with Congregationalism is often heard from Congregationalists themselves . It leads to demanding some new machinery or laying hold of some existing organization or to the establishing of an endowment or the founding of an institution , for the maintenance of the partisan view of the one side or the other . The result is the needless perpetuation of a controversy which otherwise would soon have ceased ; the embodiment of a partisan and transitory phase of thought in a permanent form , which becomes an entanglement and an element of dissension after the controversy has passed away . But in fact the Congregational polity is founded on truer and deeper principles of stability and order than those of any hierarchy enforcing unity by authority , and is more efficient in the conservation of true evangelical belief and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . A Congregational Council declares no abstract principles , doctrines or rules . It can act only on a specific case presented before it and advise what , in that specific case considered in all its aspects and bearings , ought to be done . In considering the // question of ordaining a man as a minister of the gospel for missionary work in the foreign field , the Council does not declare a doctrine . It simply advises whether , in view of the whole case as presented before it , that particular man shall be ordained to the Christian ministry in the foreign field . It has been said , in reference to delaying the appointment of a candidate on account of his doctrinal views , that the Prudential Committee waited to hear the voice of the churches . There is no national authority anywhere in the Congregational churches to utter the collective voice of all the churches on any question of doctrine or practice . Nor can it be uttered by newspapers , nor by the voices of a great and excited popular assembly . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that is by a Council of churches advising what is best to be done in a specific case carefully examined by it . My proposal , if carried out , insures to the Committee the desired voice of the churches in reference to the appointment of every candidate who offers himself for missionary work . And because a Council makes no general and binding declaration of doctrine , this method is conservative of the true evangelical belief and of its right application , as well as of freedom of thought and of the rights and liberty of the churches . When a question of doctrine or practice is raised and differing opinions are advanced and defended , it gives time for Christian investigation and discussion , and opportunity for the truth to establish itself by argument and by commending itself to the intelligence and good sense , to the Christian conscience and piety of Christian people . And it must be remembered that nothing is ever settled till it is settled right . And by this method we gradually obtain , not a provincial opinion , not the views of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the churches . As men continue to offer themselves for ordination to the work of the ministry in the foreign field , Councils will be held in all parts of the country . Thus questions pertaining to the appointment of missionaries will be examined at widely different points ; the examination in every case and the reasons for the decision will be publicly known and discussed . Thus an agreement of feeling and action on these points will gradually be reached ; thus we // shall attain , as by no other means is possible , the prayerful , thoughtful and intelligent conclusion of the mind and heart of all the churches on these questions . In contrast with this , by the present method , the question , who shall be appointed missionaries , is settled by the Prudential Committee with the advice and counsel , but without the vote of the Secretaries . The Committee , as now constituted , consists of ten persons , five clergymen and five laymen . Necessarily they all live in Boston and its immediate vicinity . Their meetings are private . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from their decisions ; and then only to the Board at its annual meeting in a great popular assembly , in which there can not be any careful and judicial review of them . Rev. Dr. Hopkins , in an article published since the last meeting of the Board , speaks of existing dissatisfaction with the Committee arising " from its action in filling its own vacancies , done nominally indeed by the Board , but really and almost necessarily by the Committee . " The Committee have the public confidence as all of them personally upright and able Christian men , conscientious and honorable in intention . But however wise and good they may be , they are subject inevitably to the influence of local opinions , movements , and excitements , and to the influences inseparable from power which practically is so nearly irresponsible . The objection , that it is not safe to trust the churches and their Councils with determining the appointment of missionaries , assumes that it is always safe to trust the Committee . But , in the marvelous changes wrought by time , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the next generation , will be holding some new doctrine , and , in accordance with the precedent which those who urge this objection are now seeking to establish , refusing to appoint as missionaries candidates who do not dogmatically declare their agreement with the new doctrine of the Committee ? The old question , who shall keep the keepers ? never loses its significance and pertinence . It can not be doubted , and this is no disparagement of the Committee , that the purity of e.vangelical faith , the legitimate freedom of thought , and the rights and liberty of the churches , so far as they are affected by the appointment of missionaries , are safer in the hands of all the // churches and pastors engaged in practical Christian work over all the conntry , than they can be in the hands of any ten men , however wise and good , in Boston , or in Chicago , or in any other city . To say otherwise wonid be to dishonor the everywhere open Bible , the everywhere present Spirit of God , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under this inspired and divine guidance . And fnrther , the practical working of the Congregational polity , shown in its history , proves its efficiency and sufficiency in the conservation of the evangelical faith with freedom of thought through the agency of the churches themselves and their Councils . A few days after the meeting of the American Board at Des Moines , the American Missionary Association held its annual meeting in New Haven . Its officers said that , both as to the numbers in attendance and the interest manifested in the work , it was the most successful annual meeting which the Association had ever held . Not a ripple of the existing theological discussion disturbed its harmony . Not a syllable respecting it diverted attention from the great work in which the churches through this Association are engaged . As I sat in this meeting I could but contrast it with the meeting at Des Moines . There the interest concentred mainly on a debated question of theology ; and in the newspapers unbelievers sneered that , 1886 years after Christ , Christians met to send the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come together they did not know what the gospel is which they were to send . What is the reason of this marked contrast * The answer is plain . It is that the American Missionary Association accepts from the churches the ministers whom it employs , confiding in the established ecclesiastical agencies as a sufficient guarantee of their evangelical belief . The annual Year-Book of the Congregational churches reports eight national societies through which these churches carry on the various departments of their missionary work . Among these the American Board stands alone in insisting on a private and extra-ecclesiastical inquisition into the doctrinal belief of the ministers and candidates for the ministry who offer themselves as missionaries in its work . All the others , so far as they have required the service of ministers // of the gospel , have always acted on substantially the plan which is proposed in this paper for the American Board . For this reason not one of the seven finds the slightest embarrassment from the theological discussion which has recently sprung up , nor has found any in any preceding controversies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that the Board has taken the contrary course , it finds itself involved in theological dissensions and obliged to give to the consideration of these the main thought of its last great annual meeting . In so doing it has turned the attention of the churches away from its great missionary work to a discussion of a disputed theological doctrine , and thus has perhaps done more than all other agencies together , previous to that meeting , to call attention to this controversy , and to broaden the area and intensify the excitement of what otherwise might have been a comparatively local and temporary theological discussion . And in so doing it compels applicants for appointment as missionaries to wait till they can dogmatically affirm their assent to the belief on the controverted point which the majority of the Committee for the time being hold . Certainly the history of the Home Missionary Society and of the American Missionary Association , and of the other societies so far as they require the service of ministers of the gospel , is abundant proof that the method proposed in this paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the appointment of missionaries . And the evidence is confirmed beyond all doubt by the embarrassment which the method of the Committee has brought upon the American Board . The sufficiency of the proposed plan is shown also by the history of past controversies . In the Unitarian controversy , for example , no church adopted the uncongregational method of calling a great Council from all parts of the country to give once for all the voice of the churches as if they were a National Church . It was settled by the local churches and their action in their Councils . And never was a great controversy settled more effectively nor evangelical belief more fully conserved , and not only conserved but made more prevalent than before . In this case the Unitarian doctrine was rejected by the churches as unevangelical . Some think that all who // hold the new doctrine now under discussion should be excluded from the ministry of our churches as the Unitarians were . Let them urge the reasons for their opinion as earnestly as they will . But let them address their appeals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merits as it is brought before them for action , uot to the Board nor to its Secretaries and Committee , for it is not their business to decide disputed theological questions . The method nuder consideration has equally proved its sufficiency in controversies in which the churches have not rejected the doctrine of either party , but have kept fellowship with both . Such were the controversy between the old Calvinists and the New Lights in the last century , that concerning old and new measures fifty or sixty years ago , the anti-slavery excitement , which split some of the strongest national religious organizations , the Old and New School controversy which split the Presbyterian church . None of these split the Congregational fraternity of churches . And it has been their peculiar polity and its legitimate influences which have preserved their unity . The usual result in these cases has not been the adoption of the extreme partisan position of either side . It has been rather the clearing of the theological atmosphere , the broadening of theological thought , the clearer and stronger apprehension of the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the softening of theological asperity , and ultimately a more complete union and a more complete and intelligent concentration of the energies on Christian work . Precisely because Congregationalism leaves the settlement of controverted questions to free discussion and limits the action of the churches in their Councils respecting them to specific cases arising in the actual prosecution of Christian work , and thus to their deliberate and prayerful judgment amid the practical needs of their Christian work in all parts of the land and under the guidance of the open Bible and the present Spirit of God , the usual results of theological discussions have not been harmful , but beneficial . If the controversy which has recently arisen could have been left to the decision of the churches through their legitimate agencies , the result , whatever it might have been , would doubtless have been equally safe and salutary . In a few years the // controversy would have passed away , leaving behind whatever of good had come from the Christian interchange of thought . On the contrary , the method adopted by the Prudential Committee has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 3 . The plan proposed is necessary , in the interest of the Board , to secure the greatest interest of the churches in missions , to deepen their sense of responsibility , to call forth more thoroughly their powers and resources , and thus to secure to the Board , as their agent , its highest efficiency . This plan will extend and intensify in the churches the sense of responsibility for finding and sending out men , and the right men , to the missions . Under the present plan the churches are called on only to give money for carrying on missions over which they have no control and for the support of men in whose selection they have no agency or responsibility . It is true the man appointed a missionary appears before a Council for his ordination . But it is only for his formal ordination as a minister . He has already been examined and appointed by the Committee , and no Council ever thinks of going behind its action . And the churches and their Councils know nothing of those who from time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejection . The whole business of selccting and appointing the men who are to be ministers of the gospel in that great sphere of the work of the churches , the foreign field , is practically in the hands of the Committee in Boston , independent of the churches . The only way of control left to the churches is by withholding their contributions , an extreme measure which the friends of missions must always be reluctant even to think of . But if the Board will abandon its isolated position and adopt the plan proposed in this paper , as the other niissionary Societies have for substance always adopted it , then every Council called to ordain a candidate for the Christian ministry in the foreign field will examine the whole question as to that man 's fitness for the work . Then the church calling the Council and all the churches represented in it have brought home to them their responsibility for sendiug men , and the right men , to the missions . And after the man has been ordained and has gone to his mission , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 188 ' 1 . American Board d Ecclesiastical Councils . feel that the work of missions is their own , as they can never feel it under the present method . And as these Conncils will be held in all parts of the country , this deepened sense of responsibility will be extended to all the churches . If a candidate is rejected , the fact and the reasons for it will be publicly known and discussed . Thus the churches will come to an intelligent consideration of what are the necessary qualifications for missionary work in the different parts of the world , and , so far as in the nature of the case it is possible , to a substantial agreement as to the principles which should regulate their appointment . I can think of nothing which would be more effective in extending and intensifying in all the churches their sense of responsibility and their intelligent interest in the missionary work . Another recommendation of this method is , that it will relieve the Committee from the necessity of deciding questions of theological belief , questions which in times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will permit them to give their whole attention to the administration of the missions . And as the churches come into closer connection with the Committee , they will better appreciate the service which its members render in devoting so much of their time and thought , without compensation , to the service of the missions . Further , this plan , if adopted , will relieve the Board and its officers from the jealousy and distrust which at different times have found expression , because the Board , while controlling the large funds contributed by the churches and their members and managing that great part of the work of the churches which is in the foreign field , is itself a close corporation created by the State , filling its own vacancies , and not legally responsible to the churches . It will insure a visible and continual acknowledgment by the Board of its moral responsibility to them and of its identification of itself with them in cooperation in the great work. * * It has been said that the constitution of the Board is analogous to that of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the constitution of the Board . Societies and institutions of various kinds are necessary in the work of the churches . The question is not whether the peculiar constitution of the Board is the best constitution of a missionary // Another advantage of the proposed plan is that it will relieve young men from certain discouragements from offering themselves for appointment as missionaries , which result from the present method . These young men may naturally and reasonably say : " We hold the evangelical faith and are willing to submit our belief to the examination and decision of a ministerial association for licensure , and then of an ecclesiastical Council for ordination , according to the usage of the churches . But we see no reason for being obliged to submit also to a private and extra-ecclesiastical examination to which no man entering the ministry in the home field is subjected . " This seems to be a natural and reasonable objection . The method of the Committee , as it has been carried out of late , is discouraging worthy and most desirable young men from offering themselves as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young men who apply for appointment as missionaries have usually not completed their course of study in the theological school . They are in the midst of their investigations ; if they think , they of course have found questions which as yet they have not answered and difficulties and perplexities not yet cleared np . To require them at this stage of their studies to give a dogmatic declaration of their belief on any question , which , as a subject of controversy within the churches at the time , may be specially interesting the theologians of the Committee , is unreasonable . But according to the plan proposed in this paper , the candidate will be left free to the spontaneous operation of thought and religions feeling in pursuing his investigations . The usual result will be that , by the time he presents himself before the ordaining Council , his views will be so clearly evangelical that any Congregational Council would ordain him . 4 . The proposed change is desirable in order to place the society . Its constitution is a fact and no one is seeking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wisdom of a particular method of administration . The point made is that the proposed cham*ge of method will promote the interests of the Board , the missions and the churches . The fact that the Board is a close corporation , and that distrust has arisen at different times on that account , certainly demands that the officers of the Board should use special care to give no occasion even for the suspicion that they are usurping ecclesiastical functions . // Board in a position from which , in a time of excited theological controversy within the churches , it can not be drifted into a partisan attitude nor used for partisan purposes . During the history of the Board there have been several important controversies within the churches . Tn these the excitement was at least as great and as widely spread , the alarm for the purity of doctrine or for the right application of evangelical truth as deeply felt and as earnestly uttered as now . But in none of these controversies , so far as I have ever known , did the Board or its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missionary on account of doctrinal views in agreement with one of the schools or parties and not with the other ; nor take any action throwing the weight of its influence in favor of the one school or party and against the other . It is the glory of the Board that in all its history , before the present controversy arose , its whole action has been in the spirit of Christian comprehensiveness and unity , at the farthest remove from partisanship and sectarianism . And no party or school in any previous controversy , so far as I know , ever attempted to lay hold of the Board , directly or through its officers , in order to use it for its own advantage in the controversy . Recently a new controversy has sprung up within our churches . In respect to this the action of the Board and its officers seems to be an innovation unprecedented in all its previous history . It has awakened in many minds the apprehension that it is in danger of departing from its time-honored position of Christian comprehensiveness , of taking on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus of being drawn into partisanship in a theological discussion within the churches . Printed documents have been issued officially from the missionary rooms to candidates for appointment as missionaries and to others , indicating what views must be held on the point in controversy in order to obtain appointment , and presenting arguments in support of the same . The Prudential Committee has declined or postponed the appointment as missionaries of persons acknowledged to be evangelical in spirit and in their general doctrinal belief and well adapted to missionary work , solely because they could not dogmatically affirm a belief on the controverted point , agreeing with that of // the majority of the Committee . A prominent action of the last annual meeting was the discussion pertaining to this doctrinal issue and the adoption of a resolution of warning against the " divisive and perversive and dangerous " tendencies of the doctrine held by one school or party in this controversy . Here is a sort of Encyclical , hastily written under the excitement of debate in a great popular assembly , in which the Board pronounces its decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And after the meeting , arose in various parts of the country the acclaim that the one party or school in this theological controversy had gained the victory and the other had been routed by the action of the American Board of Coinmissioners for Foreign Missions assembled in its annual meeting . And all this was done as if it were still an open question what the position of the Board in such a case should be ; as if its whole previous history had not settled it that the Board is not to be a partisan in a theological controversy within the churches . It is not strange that there are grave apprehensions that the Board is forsaking its old and honored position and will " give up to party what was meant for mankind . " Another notable innovation is found in the ground on which the recent action of the Board and the Committee has been publicly defended . The ground now taken in its justification is that the Board is a close corporation created by the State , and therefore not amenable to the churches . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the charge against the Board , which was the source of much distrust and opposition . Many contributors withheld their contributions from the Board and a considerable number of churches ceased to take collections for it . And in whatever forms the dissatisfaction found expression , a prominent ground of justifying the distrust was just this fact , that the Board is a close corporation independent of the churches . In those years the defense of the Board , against this charge , by its officers and supporters was , that it was a corporation only as a necessity in its world-wide pecuniary transactions ; that its administration would never ignore its responsibility to the churches ; that its management was open to the public and invited the closest scrutiny ; and that its officers studied in all things to meet the wishes of the churches . // The Board by its earnest disclaimers and its wise and Christian administration gradually lived down this distrust . But now this very fact that the Board is a corporation , and the inference from it that the Board is not responsible to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justification of the recent action of the Prudential Committee . These innovations indicate an attempt to initiate a change of management which is not less than revolutionary ; a change which , if completed and persisted in , will make the Board a perpetual menace to the rights and freedom , as well as to the peace and harmony , and even to the unity of the churches ; and which in every controversy will widen and intensify the excitement , will alienate some , and cause dissensions and perhaps division , will turn the attention and interest of both parties away from missions to theological debate , and thus will embarrass and hinder the work which the Board . was instituted to carry on . It is true that the Secretaries and Committee have been accustomed to inquire as to the orthodoxy of candidates . But the fact that they have done so is not a sufficient reason why they should continue to do so . In former years they have exercised this power with a wise and scrupulous regard to the will of the churches , so far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . But with all their wisdom and caution they have not always succeeded in retaining the confidence of contributors to the funds . At different times jealousy and distrust have arisen and found more or less wide expression . And new times may demand new methods . What worked passably well years ago may not be the best mode of procedure now . And since the present method of the Committee has already shown its dangerous tendencies in the past and is now again revealing its insufficiency satisfactorily to meet an existing emergency , it is wise to inquire if a better and safer method can be found . It has been said that the doctrine now in question is new , that it has not been held by the churches , and is still rejected by almost all ; that therefore the Committee must reject all candidates who hold it until it becomes known as a common doctrine of the churches ; and that then , should this ever come // to pass , the Committee would act in harmony with the churches . This is a recognition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which men are to be accepted or rejected as ministers at home or abroad , rests with the churches , and it is accordant with the common avowal that the Committee aims always to act in harmony with the churches . Why then , in order to learn the voice of the churches , does it not take the simple and straightforward way of referring each case , as it arises , to a Council , in accordance with the established usage of the churches ? This would involve no change of principle , for it is acknowledged that the decision of the questions of doe . trine in such cases rests ultimately with the churches . It is only taking a simple and direct way in harmony with our ecclesiastical polity , instead of an indirect and indefinite way hostile to this polity . It should also be remembered that in the beginning of every theological discussion the view held on one side must be new . It belongs to the churches to decide , in each case as it comes before them , whether they will receive into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold the view advocated on one side of the discussion , or will receive to this fellowship men holding either of the two controverted opinions . In the present controversy , if the churches are so nearly unanimous in rejecting the new doctrine , all who reject it may feel it safe to refer the decision of the question , in cases *s they arise , to the churches . lit is often said that , owing to the " looseness " of the Congregational organization , the general missionary work of the churches must be done through the agency of societies . It is true that societies of some kind are necessary . But it is a mistake to suppose that their existence is peculiar to Congregationahism on account of its peculiar polity . From early times and in all branches of the church , societies , orders , institutions of various kinds , have existed , as agencies for special lines and departments of Christian work , auxiliary to the church . And history shows that sometimes such an auxiliary has trenched on the rights of the church and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With the explicit declaration that I mean no comparison between the spirit of the Board and that of the Jesuits , I mention the " Company of Jesus " as a striking // example . Originally welcomed by the church , and working powerfully for its defense and enlargement in a critical period of its history , it became so powerful as to overawe even the great Roman Catholic church , and to force it into lines of action repugnant to its best minds , and into which the church , left to itself , might never have entered . ilistory shows that there is a real possibility of danger from the dominant influence of a powerful Society , and all the more when , like the American Board , it has grown into power by wise and efficient Christian work . Any change in its management which aims to set it up in practical and moral as well as legal independence of the churches , or which would lay hold of it as an agency for partisan ends , must be dangerous to the churches and disastrous to the Board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into antagonism , not only against the wise counsels and large Christian spirit which have ruled in all its past history , but also against the best spirit of the age and the whole drift of its Christian thought and feeling , which is toward comprehensiveness and a catholic unity of all who trust and serve the God in Christ reconciling the world unto himself , and away from narrow and divisive partisanship and sectarianism . The present theological controversy will not be the last . Differences on theological questions will arise in the future as in the past . Where will be the freedom o F the churches , the liberty of thought , the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace , the conservation of true doctrine , if , from generation to generation , whenever a discussion springs up in the churches , ten men in private session in Boston are to exclude from the ministry of the churches , in the enlarging field of missionary work , all who do not agree with them on the doctrinal question at issue , and are to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partisan agency in the controversy ? If ever in the future , in theological controversies within the churches , the Missionary Rooms in Boston shall become the centre for laying plans for the triumph of one of the parties or schools , and an arsenal whence controversial documents in its support are distributed ; if the annual meetings shall be prearranged for the support of one of the parties and the sup // pression of the other ; if the annual sermon shall be polemical in support of the side favored in the controversy , and the preacher be selected in order that it may be so ; if the members of the Committee shall be carefully selected in order that they may be in agreement in support of this side of the question in controversy , and in refusing to appoint as a missionary any person who does not hold and support the same ; if our missionaries abroad shall be denied the freedom of thought which is the undisputed right of every minister and member of our churches at home , and the keeping of their consciences shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them if they take up any new thought in theology not approved by the Committee , it would be a dismal and disastrous issue . The Board and its officers would of course deprecate such a result . But their method of appointing missionaries makes this result possible in any time of excited controversy ; and their action in assuming to decide controverted theological questions in accepting , rejecting or recalling missionaries , looks and tends in this direction . The only safeguard from some such result , and from the dissensions , divisions and miseries involved in it , is the uniform committing of the decision of questions of theological doctrine , as they arise in successive cases , to the Councils of the churches . And while this is the only justifiable method in accordance with the Congregational polity , it will be found to be also the most effective in conserving evangelical doctrine with the freedom , unity , and peace of the churches .
