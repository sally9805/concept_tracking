ARTICLE VI. - GOVERNMEKT BY THE PEOPLE . I HAVE hitherto spoken of the State in our polity as the association of all the people , partly for the transaction of business in which all are alike concerned , but principally for pro - tection from dangers to which all are alike exposed ; a definition which affirms the solidarity of government and people , the perfect obedience of the representatives to the will of a unanimous constituency . This is the theory , and if the facts conformed to it there could , of course , be no such thing as dualism and discord in the action of the State . The whole power of an association of that kind would necessarily be furnished at the cost and expended for the benefit of all , without distinction of person or class ; for a constituency unanimous in conferring exceptional privileges , or imposing exceptional burdens on a part of the constituents , is nearly a contradiction in terms . It is now necessary to recall the fact that the State , if theoretically one and indivisible , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existing only to give expression and effect to the will of another , is itself an individual with a will of its own , and accessible to all the motives which determine individual action ; perfectly , capable of entertaining purposes which are not those of the people , or of the whole people , and of carrying them out with the power which the people has put in its hands . The State-said one of the last of the real monarchs , I. am the State ; meaning that the sovereign power was his by absolute right , and used according to his notions and purpose . We are the State , say the people , meaning the sairie thing . Both are correct according to theory , but as a matter of fact the transfer of power had already gone far under the monarchy and is not yet complete under the republic . A new dogma has been substituted outright for the old one , an achievement always easy upon any sufficient display of force ; but as the will of the people counted for a good deal before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a good deal to-day ; and nearly all the political perplexities // and disorder of our time are related as parts of the era of transition , in which the political facts are slowly struggling into conformity with the political formula . We suffer and are often at our wits ' end , simply because having appropriated the sovereign right we have not wholly appropriated the control of the sovereign power , because the government , which is nothing if not our representative and agent , has not been thoroughly moulded into the expression and instrument of our will . We have certainly canght and harnessed the steed but have not quite yet broken him in . But now , when we talk of the transfer and appropriation of power , it is always to be remembered that , under whatever theory or form of government disposed of , or by whom , or for what purposes , no power exists , or has ever existed , other than the power of the people itself . Ca*sar or the Senate , the constitutional king or the king according to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the usurper or the delegate , all have fought their battles with the same weapon , and carried their ends with the same means ; and if the will of the people has not counted with them or has been counted out , the reason is not the lack of power but the lack of will : the ignorance , the illusion , the unconcern , or the divided counsels , of the body itself which furnishes the force another interest and intelligence control . From the first , the people , whether reigning or not , has always ruled whenever it has been able to make up its mind . Nor has it ever failed , in some sort or other , to make up its mind . For as the animal differs from the mere organism by the faculty of will , so does man from the mere animal by the faculty of willing in concert . By what long evolution , what conflict of hostile forces , what costly survivals of the fittest , the organs of intercommunication and the aptitude for combined action may have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case society emerges from the aboriginal chaos as a multitude of men with a common purpose , founded on the consciousness , or the instinct , of common dangers and common wants . This is the primitive , the fundamental , and the determining fact of all political history , and no political force has ever got beyond it , or the better of it . In effect that assemblage of forces which // we call government , is the first authentic expression of these great unanimities of men , and could not exist in the absence or in advance of them . In the very act of giving it being they lay an inviolable veto and an irresistible constraint on its action , hand over to it the power of what is already a people , for the interests of what is already a commonwealth . He reads history from the outside and to little purpose , who does not discover among the wildest excesses of public power the inexpugnable energy of popular will , an element of consent in the most abject servitude and of concession in the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation may be , the controlling factor is always and everywhere , not the special purposes of the sovereign , but the universal purpose of the people . It follows that the continuing course of political evolution is nothing other than the slow , successive steps by which the people comes to the consciousness of its power , and into accord upon the ends for which power is to be used ; with the sovereignty of the people as its logical and necessary conclusion . Yet none the less the special purposes exist , and take effect , from the beginning , because as much as the other they are an inevitable and immediate product of the nature of man . The appetites of the individual are always at the root of the social instincts common to everybody , and they come to the front at once with the individual who is promoted to power . It does not matter much how he comes by promotion ; he may have conquered it as the strongest animal of the primitive herd , or been admitted to it as the most experienced patriarch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribe . In any case the power he holds , although a borrowed power , originating elsewhere and inexorably held to the conditions of its origin , is necessarily a source and occasion of personal profit to him and to those belonging to him . He takes along with his higher digni*ties a larger share of the goods of the commonalty than anybody else , a wider range of pasture for his cattle , the richest of the spoils won from the enemy of the tribe . With these things , too , comes the appetite for more , and with the appetite the talent to get more . For a material force of any kind discloses its quality and suggests its uses first of all to the man // who has the handling of it . Were he not already the most capable man of the tribe , capacity would come to him with the practical management of his trust , so that the longer he holds it the more he will be able to do with it and to get out of it , and the more certainly he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the rudest of these early chieftainships , and in its accessories , are all the essential conditions and distinctive features of government in its latest and most complex forms ; a compact body of men , instigated by the same personal motives , capable of swift consultations and unanimous resolves , and disposing of a vast power imperfectly defined and waiting to be employed . We need not wonder that the evolution of government , surrounded by these large opportunities and hastened by these intense motors , has everywhere outrun and overborne the evolution of the people . For six thousand years it has filled history with the glare and uproar of its doings , and hidden everything beneath the picturesque perversions of a power that seems to have forgotton its origin and the ends for which it exists . It has been reserved for the skeptical and prosaic intelligence of our own time to see through the pageantry to the central fact , the most conspicuous of facts when anybody points it out , that the real drama , which prepares all the final and decisive catastrophes , goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most part the work of those noiseless , diffuse , and leisurely forces , which assimilate the multiplying experiences , and determine the agreements of men in the multitude and the mass . The true kingdom of man is like the kingdom of heaven in this , if in nothing else , that it cometh not with observation . And when it comes at last , like the meek who inherit the earth , it comes enriched with all the spoils , trained into all the talents , of the transitory dominions which have usurped its power and figured in its place . For , first , if there is anything obvious and certain in the make up of human nature , it is this , that a possession which satisfies all the most urgent requirements of the holder , can not remain the permanent monopoly of any man or of any set of men . The laws of political economy alone , which break down or wear away the artificial barriers , and ensure the distribution of wealth , are enough to decentralize a power which more // than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy . It is all in vain that it isolates itself in the hands of the reigning dynasty or order from the universal competitions which are the life of society , by pretending to a superhuman origin and an exclusive right , or by snrrounding itself with the menacing ramparts of military armament . The sanctions and the defences are themselves a capitulation , the admission into the stronghold of auxiliaries who will in time bring in the whole people after them . All that are best and worst in the community around it , the men bent on bettering their own condition or the condition of others , detach themselves from the inert and acquiescent masses to dispnte its prizes and divide its sway ; bringing with them the alternative of an indispensable service or an implacable hostility . It is precisely by such sacrifices that all government grows . Its progressive organization is nothing but the surrender of parts of its prerogative for the preservation of the rest , the admission of body after body to help on an enterprise in whose returns it is granted a share . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a host of employees and retainers fasten on the administration , the indnstries of the country gather around the treasury , an aristocracy adds itself to the court , literature and science and art to both ; and the capital of the empire becomes at once a center and an outpost of the civilization of the time . In the second place , and in particular , if the emoluments and dignities of government can not be put under lock and key as the exclusive property of a part of the community , neither can the special training and talents by which these things are acquired and held . Not only does the faculty go along with the prizes , it goes faster and farther . The art of government propagates itself incessantly to the non-governing classes ; were it not so they could never find or force their way to a share in the enterprise . As I have said , the men who have the handling of power are the first to learn what can be done with it and gotten out of it , but in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power of the people , in presence of the people , and at the expense of the people ; so that every act of the government , or every refusal to act , takes // effect beyond it , and taking effect , raises at once the question of its motives and its consequenes . The thing carefully calculated and settled upon in the innermost mystery of the council chamber , is reopened the next morning out of doors , under all the incalculable conditions of debate between the men who profit by it and the multitnde who do not , or who are its victims . The latter are no doubt worsted , for the time being ; but meanwhile they have been united by a common interest or a common grievance , and in the union have found ont something of their own strength , and something of the art of organization . In a word they have improvised a government of their own , quite competent to try conclusions over again with the titular government another time . When the issue is so made np , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry its points and be admitted to a share in the sovereignty , when the same process will begin anew with another opposition founded on another grievance ; or it will be worsted , when it will seek to interest other men in its griefs or associate other causes with its own ; as we say , it will appeal to the country . In either event the result is the same , a development of the political consciousness and political capacity of the people , its progress in that very art of government which is the special aptitude and strength of the governing class . It is these incessant collisions with an opposition , ever tending to wider popularity and larger resources , that fix the role of government in the political evolution of society . The sole depositary of an undeveloped and uncontrollable power , the initiative belongs to it always , the event never . Its specific function is to take the first step , by a formal decree , or positive act , to raise the question point-blank whether a given application of public power is for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The most arbitrary and licentious despotism with its utmost precautions can not avoid doing this : the most thoroughly representative administration can not possibly do more . The decree of the despot is the expression of his own will ; the law enacted by the representative an interpretation of the will of the constituency . It would seem , therefore , that the latter is secured in advance from the discomfitures that await the caprice of the other . But in most cases the will of the people , proclaimed // in the law , has not previously been put on record anywhere , or made known by any unmistakable signs . It exists as the diffuse feeling , or predominant thought , of a multitude of individuals , no one of whom , perhaps , has fully made up his mind , or if he has , has made it up in full accord with all the others ; a state of mind not formed , but forming , and until formed , far too complex and indicisive to furnish a clear m'rndate to the representative . Its first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that constitutional government is canght at the start in a vicious circle from which the arbitrary ruler , acting on his own motion , escapes . Called upon to consult the constituency in every law it makes , it has only one means of doing so , namely , by making a law . How can the will of the people be expressed until it is known , or how known until it has been expressed ? The practical consequence is , that the most considerate , like the most capricious law , is , in its first enactment , a conjecture and an experiment , an interrogation , more or less sagacious , put to the people whom it concerns ; and the vast volume of legislation turned out annually at hap-hazard by our law-making bodies , is no more than the crude material out of which there may come in time an expression of the ultimate and abiding purpose of the people . From first to last the function of the government is to raise the political issue , to submit the political alternatives , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summon the constituencies affected into the arena of debate , and whose exhaustive solution is to be found only in their unanimous accord . In every way , therefore , ' it appears that the selfish purposes of the ruler have to reckon with those of everybody else , and that the evolution of government , however it may be facilitated and hastened by the possession of power , depends upon and must at last be overtaken by the larger and dilatory evolution of society . The power diverted to the special uses of the men who are made its depositaries , tends continually to decentralize and redistribute itself , until it ends by reverting to the use of the body which furnishes it . The process , clearly , is one not to be held in and kept from going farther by any self-restraint on the part of the government , since all the conditions under which // it acts help to complicate the manner and widen the sphere of its action . The only force in existence , or conceivable , sufficient to stay its incontinence , is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfied the last of its claimants and competitors , and is brought face to face with a stolid and submissive population , insensible to its prizes , incapable of a farther aspiration , then all transaction and exchange between the two cease , and the double evolution ends in a permanent equilibrium between sovereign and subject in a dual State . Now this , although in some sort or other the instinctive aspiration of every governing body , even our own , is no solution . It is arrested development , a dead-lock between the opposing forces contributing to the evolution , and like every unnatural equilibrium , holds within itself the conditions of rapid and universal dissolution . The process all along has been one of give and take , the cession of parts of the prerogative on one hand , the admission of new constituencies on the other ; continuous acquisitions of power purchased by continuous distributions of sovereign right . But the moment the surrenders cease , the acquisitions purchased by them cease too , and that torpor of the people which leaves to the governing class the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is now nobody left to dispute its sway , but also there is nobody left to recruit its ranks and replenish its store . ilenceforward it must depend on its own resources alone and reproduce itself from within . It is an organism like any other , and must be fed to be kept alive . The higher its organization the more complete and energetic its functions , the greater is its need of aliment , that is of new men to fill its vacant places , transact its business , and care for its concerns . As outside itself there is only the people whom it has both excluded and disqualified , it must feed upon its own tissue , which is what we call in the vernacular , starvation . The figure , like most figures , does not go far enough . There are , besides , the reaction which follows all prolonged effort when it is ended , and the laxity which goes with the seductions of power set free from all accountability . Moreover , the men who went together as one man , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fall out among themselves when the interest is secured . To the slow wasting // of starvation are added the fierce decompositions of profligacy and intestine feud . The government drops to pieces , letting loose in its collapse the corrupting passions of the multitude , and society , unless some sounder race steps in to conquer and save it , returns to the chaos out of which it came . We are always taught to look to the Syro-Greek and GrecoRoman civilizations as the sources of our own . Why are they dead , and ours , apparently , undying ? I have given the answer ; they died from over-effort and inanition . Each of them in its turn was founded on and centered in the political institutions of its place and time , and in its freest range was never more than the precocious development of an isolated race or exclusive order , whose exhaustion came before the development of surrounding races or society could overtake and sustain it . The isolation , it is true , had the happy effect of extricating an original genius from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a pure and perfect expression . It was the instinct of self-preservation , as well as the sense of superiority , which kept the Hebrew aloof from the Gentile , the Greek from the Barbarian , and even the perfectly tolerant and companionable Roman from the horde of inferior peoples who came under his sway . But at the same time , the devout , or aristocratic , reserve which perfected the product , shut off at last the indispensible sources of continuous production . So , humanly speaking , the canon of the Old Testament was closed because the race was worn out . Whatever its inspiration , its institutions and scriptures were the work of individual men , and men of that stamp are to be had in unending succession only from a vast and ever progressing population , whose experience and creative power go on widening and deepening from generation to generation . The sterility into which it sank after its centuries of production was broken , or if it be preferred , the inspiration returned to it , with what its own writers called the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign thought . Torn from its seclusion and set adrift on the surges of Macedonian and Roman conquest , not knowing what it did , it gave birth to a new creation disowned alike by itself and by its violators , and whose inmost meaning will be fathomed only by the latest and highest intelligence // of man . But the race itself died in the delivery , and has been heard of no more save as the barren memorial of what it was . The fate of the Greek was the same , and the fate of the Roman ; but with the Roman the disaster was entire , because he had absorbed into his system and bound to his fortunes every civilized people from the Euphrates to the Atlantic . He had fastened his imperial forms upon the cultnre of the Greek in a hundred capitals , and upon the conquests of Christianity in all his provinces  --  a process usually described as the conversion of the Empire ; and when he gave out exhausted in his turn , he took everything with him . The fall of Rome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she left nothing standing ready to take her place and carry on her work . It is all in vain for historians of the " comparative " school to spin the cobwebs of their theory over this collapse and to talk of the continuity of European history across the tremendous abyss which separates the ancient society from the modern . Everything , says Mr. Freeman in his Essay on the Unity of History , emptied into the Roman Empire , and everything takes its rise there . I answer that everything that went into it was lost with it , and when it disappeared nothing was left afloat but the wreckage of the foundered wreck ; the dead , material relics of what it had been and what it had done ; the scattered manuscripts of its literatures , the mutilated and crumbling monuments of its arts , the wasting forms of its legislation and order . So far as any conserving force then extant was concerned , the wreckage would have followed the wreck , was in fact fast following it in the furious tempests of barbarian invasion . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that went before , the starting point of everything which came after , and the living centre of all European history , is to falsify words and the real meaning and relation of events . Nevertheless society is erect and vigorous as ever , and , what is more , wears the garments of the extinct civilization . In large measure our piety is Hebraic , our intelligence Greek , our social order Roman . Why ? Because there happened to be in the same family one untried and capable race outside the fatal circle of the Empire , not identified with its action and not caught in the vortex where it was engulphed . Of course the // German was conquered here and there , after a sort , as everybody else was west of the inaccessible Parthian , and parts of his territory were annexed to the Empire . But this was a mere geographical detail without significance . The capital fact was that the genius of the German was still in all the unconsciousness of infancy and barbarism , and therefore , unlike that of the Hebrew or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and absorbed by the devouring energies of the Roman . To return to . the figure , he escaped the wreck safe and sonnd , and was ready when the storm went down , to draw the wreckage ashore and make use of it . This contact of the living German character in its nnsophisticated infancy , with the dead memorials of an exhansted civilization , is the supreme fact of modern history , I may say of all history . And there would seem to be no historical fact which has been more perfectly mistaken by the historian . It figures in a vast repertory of labored reconstrnction as the " revival** of learning and letters , of philosophy and art , of religion and social order ; as if these things were separate entities of themselves , and not the mere modes in which men feel and think and act ; and as if in their independent being they had fallen asleep and waked up again , or had died and risen from the dead . The revival has gotten a name to itself and is known to everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mischievously expressive terms which misrepresent a whole phase of civilization by fastening a rank abstraction in men's minds as a concrete reality . What art was revived in the Renaissance , or what literature , or what form of culture ? There is a style of architecture , known distinctively as the Renaissance , which lends itself to the fallacy by wearing on the outside the classic " orders** like a layman in the habit of a monk . Is it classic architecture ? Certainly not ; nor are the Italian paintings and sculptures classic art , or the early Provencal poetry classic literature , although the Latin blood must have told here if anywhere . In all this prolific era of the Renaissance , to which , in any exact use of the word , we ourselves belong , the only thing born again was no state of mind , or way of life , or mode of expression , but a race . And if the voice that called it from the dead  --  the tuba *ouan* per sepulchrum , was the voice of antiquity , it does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the extremly simple reason that the risen race was neither of the old races , but another and a fresh one . As a matter of fact it was not brought by a miracle out of any tomb , but out of what I have called its barbarian slumber , by natural means . That since its awakening for a thousand years , it has been sitting at the feet of the dead past , has caught its inspirations and copied its models , is a matter of course and nothing to the purpose . Let the utmost be granted anyone can claim , that in all our intercourse with one another , we are bound by the formulas of Roman law and sheltered by the fabric of the Roman order , that our religion is the dogma of Palestine clothed with the hierarchy and ritual of the Empire , that our thought and imagination revolve in the circles and put on the forms fixed for us by the Greek ; still the question remains whether all this is mere reminiscence and imitation or whether it is not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derived from other sources , obeying other laws , and tending to another destiny . There can be no question of greater gravity than this ; for if , as the writers on the Renaissance suggest , all our creations are but revivals of what existed before , or if , as Mr. Freeman says , history is continuous and everything in modern society takes its rise in the Empire , then our civilization is but the proce88 , or repetition , of the old one , and must find its way to the old catastrophe . What we are actually participating in , is the same premature development of the more capable or more favored classes , cut loose from the slow-moving or motionless body of the people , and hastening toward the appropriation of all prerogative and power ; what we have to look forward to is the same fatal schism in the state , which must end , as before , in entire collapse . The only difference in the situation is that this time there is no hope for salvation from without , since the German , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last of the available races , and carries with him the destinies of the world . I need scarcely add that this is the creed of a great many very wise men , reflected in that wide dejection and unrest which are among the distinctive notes of our time ; as if we too , like the Roman in his prime , were entering the shadow of all-involving ni* ht . Who are we that we should not in our turn go the way of all the earth ? Let us eat and drink for to-morrow we die . // Yet with all their confusing identities and resemblances , due in part to affinities of race , in part to the influence of the elder races on the younger , nobody is blind to the peculiarities which distinguish all modern , from all ancient , work . Not a book has been written , not a building put up , not a law enacted , not a government made or overturned , nothing has been thought or said or done , by men or by states , within a thousand years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classic era . And nobody doubts that these peculiarities are real race differences , due to something nuderived and new in the character of the German . The originality is so great that it removes him as far from the Greek and Roman , who were of his own blood , as from the Hebrew , who was of another . These elder races were brought into one civilization , not by their accidental assemblage under the Empire , but by a certain mental quality common to them all beneath wide diversities of descent and performance . The German , who lay beyond and came after the Empire , belongs to another civilization by a wholly different quality . I venture to go farther and to affirm that the difference admits of exact definition , and that anyhow , whether definable or not , it has given another starting-point , and will ensure another ending to the development of modern society . The ancient civilization came to an end when it had exhausted the assimilable material around it , when the subject populations ceased to furnish men capable of maintaining it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same in the same event . But the authentic manifestation of the new quality I have indicated , whatever it may be , is in the active presence everywhere of the entire population , at once as an irritable power that must be reckoned with , and as an abundant supply for all the functions of organic society . We may admit that it was the aristocratic voice of antiquity which broke the slumber and set free the forces of modern Europe , but the difference is here , that the entire body of the people has answered the summons which fell unheeded upon its predecessors , and with ever-increasing mastery has interfered to determine the course of events and the character of civilization . The very forms of our culture most evidently dependent upon the ex // ample and inspirations of the past , have had their birth in some one of those upheavals and displacements of vast populations which are the capital mark of the whole era ; the anonymous movement which precipitated the German tribes on the Empire , the Crusades , the Reformation of the 16th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overflow of emigration into other continents . The suggestion , it may be , comes to us from without , but the motive power is from within and is our own . This is so true that the manifest dangers of society are no longer where they were of old , in the over-development of government ; they are in the impatience and excesses of the people , the chance that it may come into the control , before it has been trained to the use , of its own power . If its self-restaint prove equal to its energy , then we need not doubt that it furnishes what was wanting to the ancient world , the inexhaustible material for a civilization , not less original , and far more complex and durable , than any ever seen before . Now , partly in virtue of our ancestry , partly as the effect of our geographical and political surroundings , we happen to be ourselves the clearest , as we are the latest , manifestation of this new factor in human affairs . It is understood , I believe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have our laurels yet to win in the various arts of expression . We are deplorably Philistine rather than Hebrew , Barbarian rather than Greek ; and are even that in no American fashion of our own , but at second hand , with provincial fidelity to British models . Even Mr. iNlatthew Arnold , who loves us , sees this , and by and bye , when he has gotten up IDe Tocqueville on Democracy in America , is going to see what he can do about it . The meaning of it all is that we have hardly contributed our share to the Renaissance , have yet to achieve those happy " revivals " which attest the blended Blebraism and ilellenism of a first-class race . The only answer that can be made is , that after a while , and with the benevolent help of Mr. Matthew Arnold , perhaps we will ; and that anyhow , in the meantime , we have made very clear our Germanism ; that is to say , the capacity of an entire people to divide upon any issue submitted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and interests , to work its way to the exhaustive solution of universal accord . Tried by viii 8 // the test of individual achievement , the ideas of great thinkers in advance of their fellows  --  and these are the content of what is known as the culture of any place or time-we are behind more than one of contemporary societies . But in the multitude and importance of ideas which are omnipotent with us because the whole community has fallen out over them , and into agreement upon them , we lead them all . As I have said , society appears at the start as the embodiment of a common purpose founded upon the feeling of common dangers and want ; and the continuing course of political evolution thereafter is only the process by which the people comes to the fuller consciousuess of its power and into new agreements upon the ends for which power is to be used . It was this process which the fall of Rome iuterrupted , which modern Europe has resumed , and whose latest and largest results are found in the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point which European society is painfully approaching to-day . Our original capital , the fundamental ideas of our polity , were brought here by handfuls of fugitives who found themselves in hopeless minorities at home , an opposition called into being by provocatious of the government , and crowded out of place by the inert or hostile masses who divided on the government side . As the scattered colonies expanded and coalesced , and the continent filled , new provocations came from the pursuing sovereignty abroad or its representatives here , new alternatives were submitted , new divisions arose ; and out of every division there came in time another agreement of the body politic , another principle carried through the vicissitudes of popular controversy into the untroubled region of demonstrated certainty and universal consent . The government we gave ourselves has continued the functions of the one it displaced , which , I repeat , are those of all government , to take the initiative and to submit the issues over which the constituents divide . Our political life and our political superiority are in the promptness with which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Whatever else it lacks , the people of the United States has not yet shown itself lacking in the supreme faculty of making up its mind , and of making it up according to the thorough // dialectics of practical reason ; not inconsiderately , by instinct or in the gusts and rush of contagious passion , but after the manner of men who start from the opposite poles , to end their conflicts in the common term , of a truth . But a people comes into the sovereignty in the act of making up its mind . The power has belonged to it from the beginning . It resumes the control of the power , which has gotten into other hands only so far as another will has been substituted for its own , when it has fully resolved upon the ends for which power is to be used . To the extent that the American people has thrown off its unconcern , enlightened its ignorance , and ended its controversies in a common accord , it reigns and rules within its domain . The laws have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of its wilL No matter what the selfish purposes of the governing body may be , or the unscrupulous talents by which they are supported , they find no shelter or foothold , no means of resistance or evasion , under the calm , perpetual , omnipresent pressure of the will of the nation . One may even say that for a sovereignty of this sort , the form of its government and the modes of its legislation are an unimportant detail , since for a power so steadfast , so overwhelming , so sure of its ends , one instrument will do its work as well as another . Were we but able perfectly to make up our minds about the whole use of our power , we could give ourselves any form of government we chose , or reduce all government to its lowest possible expression . Mr. Arnold , in the paper I have alluded to , * has expressed a kind of envious admiration for the perfect adaptation he found on visiting the United States of the institutions to the people . " I had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed expressly and thoroughly suited to it . . . . As one watches the play of their institutions , the image suggests itself to one 's mind of a man in a suit of clothes which fits him to perfection , leaving all his movements unimpeded and easy . It is loose where it ought to be loose , and it sits close where its sitting close is an advantage . " The fitness is there , certainly , although hardly in the perfection Mr. Arnold supposes . At least it seems to me that we waste as * Nineteenth Century for February . // much political energy in cumbrous and obstructive machinery , and transact as much business with the bare fiction of machinery , as any civilized community going . A people which keeps forty legislatures turning out forty contradictory or variant laws upon precisely the same subject , whose chief magistrate is solemnly chosen by a deliberative body which humbly records a verdict it is fully empowered to reverse , and can then find , according to the President of the Senate , nobody authorized by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which can be said to cut its coat according to its cloth or its figure . We wear these things , and a good many others of the kind , easily enough in spite of the misfit , as a man wears an old shoe , because we are used to them . That freedom and ease of political action which Mr. Arnold finds here , are not in any mere adjustment of machinery to power , but in the anterior fact that the power is in the hands of a people which has , upon so many important points , fully made up its mind . We escape so many of the distressing complications and futilities of British politics by aid of our institutions but not in virtue of them ; because upon points where the British community is hopelessly divided we have compounded our differences and are at one . This is that very fact which De Tocqueville , whom Mr. Arnold is going to get up anew , deplores as the monotony of democracy , and which Mr. Arnold sighs for at home as the homogeneousness of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have come as to the use we will make of our political power . I will only add to complete the statement , that while we have arrived at them disconnectedly , one by one , with all the confusion and inconsequence which belong to popular controversy , nevertheless a kind of superior reason has determined the order of their coming , if not that intelligence of the American which , says Mr. Arnold , sees so straight and sees so clear , then the infallible logic of events . They are all related to one another as parts of a whole , the interdependent results of the same evolution , and may all be summed up in a single generalization . We have , in a word , resolved that upon this continent , within our dominion , there shall be no more heterogeneousness in the composition of the State , no hereditary supremacies , no irrevocable rights , no priv // iliged classes , in the eye of the law and the action of the executive no distinction known beyond that fundamental one for which States exist between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this distinction the entire power of the State shall be fnrnished at the cost and employed for the benefit of all its constituents alike . This is a reduction of things to a dead-level , no doubt , the last term of homogeneousness and monotony , the exclusion of all those political inequalities which have so stimulated and fed the culture of aristocratic communities . But what is the result ? It leaves the individual man alone in his individuality , sheltered so far as the collective wisdom of society can from the hostilities of nature and the interference of his enemies , to make what best use he will of the faculties God has given him . If with this protection perfected , and these opportunities enlarged to their widest , the individual man fails , if he does not go farther in the future than he could have done before , does not bring to the service of mankind a better tribute than men have brought before , then our German civilization fails . And as to that we must wait with what faith we can for the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas of our State , the great unanimities in virtue of which the people rules with uncontested and incontestable sway . It is sovereign to the extent of them and powerless beyond . Where they apply the government works its will ; where they cease it works its own . In spite of the fitness of our iustitutions we are no better off than the English of Mr. Arnold 's comparison where we have not made up our minds . We too act like a people without lucidity , which does not see straight and see clear ; we too fumble and flounder and beat the air " because we can not make up our minds . " But there is this saving difference in our case , enough it need not be said to take us omit of the dead-lock of foreign politics , that the things we are halting about are things whose principle is settled already , outlying details not yet brought under the law and included in the generalization of our political doctrine . The details themselves have a generalization of their own . We have but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put under the sanctions which already cover his person and his franchise , and the work is done . The // inequalities of taxation , and the inequalities of expenditure , in in a word , the abuses by the government of the money-power of the State , are what still await reduction to the common law , submission to the universal principle . They will have their turn when we cease to " fumble " and make up our minds ; and not before . We may give ourselves fit institutions or unfit , Democratic administration or Republican , civil-service reform or the license of patronage ; none of these will avail unless the people makes up its mind , or hinder when it does . There is but one remedy for any wrongs with us ,  --  the instructed and conscientious sovereignty of the people .
