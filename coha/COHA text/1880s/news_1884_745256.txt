txt The returns from Ohio come in slowly and in a fragmentary manner . At the present writing no figures of the total ; vote in any town or precinct have been received . The dispatches giving the gains and losses in majorities show that in 488 voting precincts the net gain of the Republicans over last year is 6,280 . This is an average of 13 votes to a precinct . If these precincts are representative and the same ratio of gain over the disastrous results of 1883 is maintained , the Republicans will elect the head of their State ticket by about 13,000 majority , or 6,000 less than in October , 1880 . That is , the Blaine managers , by the most desperate efforts , with the presence and guidance of their candidate , concentrating all their energies on this one State , have not succeeded in holding the advantage which was naturally , easily , and as of course won in 1880 . It is plain that as no such effort can be extended over the entire Union , and as there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than it is in Ohio , this meagre result of their struggle would be a gloomy one to them . But there is no certainty that even this has really been secured . The portions of the State heard from thus early are precisely those in which the greatest influence has been brought to bear by the Blaine machine , and there are scattering indications that the average of gain will not be kept up . Ashtabula County , for instance , which gave GARFIELD 4,700 majority , this year gives ROBINSON less than 4,100 . The definite result can not be known before another day , and we advise our Blaine friends not to boast too loudly on what is now known .
