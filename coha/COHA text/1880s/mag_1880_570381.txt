ARTICLE X.-TIIE TAXATION OF MORTGAGES . IN the recent discussion concerning the taxation of mortgages that took place in the Atlantic Monthly , the argument of Mr. Brooks Adams was certainly a sufficient reply to all the common objections to a reform . These objections are based entirely upon the delusion that both mortgages and estates mortgaged are at the same time property . Nothing better in the way of political education can be accomplished than the clearing people 's heads of this delusion , and any words may be deprecated that shall seem to hinder this good work . But in the course of his argument Mr. Adams makes some statements that can hardly be accepted without question . His end is to change existing laws regulating taxation , and it is of the utmost importance that such changes be made under . standingly . Before a line of policy is reversed we must know what the result of the present course is , and what will be the result of the change . We propose to show that Mr. Adams has not fully explained the operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Mr. Adams asserts : . . . . " The diffict*lty with all this taxing of debts is not only that it is absurd in theory but that it is iniquitous in practice . The borrower always has to pay . If four per cent . is the market rate for money , and taxes amount to two per cent. , we have seen that the mortgagor can borrow only at seven per cent . The capitalist will collect the tax for the government , but he pays himself at the expense of the borrower for his risk and trouble in so doing . No statute can change this law of trade . The only effect of taxing loans is to raise the rate of interest . " This , the orthodox doctrine is established generally by reasoning somewhat as follows . In the employment of capital , according to economic theory , an approximately equal rate of profit will be obtained , no matter what the department of business . The apparently higher rates of profit secured in some cases are explained as the reward of increased risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is discovered that any branch of trade is securing to itself greater profits than others , capital will seek that employment until the returns are reduced by competition and the equilibrium is restored . If then a man proposes to invest a certain capital in building houses , it is plain that he will expect to receive a certain rate of profit . He will not expect one rate of profit when he sells for cash and a different and lower rate when he sells upon credit . He would rather expect , however , to receive a higher rate in the second case than in the first . To put our reasonmg in the concrete form , a builder expends , let us say , $1600 upon his house , expecting to get for it $2,000 . If he sells for cash at this price he realizes his expectation . If the whole transaction has required a year , we may allow $100 for interest and call the profit $300 . What , now , must be the return if credit is to enter into the transaction ? Can it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Let us suppose that the terms of sale are $1000 down , and a mortgage . If capital is loaned at six per cent . and there is no tax upon mortgages , this mortgage will he sold for $1000 at six per cent . The builder can sell it and make his profit of $300 as well as if he had sold his house for cash . But if there is a tax of two per cent . upon mortgages , a mortgage for $1000 would not sell for that sum . Money otherwise loaned brings six per cent . and loaned upon such a mortgage it would bring but four per cent . If the builder is to make his profit the mortgage must be at eight per cent. , or else for a lar0 er sum at six per cent . For au obvious reason , where there are no usury laws , the former course will be adopted . Nothing can be clearer therefore than that the buyer of the house must pay the mortgage tax . There are two lines of criticism upon this argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and most thorough-going is extremely intricate and difficult to comprehend without some acquaintance with and indeed some mastery of economic principles . The second is altogether more obvious and less profound ; but it will serve to introduce the other , for it suggests questions that unavoidably excitq our curiosity . The first course requires an investigation of the causes that determine // the ordinary rate of profit ; the second involves a reference to the fluctuations of price . As we have recently passed through . a period remarkable for the " shrinkage of values , " and as this phenomenon has received a vast amount of explanation , it will be more practicable to begin with our second criticism . Let us shift our point of view while clinging to the doctrine of a general rate of profit . Suppose that a man possessing some capital seeks to invest it in real estate . He will of course expect the usual return for his investment . He examines the house that we have supposed to have been built at a cost of $1700 and finds that he can have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit , by paying seven and four-tenths per cent . interest on the amount of the mortgage . Having but $1,000 he is unable to buy for cash , while he is unwilling to pay the exorbitant interest that is demanded . He will say to the plea that the tax upon mortgages causes the increased interest that it is doubtless true , but that as the tax was intended to rest elsewhere he will not , if he can avoid it , assume it himself . The question therefore is whether there will be a deadlock-whether no bargain at all can be made . It seems reasonable to suppose that bargains often do take place by compromise , so that a part of the tax upon mortgages is paid by the seller of the property , either because he sells at a less price or accepts ; what is the position of the builder ? He has a house that he can not sell at the price he has fixed , and he must either rent it or let it lie idle . The latter course is much more to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course will give him no ready money with which to continue his business , so that he will be compelled to mortgage the property himself , and thus , according to the reasoning that we are criticising be compelled to pay the tax on the mortgage . Whether he would be able to exact the tax from the tenant in the shape of increased rent is another question . If it is maintained that the tenant pays the tax , then the case of those who have bought houses on mortgage may present no peculiar hardship . // In short the relative intensity of the demand of the two parties must be reckoned as one of the conditions of the problem . If the owner of the property anticipates a fall of prices he will be eager to dispose of his property . If the buyer has the same expectation he will be disposed to hold back . Or if the mar*et for houses is overstocked the seller will not forego an opportunity of selling because the tax on mortgages will be levied upon him . The fluctuations in the price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going up the buyer probably has to pay all charges ; when the price is falling or has fallen the seller may be obliged to assume some of them . The case is somewhat similar to that of two countries , one of which imposes duties upon the products of the other ; the " reciprocal demand " will decide whether one country or the other shall pay the whole or a greater or less part of the duty . We might almost say that th3re is a modern " zeisachlheia " under our system of credit , every ten or a dozen years , prices being shaken down without much regard to cost of production or rate of profit . If it be true that in times of dull business the holders of real estate often dispose of it at a loss , or at a reduced profit as in the case above supposed , then we may regard the tax upon mortgages as paid once for all , in a permanent depreciation of the value of real estate . For if we suppose the buyer in our example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do so without loss at the same rate at which he bought . He can assume the mortgage tax now because he escaped it before . In this way the incidence of the tax would vary as one was buyer or seller , so that it would be evenly dis . tributed . Even if we suppose that the buyer always pays the tax , as is commonly done , we must bear in mind that his position is changed when once he has paid off the mortgage . He now occupies the position of the builder and may he supposed to desire the ordinary profit upon his investment . He therefore adds to the price of the house the amount that he has paid in extra interest and demands this sum for the property . He can not do this when business is dull for the competition of the builders would not allow it , but he may very often do it when prices are rising . From this again we should conclude that // the state of business would decide whether the tax was paid by the buyer or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No one doubts that times of falling prices may involve loss to sellers . They get less money than they paid and if they are doing business on credit they necessarily lose . But any supposed advantage obtained by the buyer in the shape of reduced interest would appear in a reduced cash price . The buyer no doubt gains but he does not gain so much as he would , but for the mortgage tax . This tax be still really pays although he no longer notices it . For suppose that the pressure of circumstances causes the builder to offer his house for $1500 in cash , on what terms would he sell it on credit ? If he accepts a mortgage for $500 , it is plain that it should be of a present worth equal to $500 in cash . In order that this may be so the buyer must add the tax to the current rate of interest . Otherwise the seller would be receiving perhaps the equivalent of only $1400 . Stated in this way the objection seems unanswerable . But we must consider that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affected by the mortgage tax . XTere it not for that tax he might have fixed upon a cash price of $1600 ; for , being freed from the tax , a mortgage for $600 at the current rate of interest would be saleable at its face value . Our conclusion obviously amounts to nothing when based upon such premises . It may be quite true that the buyer pays a higher rate of interest than that current in the market , and yet if that higher rate is calculated upon a rednced valuation , he may not really pay the tax that he seems to pay . The seller , in short , has two ways of disposing of his property . A tax is laid upon one of them , rendering it less , advantageous than the other . Hence there is a general lessemug of his facilities for sale ; his freedom of action is curtailed ; his market is reduced in extent ; his rate of profit is lessened . If there are two roads of equal ease between two towns and a bridge breaks down upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade will be impeded by being confined to the single avenue that is passable . We are able now to see pretty clearly the nature of the mortgage tax . It is a tax not strictly upon property , but upon // a human act ; namely , the borrowing or lending money in a particular way . Accordingly if we consider the general question : - If the loaning of money is taxed , who pays the tax ? - we may find the answer to the particular case with which we are concerned . In this way we shall be led into our second line of criticism . It may , however , be urged that in the case of real estate or more strictly , dwelling houses , there is from the nature of the case a peculiar pressure acting upon the buyer . A nian must live somewhere , and he must , therefore , either buy or rent a house . But it appears that nothing is so elastic as population . In prosperous times it expands and fills houses as fast as they can he provided . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some families occupy apartments instead of houses . Some combine their households . Some content themselves with the confined quarters of a boarding house . Some take half a house when they would once have taken a whole one , and , therefore , the market becomes suddenly overstocked with real estate . Hence we may conclude that there is no peculiar pressure resting upon the buyer of real estate . He buys when he feels prosperous , just as he allows himself other luxuries . When times change the buyer of real estate holds back even more than the buyer of other kinds of property . We may , therefore , now proceed to consider our general question-Who pays a tax levied upon the loaning of money ? And first let us assume that the tax is levied upon all loans whatsoever . There is , then , a corresponding inducement for every one to employ his own capital rather than entrust it to others ; unless the tax can be transferred to the borrower . And if the tax can be transferred to the borrower it will operate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since the borrower borrows for the sake of profit and the lender lends also for the sake of profit , it appears that we have really to discuss the problem of the ordinary rate of profit . Let us suppose that four per cent . in this country is the lowest net remuneration that will content the owner of goods for his abstinence from their use ; that is to say , if the owner can not obtain this return he will consume the goods instead of abstaining from them . The markct that the government has // found for its bond seems to indicate a rate as low as this . " John Bull can stand a great deal , but he can not stand three per cent , " is an English saying . Money was loaned in Holland at one time for two per cent . But perhaps four per cent . in this country would be a fair allowance . Let us also suppose that fifteen per cent . is now the gross profit upon most employment of capital . This applies to cases where the management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or holder of the capital . If his capital is borrowed he must pay as much as four per cent . upon it . There is then left a margin of eleven per cent . to be divided somehow between the lender and the borrower . It is almost impossible to name any figure that will represent the remuneration expected by the manager of a business for his services . Nothing differs more than business capacity , and it is constantly the case that men of very different abilities receive the same remuneration . The immense number of failures in business and the extreme difficulty of finding really able managers show how great uncertainty surrounds the subject . Indeed , if we could answer this question the problem of c&amp;iperative production would be solved . The share of " talent , " according to Fourier , was , we think , one-fourth . But Fourier 's guesses are of no assistance in deciding such a question . It probably admits of no precise answer , because the rate of remnneration is essentially fluctuating ; but some approximation to the truth may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital , large quantities fall into the possession of those who can make no use of it . Widows and orphans , charitable and educational institutions must have their money managed for them . Elderly people and in general those who do not choose to engage in productive labor are in the same category . To all these the first consideration is security . This security may be considered to be obtained for an additional two per cent. , so that the lowest average interest upon notes must be six per cent . There remains , therefore , nine per cent . as the greatest possible profit for the borrower . We are thus fairly driven to assume that there is a minimum rate of profit that will content the borrower , and that this minimum , with the figures here employed , will be below nine // per cent . If we consider it to be the same as the return that contents the lender , there will be a remainder of three per cent . to go to one or the other , or to be divided between them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the variable character of profits . If the field of production be unlimited , as where unoccupied lands are abundant , it may be possible for the lender to exact this three per cent . in addition to his ordinary return . The competition of those who desire to occupy lands and are without capital , will enable him to secure his own interest . But if a tax of three per cent . were then levied upon money.lending it seems hard to avoid the conclusion that the money-lender would pay it . He is getting more than his minimum return , while the borrower has already reached his minimum . If the field of production be limited as in the ease of a manufacture that is thought to be a little overdone , it does not seem possible for the lender to secure to himself the margin of three per cent . The borrower will insist upon easy terms if he is to use more capital in an uncertain business . He may compel the lender to take the minimum interest . In this case the borrower would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state of business were such that the gross profit amounted to but twelve per cent. , since both borrower and lender would have yielded all that they could , it is plain that a tax upon loans would amount to a prohibition . The lender will prefer to spend his capital rather than abstain from it on such terms . The borrower will prefer to contract his business rather than pay a high rate for money that does not bring him in much profit . Such a tax , therefore , tends to produce a waste of capital , which would continue until the rate of profit rose to a satisfactory height . Certain banks have recently reduced their capital on the ground that excessive taxation had rendered its employment unprofitable . This fact shows that a tax upon loans is not always paid by the borrower , for in that case taxation would not affect the banks . But since at the enhanced rates that they would be obliged to charge in order to transfer the tax to the borrower , borrowers would be few , it would follow that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , would be let at low rates . // We have spoken of a general tax upon loans as if the tax upon mortgages were governed by the same laws . It may be thought that there is no such general tax , and that mortgages , therefore , suffer peculiar hardships . But , in fact , the taxation of loans is quite general . The taxation of banks is a tax upon loans , for banks exist in order to loan . The taxation of corporations is really taxation of loaned capital . If corporations borrow , their bonds are taxed . And the stock of a corporation is really borrowed capital . It is managed by other persons than the owners . The only loans , therefore , that escape taxation are loans by private individuals upon personal security . The mortgage tax is , therefore , in harmony with the policy of our present system of taxation , which is to encourage private lenders rather than corporate lenders , and , on the whole , to discourage lending at all , by relieving capital employed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borrowers . Mr. Adams says : - " There is a terrible contrast between the workingman who has invested one thousand dollars in a house , and has borrowed another thousand on a mortgage , and another workingman who has one thousand dollars in the bank . The State taxes the latter seven dollars and one-half ; the former , forty-four dollars a year. ** This view seems one-sided , because the workingrnan that does not own his house must pay rent . Mr. Adams elsewhere says that the mortgage tax raises rent , so that this workingman perhaps suffers no more than the other . Indeed , if we were to apply the ordinary reasoning of economists to this case , we should suppose the former workingmnarm to reflect that by taking a certain course in regard to procuring shelter , he would escape the payment of thirty-six dollars and one-half in taxes . Should we not be justified in supposing that this 0reat inducement to a particular mode of investment would cause such a rush of investors that their competition would reduce the advantages to a par with those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared that it was much more profitable to rent a house than to buy it and give a mortgage , we should expect that houserent would rise until the two modes of investment stood about on a par . There is not space for an examination of rent , but // it is not probable that it is very greatly to the advantage of a workingman to live in a rented house . During the past three or four years it is likely that the hiret has bad an advantage over the owner , but their circumstances will be reversed by a rise of prices . It does not appear to have ever been clearly settled how taxes are divided between capital and labor . The view that the tax upon mortgages is paid by the borrower seems to correspond with the assumption that capital always escapes taxation by transferring it to the consumer . But in the case of general taxation capitalists would pay as consumers the taxes that they appeared to evade . The question then arises whether capitalists can maintain their profits undiminished by lowering the rate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the working classes . If we consider profits as " the leavings of wages , " and wages as fixed approximately at a given figure by the indisposition or inability of workingmen to subsist upon less , we must conclude that the expense of shelter has some effect upon wages and therefore upon profits . If the builder must make a certain profit he must also give certain wages . The workman , according to the theory , insists upon shelter of a given kind and if the cost of this shelter is increased he must have increased wages . Adopting this theory we should conclude that the tax upon mortgages , although apparently resting upon the borrower , may be to some extent transferred by him to the whole society in the shape of enhanced wages . This conclusion will be the more plausible if we consider the expense of hiring a ho use to be approximately equal to that of buying a house on credit . The inference to be drawn would therefore be that taxes that fall upon the laboring class as a whole are really , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If it could be shown that the value of real estate has declined more of late years than the value of wages it might be considered as evidence in favor of this view . Of course we must suppose the increase of population to be suspended or restricted while such changes are going on as have taken place within the last five years . Another aspect of the case to which reference was made at the outset is that afforded by periods of violent change in values . Our sympathy is appealed to in behalf of those who // have invested in real estate with little capital and have therefore suffered the loss of their investment . This is the great " debtor class " of whose existence we have heard so much in the speeches of partizans . This class certainly deserves pity on account of the hardships they have undergone from the action of the government in inflating the currency , and the necessary subsequent contraction . But the tax upon mortgages is only incidentally connected with this suffering . If there were no tax , still many would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can save men from the results of imprudent investments . Real estate is notoriously fluctuating in value , and for a workingman to buy a house on which he can pay but one-half the price , is an act which it can hardly be regarded as wise policy for the State to encourage . When prices are down , such an act may be the height of wisdom ; when they arc up , and especially when the currency is inflated such an act is of a highly speculative nature , and is for the ordinary working man the grossest folly . We may perhaps do well to sum up this somewhat perplexing argument . We find grounds for maintaining the following positions . 1 . In times of depressed business the holder of real estate is under a disadvantage in his efforts to sell . He may sell at less than cost , and he may consent to pay the mortgage tax himself rather than not sell at all . In this case the borrower does not pay the tax . Mr. Adams admits this possibility when he speaks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In times of active business the workingman is not obliged to buy on mortgage unless he deems it for his interest to do so , and if large numbers of them prefer to invest in this way rather than in savings banks , it is to be presumed that they regard their investment as the best they can make . 3 . Mr. Adams declares that the mortgage tax raises rent . Hence it is a tax upon all workingmen , whether they buy houses on mortgage or put their savings in the bank . 4 . A tax that affects all workingmen may be returned in part to them in the shape of enhanced wages . If this takes place the mortgage tax is a tax upon profits as well as wages . From other considerations we derive these inferences. // 1 . Since a great deal of wealth can not be productively employed by its owners , it must be either lent or spent . 2 . If a tax upon loans be imposed , it must be paid by either the borrower or the lender. 3 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must pay it . If he does not he must either consume his wealth or lend it in some way that is not taxed . 4 . If all lenders choose to lend upon notes to escape taxation , their competition may reduce the market rate so that their return will be no greater than if they lent upon mortgage and paid the tax themselves . 5 . If four per cent . is the market rate for money and mortgagers pay seven per cent. , it is fallacious to infer that " the only effect of taxing loans is to raise the rate of interest . " The effect of taxing 1o us may he , as shown in ( 4 ) , to lower the rate of interest . If there were no mortgage tax the mortgager would not necessarily borrow at four per cent . The greater profit to be derived from loans would so encourage borrowers that mortgagers and all would have to pay five or six per cent . ( This is a modification of the received theory of political economy that is of great importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , been previously noted. ) 6 . The question whether the borrower or the lender shall pay the tax upon loans is settled by the prevailing rate of pro . ductiveness of labor . If profits are very high , borrowers will consent to pay high for their loans . If profits are low they will not consent to pay more than a given rate , and if that rate is above the minimum return that will content the lender , he may consent to pay the tax rather than let his wealth lie idle . 7 . If a certain amount must be i-aised by taxation , and all taxes are paid out of the returns of productive labor , whatever sum is raised now by taxing loans must be raised in some other way , if the loan tax is abolished , out of the returns of productive labor , i. e. out of wages or profits . 8 . Before new taxes are imposed the decision must be made whether they shall come out of wages or profits . If out of wages , it is necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is now . If out of profits , it is necessary ( for reasoners occupying Mr. Adams ' ground ) to show how the capitalist will be prevented from transferring the tax vol4 . III . 29 // to the shoulders of the workingmen . It will be worth while also to enquire whether all taxes are not paid in the long run by real estate . In that ease how would the workingmen be bettered by a change ? 9 . Since a tax upon loans secured by pledges enables those who borrow on the security of their good faith to do so at an advantage , and furthermore is an inducement to every one to work with his own wealth rather than live in idleness , would the results of the abolition of the tax be altogether good ? 10 . Since the great extension of credit results in violent fluctuations between prosperity and adversity , is it desirable to encourage borrowing any more than it is at present encouraged ? On these last three heads I do not express any opinion . The truth of the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tremendous question of public policy . It is a question that is alarmingly pressing in India . It looms up in Rumania . It shook the city of Rome so long ago that only vague accounts of the disturbance have come down to us . It was treated in a drastic fashion by Solon of Athens . The question concerns the position of the State in relation to the incurring of debt by the laboring classes . To say unhesitatingly that as soon as the workingman has saved five or six hundred dollars , every encouragement should be given him to buy a home for himself on mortgage , and " pay off the debt by instalments , ' is to decide a great question too easily . The aim about which all are agreed is to create good citizens . Certainly the possession of land is the best means to this end . But the failure to retain land on which an instalment has been paid , to be sold out , to lose money and labor and home ; - good citizens do not arise from such experiences , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as business is done on credit , so long will there be times of activity and dullness , high prices and low prices . And so long as human nature remains as it is , it will believe in the time of high prices , that the high prices are going to last , and will enter into obligations accordingly , which in the time of low prices it will be unable to meet . This perennial infatuation , this inability to represent to the mind the pains and hardships of future payment , is certainly a fact to be considered before the state undertakes to encourage borrowing by the poor .
