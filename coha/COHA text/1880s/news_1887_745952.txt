txt To any competent business man the conduct of Congress in regard to revenue and expenditures would , if applied to private affairs , seem ample ground for putting any one guilty of it under arrest . This is particularly plain as to expenditures . Any one can understand that it is the duty of Congress , so far as it must spend money for constitutional and necessary purposes , to spend enough to secure them ana no more . Yet it is easy to see that many of the things for which Congress expends money have little or no authorization in the Constitution , that many of them are not necessary , while some of them are mischievous ; that it often expends much more than is needed , and not seldom spends too little to accomplish the real end it has in view . Without making too much of the restraints of the Constitution , which have been so loosened by precedent that they have little force , the examples of extravagance and of parsimony equally extravagant are many . Of the former the " dependent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress almost as a matter of course , with no discussion worthy of the name , is a conspicuous instance . We are aware , of course , of the political motives that have produced this piece of recklessness , and that it is on the one hand the result of protectionist trickery and on the other the fruit of arrant and discreditable demagogy ; but it is as a matter of finance that we at present regard it . The first and chief vice of the bill is that it is indefinite . No one knows what it will take out of the Treasury . Not only that , but no one of all those who have had to do with it has taken any pains to find out what it will cost . The gentleman who had charge of it in the House hardly pretended to have considered the subject thoroughly . He did not have any estimate to submit that was entitled to a moment 's serious study . A few figures as to a few counties , gathered almost at hazard , weie cited by him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting in ordering a new fence about a schoolhouse . In any well ordered legislative body where respon- sibility is fairly fixed , a statesman who should venture such a proposition on such grounds would have ruined himself . In the House of Representatives of the United States the splendid folly and audacity of the thing scarcely attracted attention . In the Senate , supposed to be a check on hasty legislation in the popular branch , the case was quite as bad . The second vice of the bill , scarcely less great than the first , is that it gives the same pension to all persons embraced in the bill , without any regard to their merits , their service to the country , or their claim to aid .. Undoubtedly it will be a needed relief to many very deserving men , but it will also give money to a far greater number who entered the army from mercenary motives , who rendered as little service and as poor service as they could without incurring punishment , and who were , as Gen. BRAGG declared , ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union veterans , ) the " rubbish of the army . " Men who in 1863 and 1864 went into the army with a large bounty , who may never have seen a battle and who were a source of danger to their comrades and of ' anxiety and torment to their officers , receive the same consideration as the men who volunteered in 1861 and were brave and faithful soldiers to the close . Examples of ignorant and wasteful parsimony are , as we have said , equally abundant . The Post of last evening , in a Washington dispatch , called attention to two of these , which , as they are recent , will be good instances of what we mean . The House , being applied to for money to fit out a steamer to carry an expedition to Alaska and to pay the expenses necessary to the settlement of the disputed boundary in that region , votes just enough money for the steamer and refuses what is required for the expedition . Again , where buildings costing large sums of money have been authorized by law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are practically thrown away . In the meantime , the cost of supervision , custody , &c.,; usually in the form of salaries , goes on at the same rate as if an adequate appropriation had been made . A " staff " at $10,000 a year is maintained out of an appropriation of $50,000 , when an appropriation of $500,000 would require no more expensive one . It is plain that in such a case these " staff " expenses are made tenfold greater than is necessary . For such willful blundering there is generally but one motive , a desire to seem economical , while getting out of the measure all the " patronage " possible . In point of morality this is on a level with the tricks of agents in mercantile life , who pocRet " commissions " or charge expenses never incurred to their employers . The Senate , being of a different party from the House , is greatly offended at this sort of thing , but it is no worse than Republican Houses have done , and no worse than has been done by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the division of the National Legislature between the two parties does not produce that caution that might be expected . Each house is quite willing to promote any extravagance for which the other can be held responsible , or to make a pretense of economy if the other house can be relied on to override it . And , as in the Pension bill , both houses are quite capable of combining in the most shameful squandering of the money of the taxpayers from motives that in ordinary business affairs would be regarded as dishonorable . There are very few advantages about such a division of power , and the gravest possible evil is inherent in it  --  the escape from responsibility . Responsibility at best is not very definite or very rigid under our system of Government , and that is one of its gravest defects , and that it is much aggravated by a division of power is shown in the financial bungling , to call it by no harsher name , of the current session .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
