txt A splendid victory was won last evening in the Second Congressional District Republican Convention by the anti-Administration Republicans . The convention met in the wigwam at Kingston and Atlantic avenues . Early in the evening and long before the doors of the wigwam were opened the office-holding contingent and such other supporters as the Dady-Daggett combination could secure began to gather in force . During the day it was confidently announced that Major Hobbs , who had boldly declared himself as against Arthur under any circumstances , was to be beaten at all hazards , and it looked for a time after the delegates came together as if physical force would be resorted to . The convention was called to order by John , of New-Lots , and Messrs . Burroughs and Wright were made Secretaries . These gentlemen were made the permanent officers of the convention notwithstanding an effort on the part of Justice " Billy " Watson , who was indicted some time ago for instigating a prize-fight in a hall back of his court-room , to substitute an Arthur man as presiding officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who acted as fugleman for the Administrationists , moved that an informal ballot be taken . The purpose of this move was to find out how the delegates stood , and then , if the followers of Arthur were in the minority , to give the office-holders present an opportunity to get in their " fine work . " The convention , however , was in no mood for temporizing , and on motion of Mr. Chevalier , of the Twelfth Ward , went at once into a formal vote . Both sides were united on Silas B. Dutcher . The fight was as to whether Mr. Ditmas Jewell , whom the Arthur men supported , or Major Edward H. Hobbs , who is bitterly opposed to Arthur , should go as Mr. Dutcher 's colleague to the National Convention . Both sides kept a strict tally , and when the roll had been called it was seen that Mr. Dutcher had 80 votes , Mr. Hobbs 17 votes , and Mr. Jewell 15 votes . In the desperation of defeat . the Administration men rushed toward the platform and half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a delegate from the Twenty-second Ward . Whatever reasons they had to urge operated quickly , for before the Secretaries had time to announce the vote De Grove rose , pale and trembling , and was understood to announce that he wished to change his vote from Hobbs to Jewell . A hundred officeholding throats yelled out that De Grove wished to change his vote , and , for a few minutes , the din was deafening . When something like quiet was restored , the Chairman , who was misled by the Secretaries , announced that Messrs . Dutcher and Hobbs had been elected . Almost immediately the Chairman discovered his mistake and essayed to correct it , but the Administration men , knowing front the heated demonstrations all round them that some of the self-respecting delegates who had voted for Mr. Jewell would resent the action of De Grove and the means by which it was brought about , thought they saw a chance to break the convention up in a row . Excited men jumped on the scats and crowded around the platform shouting at the tops of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself heard . Somebody sent for the police , but the presence of the officers did not restore quiet . At length Major Hobbs , who had been in the back part of the hall , gained the platform and asked for a hearing . Watson attempted to prevent Mr. II obbs from speaking , but he was summarily suppressed by some of the more decent members of his faction . Then Mr. Hobbs announced , in a ringing voice , that he Would not accept an election that was not the result of afull , free vote cast in an orderly convention . He announced what the Chairman , owing to the noise , was unable to announce before . that toe vote between Mr. Jewell and himself stood 16 to 16 , and that another ballot would have to be taken . Mr. Hobbs 's brief and manly speech took well with the delegates . Just at this point Senator Daggett entered the hall , and a final effort was made by the Arthur men to rally their forces . But the Administrationists had overreached themselves , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Hobbs , 18 ; J ewell , 14 . Messrs . Dutcher and Hobbs were then declared the delegates from the Second Congressional District to the National Republican Convention amid the wildest cheering . Mr. Hobbs said to a TIMES repeater , after the vote had been declared , and when he was receiving the warm congratulations of his friends : " You may announce that 1 am an anti-Arthur man of the straightest and strongest kind , and that I was elected as such to-night . " Beaten into submission by the independent Republicanism of the district , the Administrationists humbly asked to have an Arthur man sent to the convention as an alternate to Mr. Hobbs . But the kickers were inexorable . John and William H. N. Cadmus , both pronounced anti-Administration men , were selected as alternates to Messrs . Dutcher and Hobbs . Defeated at all points , Mr. Daggett and his machine followers , who had come into the hall boasting of certain victory , went out of the building sadder but wiser men . Before the convention adjourned a resolution was passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conventions of the Republican Party proportionate to the Republican vote cast in each State . The Third Congressional District Convention met at Liberty Hall , at Nostrand and Gates avenues . W. H. Leaycraft presided . Luther W. Beasley moved that Andrew D.

Pease was placed in nomination for the second delegate , when a member from the Seventh Ward protested against the choice of both delegates from one Assembly district and proposed the nomination of William Ray , the President of the Seventh Ward Republican Association . Mr. Pease was chosen by a vote of 19 to 13. and his election was made unanimouns . William Ray and D. W. Northup were chosen alternates , but Mr. Ray declining to serve George L. Moore was elected in his stead . Both candidates and alternates are strong anti-Arthur men . Mr. Baird 's preferences are for Mr. Blaine , while Mr. Pease leans toward Mr. Edmunds .

Mr. Wren 's substitute was carried , and Mr. Wren moved an adjournment until Wednesday evening .
