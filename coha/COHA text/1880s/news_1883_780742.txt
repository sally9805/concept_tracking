When he left Atlanta to go to Saran-nab he had the car heated to 67 ? , and kept it there all the time . As the ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most dense known foi some time in that section . Anticipating trotible from riding through this to his hotel . the Gov erner telegraphed to Savannah for a close oar riago . Upon arriving , be found that it bad been provided , but that the windows were down and could not be closed . He sat is the carriage with the clammy fog penetrating his system and chill ? log him thoroughly for about 30 minutes . Upon reaching the hotel he went to bed and was so sick that he did not have strength to rise until about I o'clock , and he has never fully recovered from the shock his system received . When he left Savannah the temperature was about SO ? , and when be reached Atlanta the temperature was about 40 ? and chilly . He drove to the mansion early in the morning and immediately took to his bed and has not been out of it since . At first he was only slightly indisposed , and ioid to visitors who same to his bedside that he was suffering from cold , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse and weaker . lie was impatient under his confinement , as there were several contested election cases that he was anxious to attend to and get out of the way . The doctors were not alarmed about his condition . . until at length his stomach refused to retain nourishment owing to an attack of neuralgia of ' the bowels . The pain was very great and he took quantities of morphine to keep it down and quiet his system . Becoming weaker day after day he last Monday became very deapoudent , and when Capt . Nelms asked him how he felt he said : " I am going to die . " Capt . Nelms said he booed not , and remarked that the doctors did not think his condition dale gerous . " They may be fooled about it , " he replied . " I know exactly now much strength I have , and I believe I eming to die . " On Tuesday l he repeated the same thing to Capt .

" Under tho continued use of morphine he became very quiet , and was most of the time unconscious , with lucid intervals . Gov .

No one except the family physiolaa was admitted to his bedside . Yesterday about o'clock Dr. Raines announced that he was restinj quietly . There seemed to be little alarm among the members of the household . He had been so neat death 's door so often before , and had been rescued by such miracles of vitality and nerve that they counted confident 's , on his strength to pull him through this crisi4 . An invalid for 50 years and his life despaired of a dozen times  --  a condition that would awaken the greatest anxiety in any other person  --  was apparently looked on with little alarm in him . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday , and anxious faces on every side that showed plainly that apprehension was felt as to the strength of the old man who for half a century had been in constant conflict with death . In spite of everything that the attending PhY . Means were uble to do the condition of Gov . Stephens steadily grew worse . His system seemed to have tailed at last . Until yesterday there was hope of his early recovery , but as he grew worse all the time alarm took the place of hope . From what is said it is inferred that the Governor sun bored more from a general disorder and giving I way of his system than from any one of the partioular troubles with which he had had to battle before . He could take only liquid nourishment , chicken broth , beef-tea , and milk-punch . His stomach retained it , but the food would not assimilate . Dr. Raines at night remained in a room adjoining that of the Governor . Dr. Miller called as often as was necessary , and Dr. H. H. Steiner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several severe periods , came last night at the request of Drs . Miller and Raines . Col. R. F. Maddox called to see him yesterday morning , and found him vomiting between his gasps . The indomitable man looked up and said quickly : " Is that you , Spear ? " Col. Maddox corrected him , and Mr. Stephens said : " It is so dark I ca n't see you . " He thou said : " They say that this coffee is making me vomit . Well , the hair of a dog is good for a bite , so I believe take a little more . " Upon leaving the house Col. Maddox asked Aleck , the boy who attends Mr. Stephens , what he thought of his master 's condition . Aleck said : " I believe I have seen him as sick as this before . But I never saw him out of his hoed . I have noticed another thing for the past few weeks . He has been talking continually in his sleep , a thing I never heard him do before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literally worked himself to death . He insisted upon supervising every detail of his office and would not al:ow anything to be done without his direct orders . Gov . Stephens 's last official act was the signing of Senator Colquittie commission , witch Was issued a few days ago .
