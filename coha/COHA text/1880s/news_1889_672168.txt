txt The most that is now known of the disaster that has fallen upon the city of Johnstown is that it surpasses in its terrible fatality any previous recorded disaster arising from the breaking away of a body of waters contained by a dam of artificial construction . Even the extent of the destruction of life can only be conjectured , since where an entire city is swept away and the whole population of a valley is either drowned or driven from its homes , no accurate reckoning of the lives lost can be possible . Of the character of the North Fork Dam not enough is at present known to determine the question whether , as in the case of the ** flood in 1874 , gross neglect in construction is chargeable to its builders , or whether the flood came in such overmastering volume as would have swept away any structure that the skill of man might have erected . The rumors that leaks were discovered in the dam not long ago indicate that it was too weak for the weight of waters it had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its stability . The downpour of water , at all events , must have been extraordinary , leading to the usual description of it as a " cloud-burst . " The situation of the lake or pond , at the head of a thicklypopulated valley , and at a considerable elevation , in itself constituted a menace to life and property , and the unusual dimensions of the dam should have suggested the utmost vigilance in its maintenance . If it shall prove that the disaster was due to a phenomenal downfall of rain , not to be resisted by any human device , the only visible moral will lie that men should not build their habitations along watercourses which form the outlet of ponds or reservoirs ' artificially contained . But men have always been willing to take these risks , and they always will . The possibility that the loss of life will be found to exceed even the present estimates gives to the disaster a gravity which is not likely to be lessened until more definite accounts have been received .
