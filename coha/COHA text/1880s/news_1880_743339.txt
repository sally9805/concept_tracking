txt We have often noted it as one of the most striking proofs of the low estate to which the influence of the Tammany rule has brought our working classes , that no large , successful effort for co-operation had ever been made among them . ? The Philadelphia mechanics , artisans , and working men have long since made themselves comparatively independent of capital by their admirable Buildine. and Loan Associations , and have proved how wonderfully successful and able the business management of working men may be . But in New-York , with all its wealth and enterprise , there n ever h as b e en sufficient intelligence and public spirit among our artisans to originate and carry out any large , successful scheme of co-operation , whether in production or " distribution . " The simple fact seems to be that under the control of the Democratic Party , with its free distribution of spoils and places , the working classes become demoralized , and prefer to be dependent on political leaders and . ward partisans to combining for doing anything for themselves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representative working men in any scheme of co-operation . Their dependence on party lowers the tone of the whole , and they do not produce such leaders as Philadelphia , for instance , has brought to the front . The only instance of really successful co-operation ( though on a limited scale ) that we can recall in New-York is the Pilot Association , which has certainly been always very efficiently managed . A new movement has , however , been started in Brooklyn and New-York for co-operation , under the title of the Union Supply and Mutual Benefit Association , the office of the Secretary , J. H. WHITEHORNE , being at No. 595 Leonard-street , Brooklyn , and No. 291 Broadway , New York . Whether the Secretary is a member of the artisan class , we are not informed , but we note among the New-York Directors several names of highly-respectable citizens indeed , but not those of working men or known leaders of the mechanics and artisans . This we consider unfortunate , for the sueeess of this , as well as of any similar " building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the working men themselves doing the whole labor of founding and carrying on the movement . This is not a charity : a gift from the fortunate to the unfortunate . It is a business begun by the artisans themselves to compete with the ordinary " distributors " or retail merchants and the managers of the savings of working men , such as the savings banks and life insurance associations , and it will only succeed by great self-control , economy , and excellent business management on the part of laboring men themselves . The Directors ought not to be Doctors of Divinity , however learned , or philanthropists or ethical lecturers , or wealthy and benevolent citizens . They should be mechanics and working men who know how to save , who can carry on an . enterprise with the least possible expense , and who will gradually learn how to purchase goods , how to invest , and how to lend money . One great element of the success of the Philadelphia societies is the extraordinarily small expense of management , often not more than $200 or $300 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one can secure such a result but the working men themselves . It means , in point of fact , a noble sacrifice , by artisans of great ability , of large incomes for the sake of their fellows . When we hear of the brilliant financial success of the English factories in Rochdale we know that this is due to two or three working men who could have secured large salaries as managers elsewhere , but who were willing to receive small pay in a cooperative association for the sake of benefiting their class . There will be something of this in any successful co-operative movement here . The association , too , will receive  --  just as charities do among the rich ? a great deal of brain work and labor , for which it does not pay . For all these reasons , and , above all , because co-operation itself is the best possible education for the working classes , all co-operative societies should be managed by the working men themselves , and not by outside persons , however disinterested or influential . The plan of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the lowest wholesale cash prices ; to resell them at the market retail prices , and hold the difference ( less necessary expenses ) for division among the members . Capital is accumulated by the Profits thus obtained , and by a monthly payment of one dollar and five cents by each member for a " fund-certificate . " When the amount thus paid in by a member , with the dividends , equals the par value of the certificate , $50 , the holder is entitled to draw the full amount from the funds of the association . " By this system says the prospectus each mem. ber , by the simple act of transferring his custom from a merchant to the association , will at once cause the money he spends to supply his necessities to produce a profit for himself , which profit will assist in creating a capital with which to stock a store , in which he will be a part owner , and in the management of which ho will have an equal voice with all other members . " The elan is substantially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or mystery in it . It simply means that the association must buy and sell its groceries or dry goods so carefully as to make a profit , and that it must manage its business so economically as to be able to borrow money from its shareholders and customers , and divide a profit among them . It is a business which will demand excellent judgment of goods and markets , first-rate business habits , careful and systematic accounts , enterprise . and thorough honesty . If the Union Supply Society can secure all this , and the confidence of the working classes , it will succeed ; if not , it must fail . But when we remember that there are in Great Britain 1,281 such societies , with a total investment of $322806,115 , with total sales of $106,870,065 , and realizing profits each year of $9,935,600 , or at the rate of 28 per cent. , it would certainly seem that at least one co-operative society ought to succeed here .                  @ @ @
