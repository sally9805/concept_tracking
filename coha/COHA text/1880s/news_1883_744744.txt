txt Seth Hastings Grant , who has been private secretary to Mayor Edson since the latter took office on Jan. 1 , was appointed Controller of the City of New-York yesterday by Mayor Edson ; to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Allan Campbell . Mr. Grant 's name was not mentioned in connection with the Controllership until an hour or two before the announcement was made , and his appointment was a genuine surprise to the great majority of the local politicians . The Mayor 's office during the afternoon resembled a political headquarters during the week , before an election . it was thronged with politicians and City officers , all anxious to know who they would have to congratulate . Soon after the Mayor reached his office in the morning he said to a friend that he intended to appoint a Controller before the close of business hours . This statement quickly became public , and it was not long before curious politicians began to drop* into the Mayor 's office and hang around the various rooms and doorways . By noon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private room , from which the crowd was kept by two tightly locked doors guarded by a policeman . The Mayor spent three hours giving ' private audiences to vari ous well-known men , and at 3:15 o'clock the announcement was made that . Mr. Grant was the new Controller . A few moments later Mr. Grant made his appearance in the main office . ' ? He was instantly surrounded by the politicians and was compelled th shake hands until his right arm ached . Among those who ran in and out of the Mayor 's office during the day were ex-Controller John Kelly , President John Reilly , of the Board of Aldermen ; ex-Senator Thomas J. Creamer , Dock Commissioner William ' LaimEDr . Cyrus Edson , the Mayor . ' s son ; Col. E. ? T. Wood . that brother-in-law of . the Mayor 's ; Corporation Counsel George P. Andrews , Aqueduct Commissioner Spencer , Judge Michael Norton . Aldermen Jaehne , Rinckhoff , and Kirk , Supervisor . of the City Record Thomas Costigan , ex-Aldermen Michael Tuomey and George Hall , Thomas P. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finance Department , and lesser lights of the various Democratic factions . An hour or more before the appointment was made the story that Mr. Grant would probably be the Controller became current , but most of the crowd said they would not believe it until it was officially announced . The three men who were especially favored with private interviews with the Mayor were John Kelly , Corporation Counsel Andrews , and Col. E. T. Vv ood . It was understood that the honored leader of Tammany Hall was not inclined to look with favor upon the appointment of Mr. Grant , and that he labored Lard and long with the Mayor in the hope that Mr. Edson might yet ' be induced to name some man more acceptable to Tammany Hall . A story was also circulated to the effect that Mr. Kelly had asked the Mayor to name Col. Wood , Mr. Edson 's brother-in-law , but this was afterward denied . Mr. Kelly himself said , later in the day , that he had recommended the appointment of Andrew L. Soulard , President of the Sterling Fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Nineteenth Assembly District . He told the Mayor that Mr. Soulard was a good business man and also knew something about City affairs  --  a combination of qualifications which the Mayor had determined his selection must have . Mr. Edson replied that be had carefully looked over the field and had made up his mind that the new Controller must have some knowledge of the affairs of the City Government , Private Secretary Grant had such knowledge , and combined with it an excellent business ability . He was a natural statistician , reticent , of a disposition to be fair , and he would do justice to all parties . Mr. Kelly asked if Mr. Grant would make any changes in the personnel of the office , and the Mayor assured him that nothing in that line would be done at present , as it would not be wise to make changes before the Commissioners of Accounts made their report noon the affairs of the department . Whether Mr. Kelly was satisfied or not with the Mayor 's decision , it was noticed that when he left Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wore a smiling countenance . Mayor Edson said yesterday that he had offered the position of Controller to six or eight different business men , in each of whom he had implicit confidence as to their ability to properly fill the office . All had declined to accept the appointment for various reasons . The fact that there was a doubt in some minds as to whether the new Controller 's term would expire in May next or in December , 1a84 , had hindered some from taking the office , and the fact that the Finance Department was somewhat under a cloud because of the coupon frauds had also helped to influence their decisions . Mr. Grant , the ? Mayor said : was not appointed as a makeshift in any sense . He had thought of naming Mr. Grant , but be had been bothered as to who could be put In in his place as private secretary . A large number of persons had been recommended tof him for the Controllership , none of whom be had felt that he could appoint , because he did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position . He did not wish to appoint any man who would Immediately go to work turning things upside down in the department . He was satisfied that everything was " straight " in the Controller 's office except the coupon frauds already known , as the Commissioners of Accounts bad investigated far enough to show that the frauds already known covered all there were . The public , however , did not know just what condition the department was in , and the Mayor wished to see confidence restored and the credit of the City kept up . He had known Mr. Grant 15 years , and knew that he was thoroughly capable to fill the position of Controller . He had good organizing ability and would restore public confidence in the department . Controller Grant said he would file his $200 , - 000 bonds and take the oath of office this morning . He had no intention of making any changes in the office for the present at least . He should carefully look into affairs in the department , and make only such changes as he found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the last thing looked for by the politicians , they were very careful in expressing any opinions on the subject . They had not had time to think the matter over and to talk with the men in power . John Kelly , as representing Tammany Hall , declared that he was well enough pleased with the Mayor 's selection . The appointment belonged to Mayor Edson , he said , and be had a right . to name whom he pleased . He could not name all who were recommended , and , under all the circumstances , the choice of Mr. Grant was probably as good as any that could have been made . He had been assured by the Mayor that the appointment was not hastily made . Other Tammany Hall men contented themselves with saying that the selection might have been a good deal worse and that Mr. Grant owed a big debt of gratitude to Mayor Edson . Among County Democracy followers the same hesitancy to express opinions was observed . They were , however , fairly well satisfied , and they were delighted over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had felt that the new Controller would be a man entirely under Kelly 's thumb . " The Mayor might have put in a Controller , ' said a County Democrat , " who would have implicitly obeyed Kelly 's orders , but with Grant we will stand some show . " Politicians of all factions remarked that the Mayor had at least followed out his assertion that he would not name a politician for the place . The appointment was eniversallsr considered a personal one on the part of the Mayor , and many politicians talked of the great additional power in local affairs the appointment placed in Mr. Edson 's hands . It was taken for granted that the new Controller would carry out any instructious he might receive from the 1'iavor . By virtue of his office as Controller Mr. Grant becomes a member of the Croton Aqueduct Commission , the Board of .
