m HE charters for railways granted by I the Mexican government to American capitalists during the past four or five years will , if carried out , involve the construction of some five thousand miles of road , and an expenditure of from one hundred and twenty-five to one hundred and fifty millions of dollars . This is a large sum of money to part with , even for a country as rich as the United States , and it could be taken from no country in the world without seriously affecting its industry , commerce , and financial relations . The question whether such an investment will be remunerative is one , therefore , which concerns , not the capitalists alone , but only in a less degree every citizen of the United States . In submitting to our readers some of the considerations which must be taken into account in determining the extent to which the recent enthusiasm for railway investments in Mexico deserves to be encouraged , we shall endeavor to confine ourselves to uncontested facts and to uncontested principles of railway finance and economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation on the globe certainly offers many inducements to railway speculation . A territory larger than the combined territories of Great Britain , France , Spain , and the entire German Empire ; reaching from the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific Ocean , and forming what Humboldt some eighty years ago termed the bridge of the world 's commerce ; bounded by the United States for a distance of nearly two thousand miles ; with a physical conformation which enables her soils to yield the products of every climate and every zone ; with mineral deposits which have already yielded more than half of the existing stock of silver in the world , and which are believed by some to be still the richest on the globe ; without a single competing navigable , stream , or one that can ever be made navigable to advantage ; with a physical configuration which must forever preclude canalization ; with a population of ten millions , or only about one and seventy one - hundredths per square mile less than the population of the United States per square mile ; with twelve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand inhabitants ; and with a foreign commerce averaging ? rom seventy to eighty millions a year , though conducted with no better facilities of internal transportation than the backs of mules and some three hundred and fifty miles of railway-such a country certainly possesses some advantages for railway improvement that are not possessed in an equal degree by any other nation or people . But to all the blessings of this world conditions more or less serious are always attached . A country which enjoys the climate and yields the products of every zone within twenty-six degrees of latitude can hardly be expected to produce a homogeneous population , or to enjoy a climate altogether favorable to the growth and longevity of a hardy and powerful race of men . The greater portion of Mexico is from five to seven thousand feet above the level of the sea , and is invested with an abnormally rarefied atmosphere . Most of the remainder of Mexico lies along the coast , is very hot , and never free from malignant disease . Up to the present time no people-that is , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force - has ever flourished in so high an atmosphere as the Mexican plateau , or in so high an average temperature as her sea-board plains . People born under better conditions have frequently invaded and occupied Mexico , but all have failed to maintain themselves there-in part , perhaps , from the difficulty of doing so ; in part , also , perhaps , becanse the possession was not worth the cost . It is true that Mexico is the only country in which Providence has made such an experiment , but it is none the less true that thus far the experiment has not proved that she can ever become the seat of a ruling race . Mexico can hardly be said to have a single good sea - port , or one capable of being made adequate to the exigencies of modern maritime commerce . Nor has she a single navigable stream . In one sense this may justly be thought advantageous rather than prejudicial to a railway system , as it implies the absence of waterways , usually the most formidable of all kinds of competition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been devised so cheap as the ocean , yet to this day it contributes the largest portion of theirbusiness to all the railway systems of the globe . VOL . LXV. - No. 889-47 // Of the ten millions of people in Mexico , fully three - quarters are Indians , twothirds of whom can not read , nor ever had an ancestor that could , who never slept in a bed or wore a stocking , and who are accustomed to live at a less expense per day than a farm horse would cost in any New England State . These are none of them controlling considerations , perhaps , but in studying the natural attractions of Mexico for railway enterprise they must not be lost sight of . Whenever the future of Mexico comes under discussion , the first question which ! the foreign student asks is in regard to the ci* character and stability of her government , for upon them depend the security , and consequently the value , of property . It is safe to say that at no time since the conquest by Cortez have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at no time since the conquest , till within the last five or six years , have the Mexicans enjoyed any of the prerogatives of self-government , nor at any time during that period could they fairly be held responsible for any of the political follies and crimes which have made the name of Mexico the synonym for brigandage and misrule . It is a curious illustration of the methods by which God makes the wrath of men to praise Him , that the two Emperors of France should , of all men in the world , have proved the greatest benefactors of republican Mexico . By dethroning King Ferdinand and putting the crown of Spain upon the head of his brother , the first Napoleon provoked and rendered possible the political independence of Mexico , and her emancipation from the domination of Spain . In attempting to conciliate the Papal Church by founding an empire in Mexico for a prince of the house of Hapsburg , the third Napoleon precipitated her emancipation from the domination of priests , and restored her for the first time in three centuries to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restored Mexico to the Mexicans , but the humiliating conditions upon which he withdrew his expeditionary army from her territory in the years 1866 and 1867 involved a memorable recognition of the inviolability of American soil , and taught a lesson of non-interference which will not be lost upon any of the foreign potentates and powers on the other side of the Atlantic . His retreat placed Mexico , if not under the protection , at least under the shelter , of the government of the United States forever , or so long as the United States shall be able to offer her shelter . The results of this double emancipation deserve to be ranked among the marvels of our time . Mexico has a constitution in which the rights of the people are as carefully guarded as ours under the constitution of the United States . Her government is apparently as stable ; her elections , however illegitimate may be some of the influences operating upon the electors , are conducted as orderly and as quietly as in the United States or in England . Pronunciamentos and revolutions have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire for peace and order , and respect for authority and law , in defiance of great and obvious abuses , incident , as a matter of course , to the exercise of new and unfamiliar political powers , is apparently as thoroughlynational and unanimous as in the United States . For more than five consecutive years peace and order have prevailed in every important city of the republic ; occasional attempts at revolution have been made in isolated districts far away from the centres of population and beyond the reach of the Federal authorities , but all of them ' proved abortive , and succumbed to the new-born sentiments of national hope and pride . Protected as they now feel themselves against the intrigues and conspiracies and greed of foreign powers , the Mexicans are already manifesting conspicuous devotiom to the arts of peace . The recent removal of the fortifications around the city of Vera Cruz contains in a nutshell a history of the prodigious revolution which ha taken place in their condition , sentiments , . and aspirations . But while the Mexican government exhibits so many elements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the facts : 1 . That four-fifths of her population do not read , and are therefore not only without any political education , but equally inaccessible to those public considerations by which through the press and the tribune the measures of an administration may be commended to the popular judgment , or peacefully resisted . Meetings of the people for the discussion of publie* * It is but a few years since one-fourth  --  and some authorities say one-third-of all the property , real and personal , in Mexico , belonged to the Church . // measures are practically unknown , and though , of late , ample freedom is enjoyed by the press for the discussion of political questions , and though this freedom is liberally exercised by the metropolitan journals , it is needless to say that they reach and inform hut a very inconsiderable portion of the population. * * Supplementary to what we have said on this subject , the following remarks of an enlightened correspondent of the New York Evening Post , writing from Mexico , April 11 , 1882 , may he read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President 's Message , again , in writing something ahout the condition of the suffrage in this country . General Gonzalez informs Congress , as a thing worthy of note , that the elections for judges of the Supreme Court and for the Attorney-General of the nation have been held in all the republic , excepting a few remote districts . ' The very fact that he should think it worth while to speak of such . a thing shows something of what the state of the case has been . Peaceful and universal elections have been a rare thing ; and the truth appears to be at present that the peace and quiet of the elections is simply the peace and quiet of lethargy or death . It has been amusing to notice the announcements in reference to these very elections to which General Gonzalez alludes , furnished by the Dierio Oficial from time to time . On such a Sunday the election for Supreme Judge in such a district took place , and the result is that such a man is chosen unanimously-by thirty votes , it may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So the records have been running . The organ of the government maintains a grave face , and speaks of the choice of the people , while the truth is , as the figures show , and as the opposition newspapers boldly assert , that the elections are the merest farces , simply a cumbrous way of declaring the will of the Executive . The Mionitor charges the gravest irregularities on the government in the matter of advertising and managing the elections , and declares that in the recent choice of judges not a dozen votes were cast in the whole country outside of civil and military officials , and that the successful candidates in every case are from the innermost circle of Gonzalez 's partisans . The facts seem to be that , what with the indifference and ignorance of the people , and the intriguing of the party in power , Mexican elections are managed with a method and precision which might be the envy of a New York city caucus . The plan of indirect voting , with the opportunity for Congress to constitute itself a returning board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work of this sort . " Of course the thought at once suggests itself that these elections , though for important offices , are not of the sort to arouse popular interest , and that they are consequently not a fair gauge of the popular participation in the choice of rulers . There is some truth in this ; but a recurrence to the official figures for the last three Presidential elections will not better the matter much . At the second election of Juarez a total vote of 12,361 was cast by a population of 8,836,000 . After the death of Juarez , Lerdo , in 1872 , was chosen President by 10,465 votes , with less than 1000 against him , all told . Revolution , not the suffrage , determined the succes 2 . The Mexicans , like all the Latin race , are inveterate gamblers . To this habit they have been trained both by Church and State for generations , and of all the aleatory devices for improving their fortunes there is none to which they are more addicted than the game of revolution . Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great , the risks also are very great , and are rarely if ever incurred except when for one reason or another industry is disorganized , large classes of people are without visible means of support , and starvation or the highway seems to be their only alternative . Thanks to the large amounts of American capital which are now finding employment in Mexico , and to the wise economies of the government , which this capital has contributed in no small degree to render possible , the revolutionary tendency seems to be almost if not altogether extinct ; but like causes will always produce like effects . So long as the present prosperity of the country continues , and labor is abundant at good wages , the revoluitionary forces in Mexico will not be formidable , and the government will be strong enough - to hold them easily in check . How long American capital can afford to nourish Mexican industry ; how much of an interval must elapse before the firm and stable government , with such assistance , can make a permanent and remunerative market for labor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a nation into a due respect for the arts and industries of peace , are questions presenting so many elements of uncertainty as to render any attempt to forecast the political destinies of our sister republic extremely difficult . The risks of railway property , like every other , in case of revolutionary disturbances , are of course very great . It is always difficult , and it has usually proved impossible , for railway corporations to so con- sion in 1876 . In 1880 , 11,528 votes were recorded in favor of Gonzalez , with no appreciable opposition . " This , for a people with practically universal suffrage , is no great credit to republican institutions . In fairness , however , one must remember the many palliatin* circumstances . The decision of the sword has been so often put above that of the baMot that the popular will has come to think , not unnaturally , that it is scarcely worth any pains to express itself . For this reason it is that patriotic Mexicans are looking anxiously forward to the Presidential election of 1884 as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of peace have restored political confidence and caused a greater popular desire to exercise the right of suffrage . " // duct in times of civil war as to satisfy both of the belligerents , and if the faction they offend happens to triumph , the railways , from their greater command of ready mon*y and from their strategic importance , are naturally the first victims of its rapacity . The Vera Cruz and Mexican Railway , the first of any importance constructed in Mexico , and still the only one which connects the capital with the sea-coast , waspartially confiscated and its work of construction suspended for a period of three years because of its supposed complicity with the late imperial government of Maximilian ; and though danger from revolutionary disturbance seems now almost reduced to a minimum in Mexico , any road running from any portion of her frontier to the capital has to pass through such long stretches of sparsely settled or wholly unsettled country that its trains are constantly exposed to lawless marauders and more or less organized banditti . When the stranger landing at Vera Cruz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city of Mexico , his curiosity is aroused by the approach , a few moments before the train is to start , of a squad of soldiers , who are marched into a car specially set apart for them . Upon inquiry , he learns that they are sent to guard the train . Upon his arrival at the different stations on the journey he will not fail to notice also a squad of cavalry drawn up near the station-house , which upon inquiry he finds are charged with the same duty , with the additional one of looking after the soldiers , who , meantime , are locked up in their car . These precautions are taken not only on the railroads , but on all the stage routes on which the precious metals are transported to any extent . The diligence from Mazatlan to Guadalajara is usually escorted with not less than six mounted soldiers , who are changed every two hours . The writer was informed by a gentleman who recently made the journey that the day they arrived at Guadalajara the diligence going out was attacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty men in broad daylight . The escort and passengers defended themselves , and finally drove the robbers off , but not until both parties had been largely re-enforced . The Mexican Central road , now in process of construction , from the city of Mexico to El Paso , and which for some months has been running its trains as far as Queretaro , carries no guards , and its local agents are sanguine that such protection will be unnecessary . More experienced railway authorities in Mexico , however , say that when they shall have occasion to carry much of the precious metals , they will find it necessary to conform to the " usages of the country . " It would be wrong , however , to ascribe the insecurity which makes such precautions necessary to anything peculiar to the Mexican people and government . The same precautions for the transport of valuable property through any unsettled country would be equally prudent . There have been more train robberies perpetrated and property of greater value taken by highwaymen in the United States during the past six years than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the territorial area of the two countries . * * To show that we are doing our own country no injustice , and also for the purpose of cultivating modesty and reserve among our people in their judgments of the Mexican , and indeed of all foreign civilizations , we can not do better than recall some details of the familiar and recently terminated career of Jesse James . If Mexico has ever developed such a lawless and formidable ruffian , to say nothing of tolerating his villainies as we have done for an entire generation , neither history nor tradition has preserved any record of it . Incredible as the statement seems , it is nevertheless true that this man , or rather monster , at the age of thirty-seven , was either principal or accessory to the murder of one hundred and twenty-five individuals , thirty-six defenseless citizens falling by his hands alone at the memorable Lawrence ( Kansas ) massacre ; while at Sedalia , Missouri , the following year , he and two associates shot , in cold blood , thirtytwo invalid Union soldiers en route to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volunteers coming to their rescue were ambushed and killed to a man so that in less than two hours eighty ghastly corpses were piled about the village . In 1865 he robbed a bank in Russeilville , Kentucky , of $12,500 ; also one in Gallatin , Missouri , of all its funds , and deliberately shot and killed the cashier . After spending two years in Mexico , he and his brother returned to their former haunts , and heralded their advent by robbing the bank at Corydon , Iowa , of $40,000 . In 1872 he raided a bank at Columbia , Kentucky , and shot the cashier and his assistant . Next he seized at noonday $10,000 of the funds of the County Agricultural Fair , at Kansas City , in the presence of thousands of spectators , who seemed paralyzed at his audacity , though in all these transactions he was armed to the teeth . This was followed in six weeks by the robbery of the Bank of St. Genevieve , in the same state . In 1873 a train on the Chicago , Rock Island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ messenger relieved of $6000 . Next came the Gadshill robbery , where James and his pals took possession of the station , switched the train on to a side track , and at their leisure stripped the passengers and express messenger of $12,000 . A large reward being offered for their capture , a posse of officers were dispatched by Allan Pinkerton , of Chicago , a // In estimating the political forces bearing upon the railway question in Mexico , we must not lose sight of the profound and well-earned distrust of foreign governments , and especially of the American , which is universal in Mexico . The Mexican people are intensely patriotic : there are none more so : and never were they more patriotic than now , when their national pride is beginning for the first time almost in centuries to receive its natural aliment . They do not forget that their country has been twice dismembered , and more than half their territory taken from them by a sister republic which is always claiming for itself the special mission of Scotchman by birth , and one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add , however , the pursuit ended in the death or wounding of nearly every one sent on the perilous mission . In 1874 , by placing obstructions on the track , they robbed a passenger train on the Kansas Pacific Railroad , near Muncie , of $25,000 . In 18 ' 75 the Bank of Huntingdon was sacked , and the cashier , at the muzzle of a revolver , compelled to give up $5500 . Pursuit following , one of the bandits was killed and another captured , but the James brothers made good their escape . In July , 1876 , the eastward-hound train on the Missouri Pacific Railroad was robbed at Otterville , twenty miles east of Sedalia , and $15,000 taken from the safe in the express car . In the following September an attempt was made to sack the bank at Northfield , Minnesota , which ended in failure , though in the instant death of the cashier . Pursuit was immediately given by the citizens ; three of the outlaws were killed , and three severely wounded , who are now serving life sentences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the James brothers succeeded in ultimately baffling their pursuers , and escaped into Texas . In the fall of 1879 , returning to Missouri , the hand was re-enforced , and on October 5 a passenger train on the Chicago , Alton , and St. Louis Railroad was boarded by a gang of masked ruffians , at a small station named Glendale , and $30,000 secured as booty . In 1881 the night express on the Rock Island and Pacific Railroad was again robbed , near Winston , the conductor shot , and the messenger and passengers deprived of their valuables . The alarming frequency of these depredations at last aroused the Governor of Missouri and the railroad officials to a sense of their duty , and a reward of $50,000 was offered for the body of Jesse James . The result is told in his cold-blooded assassination in his own house , in an unguarded moment while divested of his weapons , by a treacherous comrade who had won his confidence-fitting end to such a record of crime , though a sad commentary on our civilization and jurisprudence , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplish what the authorized representatives of the law have for years been unable to effect . Immediately after the funeral , Ford , his assassin , was arrested , at the instance of Mrs. James , for murder , tried , found guilty , and sentenced to be hanged on the 19th of May last , on which day he received from the Governor of Missouri an unconditional pardon . protecting all American nationalities from foreign intervention . Of the entire Mexican population there is but a very limited number sufficiently acquainted with foreign politics to know that the predatory impulse of which they so justly complain , and from which they have sustained such humiliating and inexcusable injuries , no longer exists ; that the crimes of which slave property was the fruitful parent have been expiated by a long , bloody , and costly civil war ; and that there is no important interest in America that would be promoted-it would be safe , though perhaps unnecessary , to add that would not be prejudiced-by the addition of all or any part of Mexican territory to the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This view , though as yet shared by few in Mexico , will , we are inclined to believe , spread , and in the course of time take possession of the country . Meantime it is not to be disguised that the efforts making to unite the two countries more intimately by commercial highways , though they carry with them peace , order , and prosperity , to which Mexico has for centuries been a stranger , are regarded with great mistrust and suspicion ; and could the voice of the whole nation find expression upon the subject , we have no doubt that it would pronounce rather for taking up every rail which has been laid between the city of Mexico and our frontier than for putting another down . No one visiting Mexico , and talking with the people not immediately interested in the railway enterprises or specially enlightened upon the point , would long have any illusions on this subject . There is a great deal of wealth in Mexico , and the Mexicans have great business sagacity and capacity for affairs , yet the temptations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coolest heads in Wall Street and Threadneedle Street can hardly be said to have opened the purse of a single Mexican . We doubt if among all the railways chartered to unite Mexico with the United States , and upon which already many millions of dollars have been expended , fifty thousand dollars , if half that sum , has been contributed by Mexicans . This singular reluctance to profit by opportunities which have been the constant theme of the Mexican as well as of the American press may be due in part to a chronic sense of the insecurity of all property which can be readily // reached and laid under contribution by a necessitous and desperate faction or government , and partly-probably in a greater degree  --  to a fear of the consequences of being interested in an American enterprise of that character , in case it should ever be made the instrument by which the American government might attempt to repeat the crimes of 1837 and 1847 . It deserves here also to be mentioned that the Latin Church , though no longer as formidable for mischief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church of the country , and its influence is used , and very effectively , among the masses of the people to discourage the railway invasion of Mexico , and this re-enforcement of the actual government , with which it is not in sympathy , by such a powerful Protestantizing influence from the United States . Another evidence of this not wnnatural mistrust of foreign influence may be found in some of the provisions of all these Mexican concessions . None of the differences that may arise between the incorporators and the Mexican government can be made the subject of representation or complaint to any foreign government ; the very act of making such a representation works a forfeiture of the charter , and a practical confiscation of its property . We will now pass to a consideration of some of the more important material conditions upon which a railway system in Mexico must depend . The first questions to be considered are , what is the existing demand for railways ? and to what extent can that demand be increased ? The natural resources of Mexico both agricultural and mineral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been a little overestimated . Most of her soil is rich , and in no country in the world are the products of all the zones concentrated within so small an area , but over the greater part of MexLco not a drop of rain falls for eight consecutive months of the year . Agriculture , therefore , in Mexico implies a costly system of irrigation where irrigation is possible . How large a portion of the territory is susceptible of irrigation no one is competent to say , for the hydrography of Mexico yet remains to be studied ; but nothing but a scarcity of water and the costliness of irrigation can explain the fact that by far the larger portion of the territory of Mexico , with its ten millions of inhabitants , is still a howling wilderness which has never felt the tread of the ploughman nor the hand of the husbandman , while the most productive portions of her territory , which lie along her ample coast , are so unhealthy for three - quarters of the year as to be practically uninhabitable to any person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mineral resources of Mexico perhaps have not been exaggerated , and yet they do not seem to contribute in any corresponding proportion to the substantial prosperity of the country . Perhaps mining at its best is such a purely gambling business that the country engaging in it suffers as much as it gains , not to say more , from the demoralization and thriftlessness incident to such a business . Be this as it may , there is a shorter way perhaps of determining to what extent the natural resources of the country invite additional facilities for transportation . It was the judgment expressed to the writer by two of the most experienced railroad men in Mexico that the new business developed by railways there thus far averaged about five per cent . every five years . This estimate was based largely if not entirely upon the traffic of the road connecting Vera Cruz with the capital . This line , with its branches , is 365 miles long , and since it was completed , in 1873 , has had the practical monopoly of all the railway transportation in Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; 326 passengers , and in 1880 , 313,348 , or a daily average of 787 passengers in 1879 , and 858 in 1880 ; but its daily average of through passengers was only nine . In November of last year this company declared a dividend of ? 4 on each ? 100 of stock for the previous six months , which , with the dividends declared the previous half-year , is equivalent to an annual dividend of about five per cent . This was the first year this road has paid a dividend on all its stock since it was opened in 1873 . The explanation of this sudden increase of traffic may be found in the following passages of the annual report of the directors , and they throw important light upon the question we are studying : " The two main causes of the largely increased div. idend may be very simply stated ; they are , a great increase in traffic , and a small proportionate increase of working expenses . Nor is there any difficulty in tracing the nature of this increase of traffic . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but on goods there has been a total increase of about ? 120,000 , of which three-fourths , or // THE RAILWAY INVASION OF MEXICO . ? 90,000 , has arisen from the greatly increased carriage of railway materials , and one-fourth , or ? 30,000 , from the development of general traffic . About four4ifths of the transport of railway materials has been on account of the two great American companies , the Central and the National , and one-fifth on account of a variety of local railways and enterprises . ... . The question naturally suggests itself whether the increase of traffic , which has been so great and so sudden , is likely to be of a permanent character . The directors can only submit to the proprietors such considerations as seem most worthy of attention , and leave the proprietors to draw their own inferences . It is obvious that if the two great American companies come to any pause in their present field of operations , the increased revenue derived from the carriage of materials from Vera Cruz to Mexico would be largely diminished , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the object of both companies is to connect Mexico with the United States , there may be a point at which it will be natural for them to devote the greater part of their energies to working from the northern end , and bringing their materials from their own country . It was through a considerable increase in the carriage of railway materials that the distribution of a full dividend to the Second Preference stockholders was made possible in the half-year preceding that under review , and the increase of ordinary traffic noticeable in the present half-year might be wholly or partially absorbed before the amount of the dividend distributable to the ordinary stockholders could come under consideration if a very large reduction took place in the amount received from the carriage of railway materials . Further concessions for railways on a large scale have recently been given , but it would be premature at present to offer any opinion as to whether the undertakings thus contemplated are likely to be carried out ; and it may be said of most of these undertakings that while some , if carried out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there are others which have been partly begun , and which , if carried out , might divert a portion of the traffic at present commanded by the company . It may be added that the duties in the Mexican ports have lately been considerably increased , and it remains to be seen whether this increase of duties , which were already very high , will or will not check the importation of foreign goods . " In other words , this important railway , having a practical monopoly of the inland transportation of the foreign commerce of the country , is only able , after seven years of service , to make a dividend of five per cent . by enjoying the exclusive transportation of railway material from tide-water to the two American railways now constructing in Mexico . When we add that this road receives an annual subsidy of $560,000 from the Mexican government-equal to about one-half the earnings over and above fixed charges-we are forced to the conclusion that railway property which depends upon the industries and natural growth of the country , if not precarious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some new ele ments of prosperity can be grafted upon it . This , we believe , is the conviction of all who have studied the question . All the schemes for new roads which have been presented to the American public have recognized it , and the new element upon which they all rely is emigration . Reasoning from their experience of railways in the United States , they assume that emigration will follow the locomotive through the wilds of Mexico as promptly and copiously as it has done through the prairies of Iowa and through the metalliferous deposits of Colorado and Nevada . In their imagination they see thriving villages springing up at every station , and their rolling stock immediately taxed to its utmost capacity in transporting the merchandises which they consume and produce . It is from conclusions such as these that dreams are made . A few words will suffice to show how utterly delusive are all calculations based upon emigration as a railroad factor in Mexico . In the first place , Mexico has offered , and can offer , none of the inducements to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no public lands to appropriate for such a purpose , even if her government were reckless enough to squander them as we have been squandering ours for the last thirty years . In the next place , most of the railways in the United States west of the Alleghanies have received land enough with their charters , with proper economies , to return the cost of the roads to their stockholders . The Mexican roads , on the other hand , have no land grants ; they have nothing to offer to emigrants but free passes over their roads to a country where they will be strangers , among a people whose language they do not understand , to cope with a climate , soil , and agricultural exigencies of which they have had no experience , and where they must compete with a laboring class that has been accustomed for centuries to live upon less than a shilling a day . When we contrast the inducements which a railway in Mexico offers to an emigrant from the Old World with those which welcome him when he lands upon our shores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tributaries , it is obvious that no family or man in his senses would double the length of his journey to find a home in Mexico . But it may be said that land may be bought in Mex // ico very cheaply , in a climate that knows none of the expenses or privations of our Northern winters . True , land may be bought very cheaply in Mexico , cheaper than in the United States even from the government , and the land of as good quality , perhaps , as our best ; but it must be bought in very large tracts to be cultivated to any advantage , or even to be made habitable , and this brings us to what seems to be the one insuperable and conclusive objection to emigration as a resource of railway enterprise in Mexico . As we have already intimated , the rainfall in Mexico is limited to the four months of June , July , August , and September . It is unusual for enough rain to fall during the remaining eight months to lay the dust . Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon irrigation . The principal portion of the water for the irrigation of the republic of Mexico during the dry months is stored in the form of ice and snow upon the summits of her mountains . Wherever the water supplied by the melting of these mountain snows can be carried , agriculture is possible , and if not carried at too great an expense , profitable ; but where this water can not be carried it is practically impossible . It is in consequence of this necessity of controlling at least a portion of the water of these mountain streams which has delivered over the territory of Mexico to a comparatively small number of proprietors . Of course a small farm not on a stream or owning a right to divert its waters to its use would be of little if any value . To meet this difficulty it is proposed , and we understand that projects are maturing for the organization of land companies , to buy these large estates , which can be had in unlimited quantities at prices ranging from $500 to $1000 the square league , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The only way in which such a project would prove of any avail to the emigrant would be for the land company to construct the canals , and distribute the water so that it should be accessible to every farm for which it could find a purchaser . This , of course , would involve a degree of trouble and expense which would be very difficult , not to say impossible , to estimate , and for that reason , if no other , would not be particularly captivating to capitalists . The railways when finished might find themselves compelled to undertake it , but many years must elapse before it could be proved to be profitable or cease to be a costly experiment . Meantime the railway must depend upon local business and the natural growth of the industries and commerce of the country for its success , and judging from the roads already in operation , we venture to say that that success will not be of a very intoxicating character . It is true there has been a considerable emigration pouring into Mexico during the past year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps , but it ha*i consisted mainly of Italians and negroes , who have been brought there at the expense of railway contractors to work on the roads ; and those of them who do not succunib to the climate will , when their contracts expire , either return to their respective countries or remain a burden rather than a source of wealth to their adopted country . There has been , and in the nature of the case there can be , no spontaneous emigration to Mexico until she can offer far different and greater inducements than she has yet been able to offer , or until the now vacant lands of the United States are practically withdrawn froni the market . This element of prosperity , therefore , which has contributed so largely to build up the railway system of the United* States , can not be counted upon in Mexico , and her railways must depend mainly upon the native industries and natural growth of the country , which , as we have already remarked , is estimated at an average of about one per cent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase of facilities , but to no very considerable extent for the first fifteen or twenty years . Recognizing this difficulty , the Mexican government , as a substitute for land which it has not to give , has sought to stimulate railway enterprise by a general system of subsidies . Most of the charters it has granted carry with them a subsidy equal to about one-third of the cost of the road . These subsidies , however , are coupled with such conditions , and carry with them such obligations , as to render them , to say the least , of doubtful advantage to the company . But for the facilities they afford for borrowing money in foreign markets , it is safe to say that they are a positive disadvantage , at least such is the impres // sion we have derived from a comparison of the charters granted thus far to roads with and to roads without subsidies . We will illustrate our statement by a comparison of some of the provisions of the charters of the Mexican National Construction Company , commonly known as the Palmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonly known as the Frisbie-Huntingdon Concession . 1 . Construction materials of all kinds are exempt from duties for fifteen years on the Mexican National ; for twenty-five years on the International . 2 . The National is authorized to charge for first-class freight four cents a ton ; the International , ten cents . The National is authorized to charge for secondclass freight three cents a ton ; the International , seven cents . The National is authorized to charge for third-class freight two cents a ton ; the Intcrnational , five cents . For passengers : the National may charge for first-class , per kilometer , two and a half cents ; the International , seven cents . The National may charge for second-class , per kilometer , two cents ; the International , five cents . The National may charge for third-class , per kilometer , one cent ; the International , three cents . 3 . The tariff of the National may be diminished by the consent of the company , butt can not be increased ; the tariff of the International may be increased until a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized . 4 . The National may vary its tariffs with the cost and difficulties in operating its line at different points , but the above rates must never be exceeded in any one kilometer ; the International may vary the rates in such difficult places without reference to the distance run . 5 . The National is required to carry Mexican cereals , which constitute a very considerable portion of the freight of the country , as third-class freight , that is , at the rate of two cents a ton for each kilometer , or , say , three and a quarter cents per mile , and railway construction material at thirty per cent . off the price of third-class freight ; the International is subject to no such restrictions . 6 . The National must deduct sixty per cent . from the regular rates for the transport of troops , artillery , or baggage trains , munitions of war , equipment , provisions , horses , mules , and any other effects destined for the public service , all military forces , Federal employ*s , and , finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The International is required to transport the mails , and the officers in charge , gratuitously for five years after the completion of the road , when " new contracts on bases more equitable than those enjoyed by the public " will be entered into . The government , also , will have the preference over individuals for the transport of their correspondence , passengers , and material ; in case of war or revolution , the government may use the road to the exclusion of all other traffic , while the war or revolution lasts , by paying the established tariff with the rebate of five per cent . 7 . The government reserves the right to put up two wires on the telegraph poles of the National , and to require the company to maintain them as its own , the government to have the exclusive use of them ; no such burden is imposed upon the International . 8 . The National is required to build a light-house at its terminal point on the Pacific , which , when completed , becomes the absolute property of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ International . 9 . With each section of engineers employed on the surveys of the National must be an engineer designated by the Executive , with a salary , also to be fixed by the Executive at a sum not to exceed $4000 a year , to be paid by the company . As each section is about one hundred miles , for the 2000 miles or more embraced in the Palmer and Sullivan Concession there would be required about twenty of these ornamental engineers , at a salary not likely to be less than $4000 , and amounting , therefore , in the aggregate , to $80,000 a year , or in that proportion for whatever part of the work is under survey . The International is free from these conditions . 10 . Two of the directors of the National are to be appointed by the Executive , at a salary to be fixed by him , not to exceed $4000 a year . The government is authorized to name one or two directors of the International , but his salary is to be paid by the government . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for non-completion of the road within the time prescribed , or for any other cause , the National becomes the property of the government at its appraised value , from // which all subsidies paid are first deducted , free from all incumbrances , and the franchise maybe resold . For whatever balance may be found due , the government issues its bonds at nine per cent. , to be paid by the purchasers of the charter ; in other words , in such an event all the bonds secured by mortgage on the road are confiscated , and in case of any of the stockholders or others attempting to save their property by reorganizing the company and completing the road , they would be compelled to pay nine per cent . a year on the appraised value of the road until it was redeemed . In case of a corresponding failure to complete its road by the International , that company , on the other hand , loses its charter , but will retain its property in the buildings and such parts of the road and telegraph lines as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and tools employed on its works , for which it is entitled to be paid at their appraised value . To have a more definite notion of the importance of some of these discriminations against the subsidized roads , let us look at the practical results of some of them . Grain is one of the principal articles for which transportation has to be provided in Mexico . The Mexican National is required to carry it as third-class matter , and at the rate of two cents a ton for each kilometer it is hauled . The International , an unsubsidized road , may carry it as second or third class , and if as third class , may charge five cents for the same service . Now , to get some notion of the practical results of this difference , we will take the operations of the Vera Cruz road as our standard . This road , for the year ending June 20 , 1881 , carried up and down a total of 26,116 tons . For that service the National would receive $522 per kilometer , while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third class at five cents , and $1828 a kilometer if carried as second class at seven cents . The National received a subsidy for 1125 kilometers of road , from the Junction to Laredo . It would receive , then , for the transport of 26,116 tons of grain over this portion of its line but $587,250 . For the same service , and charging only as thirdclass freight , the International would receive $1,469,025 : difference , $881,775 . Again , the National is required to carry railway material for thirty per cent . off the prices of second-class freight . The railway material transported on the Vera Cruz road the last fiscal year amounted to 34,435 tons , which , at thirty per cent . off second-class freight , would yield only $484 a kilometer . The International for the same service would receive at least $1711 per kilometer , or , for 1125 kilometers , $1,834,875 ; the National would receive only $534,500 : difference , $1,300,375 . The burden borne by the subsidized road for the transport of troops and munitions of war is proportionately onerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard . The number of miles run on this road last year , for passengers in service of the War Department was 1,009,056 ; for civilians , 7,923,820 ; that is , about oneeighth of all the passengers carried over the line paid sixty per cent . less than the regular fare . The number of ton miles of civil goods traffic was The number of ton miles of military goods traffic was The earnings of the civil freight . military freight ... Difference 9,913,403 2,386,923 $1,992,325 221,990 $1,770,335 or about one-ninth of the pay for more than one-fourth of the work . The International would have been entitled to receive about $400,000 for what the National could receive only about $200,000 , a difference of , say , $500 a kilometer , or , for the Laredo branch of the National , 1125 miles , a difference of , say , $*50,000 a year . Here we have on three classes only of freight a discrimination against the subsidized roads which would result in a difference of net earnings , ccctcris paribus , of $2,858,150 a year , as follows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military service 550,000 $2,733,150 The subvention accorded to the National road by the Mexican government for its branch from the Junction to Laredo is 6500 a kilometer , or $7,272,500 for the 1125 kilometers . From these figures we are authorized to infer that the discriminations against subsidized roads would take from them more than the whole amount of their subsidies in about three years . It is unnecessary to carry these calculations farther . Those we // have given make it sufficiently clear that in an economical point of view the unsubsidized roads have presumptively the advantage of the subsidized roads for all purposes except , perhaps , for selling their bonds in foreign markets . On general principles subsidies do not form the foundation on which to construct a sound railway system , but it is no doubt a wise policy for Mexico to make use of them to get roads built through her territory by foreign capital for one-third their actual cost . In offering subsidies , therefore , at the rate of from six to eight thousand dollars a kilometer , she takes no risks ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better for her . The risk is with the capitalist who places his money where the business that is to make his investment profitable is yet to be developed ; where he is liable to have competing lines constructed faster than they can be needed ; where , in case the government should become financially embarrassed , it would naturally begin its economies by suspending its subsidies , and in case of war , appropriate the road to its own uses at unremunerative rates . Then it is always one of the unfortunate conditions of subsidized enterprises that the money designed for their encouragement does not reach the parties for whom the law designs it , and the impression sooner or later gets possession of the public mind that the corporations subsidized enjoy privileges corruptly obtained . The practical effect of this is to keep them ever on the defensive , which , as all experienced railway managers know , is apt to be costly . On the other hand , it is proper here to observe that in Mexico , as elsewhere , the companies that do not receive subsidies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmoniously with the government than those companies that receive subsidies . In some way which none but the initiated can explain , but which all who have had any experience in such matters understand , the subsidies serve in some way to lubricate the political machinery upon which large railway corporations are always more or less dependent , especially if owned by foreigners ; but this method of lubrication once begun is liable to constitute a permanent charge of ever increasing costliness . If suspended , difficulties of adaninistration , originating in unimaginable ways and in the most unexpected quarters , are pretty sure to multiply , for the devil is the most inexorable of all creditors . We have spoken of the subsidies as amounting on an average to about onethird the cost per mile of the roads . It must not be understood , however , that all this money is paid in cash , and as fast as the road is built . It is payable in revenue bonds ; that is , out of the proceeds of from four to six per cent . of the maritime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's receipts , therefore , from these bonds must depend always more or less upon the activity of its foreign commerce . In addition to the uncertainties of this charge upon the public revenue , it is feared by many that the Mexican government has already incurred more obligations of this sort than she has any fair prospect of being able to make good . If we do not share this opinion entirely , it is because we expect that the greater portion of the grants already issued will be forfeited . Since 1867 the republic has issued charters for over fifteen thousand miles of railroad , with subsidies attached amounting to over one hundred and seventy millions of dollars . Some of these grants have already expired by limitation , and been declared forfeited . Deducting the amounts that have already been paid by the government upon portions of the roads already constructed and accepted , there remains to be paid as subsidies under existing and still valid charters about ninety millions of dollars . This is a large liability for a government whose annual revenues are esteemed eminently prosperous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose of floating bonds in the markets of a country where railroad building has been so eminently successful and remunerative as in ours , a subsidy of from ten to twelve thousand dollars per mile is a gratuity not to be despised ; but when all the conditions which accompany this subsidy are carefully considered by those who are ultimately to depend upon the earnings of the road for their income , it may well be doubted whether the subsidy will not in every case prove to the stockholders a mortgage rather than a bounty . There is another class of difficulties which the railway undertaker has to encounter in Mexico which , if an American , he is not likely to anticipate . The government naturally desiring for its money // durable work that will involve in the future the minimum of cost for repairs , habitually insists upon the use of the most durable material . Where over a ravine in America the road would first be built upon an inexpensive trestle - work , in Mexico it must be built of stone in solid masonry , though there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred miles of the work . This often involves very considerable delay and an additional expense , which in the United States would be postponed until it could be paid , if at all , out of the net earnings of the road . Then , again , the line of the road once selected and reported to the government , can not be deviated from a single inch without a plan and drawing of the deviation being made , submitted to andapproved by the government in the city of Mexico , so that if in the progress of their work they come to a place where by changing the line of the road a rod or two or a yard or two they may avoid a costly piece of rock cutting or bridge work , or substantially shorten their lines , or effect any other important economy , they may be obliged to suspend the work of large gangs of men and their engineers for days or weeks , if they should be far from the seat of government , before they could get the required approval of the change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive to follow the original though less advantageous route than to incur the interruptions incident to a change . The inflexibility of the Mexican government upon this point has taught the companies whose lines have been already traced some expensive lessons , and will render all preliminary surveys in future much more tedious and costly than they need be in a country where the land itself is of so little value . There is another tax upon railway enterprise in Mexico of which we have seen no note made in any of the numerous programmes to which public attention has been invited . We refer to the scarcity of fuel . There is not a single coal mine yet opened in Mexico ; and though it is stated that coal in abundance may be found near the Texan frontier , it remains to be proved by better evidence than mere surface indications that the supposed deposit will prove abundant and suitable for the generation of steam , and if both , whether it will pay to mine and bring the coal where it is needed . The Vera Cruz road is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " locomotive expenses " for the half-year ending June 30 , 1881 , for the main line , are stated in the official report of the directors at ? 66,583 iSs. 9d. ; of this , ? 24,905 6s. 2d. , or more than one-third , was for the item of " coal , coke , and firewood . " The wood used by the companies now extending their lines from the city of Mexico costs eighteen dollars a cord , and is only ordinary pine at that . Unless some cheaper method of generating steampower shall be devised than at present exists in Mexico , the question of fuel must reniain one of primary importance . It would be difficult to name many roads . in the United States or anywhere else that could pay dividends to its stockholders and eighteen dollars a cord for its fuel , even if that fuel were hickory-wood instead of Mexican pine . In spite of all that has been said to the contrary , labor in Mexico is relatively good , cheap , and abundant . Experience has shown that three Mexicans will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less . Labor there is subject to its caprices , as in the United States , but of a less vexatious and costly character . There is no country in the world , probably , where the construction of railways is less complicated by the labor question than in Mexico . We have purposely abstained from any discussion of the political consequences to be apprehended from the planting of one or two hundred millions of American money in Mexico , because the considerations involved in such a discussion would have little weight with the mass of those whom the foregoing reflections more immediately concern . It is enough to say at present that a system of railways so largely dependent for every breath of life it draws . as the Mexican system is upon the Mexican government can notexpect its relations . with that government to be always harmonious . The very possession by the Mexican government of a power to annoy is a power certain to be abused , or to beget the . suspicion of abuse . On the other hand , the consciousness on the part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful government is equally liable to abuse  --  to encourage arrogance and a disregard of those methods of conciliation and compromise by which such differences among railway companies within our own borders are commonly arranged . Should any of the roads prove unprofitable , pretexts for the interference // of the governments on both sides would readily be found-pretexts sufficiently plausible sooner or later to enlist the sympathies of the governments and people of both countries . We forbear to draw the curtain farther , but from what we have disclosed it is obvious that the dangers from this direction will increase in direct proportion to the magnitude of the interests involved . It may therefore be better for all concerned that the experiment of building railroads under Mexican charters with American capital should be made on a small scale until the respective prerogatives of the companies and the Mexican government are ascertained and placed under the protection of official precedents . Such are some of the considerations which deserve to be carefully weighed by those who are counting upon sudden fortunes from railway investments in Mexico . Though none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to point pretty unerringly to the following results : 1 . Voluntary emigration can not be relied upon to any appreciable extent . 2 . Railways must depend mainly upon the transportation of the products of Mexican industry , and of the purchasing power of its surplus in foreign markets . The railway business , therefore , can not increase rapidly , nor endure much competition . 3 . To make railways at all remunerative in Mexico they must be constructed and run with the closest economy and system . There will be no margin for extravagance or roguery. 4 . There are so many elements of uncertainty to be reckoned with in these investments , especially if made under the auspices and in the special interest of foreigners , that while they would unquestionably prove highly advantageous to Mexico , and might ultimately prove highly remunerative to stockholders , at present they should be caviare to all who have not money to invest which they can afford to lose .
