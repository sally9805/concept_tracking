" MANIFEST DESTINY . " WE have seen how desirable it is that self-governing groups of men should be enabled to work together in permanent harmony and on a great scale . In this kind of political integration the work of civilization very largely consists . We have seen how in its most primitive form political society is made up of small self-governing groups that are perpetually at war with one another . Now the process of change which we call civilization means quite a number of things , but there is no doubt that it means primarily the gradual substitution of a state of peace for a state of war . This change is the condition precedent for all the other kinds of improvement that are connoted by such a term as " civilization . " Manifestly the development of industry is largely dependent upon the cessation or restriction of warfare ; and furthermore , as the industrial phase of civilization slowly supplants the military phase , men 's characters undergo , though very slowly , a corresponding change . Men become less inclined to destroy life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terminology , which happens to coincide precisely with that of the doctrin*e - of evolution , they become less brutal and more humane . Obviously , then , the primary phase of the process called civilization is the general diminution of warfare . But we have seen that a general diminution of warfare is rendered possible only by the union of small political groups into larger groups that are kept together by community of interests , and that can adjust their mutual relations by legal discussion , without coming to blows . In the preceding paper we considered this process of political integration as variously exemplified by communities of Hellenic , of Roman , and of Teutonic race , and we saw how manifold were the difficulties which the process had to encounter . We saw how the Teutons - at least in Switzerland , England , and America-had succeeded best through the retention of local self-government combined with central representation . We saw how the Romans failed of ultimate success because by weakening self-government they weakened that community of interest which is essential to the permanence of a great political aggregate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most glorious period in a state of chronic warfare , had begun to // achieve considerable success in forming a pacific federation when their independent career was suddenly cut short by the Roman conqueror . This last example introduces us to a fresh consideration of very great importance . It is not only that every progressive community has had to solve , in one way or another , the problem of securing permanent concert of action without sacrificing local independence of action , but while engaged in this difficult work the community has had to defend itself against the attacks of other communities . In the case just cited of the conquest of Greece by Rome little harm was done , perhaps . But under different circumstances imruense damage may have been done in this way , and the nearer we go to the beginnings of civilization , the greater the danger . At the dawn of history we see a few brilliant points of civilization surrounded on every side by a midnight blackness of barbarism . In order that the pacific community may be able to go on doing its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overcome its barbaric neighbors , who have no notion whatever of keeping peace . This is another of the seeming paradoxes of the history of civilization , that for a very long time the possibility of peace can be guaranteed only through war . Obviously the permanent peace of the world can be secured only through the gradual concentration of the preponderant military strength into the hands of the most pacific communities . With infinite toil and trouble this point has been slowly gained by mankind through the circumstance that the very same political aggregation of small primitive communities which makes them less disposed to quarrel among themselves tends also to make them more than a match for the less coherent groups of their more barbarous neighbors . The same concert of action which tends toward internal harmony tends also toward external victory , and both ends are promoted by the co-operation of the same sets of causes . But for a long time all the political problems of the civilized world were complicated by the fact that the community had to fight for its life . We seldom stop to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from surrounding barbarism or from neighboring civilizations of lower type , amid which the rich and high-toned civilizations of Greece and Rome were developed . When the King of Persia undertook to reduce Greece to the condition of a Persian satrapy there was imminent danger that all the enormous fruition of Greek thought in the intellectual life of the European world might have been nipped in the bud . And who can tell how often in prehistoric times some little gleam of civilization , less . bright and steady than this one had become , may have been quenched in slavery or massacre ? The greatest work which the Romans performed in the world was to assume the aggressive against menacing barbarism , to subdue it , to tame it , and to enlist its brute force on the side of law and order . This was a murderous work , but it had to be done by some one before you could expect to have great and peaceful civilizations like our own . The warfare of Rome is by no means adequate- , ly explained by the theory of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe , is the stronger adjective which Dr. Draper uses . The aggressive wars of Rome were largely dictated by just such considerations as those which a century ago made it necessary for the English to put down the raids of the Scotch Highlanders , and which have since made it necessary for Russia to subdue the Caucasus . It is not easy for a turbulent community to live next to an orderly one without continually stirring up frontier disturbances which call for stern repression from the orderly community . Such considerations go far toward explaining the military history of the Romans , and it is a history with which , on the whole , we ought to sympathize . In its European relations that history is the history of the moving of the civilized frontier northward and eastward against the disastrous encroachments of barbarous peoples . This great movement has , on the whole , been steadily kept up , in spite of some apparent fluctuation in the fifth and sixth centuries of the Christian era , and it is still going on to-day . It was a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spain , and taught them good manners and the Latin language , and made it for their interest hereafter to fight against barbarians . The third European peninsula was thus won over to the side of law and order . Danger now remained on the north . The Gauls had once sacked the city of Rome ; hordes of Teutons had lately menaced the // very heart of civilization , but had been overthrown in murderous combat by Caius Marius . Another great Teutonic movement , led by Ariovistus , now threatened to precipitate the whole barbaric force of southeastern Gaul upon the civilized world ; and so it occurred to the prescient genius of C*sar to be beforehand and conquer Gaul , and enlist all its giant barbaric force on the side of civilization . This great work was as thoroughly done as anything that was ever done in human history , and we ought to be thankful to Cai*sar for it every day that we live . The frontier to be defended against barbarism was now moved away up to the Rhine , and was very much shortened ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel themselves to be Romans . Their country became one of the chief strongholds of civilization and of Christianity ; and when the frightful shock of barbarism came  --  the most formidable blow that has ever been directed by barbaric brute force against European civilization-it was in Gaul that it was repelled and that its force was spent . At the beginning of the fifth century an enormous horde of yellow Mongolians , known as Huns , poured down into Europe , with avowed intent to burn and destroy all the good work which Rome had wrought in the world , and wonderful was the havoc they effected in the course of fifty years . If Attila had carried his point , it has been thought that the work of European civilization might have had to be begun over again . But near Chalons , on the Maine , in the year 451 , in one of the most obstinate struggles of which history preserves the record , the career of the " Scourge of God " was arrested , and mainly by the prowess of Gauls and of Visigoths whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last day on which barbarism was able to contend with civilization on equal terms . It was no doubt a critical day for all future history , and for its favorable issue we must largely thank the policy adopted by Ca*sar five centuries before . By the end of the eighth century the great power of the Franks had become enlisted in behalf of law and order , and the Roman throne was occupied by a Frank , the ablest man who had appeared in the world since Ca*sar 's death , and one of the worthiest achievements of Charles the Great was the conquest and conversion of pagan Germany , which threw the frontier against barbarism eastward as far as the Oder , and made it so much the easier to defend Europe . In the thirteenth century this frontier was permanently carried forward to the Vistula by the Teutonic Knights , who , under commission from the Emperor Frederick II. , overcame the heathen Russians and Lithuanians ; and now it began to be shown how greatly the military strength of Europe had increased . In this same century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Europe with a horde of more than a million of Mongols , and tried to repeat the experiment of Attila . Batu penetrated as far as Silesia , and won a great battle at Liegnitz in 1241 , but in spite of his victory he had to desist from the task of conquering Europe . Since the fifth century the physical power of the civilized world had grown immensely , and the impetus of this barbaric invasion was mainly spent upon Russia , the growth of which it succeeded in retarding for more than two centuries . Finally , since the sixteenth century we have seen the Russians , redeemed from their Mongolian oppressors , and rich in many of the elements of a vigorous national life-we have seen the Russians resume the aggressive in this conflict of ages , beginning to do for Central Asia in some sort what the Romans did for Europe . The Aryan people , after attaining a high stage of civilization in Europe , are at last beginning to recover their ancient homestead . The frontier against barbarism , which C*esar left at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is now advancing even to the Oxus . The question has sometimes been raised whether it would be possible for European civilization to be seriously threatened by any future invasion of barbarism or of some lower type of civilization . By barbarism certainly not ; all the nomad strength of Mongolian Asia would throw itself in vain against the insuperable barrier constituted by Russia . But I have heard it quite seriously suggested that if some future Attila or Jiughis were to wield as a unit the entire military strength of the four hundred millions of Chinese , possessed with some suddenly conceived idea of conquering the world , even as Omar and Abderrahman wielded as a unit the newly welded power of the Saracens in the seventh and eighth centuries , then perhaps a staggering blow might yet be dealt against European civilization . I will not waste precious time in considering this imagi // nary case further than to remark that if the Chinese are ever going to try anything of this sort , they can not afford to wait very long ; for within another century , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be surpassed by those of the English race alone . By that time all the elements of military predominance on the earth , including that of simple numerical superiority , will have been gathered into the hands not merely of Europeans generally , but more specifically into the hands of the offspring of the Teutonic tribes who conquered Britain in the fifth century . So far as the relations of European civilization with outside barbarism are concerned to-day , the only serious question is by what process of modification the barbarous races are to maintain their foot-hold upon the earth at all . Where once they threatened the very continuance of civilization , they now exist only on sufferance . In this brief survey of the advancing frontier of European civilization I have said nothing about the danger that has from time to time been threatened by the followers of Mohammed , of the overthrow of the Saracens in Gaul by the grandfather of Charles the Great , or their overthrow at Constantinople by the imagebreaking Leo , of the great medkcval Crusades , or of the mischievous but futile career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to draw this outline with anything like completeness , I should have no room left for the conclusion of my argument . Considering my position thus far as sufficiently illustrated , let us go on to contemplate for a moment some of the effects of all this secular turmoil upon the political development of the progressive nations of Europe . I think we may safely lay it down as a large and general rule that all this prodigious warfare required to free the civilized world from peril of barbarian attack served greatly to increase the difficulty of solving the great initial problem of civilization . In the first place , the turbulence thus arising was a serious obstacle to the formation of closely coherent political aggregates , as we see exemplified in the terrible convulsions of the fifth and sixth centuries , and again in the ascendency acquired by the isolating features of feudalism between the time of Charles the Great and the time of Louis VI . of France . In the second place , this perpetual turbulence was a serious obstacle to the preservation of popular liberties . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintam its free constitution if it has to keep perpetually fighting for its life . The " oneman power , " less fit for carrying on the peaceful pursuits of life , is sure to be brought into the foreground in a state of endless warfare . It is a still more difficult thing for a free people to maintain its free constitution when it undertakes to govern a dependent people despotically , as has been wont to happen when a portion of the barbaric world has been overcome and annexed to the civilized world . Under the weight of these two difficulties combined the free institutions of the ancient IRomans succumbed , and their government gradually passed into the hands of a kind of close corporation , more despotic than anything else of the sort that Europe has ever seen . This despotic character , this tendency , if you will pardon the word , toward the asiaticization of European life , was continued by inheritance in the Roman Church , the influence of which was beneficent so long as it constituted a wholesome check to the isolating tendencies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendencies yielded to the centralizing monarchical tendency in nearly all parts of Europe . The asiaticizing tendency of Roman political life had become so powerful by the fourth century , and has since been so powerfully propagated through the Church , that we ought to be glad that the Teutons came into the empire as masters rather than as subjects . As the Germanic tribes got possession of the government in one part of Europe after auother they brought with them free institutions again . The political ideas of the Goths in Spain , of the Lombards in Italy , and of the Franks and Burgundians in Gaul were as distinctly free as those of the Angles in Britain . But as the outcome of the long and uninterrupted turmoil of the Middle Ages , society throughout the continent of Europe remained predominantly military in type , and this fact greatly increased the tendency toward despotism which was inherited from Rome . After the close of the thirteenth century the whole power of the Church was finally thrown into the scale against the liberties of the people , and as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time when America was discovered government was hardening into despotism in all the great countries of Europe except England . // Even in England the tendency toward despotism had begun to become quite conspicuous after the wholesale slaughter of the great barons in the wars of the Roses . The whole constitutional history of England during the Tudor and Stuart periods is the history of the persistent effort of the English sovereign to free himself from constitutional checks , as his brother sovereigns on the Continent were doing . But how different the result ! How enormous the political difference between William III . and Louis XIV. , compared with the difference between Henry VIII . and Francis I. ! The close of the seventeenth century , which marks the culmination of the asiaticizing tendency in Europe , saw despotism , both political and religious , firmly established in France and Spain and Italy and in half of Germany , while the rest of Germany seemed to have exhausted itself in the attempt to throw off the incubus . But in England this same epoch saw freedom , both political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never again to be shaken , never again with impunity to be threatened , so long as the language of Locke and Milton and Sidney shall remain a living speech on the lips of men . Now this wonderful difference between the career of popular liberty in England and on the Continent was due , no doubt , to a complicated variety of causes , one or two of which I have already sought to point out . In my first lecture I alluded to the curious combination of circumstances which prevented anything like a severance of interests between the upper and the lower ranks of society ; and something was also said about the feebleness of the grasp of imperial Rome upon Britain compared with its grasp upon the continent of Europe . But what I wish now to point out is the enormous advantage of what we may call the strategic position of England in the long mediaeval struggle between civilization and barbarism . In Professor Stubbs 's admirable collection of charters and documents illustrative of English history we read that " on the 6th of July 1264 the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 3d of August to resist the army which was coming from France under the queen and her son Edmund . The invading fleet was prevented by the weather from sailing until too late in the season .. The papal legate , Guy Foulquois , who soon after became Clement IV. , threatened the barons with excommunication , but the bull containing the sentence was taken by the men of Dover as soon as it arrived , and was thrown into the sea . " * As I read this I think of the sturdy men of Connecticut beating the drum to prevent the reading of the royal order of James II . depriving the colony of the control of its own militia , and feel with pride that the indomitable spirit of English liberty is alike indomitable in every land where men of English race have set their feet as masters . But as the success of Americans in withstanding the unconstitutional pretensions of the crown was greatly favored by the barrier of the ocean , so the success of Englishmen in defying the enemies of their freedom has no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Channel . The war between Henry III . and the barons was an event in English history no less critical than the war between Charles I. and the Parliament four cen turies later ; and we have every reason to be thankful that a great French army was not able to get across the Channel in August , 1264 . Nor was this the only time when the insular position of England did goodly service in maintaining its liberties and its internal peace . We can not forget how Lord Howard of Effingbam , aided also by the weather , defeated the armada that boasted itself " invincible , " sent to strangle freedom in its chosen home by the most execrable and ruthless tyrant that Europe has ever seen - a tyrant whose victory would have meant the usurpation of the English crown and the 9stablishment of the Inquisition at Westminster Hall . Nor can we forget with what longing eyes the Corsican barbarian wha wielded for mischief the forces of France in 1805 looked across from Boulogne at the shores of the one European land that never in word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days England has had no need of stormy weather to aid the prowess of the sea-kings who are her natural defenders . It is impossible for the thoughtful stndent of history to walk across Trafalgar Square and gaze on the image of the mightiest naval hero that ever lived , on the summit of his lofty column , and guarded by the royal lions , looking down toward the governmenthouse of the land that he freed from the dread of Napoleonic invasion , and toward that ancient church wherein the most sa * Stubbs , Select Charters , 401. // cred memories of English talent and English toil are clustered together-it is impossible , I say , to look at this and not admire both the artistic instinct that devised so happy a symbolism and the rare good fortune of our Teutonic ancestors in securing a territorial position so readily defensible against the assaults of despotic powers . But it was not merely in the simple facility of warding off external attack that the insular position of Englaud was so serviceable . This ease in warding off external attack bad its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It never became necessary for the English government to keep up a great standing army . For purposes of external defense a navy was all-sufficient , and there is this practical difference between a permanent army and a permanent navy : both are originally designed for purposes of external defense , but the one can readily be used for purposes of internal oppression , and the other can not readily be so used . Nobody ever heard , of a navy putting up an empire at auction sale , and knocking down the throne of the world to a Didius Julianus . When , therefore , a country is effectually screened by water from external attack , it is screened in a way that permits its normal political development to go on internally without those manifold military hinderances that have ordinarily been sd obstructive in the history of civilization . Hence we not only see why , after the Norman c*nquest had operated to increase its unity and its strength , England enjoyed a far greater amount of security and was far more peaceful than any other country in Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military type in England which it assumed upon the Continent ; we see how it was that the bonds of feudalism were far looser here than elsewhere , and therefore how it happened that nowhere else was the condition of the common people so good politically . We now begin to see , moreover , how thoroughly Professor Stubbs and Mr. Freeman are justified in insisting upon the fact that the political institutions of the Germans of Tacitus have had a more normal and uninterrupted development in England than anywhere else . Nowhere , indeed , in the whole history of the human race can we point to such a well-rounded and unbroken continuity of political life as we find in the thousand years of English history that have elapsed since the victory of William the Norman at Senlac . In England the free government of the primitive Aryans has been to this day uninterruptedly maintained , though everywhere lost or seriously impaired on the continent of Europe , except in remote Scandinavia and impregnable Switzerland . But obviously , if in the conflict of ages between civilization and barbarism England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Hungary or Poland , or even by France or Spain , no such remarkable and quite exceptional result could have been achieved . Having duly fathomed the significance of this strategic position of the English race while confined within the limits of the British Islands , we are now prepared to consider the significance of the stupendous expansion of the English race , which first became possible through the discovery and settlement of North America . I said at the close of my first paper that the victory of Wolfe at Quebec marks the greatest turning-point as yet discernible in all modern history . At the first blush such an unqualified statement may have sounded as if an American student of history were inclined to attach an undue value to events that have happened upon his own soil . After the survey of universal history which we have now taken , however , I am fully prepared to show that the conquest of the North American continent by men of English race was unquestionably the most prodigious event in the political annals of mankind . Let us consider for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of North America involved . Chronologically the discovery of America coincides precisely with the close of the Middle Ages , and with the opening of the drama of what is called modern history . The coincidence is in many ways significant . The close of the Middle Ages , as we have seen , was characterized by the increasing power of the crown in all the great countries of Europe , and by strong symptoms of popular restlessness in view of this increasing power . It was characterized alsO by the great Protestant outbreak against the despotic pretensions of the Church , which once , in its antagonisin to the rival temporal power , had befriended the liberties of the people , but now ( since the death of Boniface VIII. ) // sought to inthrall them with a tyranny far worse than that of irresponsible king or emperor . As we have seen Aryan civilization in Europe struggling for many centuries to prove itself superior to the assaults of outer barbarism , so here we find a decisive struggle beginning between the antagonistic tendencies which had grown up in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privilege of living without risk of slaughter and pillage at the hands of Saraceus or Mongols , the question now arose whether the Aryans of Europe should go on and apply their intelligence freely to the problem of making life as rich and fruitful as possible in varied material and spiritual achievement , or should fall into the barren and monotonous way of living and thinking which has always distinguished the halfcivilized populations of Asia . This , and nothing less than this , I think , was the practical political question really at stake in the sixteenth century between Protestantism and Catholicism . Holland and England entered the lists in behalf of the one solution of this question , while Spain and the Pope defended the other , and the issue was fought out on European soil , as we have seen , with varying success . But the discovery of America now came to open up an enormous region in which whatever seed of civilization should be planted was sure to grow to such enormous dimensions as by-and-by to exert a controlling influence upon all such controversies . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the possession of this vast region , and to prove by the result of the struggle which kind of civilization was endowed with the higher and sturdier political life . The race which here should gain the victory was clearly destined hereafter to take the lead in the world , though the rival powers could not in those days fully appreciate this fact . They who founded colonies in America as trading stations or military outposts probably did not foresee that these colonies must by-and-by become imperial states far greater in physical mass than the states which planted them . It is not likely that they were philosophers enough to foresee that this prodigious physical development would mean that the political ideas of the parent state should acquire a hundredfold power and seminal influence in the future work of the world . It was not until the American Revolution that this began to be dimly realized by a few prescient thinkers . It is by no means so fully realized even now that a clear and thorough-going statement of it has not somewhat an air of novelty . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England , was planted in America , removed from the manifold and complicated checks we have just been studying in the history of the Old World , the growth was portentously rapid and steady . There were no Attilas now to stand in the way-only a Philip or a Pontiac . The assaults of barbarism constituted only a petty annoyance as compared with the conflict of ages which had gone on in Europe . There was no occasion for society to assume a military aspect . Principles of self - government were at once put into operation , and no one thought of calling them in question . When the neighboring civilization of inferior type - I allude to the French in Canada-began to become seriously troublesome , it was struck down at a blow . When the mother country , under the guidance of an ignorant king and shortsighted ministers , undertook to act upon the antiquated theory that the new communities were merely groups of trading stations , the political bond of connection was severed ; yet the war which ensued was not like the war which had but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wolfe . It was not a struggle between two different peopl*s , like the French of the old regime and the English , each representing antagonistic theories of how political life ought to be conducted ; but , like the barons ' war of the thirteenth century and the Parliament 's war of the seventeenth , it was a struggle sustained by a part of the English people in behalf of principles that time has shown to be equally dear to all . And so the issue only made it apparent to an astonished world that instead of one , there were now two Englands , prepared to work with might and main toward the political regeneration of mankind . Let us consider now to what conclusions the rapidity and unabated steadiness of the increase of the English race in America ' must lead us as we go on to forecast the future . Carlyle somewhere speaks slightingly of the fact that the Americans double their numbers every twenty years , as if to have forty million dollar-hunters in the world were any better // than to have twenty million dollarhunters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are thereby distinguishable from the rest of mankind , would not perhaps bear too elaborate scrutiny . But during the present paper we have been considering the gradual transfer of the preponderance of pI*ysical strength from the hands of the war - loving portion of the human race into the hands of the peace-loving portion - into the hands of the dollar-hunters , if you please , but out of the hands of the scalp-hunters . Obviously to double the numbers of a pre-eminently industrious , peaceful , orderly , and free-thinking community is somewhat to increase the weight in the world of the tendencies that go toward making communities free and orderly and peaceful and industrious . So that , from this point of view , the fact we are speaking of is well worth considering , even for its physical dimensions . I do not know whether the United States could support a population everywhere as dense as that of Belgium , so I will suppose that , with ordinary improvement in cultivation and in the industrial arts , we might support a population half as dense as that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moderate supposition . Now a very simple operation in arithmetic will show that this means a population of fifteen hundred millions , or more than the population of the whole world at the present date . Another very simple operation in arithmetic will show that if we were to go on doubling our numbers even once in every twenty-five years , we should reach that stupendous figure at about the close of the twentieth century , that is , in the days of our great - great - grandchildren . I do not predict any such result , for there are discernible economic reasons for believing that there will be a diminution in the rate of increase . The rate must nevertheless continue to be very great in the absence of such causes as formerly retarded the growth of population in Europe . Our modern wars are hideous enough , no doubt , but they are short . They are settled with a few heavy blows , and the loss of life and property occasioned by them is but trifling when compared with the awful ruin and desolation wrought by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ages . Chronic warfare , both private and public , periodic famines , and sweeping pestilences like the Black Death-these were the things which formerly shortened human life and kept down population . In the absence of such causes , and with the abundant capacity of our country for feeding its people , I think it an extremely moderate statement if we say that by the end of the next century the English race in the United States will number at least six or seven hundred millions . It used to be said that so huge a people as this could not be kept together as a single national aggregate , or , if kept together at all , could only be so by means of a powerful centralized government , like that of ancient Rome under the emperors . I think we are now prepared to see that this is a great mistake . If the Roman Empire could have possessed that political vitality in all its parts which is secured to the United States by the principles of equal representation and of limited State sovereignty , it might well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever have directed against it . As it was , its strong centralized government did not save it from political disintegration . One of its weakest political features was precisely this , that its strong centralized government was a kind of close corporation , governing a score of provinces in its own interest rather than in the interest of the provincials . In contrast with such a system as that of the Roman Empire the skillfully elaborated American system of federalism appears as one of the most important contributions that the English race has made to the general work of civilization . The working out of this feature in our national constitution by Hamilton and Madison and their associates was the finest specimen of constructive statesmanship that the world has ever seen . Not that these statesmen originated the principle , but they gave form and expression to the principle which was latent in the circumstances under which the group of American colonies had grown up , and which suggested itself so forcibly that the clear vision of these thinkers did not fail to seize upon it as the fundamental principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , spreading over a vast continent , be kept in a condition approaching to something like permanent peace . Stated broadly , so as to acquire somewhat the force of a universal proposition , the principle of federalism is just this : that the people of a state shall have // full and entire control of their own domestic affairs , which directly concern them only , and which they will naturally manage with more intelligence and with more zeal than any distant governing body could possibly exercise ; but that , as regards matters of common concern between a group of states , a decision shall in every case be reached , not by brutal warfare or ly weary diplomacy , but by the , systematic legislation of a central government which represents both states and people , and whose decisions can always be enforced , if necessary , by the combined physical power of all the states . This principle , in various practical applications , is so familiar to Americans to-day that we seldom pause to admire it , any more than we stop to admire the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and life . Yet I believe that if no other political result than this could to-day be pointed out as coming from the colonization of America by Englishmen , we should still be justified in regarding that event as one of the most important in the history of mankind . For obviously the principle of federalism , as thus broadly stated , contains within itself the seeds of permanent peace between nations , and to this glorious end I believe it will come in the fullness of time . And now we may begin to see distinctly what it was that the American government fought for in the late civil war-a point which at the time was by no means clearly apprehended outside the United States . We used to hear it often said , while that war was going on , that we were fighting not so much for the emancipation of the negro as for the maintenance of our federal union ; and I doubt not that to many who were burning to see our country purged of the folly and iniquity of negro slavery this may have seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From the stand-point of universal history it was nevertheless the correct and proper view . The emancipation of the negro , as an incidental result of the struggle , was no doubt a priceless gain , which was greeted warmly by all rightminded people . But deeper down than this question , far more subtly interwoven with the innermost fibres of our national well-being , far heavier laden , too , with weighty consequences for the future weal of all mankind , was the question whether this great pacific principle of union , joined with independence , should be overthrown by the first deep-seated social difficulty it had to encounter , or should stand as an example of priceless value to other ages and to other lands . The solution was well worth the effort it cost . There have been many useless wars , but this was not one of them , for , more than most wars that have been , it was fought in the direct interest of peace , and the victory so dearly purchased and so humanely used was an earnest of future peace and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for which the American government fought was the perpetual maintenance of that peculiar state of things which the federal union had created  --  a state of things in which , throughout the whole vast territory over which the Union holds sway , questions between States , like questions between individuals , must be settled by legal argument and judicial decisions , and not by wager of battle . Far better to demonstrate this point once for all , at whatever cost , than to be burdened hereafter , like the states of Europe , with frontier fortresses and standing armies and all the barbaric apparatus of mutual suspicion ! For so great an end did this most pacific people engage in an obstinate war , and never did any war so thoroughly illustrate how military power may be wielded by a people that has passed entirely from the military into the industrial stage of civilization . The events falsified all the predictioiis that were drawn from the contemplation of societies less advanced politically . It was thought that so peaceful a people could not raise a great army on demand ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand men by voluntary enlistment . It was thought that a territory involving military operations at points as far apart as Paris and Moscow could never be thoroughly conquered ; yet in April , 1865 , the Federal armies might have marched from end to end of the Gulf States without meeting any force to oppose them . It was thought that the maintenance of a * , reat army would beget a military temper in the Americans , and lead to manifestations of Bonapartism - domestic usurpation and foreign aggression ; yet the moment the work was done the great army vanished , and a force of twenty-five thousand men was found sufficient for the military needs of the whole country . It // was thought that eleven States which had struggled so hard to escape from the federal tie could not be re-admitted to voluntary co-operation in the general government , but must henceforth be held as conquered territory  --  a most dangerous experiment for any free people to try ; yet within a dozen years we find the old federal relations resumed in all their compfeteness , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once it had wrought such mischief . Such has been the result of the first great attempt to break up the federn.l union in America . It is not probable that another attempt can ever be made with anything like an equal chance of success . Here were eleven States , geographically contiguous , governed by groups of men who for half a century had pursued a well-defined policy in common , united among themselves , and marked off from most of the other States by a difference far more deeply rooted in the ground-work of society than any mere economic difference  --  the difference between slave labor and free labor . These eleven States , moreover , held such an economic relationship with England that they counted upon compelling the naval power of England to be used in their behalf . And , finally , it had not yet been demonstrated that the maintenance of the federal union was something for which the great mass of the people would cheerfully fight . Never could the experiment of secession be tried , apparently , under fairer auspices ; yet how tremendous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - the conviction that no matter how grave the political questions that may arise hereafter , they must be settled in accordance with the legal methods the Constitution has provided , and that no State can be allowed to break the peace . It is the thoroughness of this conviction that has so greatly facilitated the re-instatement of the revolted States in their old federal relations ; and the good sense and good faith with which the Southern people , in spite of the chagrin of defeat , have accepted the situation and acted upon it , is something unprecedented in history , and calls for the warmest sympathy and admiration on the part of their brethren of the North . The federal principle in America has passed through this fearful ordeal and come out stronger than ever , and we trust it will not again be put to so severe a test . But , with this principle unimpaired , there is no reason why any further increase of population or of territory should overtask the resources of our government . In the United States of America a century hence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in power and in dimensions any empire that has as yet existed . But we must now consider for a moment the probable future career of the English race in other parts of the world . The colonization of North America by Englishmen had its direct effects upon the eastern as well as upon the western side of the Atlantic . The immense growth of the commercial and naval strength of England between the time of Cromwell and the time of the elder Pitt was intimately connected with the colonization of North Anierica and the establishment of plantations in the West Indies . These circumstances reacted powerfully upon the material development of England , multiplying manifold the dimensions of her foreign trade , increasing proportionately her commercial marine , and giving her in the eighteenth century the dominion over the seas . Endowed with this maritime supremacy , she has with an unerring instinct proceeded to seize upon the keys of empire in all parts of the world - Gibraltar , Malta , the Isthmus of Suez , Aden , Ceylon , the coasts of Australia , island after island in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of maritime commerce , or guards the approaches to the barbarous countries which she is beginning to regard as in some way her natural heritage . Any well-filled album of postage stamps is an eloquent commentary on this maritime supremacy of England . It is enough to turn one 's head to look over her colonial blue-books . The natural outcome of all this overflowing vitality it is not difficult to foresee . No one can carefully watch what is going on in Africa to-day without recognizing it as the same sort of thing which was going on in North America in the seventeenth century ; and it can not fail to bring forth similar results in course of time . Here is a vast country , rich in beautiful scenery , and in resources of timber and minerals , with a salubrious climate and fertile soil , with great navigable rivers and inland lakes , which will not much longer be left in control of tawny lions and long-eared elephants , and negro fetich-worshippers . Already five flourishing // English states have been established in the south , besides the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commanding the Red Sea . English explorers work their way with infinite hardship through its untravelled wilds , and track the courses of the Congo and the Nile as their forefathers tracked the Potomac and the Hudson . The work of La Salle and Smith is finding its counterpart in the labors of Baker and Livingstone . Who can doubt that within two or three centuries the African continent will be occupied by a mighty nation of English descent , and covered with populous cities and flourishing farms , with railroads and telegraphs and free schools and other devices of civilization as yet undreamed of ? If we look next to Australia we find a country of more than two-thirds the area of the United States , with a temperate climate and immense resources , agricultural and mineral , a country sparsely peopled by a race of irredeemable savages hardly above the level of brutes . Here England within the present century has planted five greatly thriving states , concerning which I have not time to say much , but one fact will serve for an example . When in America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our socalled Northwestern States , we refer to Chicago . a city of half a million inhabitants standing on a spot which fifty years ago was an *ininhabited marsh . In Australia the city of Melbourne was founded in 1837 , the year when the present Queen of England began to reign , and the state of which it is the capital was hence called Victoria . This city , now just forty-eight years old , has a population half that of Chicago , has a public library of 200,000 volumes , and has a university with at least one professor of world - wide renown . When we see , by-the-way , within a period of five years , and at such remote points upon the earth 's surface , such erudite and ponderous works in the English language issuing from the press as those of Professor Hearn of Melbourne , of Bishop Colenso of Natal , and of Mr. Hubert Bancroft of San Francisco , even such a little commonplace fact as this is fraught with wonderful significance when we think of all that it implies . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring , where the English race is now multiplying faster than anywhere else in the world , unless it be in Texas and Minnesota . And there are in the Pacific Ocean many rich and fertile spots where we shall very soon see the same things going on . It is not necessary to dwell upon such considerations as these . It is enough to point to the general conclusion that the work which the English race began when it colonized North America is destined to go on until every land on the earth 's surface that is not already the seat of an old civilization shall become English in its language , in its religion , in its political habits and traditions , and to a predominant extent in the blood of its people . The day is at hand when four-fifths of the human race will trace its pedigree to English forefathers , as four-fifths of the white people in the United States trace their pedigree to-day . The race thus spread over both hemispheres , and from the rising to the setting sun , will not fail to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it began to acquire when England first stretched its arm across the Atlantic to the shores of Virginia and Massachusetts . The language spoken by these great communities will not be sundered into dialects like the language of the ancient Romans , but perpetual intercommunication and the universal habit of reading and writing will preserve its integrity , and the world 's business will be transacted by Englishspeaking people to so great an extent that whatever language any man may have learned in his infancy , he will find it necessary sooner or later to learn to express his thoughts in English . And in this way it is by no means improbable that , as Jacob Grimm long since predicted , the language of Shakespeare will ultimately become the language of mankind . In view of these considerations as to the stupendous future of the English race does it not seem very probable that in due course of time Europe , which has learned some valuable lessons from America already , will find it worth while to adopt the lesson of federalism in order to do away with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different states own no allegiance to any common authority ? War , as we have seen , is with barbarous races both a necessity and a favorite occupation ; as long as civilization comes in contact with barbarism it remains a too frequent necessity ; but as between civilized and Christian nations it is an absurdity . For example , we sympa // thize keenly with wars such as that which Russia has lately concluded for setting free a kindred race and humbling the worthless barbarian who during four centuries has wrought such incalculable damage to the European world . But a sanguinary struggle for the Rhine frontier , between two civilized Christian nations who have each enough work to do in the world without engaging in such a strife as this , will , I am sure , be by-and-by condemned by the general opinion of mankind . Such questions will have to be settled by discussion in some sort of federal council or parliament if Europe would keep pace with America in the advance toward universal law and order . All will admit that such a state of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is really quite as utopian as it may seem at the first glance . No doubt the lord who dwelt in Haddon Hall in the fifteenth century would have thought it very absurd if you had told him that within four hundred years it would not be iiecessary for country gentlemen to live in great stone dungeons with little cross - barred windows and loop - holes from which to shoot at people going by . Yet to-day a country gentleman in Massachusetts may sleep securely without locking his front door . We have not quite done away with robbery and murder , but we have at least made private warfare illegal ; we have arrayed public opinion against it to such an extent that the police court usually makes short shrift for the misguided man who tries to wreak vengeance on his enemy . Is it too much to hope that by-and-by we may similarly put public warfare under the ban ? I think not . Already in America , as we have seen , it has becoine customary to deal with questions between States just as we would deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the real purport of American federalism . To have established such a system over one great continent is to have made a very good beginning toward establishing it over the world . To establish such a system in Europe will no doubt be difficult , for here we have to deal with an immense complication of prejudices , intensified by linguistic and ethnological differences . Nevertheless the pacific pressure exerted upon Europe by America is becoming so great that it will doubtless before long overcome all these obstacles . I refer to the industrial competition between the Old and fhe New World , which has become so conspicuous within the last ten years . Agriculturally Minnesota , Nebraska , and Kansas are already formidable competitors with England , France , and Germany ; but this is but the beginning . It is but the first spray from the tremendous wave of economic competition that is gathering in the Mississippi Valley . Presently , as with increase of population labor grows cheaper in America , the competition in manufactures also will become as keen as it . is now beginning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New England abundantly proves . Now this economic pressure exerted upon Europe by the United States will very soon become so great that it will be simply impossible for the state of Europe to keep up such military armaments as they are now maintaining . The disparity between the United states , with a standing army of only twenty-five thousand men , and the states of Europe , with their standing arniies amounting to two or three millions of men , is something that can not be kept up . The economic competition will become so keen that European armies will have to be disbanded , the swords will have to be turned into ploughshares , and thus the victory of the industrial over the military type of civilization will at last become complete . But to disband the great armies of Europe will necessarily involve the forcing of the great states of Eu rope into some sort of federal relation , in which congr'esses will become more fi'equent , in which the principles of international law will acquire a more definite sanction , and in which the combined physical power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does in America ) a permanent threat against any state that dares for selfish reasons to break the peace . In some such way as this , I believe , the industrial development of the English race outside of Europe will by-and-by enforce federalism upon Europe . I do not ignore the difficulties that grow out of differences in language , race , and creed ; but we have seen how Switzerland has long since triumphantly surmounted such difficulties on a small scale . To surmount them on a great scale will soon be the political problem of Europe , and it is America which has set the example and indicated the method . Thus we may foresee in general how , by the gradual concentration of physical pow- // er into the hands of the most pacific communities , we may finally succeed in rendering warfare illegal all over the globe . As this process goes on , it may , after many more ages of political experience , become apparent that there is really no reason , in the nature of things , why the whole of mankind should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managing its local affairs in entire independence , but relegating all questions of international interest to the decision of one central tribunal supported by the public opinion of the entire human race . I believe that the time will come when such a state of things will exist upon the earth , when it will be possible ( with our friends of the Paris dinner party ) to speak of the United States as stretching from pole to pole , or with Tennyson to celebrate the " parliament of man and the federation of the world . " Indeed , only when such a state of things has begun to be realized can civilization , as sharply demarcated from barbarism , be said to have fairly begun . Only then can the world be said to have become truly Christian . Many ages of toil and doubt and perplexity will no doubt pass by before such a desideratum is reached . Meanwhile it is pleasant to feel that the dispassionate contemplation of great masses of historical facts goes far toward confirming our faith in this ultimate triumph of good over evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desolation ; it ends with the picture of a world covered with cheerful homesteads , blessed with a Sabbath of perpetual peace .
