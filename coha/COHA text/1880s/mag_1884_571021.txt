ARTICLE VI-TAXATION IN THE UNITED STATES . IV . THE FUTURE OF TAXATION . THE exceptional influences which have determined the fiscal legislation of the United States for the last twenty years have ended in the perversion of its constitutional power to purposes not foreseen by the constitution inasmuch as they are purposes not defined by the law . The State has charged all its expenses , or nearly all , to certain classes of its subjects selected from the others for acts which it has nowhere declared to be reasons for imposing exceptional burdens , which on the contrary it authorizes in the very act of imposing the burdens . The consuiners of certain articles of domestic and foreign production furnish far the larger part of the national revenue , yet so far are they from having been found guilty of the real punishment they suffer that the continuance of the acts which bring the punishment is looked for as the continuing source of State revenue . We may , I think , be sure that this passing equivoque will be cleared up in the natural evolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests which have created and maintain it : that the political instincts and intelligence of the people , the resentment of the classes which suffer , with the moral sentiment of the classes which profit by their suffering , will recall the perverted power of the State to the necessary distinctions , will effectually separate between the sovereign right of raising revenue , and the sovereign function of suppressing wrong , for which the revenue is raised . When this inevitable evolution has accomplished its term we shall have a State which no longer seeks to effect its ends in the act of providing the necessary means for them , but gets the means first and the ends afterward ; which calls upon all its subjects impartially for their rightful portions of tribute , and then expends the tribute openly , without equivocation , indirection or disguise , for purposes of public and common import plainly defined in the law . These two most distinct things , now confused in the action of the State , having been perfectly differentiated from one // another , will the sale and use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public wrong , calling for intervention of the State ? If yes , then they will be declared to be so by laws expressing the will of the people to that effect , laws which convert the articles in question from sources of revenue into occasions of expenditure , and transfer the seller or user of them from the class of subjects held for taxation to the class held for punishment . That this rectification will take place speedily in the matter of pernicious articles , like intoxicating spirits , is unlikely , for in the face of all the obstacles to effective prohibition the moral sense of the community will insist upon such restraints as are to be had by increasing the cost of the article to the consumer . It is undeniably the purpose of the people that if drunkenness and ministering to drunkenness can not be defined and punished as a crime according to the law , it shall be checked by heavy taxation ; if its suppression can not be made an end of expenditure its continuance shall furnish a source of revenue . And we need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the action of the State until we have got it first in the purpose of the people . But for the sale and use of commodities which have nothing against them but their foreign origin the case is different . The feeling which actually exists as to the disloyalty or lack of patrio*isrn in using these articles , is too ill defined , and when defined too preposterous to admit of serious discussion . We may be sure therefore , that in time the good sense and real interest of the people will get the better of a prejudice unworthy of them , and of the selfish interest of the class which profits by it . But although the issue is certain , it is not yet at all easy to predict by what circuits and gradations the aberrant power of the State will be recalled to the strict exercise of its specific functions . I write at the opening of the debate upon Mr. Morrison 's new tariff , a most inconclusive measure , full of partisan precautions , whose significance is that it indicates with the sensitiveness of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always precedes a new departure in public policy . On the one hand there is concentrated upon the legislature the powerful pressure of the alarmed manufacturers , who have finally succeeded , it would seem , in // identifying the fortunes of the party which is the author of the protective tariff with their own ; on the other there is the body of the people , still under the spell of old prevailing notions and habits , confused in its economical ideas and distracted in its political allegiance , but slowly charging like a Leyden jar or a thunder-cloud , as in the years before Lincoln 's election , with a new impulse and a new intelligence and already needing but the right sort of a conductor and the provocation of a new contact to discharge with irresistible power . The simple question is whether the slowly forming purpose of the people will take effect as it forms , forcing the State to undo step by step the legislation of the last twenty years ; or will be held in check by the interest of the manufacturers , the timidities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is fully formed and escapes all restraint in instantaneous and exhaustive action . The latter is indicated by the organization of the present Congress and the consequent disarray of the Democratic party , the effect of which will probably be to leave a diffuse public sentiment without an accredited organ in presence of an imperilled interest and a powerful organization . There is , I think , no reason for impatience in this , as positive convictions and decisive action when they come at last are always better than irresolution and half measures . The business of the country could more easily adjust itself to the certainty that the artificial prices created by the protective tariff would disappear at a given time , than to the vicissitudes of experimental reductions . On the whole , therefore , we may hope that the deadlock at Washington will be prolonged until the constituency is ready to issue a peremptory and conclusive mandate to the State , and that the State in the meanwhile will be spared the necessity of consulting the constituency by tentative legislation before it has fully made up its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practically the same and is now inevitable at no distant date . The classification of taxable commodities according to the accidental fact of origin will give way to a selection according to real differences , namely , first the relative accessibility to taxation of any article no matter where it comes from , and secondly its relative power of distributing the tax among the subjects . We may profitably // inquire how this change will take effect , what articles are likely to remain upon or to be added to the list as the future source of State revenue . I. It is evident to begin with that the opposition of the interested classes once out of the way , the reduction hitherto confined to the Internal iRevenue tariff will be immediately extended to the Customs Tariff ; but with this capital difference , that while the taxation of domestic articles was lessened to concentrate the burden on foreign articles , the latter will be lessened in order to apportion the whole burden equally to the distribution of the national wealth . First of all , to the list of articles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inaccessible to measurement or valuation , will be added all those articles of foreign origin , which in spite of their rely tive inaccessibility have been subject to duty for the sole purpose of protecting the domestic article . The latter motive removed , the first question for consideration will be whether the duty on any given article is worth the difficulty , the cost , and the consequences of collecting it . Articles for example of very small bulk and high value , like precious stones , or fine laces , are always driven by a customs duty into the hands of the smuggler , with the effect that the honest importer is undersold , the market deranged , and the government defrauded by wares which have escaped all taxation . In like manner of articles which although they can not escape the eye of the government are difficult of valuation . Sugar for example , is not easily smuggled over the frontier in considerable quantities , but it is so susceptible of disguise by its chemical character that costly scientific tests are necessary to determine what any consignment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear . ft is further to be remembered that an article like sugar , or tissues of cotton or wool , may be perfectly accessible if the whole supply is , delivered as an import at a few points on the frontier , and the ' contrary if partly produced within the country and put upon the market at a hundred different points , without concentration . Evidently under any rational classification a multitude of commodities now taxed in the interest of some manufacturer or manufacturing class will disappear from the list as unproductive sources of revenue , and this process of natural selectior* // will go on until the several commodities are found which upon - actual trial yield the largest return at the smallest expense , and with the least derangement of the market . So far as the character of accessibility is concerned nothing could be better than an article wholly of foreign origin and consumed in large quantities , like tea or coffee , of which the whole supply is necessarily concentrated at a few ports of entry before reaching the market . But to the character of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power of distributing the tax to the subjects . ft is not enough that an article lie well in the way of the government if it concentrates upon a few a burden which should be borne in equable proportion by all . This is why real estate and other forms of fixed capital , although by reason of their immobility the most conspicuous and accessible kinds of wealth , are unsatisfactory sources of public revenue . A farm or farm-building can not be hidden away , nor can its real value well be un ( icrstated without collusion of all the landowners in the neighborhood , but it has a low power and a round-about way of distributing the charges upon it to other property . It is not unfitted for local taxation , where prompt and wide distribution are not required , but the central government whose revenues are gathered from a great population spread over half a continent , has already been driven to restrict taxation to circulating capital , that is , to forms of property held for exchange and thus brought within easier reach before dispersion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is wide range-for selection , for if any form of circulating capital has a higher distributing power than any form of fixed capital , some forms of circulating capital have higher distributing power than others . Superiority in this respect is determined by two things , first the subdivision of the commodity upon final sale for consumption , and second the extent of the consnmption . A machine like a watch , a steam engine , or a ship , can not be subdivided at all , and the whole duty upon it must be paid by the single individual who purchases it for use . To be sure he will reimburse himself gradually for the duty he pays , as for the other charges which make up his whole investment , by interest and profits collected from those who take // time from his watch , or find work for his engine or ship , but this is the round-about and remote distribution of charges which disqualifies all forms of fixed capital for national taxation . Only such forms of circulating capital therefore as admit of minute subdivision upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cotton , woolen , and linen tissues , fluids and foods of all kinds , in general commodities taken out of circulation for immediate consumption and not for permanent occupancy or use , are instances in point . But , again , this capability of minute subdivision upon sale for consumption is not enough unless the consumption itself is considerable . Crude opium , for example , besides being recotnmended as an article wholly of foreign origin , is absorbed in minuter portions than spirits or tobacco , but the demand for it is so limited that its effective distributing power is indefinitely less . So other things being equal an article consumed by many persons is fitter for taxation than one consumed by few , and the fittest of all is one of universal consumption . Here , however , it is to be observed that other things are not at all equal for the multitude among whom the duties are to be divided , differ widely in the amounts of their wealth and therefore in the amounts of tribute they severally owe to the State . Unless we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more of a dutiable commodity in the proportion of his wealth , the larger fortunes will nearly escape and the main burden fall upon those who are less able to bear it and who owe less . Hence arise the necessities of a compound and compensating tariff , which are the chief obstacle to any system of equitable taxation . There are articles of prime necessity produced at small cost in great abundance to meet a universal demand , which are well fitted to carry the duties upon them to the whole population , but requiring to be supplemented by others fitted in another way to carry the duties principally or entirely to the larger fortunes . Such are articles of convenience or luxury produced at high cost in small quantities , and therefore within reach of those only who can afford them . The object of the State is the strictly impersonal one of making the wealth of each of its subjects wherever situated and however held , pay its rightful share of tribute . The commodity which carries the // tax upon it to the greatest amount of wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon sale-so to say by the intensiveness , or by the extensiveness , of its distributing power , is the fittest for taxation . To sum up : when the alien motives which now obstruct the action of the State are withdrawn the natural development of our fiscal system will be resumed by the abandonment , at once or one after the other , of the larger number of articles now subject to duty , and the concentration of the whole burden upon a few articles selected for superior accessibility and distributing power as the most economical , productive , and equitable sources of revenue . This is the result indicated by the experience of Great Britain , the only considerable state which has escaped the trammels of a protective tariff . The larger part of the British revenue is now drawn from duties on imported tea and tobacco and on alcoholic fluids , whether of domestic or foreign origin ; a tariff whose greatest defect is its inadequate taxation of the larger fortunes . Granting that the State is to return to intelligent legislation in behalf of the whole people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our own system in the future. * II . But now we have to inquire whether this is the last term of our fiscal evolution , the mode in which the revenues of the United States will be raised in all time to come ; or whether * I do not raise the question of the relative superiority of the specific and ad valorem duties , as both so far as the purpose of this discussion is concerned involve the same principle . The specific duty is a tax proportioned to the quantity , the ad valorem to the value of a given commodity . The former , which has been adopted by Great Britain , and retained in our present Internal Revenue tariff , is more convenient for the government , as the quantity of any article is more easily ascertained than its value . The latter , which characterizes our Customs tariff is more equitable for the people by reason of its more perfect distribution . I incline to the opinion that the ad valorem duty will prevail in our future system of national taxation , at any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in proportion to the wealth of the country , that it can consult its own convenience more freely than it is likely to be able to do for years to come . Upon this decrease in the proportion of State expenses to the wealth of the country , depends too the rapidity with which the revenue can be charged to a decreasing number of commodities . As things are , we are not likely to reach the extreme simplicity of the British tariff until the national debt is extinguished . // like the present mode , it is a mere halting-place and steppingstone on the way to a better . When the revenue which twenty years ago was drawn from almost every form of property at all accessible to the government , from capital fixed and circulating , from capital and the earnings of capital , has at last been apportioned to the dozen or half-dozen commodities best fitted to yield it , will it remain there , or will this new apportionment suggest and prepare the way for another ? According to the hypothesis , the half-dozen corn mo ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their sul ) erior capacity of putting the State exactly in possession of its own , that is of an equable proportion of the current income of each of its subjects . Now we know by simple calculation of the forces at work and by the experience of other states that no commodity or set of commodities can be found which will perfectly distribute the charges upon it in the manner desired . An article may be had , like cotton or grain , which will divide the duty among the whole population , but it will always be in the proportion of each person 's consumption and not in the requisite proportion of his income . This inequality again may be diminished by adding other articles which reach the larger incomes alone , but no possible combination will overcome all inequality . It follows that the forces of fiscal evolution have not been entirely expended in its latest product ; the system of taxation already reached in Great Britain , and which we are slowly approaching , holds in it a tendency to farther evolution . Now this tendency has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances will be arrested here . Like most of the older states Great Britain has reached what looks like a permanent equilibrium between revenue and expenditure ; after long experiment it has found the combination of articles which draws from the wealth of the nation the highest tribute it will yield ; and as this tribute barely suffices for the current expenditure , including provision for emergencies and slow reduction of the capital debt , it follows that Great Britain has not the power to experiment much farther . It must take what it can get and what the people are used to and will put up with . So Mr. Lowe 's famous tax on friction matches , borrowed from us for temporary increase of the revenue , was fairly beaten out // of parliament by fierce invasion of public opinion , although the article was recommended for taxation by its power of wide and equable distribution . It will be long before any British ministry will be able or will ( lare to undertake any considerable readjustment of public burdens because it has no room for experiments which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different case . With the disappearance of the last traces of the rebellion , and of all complications other than those created by our own incompetence or perversity , we shall have reached that happy situation of fiscal plenitude which statesmen of all times have dreamed of without seeing , an expenditure admitting of progressive diminution with an inexhaustible and ever increasing source of revenue . For the first time in the history of political finance a great state will have the opportunity of unobstructed experiment , of working out to the end the historical problem of securing the private rights of the subject in the very act of enforcing its sovereign right to tribute . Now I think there is no doubt that the system I have described is the highest and last possible form of indirect taxation , the form better fitted than all others of the kind to put the State exactly in the possession of its own . If it goes farther there is only one step left for it to take , namely from this last form of indirect taxation , to the direct appropriation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the income of each of its subjects. * The objections to an income tax have been carefully studied by writers on political economy , and may all be included under two heads . There is fir4 the inaceessihility of the property subject to tribute , due to its remoteness from the centre of government , to the interminable variety of forms in which itis produced , arid to the difficulty of estimating the different * I take occasion to repeat here what was said in a former paper , that by fixed capital I mean simply capital which is fixed , that is property of any kind kept out of circulation for occupancy , use , or consumption ; and by circulating capital , property of the same kinds held for exchange with other kinds . In the evolution of our fiscal system taxation has already been transferred from all kinds of fixed to certain articles of circulating capital , with a prospective tendency to diminution in the number of articles . I hold that if the evolution goes any farther it can only be by transferring taxation from capital to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the product or revenue of capital , which is the income-tax. // forms according to any single standard of values . We have a population of over 50,000,000 , in all conditions of penury and riches , drawing revenue out of the rents of real estate , the dividends upon stocks , the interest of bonds and other evidences of ' indebtedness , the profits of business , the wages of labor ; wealth flowing much of it in varying volume , from hidden sources , through obscure channels , apparently defying all scrutiny without the good-will of the holder . Secondly , although there is no question here , as in the tax on circulating capital , of the inequalities of distribution , yet were the amounts of incomes ascertained and reduced to a common standard , and the proportion due to the State determined , the direct appropriation of this proportion would work with the most curious inequality of effects . Let us suppose that the proportion called for is one per centum of the annual product of the whole wealth of the nation and that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital , a salary of $1000 paid to an employe , and the wages of a laborer who earns $1000 . Ten years hence the clerk and the laborer may be disabled for work , both without resources , yet having paid the same tribute as the capitalist who still has his investment . It may happen too that the earnings of the clerk or the laborer have provided for the wants of a growing family , so that his effective income has all along been less than that of the capitalist who has paid tribute for himself alone , and not also for those dependent on him . There is here , and in other like effects of the income tax , a grievous inequality in the very equality of the burdens , and the evident necessity of compensations to adjust the tax to the nature as well as to the amounts , the quality as to the quantity of different incomes . But it must be observed that all these are inconveniences inseparable from taxation in any form , and that the thing to be ascertained is the particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case the rightful property of the State is a uniform , or to speak now with entire precision , an equable proportion of the income of each of its subjects , that is , a uniform proportion full allowance made for the character as well as the amount of the income ; and so the question is whether the indirection of the tax upon circulating capital reaches this // proportion more satisfactorily than the direct income-tax ; not whether a particular commodity is more accessible than the incomes of all the subjects , which of course it is , but whether the incomes are more accessible through the commodity by reason of its distributing power , than they are in themselves . In other words , shall the State send out its commissioned agents through the length and breadth of the land to take its own wherever it lies and by whomsoever it is held ; or avail itself of the wide flowing currents of commerce to carry its requisitions for it , taking what it needs from the dealers in certain commodities who reimburse themselves on sale to their customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agents of the State ? There is a good deal to be said on both sides and I am rather inclined to submit the question than to attempt an answer . But this much I think is clear , that the practicability of the income tax depends more than that of the other upon the temper , habits , and character of the people . As things are the inconveniences of the indirect tax are patiently borne , partly because the payer is accustomed to them , partly because the tax does not take effect where it is levied , but later on where it disappears among all the other charges paid together as whole cost by the consumer , who is really no more aware that he is paying duty to the government than freight to the carrier or insurance to the underwriter . So an indirect tax of any kind must be peculiarly oppressive if it is distinctly felt and resisted by the consumer of the article on which it is laid . Contrariwise the incomedax takes effect when and where collected and is wholly borne by the person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it comes out undisguised and unrelieved . This I take to be an unanswerable objection to the income-tax as levied by the State hitherto , and the only one seriously considered by the political economists , which is an occasional , supplementary tax added to the ordinary sources of revenue , and paid only by a single class . In these circumstances it can not but be an odious impost which the class directly affected may be counted on to resist or evade . But what we are considering is an income-tax which supersedes all others , adjusted to the qualities of differing incomes , and paid by all the subjects alike each in the measure // Nov* of his resources and obligations , therefore a tax which escapes the odium of invidious and oppressive distinctions , and commends itself to the conscience and good sense of the whole population . No doubt it leaves with the payer the irritating consciousness of the burden he bears , but a people whose obligations to the State must be carefully concealed from it under the appearance of other forms of indebtedness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illusion that it is part of the cost of some commodity , has its political education to make and is not yet fit for self-government . Add that this exact consciousness of the burdens it bears is of inestimable value in maintaining the vigilance of the people and so putting upon the State the perpetual restraint of power held to strict accountability . Jt is the absence of this control and the opportunity of disguise and evasion in its fiscal measures , which has permitted all the abuses of taxation in our own as in other govern ments . On . the whole we may conclude that the tendency of fiscal evolution in the United States will be to the substitution of a direct income-tax for all other forms of taxation , and that this result will be averted only by the persistence of such other forms . Now there are no taxes of the national government which it is not able to relinquish whenever it chooses to do so . The one obstacle in its way , and for a long time to come no doubt the insuperable obstacle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other governments over whose fiscal measures it has no sufficient controL Beyond a certain point its action is paralyzed by the unrestrained and discordant license of local taxation , the tribute collected by all sorts of imposts on all forms of property in each of the little and large republics . superposed upon one another over the whole surface of its domain . How can it definitely resolve a problem in applied science complicated , for example , by the Milesian financiering of the municipality of New York ? The truth is that one of the most formidable dangers of all modern societies is what I have called the license of local taxation . With us it is aggravated beyond measure by the anomalous autonomy of the several States , which historically are the perpetuation of the colonial system of Great Britain , the one restraint upon the // normal development of our polity which we omitted to throw off in the war of Independence . As to the utilities of the sovereign state as the constituent unit of the United States there can of course be no doubt or it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a provisional and transitory kind , and accompanied by all the disadvantages of illregulated and irritable power , of discordant and incalculable action . All the great convulsions of our political history and half its discrepancies and futilities , so far as they have depended on political forms , have followed directly from the licentiousness of state sovereignty . It is not to be regretted , for the premature disclosure of its pretensions has brought down upon it a. mightier power , the abiding and irresistible tendencies of American civilization . Whether by violent blows or by incessant abrasion the exaggerated . power of the separ : *te state in our political system has continually declined , and is declining , and will in good time be reduced to its just proportions . When that time comes , along with a multitude of other siruplifications , we may perhaps look for an assimilated system of taxation over the whole realm , a tribute drawn for all the purposes of public administration , national or local , by accordant measures from a single source , the current product of the wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needless . multiplication of l ) ublic functionaries commissioned for the same purpose by separate authorities will cease , and the central government will be able to avail of all the real efficiency of local taxation , the intimate knowledge which the local authorities have of the property to be assessed . I see 110 sufficient reason why in these circumstances the whole tribute of the people may not be collected directly by taxation of incomes . It may be assumed that pending their arrival the revenues of the United States will be collected by the system to which we are now visibly approaching ; and the revenues of the several States with their dependent republics-anyhow , according to the wisdom of man and the patience of heaven .
