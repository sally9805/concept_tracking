txt No man in the world understands the peculiar complex political situation in Ohio and Indiana better than Gov . Foster , of this State . THE TIMES 'S correspondent was peculiarly fortunate , therefore , in obtaining an interview with him on the train to-day . Gov . Foster has two objects in stumping the State so thoroughly as he is doing  --  first , to address the people , and , second , to see local and county managers in all parts of the State and gather information and give instructions about the conduct of the campaign . In both of these he has no superior . At every station he is met by the proper men of the district , and in a few hasty words the situation is thoroughly canvassed . In this interview Gov . Foster said : " I am perfectly familiar with Republican plans , both for Ohio and Indiana , and I can say that things were never in better shape . All our plans have been carried out to the minutest particular . Such organization and determination to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is an efficient man in every school district who looks after local affairs , and I know as a fact that everything has been thoroughly canvassed . If anything within human power can prevent the gigantic Democratic frauds that are contemplated and are now being carried forward , this thorough organization of ours will do it . These terrible frauds are the only thing I fear , and I am not absolutely certain whether we shall detect enough of these to save ourselves or not . I certainly am confident that we shall carry Indiana , and in Ohio I can not see any reason to doubt that we shall gain a grand victory . On the Reserve the majority of last Fall will certainly be increased . So far as Cleveland and Cincinnati are concerned , I am in some doubt . In both cities there will be a much larger vote polled than before for years , and it is well known that wo had some advantages there last year that we do not possess this year . I expect that large schemes of fraud will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not closely watched as a general thing , but if that is so , with the arrangements which we have made , I do not see how they can fail to be detected . It is a part of the Democratic tactics this year , instigated from the National Head-quarters , to claim everything with wonderful effrontery . Then , in case they fail to gain everything they claim , they propose to risk the cry of fraud and make trouble in some way if at all possible . They may claim , for instance , that the election should be thrown into the Democratic House of Representatives , or something of that sort . We are willing that they should do the principal part of the blowing  --  that do n't count for much . We know what we are doing in the way of legitimate organization and work , and that never yet failed to tell . " " How will the car-loads of repeat &; that are constantly being sent into these States be detected ? " " We have already spotted large numbers . We have ascertained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return trips until Oct. 16 . We have a detective on every through train that passes through the State , and everything looking crooked is carefully noted . With all the precautions that have been taken , and with especial vigilance in the strongly Democratic wards and precincts , I can not see anything to fear in the outcome . "
