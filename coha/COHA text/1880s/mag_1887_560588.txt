THE primary ideal of Baptists is n*5t* to build up an ecclesiastical system , but to create high and manly Christian character . In other words , it is to create in each individual soul and life a legitimate independency of all men , in matters of faith and practice Godward . The more Christlike each man becomes in his estimates and standards of character , the more he will prize his individual rights as one of Christ 's freemen , and the more sacredly he will guard the rights of others . As Baptists have no formulated and authoritative creeds or decretals to which all their members must subscribe , few outside of their own ranks have made their tenets and practices a special study , or are capable of giving such an account of these as their churches would pronounce either fair or correct . Possibly none of the other large Christian bodies commonly known as " Evangelical " suffer so much from misconception and misrepresentation ; hence , a candid reader will be grateful for an honest answer to the question " Why am I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports 28,953 Baptist churches in the United States , with 2,572,238 communicants . These do not form one united church under an enforced standard of doctrine and a prescribed order of government , from which no congregation may vary . The aggregated sect is denominated by itself as the " Baptist Denomination , " and not the Baptist Church , because each separate congregation is held to be a complete New Testament church in itself . These thousands of churches , therefore , are entirely distinct from each other , and are independent in the management of their several internal affairs , much after the pattern of private families in social life . Their only visible element of unity is the Bible and the common faith and practice which they severally gather from its teachings . In the United States there are 1,305 Baptist associations , but these organizations hold no analogy to the synods , presbyteries , conferences , or convocations of other Christian bodies . Voluntary associations are // formed by the churches of any given vicinity simply for fraternal purposes . In these they confer with each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject of missions , the best methods of church work , the establishment and support of educational interests , and , if any church seeks advice in the management of its own affairs , the association will give it counsel . Its suggestions , however , in all cases , are merely advisory , and can in no wise bind the church which seeks its advice . All the churches hold that Christ has reserved to himself , as the Head of the churches , the absolute right of legislation for their government , and that He has laid down His changeless statutes in the sacred Scriptures ; consequently no Baptist body claims legislative prerogatives . Then all executive and judicial rights are lodged by Him in the churches themselves . From the decisions of the individual church , in all that concerns its own affairs , there can be no appeal , so that within its own jurisdiction its application of New Testament laws is final . It pretends to no infallibility in its interpretation of those laws , and hence it may seek the counsel of other churches in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because it is quite as infallible as those sister churches , who necessarily know less of its affairs , after the fullest explanation , than it knows itself . They can neither instruct it nor hold it under any authority whatever when it declines to follow their advice , and so each church is as absolute a spiritual democracy for all the purposes of self government as if it were the only church organization on earth . In the exercise of these democratic rights , it forms itself into a church in the first place , without the assistance of any outside body . Its only officers are a pastor and deacons ; it directs in the administration of the ordinances which Christ has appointed ; it receives its own members generally by a majority vote given in its business meetings ; it enforces its own discipline by the exercise of its popular suffrage , and is self-governing in all respects . Each . member stands on an exact equality in all that relates to the exercise of his voice and vote in the management of its affairs , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary to its well-being is done in open assembly , much after th&amp;. form of the primary town-meeting in the body politic . The pastor is a member of the body which he serves , and not of a separate clerical order outside of the church . He is. responsibio*. // only to his own church , being answerable to it for all his conduct , private and official . His settlement , dismission , or punishment for wrong-doing are entirely in the hands of his own congregation . Necessarily , his moral influence is larger than that of other members of his flock , provided that he maintains a high grade of pastoral consistency and Christ-like character ; but his office invests him with no ecclesiastical authority above that of any other member . This democratic parity is maintained on our Lord 's decision : " All ye are brethren . " His pastoral duty consists in feeding and tending the flock of Christ , under the direction of the Great Shepherd , so that he is the servant of the church for Christ 's sake , while Christ is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character of a Baptist church brings every member thereof back to his individual responsibility , on the broad basis of liberty and equality , removing membership therein as far as possible from all savor of officialism . The natural tendency of this liberal system is the cultivation of a proper respect for his own enlarged manhood . Of course , a selfwilled man , or a supine and ignorant man , who has little regard for his better nature , will act unworthily of this highly honorable order of church life and of the sacred trusts which it imposes , just as the same class of men disgrace their own citizenship in the State . But as free citizenship is adapted to lift the freeman above mere residence in the State , so in this case , freedom from every yoke which would bind a Baptist to the unquestioning obedience of church superiors lifts him far above the membership of a mere conventionalism in the church of Christ . Such religious democracy can not be true to itself , unless it conserves the rights of others , on principle . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ more than ecelesiasticism , must be a better disciple of Christ than a churchman , and must give freer scope to his individual thought and action than he can command where his voice in church management is denied . He is bone of the bone which frames the church of his choice , and , being free from all outside domination , he stands as the peer of his brethren in the discharge of equal duties and the exercise of equal rights . Such a democracy is educative and every way calculated to make an entire brotherhood relatively strong in Christian manliness , tobust in a self-reliance which these stout principles must inspire when they are held and used intelligently . // Manly characteristics are fostered and developed in Baptist churches by their radical requirements concerning the material of which they are composed . Many foolishly suppose that the chief difference between them and other churches is found in the questions growing out of baptism . A greater caricature could scarcely be drawn than that which is couched in this mistake . Possibly , it grows in part out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the names of Christian denominations generally are sad misnomers in this age . Judging from these alone , it is natural to supp6se that baptism draws the line of demarkation between Baptists and others ; but for the same reason it might be supposed that the only difference between Presbyterians and others is found in that they have a Presbytery ; or in the case of Methodists , that they follow the lines of method ; or in that of Episcopalians , that they hold to an Episcopacy in government . Yet , none of these regard their name as characterizing their chief differences with their brethren . All of them , under their several definitions , claim to have a valid baptism , an efficient Presbytery , an order of bishops , and a methodical rule of life . Wherever these honorable bodies may locate their distinguishing differences , the Baptists place theirs in the demand for a positive moral change wrought in the soul of the convert , by the direct agency of the Holy Spirit , as an indispensable qualification for membership in their churches . The New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phrases , " born from above , " " born of God , " " born again ; " a state coi1*monly known in Evangelical parlance , as regeneration by the Holy Spirit . This condition peremptorily forbids all membership in the churches secured by civil law , as in State Churches ; all birthright membership secured by infant baptism ; and all place in the churches secured by a merely intellectual subscription to a set of tenets or to an ecclesiastical creed . The very essence of the Baptist position is found in the fact that an intelligent personal trust in Christ for salvation forms the basis of Gospel church life . The rejection of infant baptism and submission to immersion according to the New Testament are pure corollaries of this vital requirement . Neither the rejection of infant baptism nor submission to immersion , nor both together , make a Baptist . The first qualification is found in thorough soul regeneration , and these considerations touching baptism are purely secondary thereto . Neither can baptism be put in the place of // regeneration , nor be so associated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other . Baptists never administer baptism to the firmest believer until he has satisfied the church that he is regenerate already ; then , because he is regenerate , his regenera - tion entitles him to baptism . Having satisfied the church that a divine work has been wrought on his moral nature , this is attested by his " burial with Christ in baptism . " Christ has nowhere empowered his church to violate the free choice of any human being , by forcing baptism upon him without his personal knowledge of Christ as his Saviour ; and when he has voluntarily taken upon him the service of Christ , the church has no right to deny him this privilege of discipleship ; hence , he is baptized , not to regenerate him , but because he is entitled to baptism as one who is already regenerated by the Holy Spirit . In keeping with this view , Baptists hold that no church has the right to add to its membership those for whom Christ did not appoint specific terms of membership . He bestowed on every man the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by the end of the first century , every precept and practice which he enjoined were embodied in the New Testament . That book , therefore , informs every person what order of obedience the Christian Scriptures require at his hands , and of what material the Apostolic Churches were composed , so that under these circumstances , no church of after times has the right to tamper with , much less to alter or deviate from , the Apostolic model . For this and other reasons , the Baptists protest against making any tradition , patristic or catholic , any creed , canon , law , or decree , no matter how old it may be or by whom constructed , the fountain of doctrines , ordinances , or government . They appeal to the Scriptures alone , and will stand or fall on their teachings . herbert Spencer in his " Data of Ethics " ( p. 257 ) , expresses the hope that the ethical principles laid down by Christ will eventually be acted upon in the practice of the world . But Baptists insist that for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , as well as for all moral ends , and that in such an appeal duty to himself links every man to the divine right of interpreting for himself what those Scriptures teach . He is bound by every consideration which is worthy of his nature to shake off all false deference for other authority , to use all the powers of his mind in an independent investigation of the New Testament , with the // pure-hearted purpose to be governed by its facts and truths . But in consideration that he is not infallible , he must divest himself of all conceit , and come to the investigation as an honest and reverential seeker of the truth , for the truth 's sake . The right of privately interpreting the Scriptures , as the gift of God to every man , does not carry with it the right of any man to . follow his own fancies , predilections or whims in choosing what he will obey and what he will throw aside , nor does it allow him to diverge from or add to its teachings , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would be mere trifling with the truth , which must finally convert the doctrine of liberty into rebellion against its Author . No church can step in between the Scriptures and the personal convictions of the man who searches the Scriptures for the purpose of honestly obeying them , nor can it enforce any teaching upon him by sheer authority , though that teaching itself be purely Scriptural . Church authority is nothing here against personal conviction , nor has the civil magistrate the power to prescribe a religion for his fellow-man , neither has he the right to punish them for rejecting the religion which the State prescribes . This broad doctrine of soul-liberty the Baptists have maintained for century after century , against the rack , the dungeon and the stake in Europe ; and against fine , imprisonment , scourging , and banishment in America during its early history . This is abundantly clear from the writings of Locke , Milton , Roger Williams , Jeremy Taylor , Motley and Bancroft . In regard to their sufferings in this country , a most frank and reliable account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Brooks Adams , son of the late Charles Francis Adams ( Chap . IV. ) , in his " Emancipation of Massachusetts . " Baptists sincerely re .. gret that all men are not Christians , and would rejoice if all Christians held their principles ; but they resist the assumed right of all churches to connect themselves with the State , and they resist all governments which arrogate to themselves the prerogative to establish a church , or even to maintain religion itself by law ,  --  to support the conformists to any church , to punish the nonconformists ,  --  or to interfere in any way with the free exercise of any man 's religion . They would not submit to have their own doctrines or practices enforced either upon themselves or others by any human government or statute . The laws of Massachusetts // banished them for about half a century ; as early as 1656 the laws of New Netherland fined , imprisoned , and banished them ; and in Virginia they were hounded by the same cruelties till after the Revolutionary war . Virginia law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the dictates of conscience " was secured to them by the 20th section of its " Bill of Rights . " Even the Constitution of the United States did not fully protect them at first , as its VI . Article left Congress at liberty to impose religious tests in other cases than those of " office or public trust . under the United States . " The entire Baptist body , without a known exception , supported the Revolution , and , as free Americans , they demanded a guarantee of religious liberty ingrafted into the organic law of the land . Jefferson , Madison , Patrick Henry , and others , stood by them , and on the 8th of August , 1789 , they laid their claim to full religious liberty before Gen. Washington , then President of the Union . He also espoused their cause , recommended to Congress , and on September 23d , 1789 , by his influence , caused the amendment found in the I. Article to be passed , which says that " Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baptists reject the doctrine of toleration in religion , and demand absolute religious freedom as the inalienable right of all men , because , by implication , the power which claims the right to tolerate others also claims the right to crush them when it chooses to tolerate them no longer . They maintain that so far as the civil law is concerned , a man may be a Jew , a Mohammedan , a Christian of any sect , a Pagan , or an infidel , with impunity . As far back as 1527 , the Swiss Baptists , in their confession of Schleitheim , drew the distinction between the right of the civil power to enforce civil law and order , and its power to punish for religion . In 1614 , Leonard Buscher , a Baptist of London , wrote to King James , in his Plea for Liberty of Conscience : " May it please your majesty and Parliament to understand that , by fire and sword , to constrain princes and peoples to receive that one religion of the Gospel , is wholly against the mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and state . " Roger Williams , the founder of Rhode Island , said , in 1644 , that " it was the will and command of God that permission of the most Paganish , Jewish , Turkish , or anti-Christian consciences and worships be granted to all men in all nations and counties . That // civil states with their officers of justice are not governors or defenders of the spiritual and Christian state and worship . " All Baptists agree with these , their great ancestors , that every form of disability or persecution for religion is radically wrong , and should a Baptist rob any man of his religious liberty by statute , penalty , or sword , in that act and for that reason he would cease to be a Baptist . Everywhere they have been put to death for this doctrine of religious freedom . On the plains of the Netherlands and in higher Germany ; in the Alpine valleys and crags of Switzerland , and in the cities of England , the ashes of their martyrs have been the sport of fitful winds and brutal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the true history of the Dutch , German , and Swiss States , of Great Britain and the United States of America , can not be written apart from the philosophical positions of this peculiar and ancient Republic of churches on the subject of civil and religious liberty . According to Bancroft , the most pronounced and best defined rights of man , which fifty millions of American freeman boast to-day , find historic recognition in the chronicles of their struggles and progress . The germinal idea of all Baptist life is , and ever has been , that the eternal law of God lays the axe at the root of all class , condition , or caste in religious life , and that the religion of Christ is an elevating democracy for every soul of man . Again , Baptists utterly reject the effete system of sacramentarianism , as unworthy of human belief and contradictory of Christ 's efficacious mediation . Neither baptism nor the Lord 's Supper were ordained by Him for the purposes of human salvation . The ample and even infinite provisions which He made to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work of the Comforter . Therefore , Baptists insist that His ordinances shall be left in the places which He gave to them , and shall not be made to usurp His saving office and honor . His body was buried first in the waves of the Jordan , then in the tomb of Joseph , and baptism preaches like burial with Him . The religious use of all the waters on the globe has never removed one stain of sin from man 's conscience or heart , neither can bread and wine , taken at the supper , impart the grace of God or prove its existence in the soul of the communicant . The only design of the super is to " proclaim His death till He come . " So far from exerting a saving influence , in part or whole , upon the souls of those who receive // these ordinances , He enjoined them simply as acts of personal obedience to Himself . They are monuments of the great work which He wrought for us , but neither of them can be moral renovators of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous heresy than that which invests baptism with any moral power or magical energy in purifying the heart , or that which makes it in any sense the channel through which the saving grace of God is conveyed to man . They also hold that it is quite as dangerous a heresy to make the supper a test of Christian fellowship , a proof of Christian character , or a visible bond of Christian love . From Judas Iscariot down , thousands have sat with Christ 's disciples at one common table , who were entirely destitute of Christian character , affection , or fellowship . The act of partaking at the same supper table , neither Christianizes those who gather there nor un-Christianizes those who do not . The New Testament is a stranger to all such arrogant ecclesiastical assumptions . Christians celebrate two symbolical acts in observing the ordinances , nothing more , for Christ Himself is their Saviour , not his ordinances . His mediation saves men , not their baptism ; and their souls feed , not on the loaf of the supper , but on Him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finds the true test of Christian love , fellowship , and character , in feeding and clothing a destitute brother . The Apostle Paul finds it in distrib uting to the necessities of the saints , in their bearing each others ' burdens , in forbearing with each other and forgiving each other , and in doing good of every sort to those who are of the household of faith . The Apostle John lodges it in a willingness to lay down their lives for each other , if need be . Yet the Master of all these Apostles puts it on a higher plane than any of them , when he locates true love in the golden rule : " Whatsoever ye will that men should do to you , do ye even so to them . " This test is worth something , because it costs something , having cost him his own life . That sacrameritarian standard which tests and proves Christian love and character by the act of eating bread together and drinking of the same cup , is of too cheap an order to meet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met before , who have never passed a word or exchanged a kind act with each other , are ever and anon receiving a morsel of bread and taking a sip of wine in common at the Supper , but what special love do they show to each other in that act more than they // had previously shown before such a meeting ? When the divine tests of love established by the New Testament are pushed aside , and one Christian comes to measure his love to another by a circumstantial act in which any hypocrite or profane person may share , if he pleases to do so , it is time to ask the question : ' " Whether or not ecclesiasticism is erecting its own standard or Christ 's ? " For reasons equally cogent and scriptural Baptists reject that sacramentarian doctrine commonly known as infant baptism . No well defined ground has yet been taken in justification of this practice but that chosen by Augustine and adopted by the Roman Catholic communion , namely , that if an infant dies unchristened it is excluded from Heaven . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that baptism is regeneration de facto , and as the babe is defiled by original sin , that , therefore , baptism secures its salvation . Those who christen children outside of the Catholic fold have never yet been able to define what practical moral relation the christened babe holds either to God or man , the church on earth or the church in Heaven , which he did not hold before his christening . Some of the Protestant state churches of Europe give this verbal definition , and all of them give it in substance , namely , that baptism makes him " A child of God , a member of Christ , and an inheritor of the Kingdom of Heaven . " Thus the nominal membership of these churches is made up of those who are christened according to the law of the land , and its inhabitants are brought into the state church without their knowledge or consent . Other churches than those which are established by law , both in Europe and in America , are strangely perplexed as to the relation which a christened infant sustains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baptism the unconscious babe is as much regenerated as after . They further hold that , before his christening , he is not a member of their churches , and yet , that , after his baptism , he is not so united with the church as to discharge the proper duties which devolve upon the recognized members of that body . He is not expected to meet its responsibilities , to contribute to its support , to attend its worship , to honor its brotherhood , to share its privileges , not even in receiving the Lord 's Supper , nor to answer to its watchful discipline for his bad conduct . Then , if his infant brother or sister dies unchristened , these churches understand the Gospel // too well , and love it too much , to suppose for a moment that the gate of Heaven is shut in his face for that reason ,  --  a conclusion which all who are Christ-like in Heaven and earth must approve . From the teachings of the New Testament , Baptists are compelled to believe that the helpless infant who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether those parents be Christians or heathen , Jews or Mohammedans , religionists of any sort or infidels , is , by virtue of our Lord 's mediation , eternally sheltered and beatified in the bosom of the Lamb of God in Heaven . Further , Baptists are deterred from the christening of their infant offspring by that God-fearing , parental love which will not pervert a Gospel ordinance by submitting a babe thereto , and so leave him in a nondescript relation which he is a stranger to in the Gospel . In their apprehension of a pure New Testament church , to christen him would leave him stamped neither with the distinctive mark of the regenerate nor of the unregenerate . To christen him , would assume that he is not exactly fit for heaven if he should die unbaptized , nor entirely fit for full fellowship in the church on earth if he lives and is baptized . For this and many other reasons , Baptists say with Lange , of Jena , who is far enough from being of their communion " Would the Protestant Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of infants must of necessity be abolished . " As it has already been said , the primary thought with Baptists is to make men stalwart Christians , who know what they believe , and why they hold their faith . They make baptism so subordinate in the Christian system , that instead of enforcing it as a fundamental act in the religious life of a human being , they do reverence to that new immortal life by first teaching it the knowledge of sin , the need of a Saviour , and the precious act of loving Him . As they attribute no merit nor virtue to baptism , they first consecrate him to Christ as a being endowed with reason and responsibility . They dedicate him to God in the holiness of parental prayer , watchful love , and holy training ; then , as soon as lie is able to discern the Lord 's death , they labor to win him to Christ 's cross that he may take Christ 's yoke upon himself by personal choice . No amount of ecclesiastical blame , misrepresentation , or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honesty see the consistency of baptizing his infant when out of the church , and then leaving him there until by his personal conversion he is allowed to come in , because that conversion // has made him fit for the church both below and above . Nor can he as a parent , responsible to God , impose upon his child the injurious notion , that because he has been christened as a babe , he has somehow entered into covenant with God , to which covenant he was not himself a party . This would delude the child with the notion that he is not to be saved precisely as unchristened children are . If his baptism did not engraft him into Christ and His church , it will greatly perplex him to know what it meant ; and if it did so engraft him , he must conclude that some moral relation exists between Christ and himself which unbaptized children do not sustain ; and hence , that he needs no such spiritual regeneration as they need . Baptists can not pu1* their children under the deleterious spell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led to Christ first , to be saved by actual trust in His redeeming merits without the use of baptism , and 4hen they must be baptized in obedience to His command , because they love Him and voluntarily obey Him . These are some of the reasons , and but some , " Why I am a Baptist . " Regeneration and not baptism is the soul of a Baptist church . These democratic bodies agree with Dr. Jacob , of the Church of England , who says , in his " Ecclesiastical Polity of the New Testament " ( p. 270 ) : " Notwithstanding all * , hat has been written by learned men upon this subject , it remains indisputable that infant baptism is not mentioned in the New Testament . No instance of it is recorded there ; no allusion is made to its effects ; no directions are given for its administration . However reasonably we may be convinced that we find in the Christian Scriptures the fundamental idea from which infant baptism was afterward developed ' and by which it may now be justified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not an apostolic ordinance .
