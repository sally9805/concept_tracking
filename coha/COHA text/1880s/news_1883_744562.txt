txt The complaints of the dry goods trade which were yesterday laid before the Executive Committee of the trunk line railroads regarding the classification of the merchandise in which they deal and the freight charges to which it . ; is subject bring to mind very forcibly the part which railroads have long ; played as a taxing power . Neither the general Government nor State Governments have any authority . to lay a tax on inter-State traffic , and . the commercial prosperity of the country has been largely due to the fact that so far as Government action is concerned we have had internal free tradet Products of different States and of different sections of the country are freely interchanged , and industries are left to develop in a normal manner under the influence of competition . While this is true so far as the laws of the Nation and of the States are concerned , it is known that the ' railroads exercise to whatever extent they may deem expedient ' and consistent with their own ' interests the power to regulate commerce between States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same State by discriminating taxes . It appears that during the war , when the production of domestic dry goods was very active and the , home demand large , and when their market value was several times what it is now , they were rated as first class 11 merchandise , in the tariff schedules of the . principal railroads , and that , classification is still maintained . The ' result is that ' the freight charges , for carrying a car-load of the products of Eastern cotton mills . to Western markets are more than twice as great as the , charges for carrying imported and domestic ' groceries , for instance . At the same time , the manufacture of these goods is springing up in the West and South , and the distributing railways of those sections are ' charging very low rates for ! delivering the product in the local markets . The consequence is that Eastern ; fabrics are being gradually shut out of the Western markets by , the operation of railroad rates . The effect , in short , is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The merchants who appeared at the conference in Commissioner FINx 's office yesterday gave some very , cogent , reasons why the rates of the trunk lines should be more favorable to domestic dry goods . There is discrimination against them as compared with other goods of a corresponding value , and there is discrimination against them as compared with the same class of goods produced in other parts of the country . Moreover , as freight westward on the trunk lines is light compared to the movement eastward , it is obvious that sound policy would favor a promotion of its volume by fair if not liberal rates . It may be said that it is as much for the interest of the railroad companies as for that of the manufacturers and dealers in domestic fabrics to facilitate their distribution in the home market and that this discouragement is not intentional . This is possible , but it is hardly to be supposed that the transportation companies have been ignorant of the facts now brought to their attention or of the effect of their policy . Moreover , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case has been brought to our attention in which it is certain that the deliberate purpose in fixing the classification of goods was to discriminate in favor of local manufactures and to protect them from competition . In the printed tariff of the " great Southern freight and passenger lines from Northern and Eastern cities , via Charleston or Savannah , to all points in the South and South-west , " we find that domestic denims , sheetings , shirting , and ticking , in boxes and bales , " South bound , " are rated as " first class , " while precisely the same goods " shipped direct from Southern factories to all points North , East , and West " are sixth class . The result is that , taking , for instance , Columbus , Ga. , au important Southern manufacturing point , the rate for these goods sent North to Baltimore , Philadelphia , New-York , Providence , or Boston , is 49 cents per hundred pounds , while for the products of Eastern mills sent South it is $1 2 per hundred pounds . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which is to protect the Southern cotton factories from Northern competition . This could not be done by authority of the Nation or of the State of Georgia , but it is done by a combination of railroads .
