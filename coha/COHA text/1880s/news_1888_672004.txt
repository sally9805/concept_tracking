txt A PATRIOT AND A TRAITOR . The duty on tin plate , like the doctrine of transubstantiation , is a severe test of faith .. For the manufacture of tin plate is not even an infant but an embryonic industry . Somebody thought that he could make tin plate in this country if a protective duty was put upon the foreign article , just as somebody told the Arthur commission that he could raise jute butts in this country if he were protected against the Indian product . Just why we should divert labor to the production of jute or tin plate for which we should have to pay more than we pay now has not been revealed except to the protectionists of the thirty-third degree . One of these lives in Newark ; his name is KETCHAM , and he has been intervie wed by the Tribune . The Committee of Ways and Means put tin plates on the free list upon the sordid and prosaic ground that the duty which enhanced the price of tin plates to the consumer was not needed for revenue and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . not tempted anybody to go into the business . Mr. KETCHAM admits that this is true , but he says it is because the duty , being 20 per cent. , ( though his figures make it 25 , ) is not big enough . With the duty doubled he thinks that " we should see in a few months 24,000 why 24,0007 men set to work on tin plates alone and provided . with employment for twelve months in the year at good wages . " " Why , think of it ! " he exclaims , rising into eloquence . " With a protective duty on tin plates we . could start a city as big as Newark and keep its chimney fires ablaze all the year round . It would be a market for the farmer which does n't exist to-day . " This is a beautiful picture , since , of course , the 24,000 workmen who would be employed in tin plate are now languishing in almshouses in consequence of the passage of the Mills bill and . earning nothing at all , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be increased a picayune " to the buyer by an increase of 40 per cent . in the price of its material to the manufacturer . Mr. KETCHAM admits that his views can have no weight with " men who are not in sympathy with our industrial progress and have no real friendship for American labor , " but as for himself he is determined to act the part of a patriot and apparently to make tin plate if the public will kindly pay him a bonus of 40 per cent . instead of a beggarly 20 for engaging in that meritorious work . We have cited this bright example , of sympathy with our industrial progress and true friendship for American labor in order to contrast it with the base and groveling behavior of another manufacturer , a manufacturer of cloaks , interviewed in. yesterday 's Evening Post . This sordid and soulless person seems to desire nothing but to make money in his business entirely irrespective of the claims of his country . So far from yearning to give employment to American labor he virtually admits that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be pleased . He openly boasts of having introduced into his establishment a " cutting wheel " which enables one cutter to do the work of half a dozen and deprives five men of employment . If he were patriotic enough to discard this diabolical device and to employ as many cutters as there were cloaks to be cut at one time , he says that he could not compete with the cloakmakers of Berlin , whose hands are paid more for piece work , although they do not make so high wages . But if ho were in sympathy with our industrial progress and had any real friendship for American labor he would see that the point was to employ as many men as possible , and he would discard all laborsaving inventions which tended to lessen the number . Of course this would be a more costly method of doing business , but he could make that up by asking Congress to clap on more duties , and not by treasonably diminishing his running expenses . It is true that this process would greatly increase the cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose interests the tariff does not contemplate , being enacted for the purpose of providing employment for American labor whether it is already employed or not . This shameless manufacturer of cloaks is of course in favor of the Mills bill , and he even intimates that with free wool and free dye stuffs he could compete with the German manufacturer with no protection- at all , owing to the unholy arts through which he deprives American labor of employment by making one man do the work of six . It . is evident that a man animated by such antipathy to our industrial progress and such hostility to American labor can not be dealt With by a mere tariff . Penal legislation , forbidding any manufacturer to make use of any device for dispensing with human labor , is the only thing that will meet such cases . and will carry to its logical results the great principle that it is the business of a Government to provide employment for the people regardless of expense .               @ @ @ @ @ @
