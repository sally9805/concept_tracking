txt " Poor Betts , " said an old citizen this morning , as he read the brief telegram . from Washington announcing the death of William H. Betts in that city . " Poor Betts ! He is better off now , and he was a mighty good shot in his day . " And thereby hangs a tale of a strangely checkered career , full of incidents of wild adventure , and showing how bad company and unrestrained indulgence can blight a life which otherwise might have been full of honor , told by a citizen who had known Betts long and well . William H. Betts was a member of one of the most respected families of Alabama . He was imbued with all the sentiments of chivalry prevalent among Southern youth previous to the war , ready to resent an insult almost betore it was given , and at the same time ready to lay down his life for a friend , or to suffer martyrdom for a sentiment . In those days gambling was a polite accomplishment , in which nearly everybody indulged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rude name as gambler would have been quickly resented , notwithstanding the partition which divided the gentlemanly gambler from the professional was very thin . Among the fast young men who flourished in Columbus and Montgomery none was faster than the brilliant Betts , and the allurements of the game soon led him across the line , until the professionals had their hooks firmly fastened into him and thus led him along in the course which proved to be one of ever downward grade . When the war called the young men of the country to the defense of the State it found William H. Betts in his place as Colonel of an Alabama regiment . It was while stationed at Pensacola , Fla. , that his first act of violence of which record exists was committed . Col. Betts had his wife with him , and one evening the lady complained to her husband of the manner of one of the men in camp . Col. Betts asked his wife to promenade around the camp with him . " When you see the man point him out , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said : " There he is . " Almost instantly a bullet went whizzing from the revolver of the husband , who coolly continued his promenade . As the killing WOOS done in defense of his wife 's honor no trouble followed to him , and in the events of life on the field the affair was soon forgotten except among those most intimately concerned in it . When the war closed Betts found himself , without money , cast among reckless men in Columbus , and lie soon became recognized as a professional gambler . He had rooms which were elegantly fitted up , considering the times , and it was his wont to entice therein unsuspecting countrymen who had just disposed of their cotton . When he had won the victim 's money and wanted to get rid of him he would asu him if he ever saw a , " hoodoo . " Of course , the victim had not . Drawing aside a curtain which had a closet in the room , there stood a full- ized manikin , with a candle dimly burning inside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The stranger would be only too willing to leave so horrible a place . Two of Betts 's intimate friends at this time were Milt Malone , who had murdered three men , for the last of which he was convicted and sentenced to death , and Penn Bedell , who had killed Policeman Rasberry in Atlanta . Mahone committed suicide the day on which he was to have been banged , and thus gained a nominal victory over the law . Bedell was shot dead . It may readily be imagined that where three such men thrived they had things pretty much their own way . It was the period just previous to reconstruction . There was no law , and an officer who attempted to make criminals think there was was not long in discovering his mistake . One day one of the bullies of the town was imposing on a little boy , which so angered Betts that he let him have a lively fusilade , only wounding him , however . As Columbus was growing warm for Betts , he i next made his appearance in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he carried on his gambling operations with boldness and dash . So open did they become that the authorities determined to wind them-up . The officers surrounded the rendezvous of the gamblers and found the doors closed . The Marshal attempted to force the door , when he was met with a ready bullet from Betts , killing him . Betts wits subsequently tried and acquitted of the charge of murder . One of the peculiarites of the trial was the dedication of an original poem , of about a column in length , by the prisoner to Judge O. A. Bull , who tried the case . When Gov . Mead issued his order requiring the registry of voters , so that they might take the oath of allegiance , Betts again brought himself into prominence in a peculiar way . Going to the office of the Registrar , an officer stood ready to take the gentleman 's name . Betts gave the name of his black-and-tau dog , which he held up in his arms , as being one as well qualified to vote as a negro . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old argument on him , when help prevented further trouble . ' Some time passed away , when Betts was again heard from , this time in Albany , Ga . An alarm of burglary was given there one night . The suspected spot was surrounded by a lot of men . Presently the burglar emerged and , making a bold dash , cut through the crowd and escaped . The next morning the matter was being talked over , when Betts quietly remarked , " If I had been there he would not have escaped so easily . " " Perhaps you were the burglar , " interposed a bystander named Amnions . Owing to a flash trom Betts 's revolver Ammons knew no more of the subsequent proceedings . So notorious had Betts 's character become by this time that a reward of $1,000 was offered by Gov . Bullock for his arrest . In the Summer of 150 he made his appearance boldly in Atlanta , consorting exclusively with men of his class . It was ascertained one night that he was in the room of : Maud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was situated in the Muhienbrink Building . A number of police surrounded the ? house , while a well-known Atlanta detective entered and secured his prisoner after . it desperate struggle . He was taken to Albany , tried for the killing of killing Ammons , and acquitted . About this time Col. Betts , who had been ' a rampant Democrat , began to weaken in his allegiance to that party , and , like Col. Jelk Brown , became alive to the fact that there was Dread and butter in the Republican Party . When an appropriation was made . in 3812 , for the overflowed people of Mississippi and Alabama a Congressional election was pending . It is notorious that thousands of pounds of this overflowed bacon was sent to sections which did not know what an overflow was . Col. Betts announced himselt as the Republican candidate for the Opelika ( Ala. ) district , and had 20,000 pounds of bacon sent to that town to his order . Three days before the ele. tion , Opelika was tilled with negroes from all over the county @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fried fat meat while waiting for the chance to vote for Col. Betts . The scenes of these three days are described by the natives as having been a pandemonium . The consequences were such that Col. Betts decided that lie had better go North , where he has spent the last 10 years of his life . He was heard from in New-York through having brought into court an old friend on time charge of stealing his coat , where he quietly closed up his evidence by acknowledging that he had killed only three men .
