txt The Governor explains to our correspondent at Albany his reasons for withholding his signature from two of the bills relating to this city which he was confidently expected to sign . These reasons relate wholly to the defective wording of the bills , and we are left to infer that he was entirely favorable to their . purpose . We have not at hand the text of these bills in the form in which they passed , and are therefore unable to judge of the pertinency of the Governor 's objections further than it appears from his own remarks . We are bound to presume that they were conclusive to his mind . The Governor has always scrutinized the measures presented for his approval with great care , and more than once has pointed out defects in time to have them remedied . He has also made it a rule not to approve measures which , on account of imperfection in their form , were likely to lead to confusion and litigation . In returning one of the city reform bills to the Assembly for amendment he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for similar defects . This was not done , and the consequence is that two important measures fail on account of the defective form in which they were drawn . To the so-called Tenure of Office act the Governor objects that it fixes and regulates the terms of office only of such officers as shall be appointed during the incumbency of the present Mayor and those of their immediate successors , leaving the next Mayor power to appoint only such successors . We confess that we are unable.to understand the force of this objection from the meagre statement that we ' have received . It was not intended in any way to change the general tenure of office of the heads of departments and other municipal officers appointed by the Mayor . That was left as already fixed by law . The sole purpose of the bill was to prevent the present Mayor from filling for the full term , with the advice and consent of the Board of Aldermen , the positions which were to fall vacant during the present year . It intentionally applied to those alone , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expire soon after he left the office , in order that the new Mayor might fill the places without the consent of the Aldermen . The general power of the Mayor to make appointments thereafter was left unaffected . No existing law relating thereto was repealed or modified , except so far as inconsistent with the purpose aimed at . If , as the Governor says , two entirely different limitations of the terms of those to be appointed were provided for , that was certainly a serious defect . The Park Commission ? bill the Governor declares to be " a jumble contradicting itself . " The defect which he clearly specifies is the lack of any provision definitely fixing the terms of the Commissioners after the first appointments . The bill provides for three Commissioners , one to hold office for two , one for four , and one for six years , and the evident purpose was that , after the expiration of the term of each , a successor should be appointed for a term of six years . This appears not to have been expressed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is until the Legislature has another opportunity to act . The original Park Commission bill reported to the Assembly and providing for a single head was clearly drawn and ought to have been passed , but it was hurriedly mangled in the Senate to meet the objection that the duties of the department were too numerous and heavy for ope man , and the result is a defeat of all action . There was a good deal of this slipshod kind of work during the season , due generally to bungling efforts to modify measures which had been more or less carefully matured . We have no intimation that the Governor has signed the bills providing for the new parks , for the repavement of Fifth-avenue , for adding the President of the Fire Department to the Aqueduct Commission , and for improving the operation of the sinking fund , nor have we received any explanation of his objections to ' those measures . We have no doubt of the honesty of Gov . CLEVELAND 'S purposes in withholding his approval from any act of legislation , and it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that or precipitancy.
