txt The Echo Agricole considers that the harvest prospects in theaorth , with tolerable weather , are eminently promising ; good in the central districts ; scarcely up to the mark in the west and east , and well up to the average in the south-west and the districts around Paris . The quality in general is decidedly superior to that of the season 1878-9 . There are also good prospects of the crops of potatoes , beets , and hops . The hay crop is not successful , but there is every chance of a good aftermath . The fruit trees and vineyards do not share the improving aspect , excepting the olive , which promises a good yield . In Holland there is an excellent crop of rye . In Germany , rye , coiza , and potatoes require more sun . The hay crop is very bad , and the only thing that looks well is wheat . Austria suffers much from wet weather . In Hungary , barley , wheat , and rye are very promising , and oats and maize are considerably above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantity and quality . Russia is complaining loudly of a deficiency , partly owing to the presence of myriads of insects . LONDON , July 16 . ? A Berlin dispatch says the Government has published , during the last few days , many reports on the harvest expectations in the different Provinces , and a r6sum6 of all these statements appears in the semi-official report of the Provincial Correspondence , which says it was generally feared that the harvest would be a miserable one , but , after the very favorable weather of June , it is hoped the harvest will exceed former expectations . Reports from different Provinces of the monarchy given by the agricultural societies , state that the fear of distress appears to have had no foundation whatever . Corn has certainly suffered very much from frost , and the reports from many Provinces are very unfavorable in this respect , but in some of the highly-cultivated districts a good corn harvest may be reckoned on .
