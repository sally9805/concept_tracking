txt Those who imagine that Tammany intends to run its straight city and county ticket without looking for any support except what the ticket itself will ' attract must assume that Tammany intends to be defeated for the sake of revealing its exact voting power or else they have not carefully studied the relative strength of political factions in this city . There is probably no constituency in the country in which there is such a large uncertain ele- ' ment and so variable a vote , but there are limits beyond which the variation is not likely to go . The largest vote ever cast in the city was that of 1880 , when it was 205,379 , and this was some 12,000 below the registry . The increase of voting population in four years is about 10 per cent. , and an equally full vote this year would be over 225,000 . In 1880 the Republican Electoral ticket received 81,730 votes , and the Democratic ticket 123,013 . The proportion at other elections has varied materially from this , and generally to the disadvantage of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorable to the Republican Party it might have retained its ratio of the total vote , which would have been about 90,000 to 135,000 for the Democrats , but it is not likely to retain anything like that proportion . Still , these figures may be taken as roughly indicating the relative party strength if the conditions were favorable for measuring it fairly . How , then , are the 135,000 possible Democratic votes divided between the factions of that party ? In 1879 , when Joni KELLY ran for Governor , he received the faithful support of his Tammany followers and polled 43,047 votes in this city . ROBINSON 'S vote of 60,556 gave no indication of the strength of the anti-Tammany Democrats , as he received many Republican votes which CORNELL 'S candidacy could not command . But in 1881 there were three candidates for Surrogate , the total vote for whom was 148,385 . Mr. ROLLINS , the Republican candidate , received 57,275 ; WALKER , County Democrat , 43,454 , and CALVIN , supported by Tammany and Irving Hall , 46,914 . This year Irving Hall is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe that the two organizations united are at least as strong as Tammany alone . . Moreover , the unqualified fidelity of these factions to the national ticket of the party will give them a certain advantage . Aside from the complication introduced by the national contest , the Republican Party in the city could outvote either of the Democratic factions by a safe margin , but it is so weakened by the revolt from BLAINE that nothing but an exceptionally good city ticket , with quite an unwonted evidence of good faith in supporting it , would hold the party together in the municipal contest . There is at all times a considerable independent vote to be counted on in city elections , provided it is properly appealed to . In 1880 the Democrats united on a municipal ticket and nominated Mr. GRACE for Mayor . The Republican candidate , Mr. DOWD , received sufficient independent support , notwithstanding it was a Presidential year , to poll 98,715 votes against 101,760 for GRACE . It is not unlikely that the complete union of the Republicans in behalf of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , KELLY was accused of trading off more or less of the Tammany vote on the Electoral ticket to make sure of the election of his municipal candidates . There are probably no less than 20,000 voters in the city sufficiently accustomed to discriminate between their duty as citizens of New-York and their duty as citizens of the United States to cast their votes for Mayor without reference to their general party preferences . Their votes are not at all likely to go to the Tammany ticket . A strong anti-Tammany Democratic ticket would be pretty sure to attract them . The , determination of independent Republicans to support Cleveland would add materially to this contingent , Making Taramany the ex , travagant allowance of 70,000 of the 135 , - 000 Democratic votes , and leaving only 65,000 to the County Democracy and Irving Hall , it is evident that the chance of the latter in a municipal contest with a good ticket would be by far the better . It is not unlikely that it could add 30,000 to its vote from outside sources . It is surmised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bargain with the Republican machine for support for his municipal ticket in return for votes for BLAINE , or even half votes covered with the name of BUTLER . It is not credible that this would help him . The number of votes that could be exchanged in this way under the peculiar conditions of the present canvass would not exceed 10,000 on each side . These would do BLAINE no good and would not save KELLY . Any dummy nominations by . the O'Brien Republicans would drive Republican votes to the other Democratic ticket , and would not be unlikely to increase the defection from the Elaine Electoral ticket . In whatever way we look at it , it seems clear that Tammany - can have no expectation of succeeding with its straight ticket , and the only rational explanation of its purpose is that it is to be used as a basis for proposals which may bring the Democratic factions together in support of a single list of candidates .                    @
