Tm* element of disinterestedness is nearly gone from our politics . We do not all speak out so bluntly as the Colorado editor , who informed his readers* that announcements of candidacy would be inserted at the uniform rate of five dollars , and that " all political work " would be charged to the person ordering it , unless it was paid for in advance . It would be better , perhaps , if the matter were put once for all upon such a simple footing . There was a convention held at Chicago last year at which some millions of words were spoken , and among them there were ten perfectly sincere ones , uttered by a voice from out of the Lone Star : " What are we here for if not for the offices ? " Such is still the power of absolute sincerity over the human mind , that this was the effective speech of the occasion . All is forgotten but the noise of the chairman 's haunner and this admirable epitome of the situation by Mr. O'Flanagan . On a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was astonished to find himself sitting in the chairman 's seat at what was supposed to be a political meeting . He enjoyed an interesting and a novel experience . The evening before , a committee called upon him and invited him ( a most unpolitical person ) to preside . He did not ask the committee by what gift of prescience they had been enabled to foresee that the assembled multitude would desire him to preside over their deliberations . He accepted the invitation without asking childish questions , aud thus became part of a splendid show ! On the evening designated , the town was in a blaze of glory , chiefly generated by the " patent campaign torch , " supplied on favorable terms by a firm of dealers in the numerous articles which are now described as " campaign material " ; a business the volume of which ran into the millions last year . A // band of music was provided , of course . There was a procession of boys and young men in very showy uniforms . Carriages were in attendance to convey participants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toilsome journey of almost two hundred yards . The scene presented in the interior of the hail was highly animated and striking : the walls draped with flags , the uniformed boys all seated together , a brilliant parterre of young eyes and glowing color , the clubs of young men wearing rosettes and badges , the band picturesquely placed , the platform well covered with citizens . Nothing was wanting to the scene except a good solid background of disinterested audience . The audience was " shy . " The room would have held a thousand people ; but , omitting persons who constituted the attractive force of the occasion , there may have been three hundred genuine auditors . The proceedings , too , had almost every quality except that of spontaneity . The audience had precisely as much voice in deciding what those proceedings should be , as the guests of a wealthy house have in determining the bill of fare at the banquet to which they are invited ; as much voice as Roman voters had in the selection of the gladiators and the lions that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The chairman , the vice-presidents , and the secretaries were announced , not elected ; and , it must be owned , they were provided in ample numbers . The chairman , in his extreme ignorance and childlike lunocence , blurted out the whole truth of the situation . He remarked that his respected Uncle had then in his service one hundred thousand persons , most of whom were capable and well disposed . He was asked , he said , to vote in such a way as to deprive them suddenly , and without cause , of their means of subsistence , and put into their places a hundred thousand other men , unknown and untried . He respectfully declined so to do , and he had now the honor of introducing the orator of the evening . That orator , who was a master in the art of amusing an audience , told two dozen of the most killing anecdotes ever perfected by a hundred repetitions on the stoop of a country store . It was delightful to see the boys laugh at them , and the austere countenances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spell . Here was a costly , elaborate , and highly successful entertainment , provided free to all comers . It was a " meeting** only in the sense in which our other Mr. Barnum 's Greatest Show on Earth is a meeting . It was a meeting such as a Roman politician // used to arrange for his constituents , except that it was innocent in every detail . A Roman politician of Cicero 's day would write to a friend in an African province : " I begin hand-shaking to-morrow for the consulship ; send me some lions . " At our meeting , no gladiators were mangled ; no members of the Young Men 's Christian Association were devoured . It was , nevertheless , as much a device for the amusement of the auditors as the stupendous gatherings which Vespasian and Titus contemplated when they built the Coliseum . We begin now to understand that wonderful edifice , which cost as much as a considerable city ; for we are ourselves approaching a phase of politics similar to that which the Coliseum completed , andnow commemorates . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit passive , waiting to see which party will provide the most magnificent and sumptuous shows . Our expenditures for political purposes are spread over so vast a territory that we can not reckon up the sum total . If we could , it would startle the world . I think I have seen in Union Square a political display ( it were too absurd to cail it a meeting ) that cost forty thousand dollars : a tumult of huge bands , volcanoes of fire-works , miles of torchlight procession , and a dozen politicians roaring from the stands to little groups of people . The cost of an ordinary affair of this kind , given by parties before every election , runs up to several thousands of dollars , and most of the expense is incurred for fire and noise . A remarkable circumstance is , that scarcely any of the work done on these occasions is voluntary . All is paid for in some kind of value ; generally , in money down . Within the memory of men not very old , the Tammany Society could , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New York on every occasion when hard work was needed . It was once a distinction to young men of position to be the secretary of a ward committee , and such it remained , so long as posts of that kind yielded nothing but honor and satisfaction . So , at least , our elders tell us . We know but too well that that precious element of disinterestedness is now absent from our politics . Perhaps there never was quite so much of it as our old politicians think there was , and it began very early to diminish . At present , in the ninety-fifth year of the Constitution , we are face to face with a state of politics of cxtreme simplicity , of which money is the moti ' *c , the means , and the end . What was the last presidential election but a contest // of purses ? The longest purse carried the day , and it carried the day because it was the longest . Some innocent readers , perhaps , have wondered why the famous orators who swayed and entertained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have not been " recognized " in the distribution of offices . Most of them were paid in cash , from ten dollars a night to a thousand dollars a week . We have outlived the primitive stage of development when an illustrious speaker could feel compensated for splitting his throat by four years of poverty-stricken exile at a foreign capital . I have not a thought of reproach for any of those gentlemen . The laborer is worthy of his reward , and they were laboring honorably in their vocation . I wish merely to state that , in the inevitable working of things , our polities have become a business , in which few take a laborious part unless they are paid for it . The business is extensive and peculiar . It has many branches , and , like other businesses , it can not be advantageously carried on except by men who possess capital ; for our political bosses now engage in operations that require long preparation and large outlay , the result of which is uncertain . They make losses . They also make those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New York . who will take a contract for putting a gentleman into Congress . Pay him so much , say , for example , thirty-five thousand dollars , and you may go to sleep for six weeks , wake up , and find yourself member-elect . One of our city members amuses his friends by relating his interview with this contractor , when the sum we have just mentioned was named as the fair price for the work to be done . " Yes , " said the boss , " I will do the job for thirty-five thousand dollars , and you shall have no further trouble . " These may not be the precise words spoken , but that was their substantial meaning . The client expressed surprise at the amount of the fee demanded . By degrees the contractor dropped to fifteen thousand , and there he remained firm , saying that " the thing could not be done for less . " The candidate discovered , by conducting the canvass himself , that the boss had spoken the truth , for his " legitimate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand dollars . He would have done well to employ the contractor . I have had the pleasure of beholding this child of his era . Blame him not . He has grown out of the circumstances of the // ease . He is a necessity of the situation . We sometimes see innocent creatures , by having too easy access to masses of rich nutriment , bloated to enormous proportions , even past recognition . Such are the flies called into being on the wharves wliere sweet-crusted sugar-barrels are landed and lie in rows for many days softening in the sun . Such are the rats in a cheese ship . Such are the hideous things that crawl and swell in the ooze of a slaughter-honse . It is not the fault , but the dreadful calamity , of these creatures that they are where they are , aiLd are able to do what they do . They only do , in a rough and wrong way , the work which we ought to have done in a right and civilized way . On just conditions , even Tweed could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have served us as dog , not preyed upon us as wolf . In his capacity of wolf , he cost us two or three hundred millions of dollars ; when we might have had him as a shaggy , serviceable dog , on strictly reasonable terms : a proper daily bone securely his as long as he earned it , and a snug kennel when his working days were over . We use familiarly this new word , boss . What is a boss ? He is simply a man who can get to the polls on election day masses of voters , who care little or nothing for the issues of the campaign , and know of them still less . We may have , for example , in one of our cities , five hundred Italians or Poles , strangers in a strange land , scarcely able to use its language , and totally unacquainted with its politics . One of their number , having some vantage-ground of access to them , assists to get them naturalized , cultivates his influence over them , and acquires , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their votes . He , in effect , casts their votes for them , and holds those votes as a commodity to be disposed of for a consideration of some kind . He is a boss . There are as many bosses as there are sets , cliques , and nationalities in a city , all subject to the head-central boss of a political party . Nor is bossism confined to large cities . Wherever there is a mass of unassimilated population , there are sure to arise bosses to marshal , wield , and vote it . In virtuous rural districts , there are men who know where to find , and how to deal with , the men whose principles require them to vote for the candidate that pays their poll-tax . I have had , I say , the opportunity of viewing a boss of national notoriety , as he rode gayly home from Albany in a palace car , surrounded by people who are called // his " friends . " He is an improvement on the pugilists and cormorant-thieves of a remoter period ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is as it ought to be , and where everything unceasingly improves-even the boss ! The Emerald Isle gave him birth ; the streets of New York , education . Without flattery he may be called a broth of a boy ; tall , straight , ruddy , robust . He even looks handsome , as he stands in the middle of the car surrounded by home-returning members and retainers , illiterate as he is , he has evidently studied and long practiced the arts by which personal popularity is created and extended . He nods gracious recognition to individuals in the outer ring , and behaves in all respects like the powerful prince he feels himself to be . In the midst of much talk of unknown purport , we hear him say that he would accept no office unless there was " plenty of patronage to * So many young men , he explains , were devoted to his service that he would not think of " taking anything unless it gave him a chance to take care of them . ' * There are , in truth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brawny and good-tempered Irishman walking abroad in his district , at a time when politics are active , is to get an idea how the chief of a clan strode his native glen when a marauding expedition was on foot . He lives in a handsome house , too , and has more property to his name than any man has ever yet been able to get by legitimate public service in the United States . Observe him sauntering into a corner grog-shop , which immediately fills with a crowd of his retainers . He treats the whole crowd , except alone the individual who pays the money . He will sometimes pass the whole day and evening in treating his district , but he takes care not to drink while he is on duty . One of these gentry , it is true , declined an office , of which the salary was fifty dollars a week , on the ground that such a pitiful sum would not pay for his rum and cigars ! He meant the rum and cigars he was obliged to give , ex-officio , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even a secondrate boss-ship . Talent enough has been developed and trained in that vocation to clean the streets of a great city , provided the doing of that was the road to fortune . The boss , as agent and organizer of spoliation , is himself a prey to every minor scoundrel ; for at certain seasons he is in a position that makes it perilous to say No , to any living creature . It requires tact , selfpossession , and resources of mind to move about among needy // people , an embodied Yes , with a pocket full of money , and yet have some of it left after election . An eminent boss lately remarked to an interviewer : " It takes years of experience in politics to enable a man to guard himself against strikers , and even then he is not altogether safe . In old times they used to get up target companies and clam-bakes , giving candidates the privilege of paying the bills . They go for solid cash now . " Money , money , everywhere in politics ; money in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the public : hecatombs for the wolves ; precarious and scanty bones for the watch-dogs ! That is the spectacle everywhere presented to us . We need not regard the anonymous paragraphs assuring us that it was " the last million " which carried Indiana . Whenever the word million is mentioned , it is the privilege of reasonable beings to become at once incredulous . But how can we set aside the thrice-printed assertion of the present Secretary of State , that the October election in Maine last year was carried by " the application of arguments we could not meet . " He meant money . On the other hand , the public was assured that the opposing party " flooded the city of Bangor with money . " Experienced politicians evidently regarded the contest as a mere trial of management between two individuals , each having the resources of a national party to draw from . " Blame , " said an angry Republican at the time , " had everything he could desire . Money , speakers , everything was placed at his disposal He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . The State has gone Democratic ; Blame alone is to blame , and he ca n't shift the responsibility . " We are all , I fear , so hardened to this tone and style of remark , that we have lost the power to feel what a lapse it is from our ideal of government . Whether we accept Mr. Blaine 's assertion , or that of his o*'ponents , where are we to place in the political system the people of Maine ? The critical business , we are told , is to get the vote all " in , ' * and it was , perhaps , in that department that Mr. Blame was wanting . In the adjacent State of New Hampshire , it is computed , four thousand men are brought home every election from distant places to vote " where they keep their trunk . " They enjoy a free ride from points as distant as Chicago and Milwaukee . In one of the closely divided localities of that State , we are assured , there is an inn-keeper who is so accommodating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a row of a dozen or so of // empty trunks , each representing a vote , sure to come from some remote place on the day before election . Two questions must have occurred to non-political persons on learning such facts as are here but slightly indicated : Who furnishes the money for such large expenditures ' ? and , What is the motive of the givers ? The sum total is so great as to destroy our claim to possess cheap government . It is doubtful if there has ever been a dearer government than that of the United States , if we reckon politics as one of the items of expenditure . It is not cheap to pay responsible executive officers a precarious pittance per annum , if it costs a million dollars every year or two to change them . It is not cheap to put low-priced men into legislative chambers , if we are also to run a lobby of millionaires . It were useless for a mere disinterested inqnirer to try and compute the cost of the last presidential election , since no record was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them are interested in keeping ' the secret . From the assembling of the conventions at Chicago and Cincinnati to the day of election in November , the expenditure was continuous and profuse . Who provided the money ? There is abundant reason to infer that a large portion of it was contributed by individuals and corporate bodies who had something more than a patriotic interest in the result . We know the men who conducted the expenditures . They were not , as a class , holders of offices , nor candidates for office ; and it is a thing too obvious that they are not of that rarest order of persons who are capable of prolonged disinterested exertion . There is reason to believe that the Government is coming to be rather an appendage to a circle of wealthy operators than a restraint upon it  --  a circle that desires to keep the Government weak and manageable , that it may be subservient to their purposes . The recent explosion in the Post-office Department at Washington still needs elucidation ; but attentive readers of the testimony so far called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dozen men , after corrupting , by petty gifts and " dinners costing from ten to fifty dollars each , " a vast number of people , " from governors and senators to messengers and porters , " make a liberal contribution to " the expenses of the campaign , " and endeavor to purchase in advance the favor and acquiescence of a candidate for the presidency . They appear to have gained nearly a million dollars by their contracts , and to have poured // ont half of it in conciliating real and imaginary opposition . If a campaign were running close , sncli men can still afford to add an extra contribution to the party funds . It is highly probable that an important part of the enormous sums spent last year in electing a President came from persons who had similar reasons for their liberality . Some of them , in decent gratitude , should have given money by the million , for they made it by the million ; and that , not through corruption , but through the inevitable weakness of watch-dogs underfed and insecure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beef . Suppose they refrain from the furtive bite ( and most of them do ) , with what moral force can poor and anxious officials , without hold upon their places , defend the people 's interest against syndicates of bankers I Three years ago , the Government had still some four-per-cent. bonds for sale , which were going off in moderate amounts to legitimate investors , about as rapidly as they could be conveniently delivered . Suddenly investors are informed that a syndicate in New York had taken all that were left , amounting to a hundred and fifty millions of dollars . The Government had no more of them for sale . The press broke into commendation of this fine sfroke of finance ; but it did not seem in the least commendable to the ordinary investor of hard-earned money , nor to mothers and children who had been advised to invest a too limited inheritance in Government bonds . The almost immediate increase in the value of the hundred and fifty millions was three per cent. , so that a handful of men in New York , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half millions . There was no corruption here . But why this readiness to throw an enormous gain into the laps of men who had already too much , to the disadvantage of the people of the United States ? Members of that syndicate could well afford to come down handsomely when an election was in prospect . Such things inevitably occur in a country where the government grows weaker , while everything else grows stronger ,  --  a country that puts the small man inside the government and leaves the big man outside . Observe what is now taking place in the magnificent prairie lands of the North-west , once the heritage of the people . The secret of America 's rapid development is , that a pioneer could get from five to fifteen good crops from the virgin soil of his Government land , with little expense . This has // been the poor man 's opportunity , from the beginning of the coun try 's settlement . It has covered a great part of the western world with thriving towns and populous counties . It has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found , on his arrival at his little plot of land , that Nature had deposited upon it , for him , the accumulated richness of a hundred centuries of growth and decay . He had to do little more than scratch the surface , and put in his seed . In seven years the product of that virgin land paid for his farm , built house and barn , fenced fields , planted an orchard , sent for father and mother , and paid a family quota to the school-house and cabinet organ . At present , rich men are " skinning the prairies " of that virgin wealth , swooping down upon tracts of thirty thousand acres , robbing them of that quality which gave the poor man his chance , and fiIing the western world with roving laborers , who work on these prodigious farms in the summer , and starve as best they can through the winter . It was government by lobby that authorized that . It is really interesting to notice the ease with which enormous amounts of money are got for purposes of waste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and elevated legislation is accomplished . What citizen of New York , for example , a State upon which Nature has lavished all her gifts in imperial profusion , and which is inhabited by as large a proportion of worthy and public-spirited persons as any other province of equal extent in the world-what citizen of New York , I say , has not in his heart accepted the invitation of the Government of Canada to join it in rescuing the shores of Niagara from base disfiguration ? No great amount of money would be required : but years pass , and this most obviously right and becoming thing can not be done . Has the reader seen the new capitol at Albany ? Every patriotic son of the Empire State should go upon an expiatory pilgrimage to it , and pass penitential hours in gazing upon its immeasurable iniquities . Whenever I have the pleasure of strolling about beautiful Albany , I am drawn to that accursed and shameful heap of spoil as irresistibly as a floating spar is drawn to a huge and dirty iceberg . Two millions were shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " American Cyclopedia , " halting at the end of a long calculation , can just find breath enough to gasp : " Its ultimate cost can only be conjectured . " Few cities were more abundantly supplied with public buildings than Albany ; but here in the // midst of them rises this unspeakable pile of stone , so vast that it will require , it is said , two thousand tons of coal a year to keep it warm . The greatest lawgivers and orators the world ever saw , Solon , Lycurgus , Demosthenes , Cicero , were not accommodated as honorable members from the Fourth and Sixth wards are accommodated here . The room in which Chatham spoke , in which Burke delivered immortal speeches , in which Fox , Pitt , aud Sheridan debated , to say nothing of the reverberating hall in which Randolph , Calhoun , Clay , Webster , and Preston were so often heard , was beggarly compared with the splendid chambers of this enormous interior . There is only one patriotic thing to do with it . It should be taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people whom it dishonors . The materials should be sold to the best advantage for some useful purpose . The ground should be leveled , and the land respectfully given back to the city that presented it . The mere interest of the money wasted upon this capitol would give the city of New York clean sfreets forever . The inquiry is interesting , too , why the American people , who , in private dealings , are as honest as any people in the world , should exhibit moral weakness when they are acting for the public . There are men in public offices who would not take a postage-stamp from a private individual , and yet , as officeholders , they not only have no conscience , but will frankly avow that they have none . I have heard them do so . According to the historian Mommsen , the noble Romans showed the same peculiarity . Writing of the virtuous period of Roman history , 167 B. C. , Mommsen says : " The conscience of the Romans , otherwise in economic matters so scrupulous , showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laxity " ; and he quotes , in illustration , the language of Cato , who observed , that " he who stole from a private person ended his days in chains and fetters , whilehe who stole from the public ended them in gold and purple . " Nevertheless , the turpitude of stealing from the public is far greater than stealing from an individual . Neither the Romans nor the Greeks can teach us much in politics ; for their system rested , as ours did till 1861 , upon a basis of slavery , and they derived a great part of their revenues from the spoliation of other states . The free citizens , comparatively few in number , had , both in their position and quality , something of the hereditary noble . Our experiment of government // by the whole people , for the whole people , is absolutely original , and we entered upon it only twenty years ago . It devolves now upon the American people to create the art of government by the whole people ,  --  government by all the mind we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equally . We have to do this greatest work of the human race with little aid from precedents . We have made a truly wonderful and hopeful beginning , but only a beginning , and we are still obliged to repeat the words of poor Hamilton , spoken in 1789 : " The business of America 's happiness is still to be done . " We should natu ? ally look to England for some guidance here . We owe very much indeed to that great country for the existence even of our experiment . But the experience of a tight little island does not throw much ligh upon our continental problem . The people there have little more voice in the selection of governing persons than the people of New York had in the original selection and repeated r*election of Fernando Wood . There appears to be no such thing in the world as the original selection of candidates by a constituency . Perhaps there never will be . Perhaps it is , in the nature of things , impossible . We can say that in a country which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of the same was ever selected from the mass of the people and placed in Parliament by a constituency . Forty years ago , the Duke of Newcastle 's son took a fancy to a young man recently his fellow-student at Oxford ; and the Duke , being in want of a member safe to vote on the Tory side , put that younger son of a Liverpool merchant into Parliament , against the will of his constituents , and over the head of a distinguished lawyer of much parliamentary experience . This outrage , as we should style it , gave the illustrious Gladstone to the British empire . Not long after , the good-natured Marquis of Lansdowne read , with very warm approval , an article in the " Edinburgh Review , " written by another merchant 's son , T. B. Macaulay . To strengthen the Whig side of the House , the Marquis , by a monstrous abuse of power , gave this young man a seat also . About the same period , Lord Durham , at Lady Blessington 's house in London , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It ended with his lordship 's lifting the young man , by main strength , into Parliament . Palmerston bought his first seat outright , for five thousand pounds . The great men of the last century owed their seats to similar influences . Edmund Burke was the private secretary // of a great lord , and was placed in Parliament by the exertion of that great lord 's will . It were easy to show , by multiplying instances , that the strength and glory of the British Parliament has been due , in every generation , to similar abuses of power . It was for this reason that the Duke of Wellington , as we see by the last volume of his correspondence , opposed all the reform bills of his time . He perceived that nothing had yet been evolved in Europe capable of doing , with reasonable efficiency , what had been done from the beginning of time by the hereditary principle . He did not say , in so many words , that the art of electing had not yet been created ; but this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the abolition of rotten boroughs would I*ll Parliament with rich noodles , to the exclusion of the kind of men who have given to that body much of its efficiency , and all the splendor of its reputation . " Make me a constitution , " said King Murat to Lord Holland . Lord Holland wisely replied : " You might as well ask me to build you a free . " That brave old oak , the realm of Britain , has a growth of a thousand years behind it , and it will continue , as we trust , another thousand years , growing , perfecting , rising , in ever closer alliance and friendship with the United States . But we , too , have to attain real strength by the same slow process of growth . We , too , have to meet evils as they come up , and thus , in our own way , and on our own principles , evolve an art which has as yet no existence  --  the art of getting by deliberate selection the few men at the summit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carlyle said many things which now seem to us mere dyspepsia , but there is one idea , to which he returns again and again in all of his works , which is of immortal value . This idea is , that men can only work with success when they work in harmony with unalterable facts . In our governmental affairs , as they stand at this moment , we disregard certain unalterable facts . We have done so , in some degree , from the beginning , but particularly since the public service was suddenly degraded and debauched by Andrew Jackson . Unalterable conditions are now proving too strong for us . One fact of all the life on our planet is , that the strong govern ; and this is a fact to which the whole progress of our race is due . In every thousand human beings there are a certain fifty or so who are much abler than the rest . This is equally the case with the apples on a tree , the strawberries // on a vine , the ants in a hill , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community . This small fifty or so of the strong will always rule the rest . Let us arrange our government as we will ; call it a despotism or a commune ; from this fact we can never escape . The world is often blessed by the weak ; but it is always governed and owned by the strong . All that the nine hundred and fifty can ever do is to limit the power of the strong a little , and compel them to use it with moderation , and in accordance with public law . But the great fact remains forever beyond our altering . Look around : after fifty years of fattening the wolf and starving the dog , we have nearly succeeded in eliminating from public life the natural chiefs of men , who indeeed smile with mild derision at the idea of belonging to it . Government is substantially left to the order of men who are capable of squabbling for patronage ; and , in many instances , places of importance are filled by dummies . " We find it cheaper , " said one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legislature , than to make terms with them after they are in . " But do the strong men the less rule us ? They govern in and by the lobby . They control railroads . They found and manage huge enterprises . What have they in common with the dirty barkeepers who fill the places in municipal governments which it was once the reward of a virtuous life-time to possess ! They get what they want through the bar-keepers . The lamentable difference is , that the people have no useful and just check upon the capitalists . Their power is limited only as that of the unhappy Czar of Russia is limited-by the knowledge that men who are pressed beyond endurance have now the means of inflicting a terrible vengeance . Men of native force , acting legitimately within a government , clothed with the might and majesty of law , can hold in due restraint the whole body of the strong , and make it even their pride to serve the many . But you cannot get an empire governed by a parcel of ravenous bosses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple but unchangeable fact , that the most legitimate business of politics can only be done by a class that has time and money at its command . " Three wagon-loads of * were " bunched " in Tainmany Hall last November , and this was but one concluding item of an expenditure continued for six months , and for which the public makes no provision . Who is to do these huge jobs of bunching ? In more primitive times // and lands , nobilities did all the bunching , or had it done ; for they alone had the wagons or the time , and upon them devolved , of simple necessity , the whole burden , both of politics and government . They alone had time to attend to public business . With us , as a rule , in dense communities , only bar-keepers have leisure , and it was they who chiefly managed politics until the prodigious profits of the vocation called into being the political boss . The system of hereditary nobility , with all its abuses and absurdities , was in sufficient harmony with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That system was a necessity to primitive man , for the reason that primitive man did not , and does not , know how to elect his chiefs . In the early ages , it required the whole mdustry of a nation to maintain a few hundred families in sufficient ease and abundance for civilization to be created , and those families held the precious charge , as it were , in trust for mankind . Nobilities were long the armed defenders of the community ; and , in later periods , by nobilities in state and church , art was sustained , science was advanced , mauners were improved , literature was nourished . We can say more even than this : By nobilities the problem of just liberty has been wrought out , so far as it has yet been done . Who extorted Magna Charta ? Not a band of anxious peasants . Who resisted Charles I. I It was the noble class who did most that was wise and good in that revolution . Who drew the Habeas Corpus act ? An hereditary nobleman . Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was wise and humane in the French Revolution ? The nobility of France and their immediate circle . The movement began in the château ; and , in truth , the peasantry lived so near starvation that they had no thought but to submit . Who began , controlled , and directed the American Revolution ? The nobility of the American colonies . Washington , Jefferson , Randolph , and the greater number of their colleagues had the three essential qualities of noblemen , namely , native superiority , command of their time , and training in public business . They were as genuine a nobility as ever existed . It belonged to them to take care of the public weal , and they were fitted for this sublime vocation by character , by circumstances , and by practice . American nobility , too , made the Constitution of 1787 , and it was the relics of that nobility who started the Government , and brought it on with success and glory for the first forty years . And that small class would still be competent to the task , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planters , farmers , mechanics , fishermen , and slaves . " Shall we doubt , " said Dr. Franklin , in the Convention of 1787 , " finding three or four men in all the United States , with public spirit enough to bear sitting in peaceful council , merely to preside over our civil concerns , and see that our laws are duly executed * Dr. Franklin was a great man , but he had not the gift of prophecy . He was far from discerning that , before the Constitution was a hundred years of age , that small but competent nobility upon which he relied with so much confidence would be swamped and overwhelmed by a torrent of people , and that all the superior intellect of America would find scope in merely " growing up with the country . " He had been himself a man of leisure at the age of forty-two , and there was a small number of such in all the colonies , down to the time when he delivered his speech recommending that the higher offices of government should be unsalaried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adhered to ever since , in spite of the altered circumstances of the country ; for to give a Seward or an Evarts eight thousand dollars a year for being Secretary of State is to get their services for nothing , and charge them thirty thousand dollars a year for the privilege of serving us . The system of gratuitous service worked ill from the beginning ; and it has worked worse every year since . It has proved to be a system of starving the dog and nourishing the wolf . Hamilton and Jefferson , before they had been twelve months in office , were pining to resign because they could not make their salaries do . They did not say so at the time . Public men often have two reasons for their conduct : one is the reason ; and the other is the reason they give . In later writings , both of them avow the fact frankly enough . Aaron Burr was not ruined by his duel ; he was ruined through being lured away into public life before he had completed his fortune . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar instance , for the purpose of showing where our difficulty lies . We have several times , of late years , seen Mr. George W. Curtis gallantly stand forth in defense of principle , in political conventions ; and , doubtless , there are many persons in the State of New York who would gladly see him enter public life . What man , indeed , could better serve his State or country , or more worthily // represent them , than one in whom are united public spirit , high culture , high principle , a distinguished and winning personality ? Of all the qualifications of a nobleman , he lacks but one but , alas , that is a fatal lack . He has not the command of his time . He is a member of the most arduous of all professions ; for there is no work done in the world which expends vitality so fast as writing for the public . It is a work which is never done . It accompanies a man upon his walks , goes with him to the theater , gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreams . If he stoops to kiss his baby , before he has reached the requisite angle , a point occurs to him , and he hangs in mid-air with vacant face and mind distraught . " What 's the matter ? " says Mrs. Emerson , in the middle of the night , hearing her husband groping about the room . " Nothing , my dear , only an idea ! " Mr. Curtis , I say , stands up before the people of New York to contend for purer politics , through a civil service which shall tend to make the servants of the public safe , dignified , and honorable fathers of families . What is his reward ? To be invited to go all over the country making more speeches of the same kind , abandoning his private duties , relinquishing his career , leaving an Easy Chair vacant , which is an easy-chair only to him . It can not be . In some way , we have to make it possible for such men as he to give themselves to the public service . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to want Mr. Curtis , have known how to make it possible for him to expend his energies and talents in their service ; and if the State of New York wants him , the State of New York must outbid the Harpers . This is the decree of eternal justice , which no amount of Fourth of July palaver can alter . In England , when Mr. Cobden was in a similar embarrassment between public and private duty , the liberal party raised four hundred thousand dollars , with which to set him up in business as Public Man . So , also , the Whigs sent Macaulay to India , for the sole purpose of enabling him to secure that fundamental requisite , the command of his time . We have yet to learn how to do such things as these in a better way . Nor is Mr. Conkling any better off than Mr. Curtis , under our system of starving out the gallant and high-bred dog , and leaving all the rich pickings for the wolf . His profession is less exacting than that of Mr. Curtis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had , it is said , at least one escape from death through // attempting to be public man and private man at the same time . Not long ago , I happened to be in the rotunda of the Capitol at Washington when the Senate marched through it , two by two , to join the House of Representatives in their chamber , at the other end of the building . It was painful to see how battered , worn , and shaky many of the Senators were . They had been strong men originally ; many of them unusually tall , broad , and massive . They were prematurely infirm , the spring gone from their step , the light from their faces , the innocence and joy from their hearts . I could not but think of Thiers , gay and alert at eighty , full of power , lire , and cheerfulness ; of Palmerston , prime minister at eighty-four , coming out of his house early in the morning , and taking a spring over the railings , to find out whether he was beginning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at fourscore ; of Washington , all day in the saddle to the last week of his life ; of Jefferson , so erect and jocund at eighty-two ; of Chief-Justice Marshall , merrily playing quoits at Richmond when he was past eighty . Those shaky Senators , among whom it has been almost a distinction not to have had a touch of paralysis , are trying to do three things at once* either of which is a task for a man-namely , statesmanship , politics , and business . The present time is favorable for the consideration of these topics . Recent events , such as the dead-lock in the Senate , the pitiful war of nominations , the vain struggle of New-Yorkers for clean streets , and the mail-contract exposures , must have made it plain to all but politicians , and even to some of them , that the preliminary step toward the development of the art of popular government is to take the public business out of politics ! Every disinterested person must now see that the weak point of our present system is the erroneous tenure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to make the watch-dog as sure of his dinner as the wolf now is , and to make his dinner as good as the wolf 's . Better , it could not be ; for the wolf riots on the very fat of the land . The task that lies immediately before us is to exalt and protect our servants and legitimate our bosses . The tenure , I repeat , is the first and chief point to be rectified ; for a man will serve , not the power that gave him his place , nor . the hand that pays him his wages , but the power that can take his place away ! The mode of appointing is imp6rtant ; but the conditions of holding are all-important . If the offices were all sold . // by auction to the highest bidder , we should have a good public service , provided the Government exacted the requisite qualifica .. tions in the purchaser , and gave him a property in his place , which should be forfeited by misconduct alone . No public service in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who , for four centuries past , have transacted the everyday law business for the French people , at rates which our cheapest lawyers would despise . Those notaries buy , sell , inherit , and bequeath their places , and have done so for centuries . But the Government imposes three conditions , and performs two duties , all designed to give just protection both to the public and to the notary . The conditions are , that no man can be a licensed notary who has not served a seven-years ' apprenticeship to the business , and served for one year as chief clerk to a notary . He is also strictly limited as to the fee he can charge for every service . These are the conditions . If the Government stopped there , it would do as we do-starve the dog and fatten the wok . It protects these public servants by limiting their number , and by decreeing that no legal docnment shall have validity unless it is attested by a notary . But all this would not suffice . It remains to protect the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this is done by holding the commission of a notary forfeit upon conviction of breach of tru.st . There you have a service that necessarily fulfils its purpose , because the system secures adequate fitness and supplies adequate motive . In four centuries , no important breach of trust has been committed in France by a member of the notarial guild , in whose custody rests the whole real estate of France , the honor of its families , and the credit of its business men . The tenure is the vital point . Add to the right tenure , the principle of paying the market price for ali the kinds of labor employed , and we shall have a public service that will cease to be a lowering iufiuence in politics , and add one more liberal profession to the resources and the hopes of virtuous families . The strength of a nation is in its families : well-ordered governments favor the multiplication and building up of families . We may just as well have a hundred thousand strong and happy families maintained by the civil service , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most obvious needs of the time is the strengthening of the class between the capitalist and the operative  --  the middle class , in // which human nature thrives best and enjoys most . Every one laments the awful , blind power of huge capital run by steam . The most sanguine person must sometimes dread the ever-growing influence of corporations . The only oounterpoise to the dead-weight of wealth is the might of living numbers marshaled by an intellectual nobility . It becomes us , therefore , to nourish and strengthen , in every legitimate way , the professions which give men standing , influence , and independence , without the possession of wealth . Literature might be a career among us : it is robbed of its meager gains because it can not afford lobby enough at Washington to get an international copyright law . The college professors would naturally be a splendid and beloved portion of a true republican nobility : they are frittered away in numberless petty colleges . Teachers , too , share the debilitating consequences of a precarious tenure . Worst of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and only adequate check upon capitalists and corporations , the only way in which the million can make their power effectual against the miflionaire , the natural career of young ambition , the field for enlightened public spirit ,  --  this has become the prey of the political boss . We are going to change all this , and soon . As nobilities have worked out the problem of freedom for us so far , it is noblemen who must still carry it on toward perfection . When I say noblemen , I mean , in particular , men of public spirit who have command of their time . We are beginning to have such a class , and it is beginning to show itself worthily in various directions . It is our singular happiness to live in a country where every good citizen belongs to the aristocracy , and does actually exhibit the traits of character which in older countries are supposed to be peculiar to the privileged orders . It happens , however , that a prodigious number of them are younger eons , who must go out into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with the country . " I call upon the gentlemen of the Manhattan Club to join the gentlemen of the Union League ; I urge similar societies in Boston , Philadelphia , Baltimore , Chicago , Cincinnati , Cleveland , St. Louis , and other cities , to come to an understanding , and agree upon it as the issue of 1884 , to give the public service back to the people , and to make the Government respectable by taking just care of the diguity and the career of the public servants . The candidate has made himself obvious to the whole country . He has shown // his faith in a rational civil service by introducing it , and maintaining it for years , in a conspicuous public office . We have pampered the wolf long enough ; let the dog now have a turn . We have tried the system of organized distrust ; let us now see what presidents , governors , and mayors will do for us if they are chosen for one long term without eligibility to a second . Elect a mayor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of what Tweed stole per annum , clothe him with adequate power , hold him responsible , surround him with honorable conditions , and circumstances ; and , when he has done his work , let us dismiss him to private life as well off as if he had succeeded in the grocery line . Let him retire from office honored and rich . Let Congress build suitable houses for the cabinet and judges , multiply their incomes by four , and no longer permit a Secretary of State to pay for the dinners given to the diplomatic corps , the guests of the nation . Let us in all respects reverse the system introduced by small men for small purposes , and try faithfully that of giving the public servants as f air a chance for distinction and abundance as private business offers . That close observer of men and things , Governor Burnett , of California , expresses once more , in his " Recollections of an Old Pioneer , ** his deliberate conviction that " the masses vvill. never permit a sound conservative amen4ment of our theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occur within the next fifty years . He thinks it probable that several revolutions will be necessary before we get upon a comfortable basis . I hope for better things . The victorious Democratic party of 1800 , which saved the country from its first great peril , and ruled the country for twenty-eight years better than any country had ever been ruled before ( though that is not saying much ) , was composed of three ingredients , which still exist among us in the richest profusion , and which can again be united to carry any good measures that are in harmony with the inalienable rights of human nature . Those ingredients were : First , the large , benign , serene Jefferson , and a small circle of kindred philosophers , who , from mere native superiority , from simple nobility of mind , loved the common welfare ; next to them , adroit managers , chief of whom in 1800 was Aaron Burr ; finally , the masses of the people , absorbed in their private affairs , but open to conviction , and capable of appreciating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our theory " which shall be truly * These ingredients can again be brought together for a patriotic purpose , and the work can be done during the next three years by men of leisure . Let them do their duty , and the masses will never be wanting to theirs . They have never been wanting hitherto . The part of a busy people in republican politics is similar to that of the jury in a court of justice , and it never can be much other than that . The people is master . The verdict of the jury is law ; but the proper presentation of the Case devolves on the few . JAMES PARTON .
