THE chief concern of every political society is the establishment of rights and of adequate securities for their protection . In America it has been agreed that this shall be done by the people themselves ; they shall make their own laws , and choose their own agents to administer them . Bnt the obvious difficulty of doing this directly has been recognized , and the people , after formulating the charter of government , incorporating in it such principles as they deem fundamental , content themselves with delegating all powers of ordinary legislation to representatives . Notwithstanding this delegation , much direct legislation of a very effective and important nature is constantly going on , at the time attracting little or no attention . This is the steady modification of the common law by public sentiment , noticeable only when it has crystallized in general cnstom . The best of all laws for all countries are made in this way . Custom , when voluntary , is the conclusive proof of the final and settled conviction of the people as to what the rnle of right and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and for that reason it is likely to receive spontaneously the obedience that statutes exact by compulsion . // A vague impression prevails that the species of popular legislation to which we owe the common law has come to an end , and that customary law is to be looked upon as a finished code , to be altered and improved by statute only . As a theory for legal purposes , this may pass unchallenged ; but it is very far from expressing the fact . Probably popular legislation was never so active as now . The reasons for this are all about us - in the wonderful activity of invention and production ; in the marvelous expansion of business ; in the infinite variety of new conditions to which the law must be conformed . Sometimes statutes have sufficiently provided for the new ways , new things , and new conditions , sometimes imperfectly , and sometimes not at all , and the legislation of usage must supply the defects . How effective it is , we only know when the occasions arise for adjudication upon it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State of Illinois undertook , in the interests of business , to control a practical monopoly by limiting the charges . But the business it proposed to control was one established purely as a private business , on private capital , and without State grant of either privilege or snbsidy . Whence did the State derive the power to intervene * The ease was new and withtut precedent ; and if the Constitntion of the State did not determine the limit of State power , it must be songht for in sach principles of government as were embodied in the common law , and as have been adopted by the people as part of their heritage of freedom . The United States Supreme Court , in upholding the State action , attached importance to a dictum of Lord Hale that seemed to bear upon the ease in hand . But a dictum of any lawyer , however eminent , when not giving authoritative judgment , could be only the expression of individual opinion - the application of his own common sense , enlightened by his learning , to a certain state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public , enlightened by the broad and varied experience of the present century , must , in many cases , be far more worthy of being followed than any dictum coming to us from the centuries that preceded it . When the control of a business is in question , there is a necessary presumption that experience is of value ; and old opinions as such claim no respect . On some subjects the state of the law at any particular time is almost of necessity somewhat uncertain ; and precedents , // which are supposed to showwhat the law is , may oniy tend to confuse and mislead when the movement of the time has been away from them . The United States Supreme Court , in 1857 , declared that persons of African descent were not citizens of the States of the American Union . Ten years later , independent of constitutional amendment , the same Court would have held the contrary ; not merely because there had been great changes in the Court in the meantime , but becanse in that short period the course of public events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision as much out of harmony with the existing condition of things as though it had been based on feudal reasons . If the decision was law when declared , ten years had made it obsolete . Some kinds of business are so entirely new in some of their features that precedents are nearly worthless . The business of operating a railroad is one of these . Statutes do very much to determine what the respective rights and obligations of the public and the proprietors shall be , but constantly some combination of peculiar facts is raising new.and peculiar questions upon which the statutes throw little light , and the courts are compelled to determine them upon the reason of the common law . But on all such questions observation and experience are the chief teachers ; and the judge , when he comes to deal with them , finds that everybody in any way concerned in railroads has been doing something to enlighten his judgment and solve the legal difficulty . Railroad managers , and conductors , and brakemen , and switchmen ; the shippers and receivers of goods ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trains to receive or dismiss them ; the very tramps that jump on and off the moving trains , with occasional loss of foot or arm ; in fact , everybody who is concerned in providing or appropriating the comforts and conveniences the railroad affords , has been thinking upon and in some measure doing something to solve the judicial problem ; and the judg6 finds that a store of wisdom has been accumulated by various classes and various interests wherewith he may enlighten his mind . He may even find that this is not only important by way of instruction , but that in fact it has established rules to which railroad managers , as well as the community at large , have already begun to conform , or , at least , have already come to perceive that they must conform when occasion arises for an authoritative declaration of the law in an // actual controversy . It may be thought that the judge , in thus taking note of the formation of customs among the people , is in danger of deferring to public opinion to an extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or prejudice , or possibly of party views . Undoubtedly , there is some danger of this , but it is a danger that is encountered necessarily . The judge who turns a deaf ear to popular clamor at all times , and means to heed only the voice of the law , is still compelled to bear in mind , when dealing with common-law questions , that the common law in its very nature is subject to continuous change , and that he is always concerned with it as it is at the time , and can consider what it has been only as an aid in determining its present state . One principal difficulty with popular legislation is , that prevailing opinions are not always either wise or moral ; they are , moreover , fitful and uncertain , and may demand to-day what they will anathematize to-morrow . In a particular locality or section , popular sentiment may attempt to set up a code that the world abhors , and to engraft a scion of barbarism on modern civilization . The Mormon in this way endeavors to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentiment of the vast majority of the people , might succeed in doing so . Still , even the local sentiment is an important factor in dealing with the evil . The government can not wholly ignore it , unless it is ready to incur the risks of permanent rule by the army or by military commissions , and of having by and by an Ireland of our own . We might then discover that if anything could be worse than the holding of a people in subjection by a monarchy , it is the holding of them in subjection by a popular government . In dealing with any evil that has even local popular support , patience is as necessary a virtue as courage or perseverance . But very much of popular law-making requires expression under legislative forms before it can become authoritative ; and the legislator is under the necessity of recognizing and deferring to public sentiment where it neither has been nor can be consolidated into custom . *The legislator , it is true , during his term of office is entitled to independence of action ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compelled to obey the popular will . But he is , after all , only a representative ; and the necessities of his position require that he // should allow the popular voice to speak in his acts . To some extent he may be able to lead the public sentiment , and to become a teacher of the people ; and in his legislation he may safely be somewhat in advance of a sentiment that he perceives is improving , and that he is aiding to improve . But to be in his legislation far in advance of the public opinion of the day would be as fatal as for a military commander , in his eagerness for victory , to outrun his supports . The most perfect law , abstractly considered , if it lacks the popular approval , can seldom in the full and proper sense be a law at all , because habitual obedience will not be accorded to it , and it will be disobeyed whenever it seems safe to do so . And it is generally safe in a free country to disobey any statute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public opinion that is to be considered is not that of the passing day merely , which may be excited and passionate , and quite unlikely to be permanent , and for that reason may be disregarded and even set at defiance ; as Pitt for a time , when he first succeeded to power , set at defiance the wishes of Parliament until the deliberate judgments of the people had been formed and had been given expression . Every statesman long in public llfe has had occasion thus for a time to disobey the popular will ; and his statesmanship is shown by his skill in judging what is the passing breeze of opinion , and what the fixed and certain current . To the former he may trim his sails for the time , but the latter is his master . Sir Robert Peel , the protectionist , repealed the cornlaws ; and Disraeli , the Tory , granted an enlargement of the franchise , because the time had come when these measures were inevitable , and the ruler must yield them or cease to rule . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil service must be granted . And who must grant it ? Obviously , whether willing or unwilling , the party in power . But the danger in legislation under the force of popular sentiment is not so much that legislators will fail to recognize it sufficiently , as that they will play the part of demagogues , and cater to popular passions and prejudices for purposes of their own . This is especially the danger when class legislation is called for ; and the demand for this in the immediate future is likely to be more frequent and more persistent than ever . It is also likely to be directed against classes that may easily be made the objects of popular prejudice ; against those who carry on // particular employments , or perhaps against the managers of many kinds of employment . A government may easily be made a tyranny by mere over-legislation , and it may become intolerable if the legislation is purposely hostile . We sometimes say with truth that the best government is that which governs least ; by which we mean the one that interferes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fewest exactions , and leaves to us the largest share of individual liberty . But in another sense the best government is that which governs most , which is most certainly present at all times with its protecting arm , and for that reason gives a perpetual sense of security . The great problem in government is , how to have a maximum of protection with a minimum of official or legislative interference ; and the proper method of solving this is manifestly not by way of class legislation . On the contrary , the true principle would seem to be , to extend self-government as much as may be found consistent with the safety of the state and the good order of society . We begin self-government in the family ; we establish it in the several towns , cities , counties , and states ; and we suffer it to exist , also , in the several trades and occupations . Thus bankers have special rules of their own making for the regulation of their business , common carriers for theirs , telegraph companies for theirs , etc. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having business with those who establish them . This the law does not merely tolerate , but encourages , because those engaged in the business know best what the rules should be , and the rules are made by experts after experience and observation have demonstrated their usefulness . This is legislation by the parties who most of all are competent to deal wisely with the subject ; and so long as it is properly limited , the state would be inexcusable if , by the agency of legislators of less experience and less competency , it were to interfere . Boards of trade go farther ; they not only legislate , but they establish judicial tribunals to enforce their legislation ; and , though these are without legal authority , they have means of making it for the inter est of parties concerned to submit to their judgments and keep away from the tribunals of the state . Associated railroad companies are coming to liave formal legislative bodies as well as judicial tribunals of their own ; and they confer upon these a power of regulation that alone can preserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state complains of none of // these voluntary arrangements until it is found that something is done under them that conflicts with the public interest . Just as the union of the people living in one locality in town and municipal organizations is likely to promote the best local government , so the union of the persons engaged in the same employment in business organizations is likely to bring out the best results in the particular business . The state does not , indeed , make the local government independent ; there must be a wisdom applied to its affairs that looks beyond the territorial limits , and considers how the local affects the general . The town is an inseparable part of the state , and chargeable with many state dutieS , and unless properly governed may cause mischief to the commonwealth at large . But here , as in the case of the natural person , the supervision of the state is to be directed , not to thinking and acting for the people in what concerns themselves exclusively , which the people themselves must be assumed to understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and preventing the abuses that might spring from temporary passions and excitements , or the evils that might arise from neglect of duties owing to the state at large . We do not in the same manner set off by themselves the persons engaged in a particular occupation , and confer upon them corporate powers , but the interference of the state in their concerns may be wisely controlled by similar principles . If they are allowed to govern without interference in whatever relates exclusively to their own affairs , keeping themselves at the same time within the general rules of law , and if the state shall keep firm rule in all that concerns the relations of the particular business to others and to the state at large , we shall then have that effective combination of self-rule with state control in which alone can we have a government that at the same time is well informed and well restrained . In some particulars the self-government of occupations has never been settled upon a safe or even a peaceful basis . This is chargeable to internal dissensions* for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their contentions , persons engaged in different capacities in the same business have assumed antagonistic positions , and have arrayed themselves in hostile forces . All about us , but especially in the great centers of manufacture , we may see illustrations . The most noticeable // fact in some lines of business is the general combination of proprietors on the one hand , and of laborers on the other , in associations for mutual protection . Nothing at first view would seem more proper ; for all employers have a common interest in the prosperity of the business , as all laborers have likewise , and what injuriously affects one may prejudice all . But the evil larks in the aim and purpose of the combinations ; for instead of a common purpose pervading all , the employer is found organized for protection against the laborer , and the laborer against the employer . It is the old fable of the belly and the members realized ; but in this case both belly and members are in rebellion against codperation , and , as a necessary result , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the governing machinery of a little commonwealth ; and the legislative and administrative tribunals of each are working at cross purposes , with a view to circumvent each other . Laborers believe their union a necessity , and the sole means whereby they can prevent their subsistence being at the mercy of employers . Employers look upon their own combination as necessary to secure to them the control of their own business . Thus they stand to each other in hostile attitude , and behind walls of defense . Each is right , in a measure ; but the wrong in their strife is more conspicuous than the right , and the evils more certain than the advantages . The defensive organization invites attack . No walled city was ever yet secure behind its battlements ; security only came when the good-will of its neighbors permitted its walls to be leveled to the ground . Strikes and lock-outs inevitably bring loss and misery ; the strife often becoming a trial of endurance that may bankrupt the employer , while it pauperizes the employed . Nor are these the sole evils ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes that are accustomed to prey upon labor - the agitator , the demagogue , the grog-seller , the shyster- make labor troubles their harvest-time , and do what they can to aggravate them , that they may extend the opportunity for making the workmen their spoil . The employer becomes bitter in proportion as he sees his anticipated profits becoming impossible ; the laborer is bitter in proportion as he feels himself at a disadvantage ; the controversy breeds a lawless spirit , and tends to criminal organizations ; it finds its way into politics and into the jnry-box ; and we are compelled to believe that men sometimes disregard the // obligations of duty , as well as solemn oaths , that they may inflict punishment on those they look upon as extortionate capitalists and hard-hearted masters . The legislation of the state comes to be suspected ; one party believing that laws that may or may not be proper in themselves are adopted to win the favor of a rabble , and the other suspecting that corruption controls ; until a high-minded and honorable man turns his back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by entering them as a member . These are very serious evils , and they affect the state at large and all classes of the community . We are all concerned , therefore , in establishing a better state of things , if that be possible . The state has ample power to interfere by law , but probably no interference would be beneficial that went beyond the mere preservation of public order . Employers and laborers alike would resent any further interference as an unwarrantable meddling with private concerns . The employer especially would insist on his right to control his business in his own way ; to go on or to stop , as his interest seemed to require ; to make his own contracts , and to resist contracts being forced upon him . In all this he would be standing upon *principles of general acceptance ; and the state must respect his rights , because they are rights that belong to us all , and are fundamental . But when a strict insistence upon legal rights leaves the troublesome and dangerous contentions in full vigor , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consistent with justice are not within the compass of mutual concessions . It is a common remark that the chief difficulty in labor troubles is , that laborers refuse to recognize their own interest , and that they put themselves into the hands of those who make use of them for mercenary purposes of their own . If they would act reasonably , we are told , if they would recognize the laws of political economy , against which it is folly to object , we should not see large bodies of men wasting their time in strikes , and giving their money to support in idleness those who organize disorder . This is doubtless true ; the laboring classes are greatly in need of a better understanding of the principles of business as well as of government . There are men among them who , like the Nihilists of Russia , are ready to be indiscriminate destructives . In any country this would be an ominous fact ; in a free country it is especially alarming , for the man with // nothing , but wlio is in sympathy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power in the state than the man with large possessions . And when discontent rules , it is possessions that are chiefly in danger . But the laboring classes are not all who need further enlightenment upon the difficult problems that concern the relations of labor and capital . Hitherto , in dealing with those problems , employers have taken high ground , and have generally been able to maintain it . But in the long run it matters little which party has the temporary success , if the conditions from which the difficulties spring must still continue . A victory is in general a disaster unless it has some tendency to bring about peace ; but peace between employer and laborer can never be based upon the triumph of one over the other ; it must come from general content . If a man says , " My business is my own , to be managed as I please , " we must assent that this is his legal right . But there is a sense in which the business can not be exclnsively his own ; and any one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him will not overlook this . While any particular establishment belongs to the proprietors , yet so long as lab*r and capital are equally essential , any particular business , considered in the aggregate , is as much that of those who bring to it the labor as of those who furnish the money . If laborers withdraw from it , it comes to an end as certainly as when the proprietor closes his doors . That the proprietor has a legal right to close his doors at discretion , regardless of the effect upon the interest of others , must be admitted . But moral obligations are sometimes so imperative that no legal sanction can possibly make them more so . The obligation of the employer to assume some responsibility for the well-being of those who perform the labor from which he expects his profits , ought to be classed in this category . They and their families are in so large a degree dependent upon him , that their condition appeals specially to his humane impulses , and ought to be sufficient security against hasty , passionate , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and theirs are to a considerable extent identical , the claims of humanity are supplemented by sefsh reasons . It is a short-sighted view that we take of our relations to our fellows when we say , " If they will be foolish , they must take the consequences of their folly . " The vessel to which their // fortunes are committed bears ours also ; we are united with them in the management , and are necessarily , as members of the same political society , linked to the same destiny . If folly on their part would injuriously affect them , it concerns us to prevent it if we can ; and if the folly is committed , then to guard as much as possible against the injurious consequences . The experiment we are making in self-government is to some extent involved in every unnecessary controversy that springs up to embitter the relations of classes in the civil state ; and we neither get rid of the attendant dangers nor to any extent diminish them by turning our backs and refusing to consider the causes from which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body of laborers throw down the tools of their business , even though it be done under an entirely mistaken view of their rights or wrongs or interests ; and , willingly or unwillingly , we must share the consequences of their mistake or their folly . That they arc foolish , instead of being an excuse for turning away from them , ought rather to remind us of a duty to aid them . A foolish man must be expected to do foolish things ; nothing but curing the folly will prevent it . But the folly itself is likely to be a consequence of unavoidable conditions . Labor , the world over , has always in different degrees been the servant of capital ; and generally , when not enslaved by law , the remuneration has been so slight that accumulations were nearly impossible . Any untoward circumstance might then reduce the laborer to destitution ; and if destitute he might better be slave than free , for the slave must be supported by the master , when the free laborer might be left to starve . Circumstances have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present there is plenty of real destitution , and probably still more that is simulated for purposes of beggary or crime . But when appeal is made to our charity on behalf of classes apparently destitute , whet her we respond or refuse , we may wisely reflect that the appeal is for those who , whether deserving or not , are joint rulers with us of this magnificent and wealthy country . Hitherto the joint rule has been beneficent ; but to insure its continuing so , it is needful to take all possible precautions against foolish and disquieting actions . Persons who are both idle and needy may be thinking dangerous thoughts as well as foolish thoughts ; but their folly is of itself a danger . A body of strikers may be taught by destitution the folly of their course , but destitution is // not likely to impress their minds with the conviction that the business is exclusively that of their employers . On the contrary , poverty and want , coming upon them from the stoppage of wages , are severe and constant reminders of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffer under a sense of wrong if they and their families cease to receive the means of subsistence from the business , for reasons the justice of which is not apparent to them . And what they may be thinking under a sense of wrong concerns us all ; for the evolution of law is from below , and the rule that finally prevails is worked out by the gradual operation of mind upon mind . And when the right-thinkers and the wrong-thinkers are all busy propagating their ideas and their theories , their influence respectively will depend largely upon the state of mind of those they address . With a discontented people , the wrong-thinkers are certain to be most influential , and they may therefore come to have the making of our laws . The importance of preventing any considerable discontent is obvious ; and it ought to be equally obvious that the best security for capital is in cordial relations between those who possess it and those whose labor gives it satisfactory employment , and that the best protection for a state is in steadfast and remunerative industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is prima facie one of mutual folly ; much as would be the antagonism of men to women as classes , of parents to children , of street to street in a city . Its existence is evidence that a wrong exists for which some one should find a remedy ; and if one party is superior to the other in intelligence , it is upon that party that the duty to search for a remedy is specially incumbent . It is sometimes our boast that in this country we have given to our possessions a protection that is found nowhere else ; for the Government itself , even in the greatest emergencies , can not impair the obligation of contracts , or take from the most humble citizen his property . But as the benefit of this protection is reaped by those who have possessions , the Constitution itself may come to be regarded by considerable classes as an instrument whose office is to protect the rich in the advantages they have secured over the poor , and one that should be hated for that reason . Mr. Gladstone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are oppressive , forces better terms from the landlords ; and it is not difficult to make classes that // conceive themselves oppressed believe that a government that is powerless to give such relief is unworthy their support . Then , all of us have been more or less indignant at the plunder of the national treasury in the interests of certain railroads , and at the watering of stocks upon which the public pay the dividends . But the unreflecting mind is liable to identify all corporations with those that are justly subject to complaint , or even to go further and condemn all that have capital as robbers and plunderers , because a few of the most conspicuous have been so . A charter of government that the people in some period of madness may tear to shreds is poor security , if such notions become prevalent . Property is safe when it is generally possessed , so that the people can perceive that they participate in the benefits of existing institutions ; and it is not safe otherwise . The tendency of events at this time is unmistakably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the management of public affairs ; and this looks to a control of business by law in a manner that may threaten disaster . It is a dangerous tendency , because it falsely assumes a necessary antagonism in the interests of employer and employed ; and the assui*ption brings about conflict where the real interests are substantially identical . Then strikes and lock-outs occur , which stagger the prosperity , not of the business merely , but of the state . The remedy for such a state of things is not so manifest as the . evils ; it will never be found until employers recognize how intimately they are concerned with the welfare of those whose labor they employ , and how important it is that their relations should be on a basis satisfactory to both . In some cases this has been accomplished by giving labor some share in the control , as well as in the profits , of business ; but this is not likely to become general , so as to embrace all grades of labor . In some cases , tribunals of arbitration have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employers . This , to the extent that it is acted upon and made effectual , secures what is of the very highest importance in every occupation - self-rule by a government in which all who are interested participate . It may be a long time before the idea of true self-rule will be readily accepted by either side ; but every instance of it is a positive gain to the state , and has a humanizing as well as an educating influence . It does something // to bridge an opening chasm , and constitutes a pledge of peace for which the family of every man concerned would be surety . It should do something also toward protecting laboring classes against the kites and vultures of society , which now take advantage of labor troubles to prey upon them . And perhaps it should do even more toward giving assurance that , from the discontent and confusion of mind springing from labor controversies , and their attendant privations and suffering , nothing that is radically niischievous shall be formulated and at length put in force by our law-makers , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
