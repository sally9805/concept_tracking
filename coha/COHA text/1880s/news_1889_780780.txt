txt The fourteenth annual report of the Johns Hopkins University , issued to-day , is the most interesting that has ever been published . It sets at rest all fears of any interruption in the work of the institution . It speaks as follows of the emergency fund : " Eighteen subscriptions of $5,000 each wore made . Several subscriptions were also made in sums between $1,000 and $3,000 , so that the emergency fund thus promptly and generously subscribed amounted to $105,700 . A gentleman in Connecticut sent a gift of $2,000 . A friend of the university resident in Liverpool gave $1,000 , and a gentleman in New-York contributed $5,000 . All the other subscriptions came from Baltimore . These contributions added to the income which may reasonably be expected from the charge for tuition and from the other available resources of the university enable it pa go forward on its present plane with wonted efficiency for the next three years . " The report , after saying that " the future is assured , " mentions other gifts , a lectureship of poetry , $1,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor of their son ; $20,000 from Eugene Levering for a Young Men 's Christian Association building in connection with the university , $500 from a Philadelphia gentleman for increasing the electric apparatus , and $150 from J.

The session has begun with brighter promises of success than ever . President Gilman concludes his report with these words : by Near the close of our lastisession the Trustees , by a formal vote , gave me a leave of absence in order that ' I may visit during the coming Winter Egypt , Syria , and Greece and other countries near the Mediterranean . After fourteen years of service , I am planning for the first time a prolonged absence from Baltimore during the academic session . I shall leave my duties for a while with confidence that the unversity , which is so dear to us all , will ere long be strengthened and enlarged . "    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
