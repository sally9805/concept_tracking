txt The subject of the relation of colored men to chickens is one of great interest and .. importance , and the publication of a work on " Chicken Ethics " by Prof. J. C. Blue , who at present occupies the Chair of Chicken Ethics in the Liberian National University , will be especially welcome at this time to all who desire to see a full mutual understanding between the white and colored races in our Southern States . Prof. Blue maintains that chickens are fercenaturce , precisely like a wolf , a hedgehog , or an umbrella . Hence there can be no such thing as property in chickens and no such legal or moral offense as chicken stealing . If a man wants a wolf he has a right to go into the woods and capture one if he can , and he invades no right of property in so doing ; and if a colored man wants a chicken he has a right to enter a white Colonel 's henhouse and take one . This is a broad general principle , but , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the colored man has to some extent changed his relation to chickens . Mere wanton capture of chickens when they are not needed as articles of food is , in the Professor 's opinion , a breach of gold taste if not of morality . To take a Colonel 's chickens in order to sell them to the same or another Colonel is simply theft . Prof. Blue points out that the colored man who sells chickens obtained for the purpose of sale impliedly claims property in them . This claim can not be made unless the theory that chickens are ferce naturce is discarded . But if this theory is discarded , then the original Colonel from whom . the chickens were obtained had a right of property in them , and the invasion of this right was unquestionably stealing . Tho professor 's argument , of which the above is of course a bare outline , is wonderfully clear and powerful , and no one who reads it can doubt that to take chickens in order to sell them is an offense against morality . Again , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but are as much property as is any article of personal estate . - No one can hold property in a live wolf , but the skin of a dead wolf is personal estate . No one can hold property in a hedgehog , but when either a Colonel or a colored man is in lawful possession of the body of a dead hedgehog whether before or , after it is cooked , he absolutely owns it ; and if it be taken from him without his consent ; such taking is ' theft or robbery , as the case may be . The chickens in a Colonel 's henhouse ' are ferce naturce only so long as they are alive . The moment the Colonel , whether acting per se or per aliurn , decapitates a chicken that chicken becomes his personal property , and the misguided colored man who stealthily carries it off in his hat commits a theft . But there is an exception to this rule that dead chickens can not lawfully be stolen by colored men . The author of " Chicken Ethics " maintains that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawfully be taken . He bases this claim upon a comparison between dead chickens and hams . That a ham may be removed from a Colonel 's smokehouse for the use of a colored camp meeting has always been conceded by the ablest African divines . The ham in such case is not taken for selfish motives , but it is , so to speak , a sacrificial ham , the mission of which is to further the cause of colored religion . Now , says Prof. Blue , ( page 671 , ) " a dead chicken is in the eye of law and morality precisely the same as a ham ? being simply meat designed for human consumption . What is true of one in its relation to the colored man is true of the other , and as it is conceded that a ham may be lawfully consecrated to the campmeeting cause , it follows that a like consecration may be made of a dead chicken . " As will be seen , the relation of the colored man to chickens is fully set forth in this remarkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will soon be republished here and will obtain a wide circulation in our Southern States .
