txt Among the passengers who arrived in this city from New-York on the steamer Pilgrim this morning were two men , each about 35 years of age . One of them was of medium height and wore dark brown clothes , while his companion was of more dignified appearance , tall in stature and apparently a respectable businesS man .. The latter , while consulting the wishes of the former , never separated from him and watched his every movement . When they left the boat and walked toward the train . the smaller of the two approached OfficersDevine and Riley and told them that the man with him was a swindler and fraud whom he could not get rid of . the officers accompanied the men to the police station where the victim of the alleged swindle described himhimself as Hiram Evans , of Keezer Falls , York County , Me . Four months ago he received a confidential letter from New-York , offering to make him a rich man by the simple operation of disposing of counterfeit money , or " green goods . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the glittering promises . He went to New-York and made an investigation that apparently satisfied him of the sincerity of the schemers . While disposed to make a purchase , he was without the necessary money , and returned to his home in Maine . He continued to receive letters and was finally Induced to visit the metropolis a second time . Before embarking on his errand he stopped In this city and posited $300 in the Metacomet Bank , as he reared that he might be waylaid and robbed when he reached New-York . On Saturday night he proceeded to that city , and on arriving Sunday called at 391 East Tenthstreet , a private residence occupied by a man giving his name as Thomas Lanning . An appointment was made for Monday , and Evans called at a place that looked like ti railroad ticket office .

Roberts accompanied the willing victim to the Park Bank to have a check cashed , but as nobody could identify him the money was not handed over . This was an unexpected set-back and it was decided that Roberts should accompany Evans to this city and obtain the money from the Metacomet Bank . They departed on the Pilgrim Monday afternoon . The swindler kept a close watch on the dupe , but the latter managed to elude his vigilance during the night , and sought the baggagemaster . He told the latter that he - wanted to get his valise , but the boat official explained that it was against the rules to remove baggage during the voyage . The urgency of the case was represented , and the valise was handed over . When opened it was found to contain two newspapers and a quantity of coal . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Roberts was perfectly cool when questioned by the Marshal , and maintained that he was ignorant of all wrongdoing . As no money had passed between the two he was let go . Evans afterward obtained the money he bad on deposit in the Metacomet Bank and departed for Boston .
