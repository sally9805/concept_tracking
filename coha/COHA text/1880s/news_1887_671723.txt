txt In the forthcoming report of the Civil Service Commission upon the abuses alleged to exist in the Federal offices in Chicago Commissioner EDGERTON takes occasion to give at some length his views upon the subject of removals . He has evidently studied the question with care upon its practical side , and he states his opinions with great positiveness. a The appointing power , " says the Commissioner , " is responsible for the efficiency of the working force . It must be admitted that changes are frequently necessary to improve the working force . and that no one is better qualified to judge of the changes needed than he who supervises the work , and is therefore cognizant of the amount and character of the service rendered by each employ &; Take away the right of removal from the appointing officer and the subordinate becomes greater than the superior . " The principles laid down by the Commissioner in these remarks are sound . They are also undisputed . We trust that Commissioner EDGERTON does not cherish the delusion that he has said anything strikingly new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be disputed by the most zealous advocate of civil service reform . If Commissioner EDGERTON will turn to page 26 of the first annual report of the Civil Service Commission he will find the following remarks : " The power of removal and its exercise for just reasons are essential both to the discipline and the efficiency of the public service . A. life tenure would be indefensible . The Civil Service act and rules leave the authority and duty of removal undisturbed - with this exception , that the second rule forbids a removal for refusing to perform a political service or to pay a political assessment , and the last rule adds every violation of either rule , or of the provisions of the act against assessments , to the good causes for removal which existed before . * - Save in the particulars mentioned , the power to remove for even the most partisan and selfish reasons remains unchanged . " Commissioner EDGERTON will learn also by an examination of the literature of the reform outside of official utterances that there is no ' intention on the part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for just causes and to " improve the working force . " We wish we could have , howeV.er , a more confident feeling of Commissioner EDGERTON 'S disapproval of merely partisan removals than his remarks in the Chicago report create . " It would be manifestly ridiculous , " he says , " to subject the appointing power to a long list of questions before he could remove a subordinate or inefficient employe2 ' And again he asserts that whenever employees become useless or inefficient " the appointing power should not be restrained from removing them at once and without question as to the reasons for so doing . " Nobody , proposes to subject the appointing power to a long list of questions in cases of intended removal . But does Commissioner EDGERTON really believe that the appointing power would be embarrassed , or that the public interests would suffer , if a brief and frank statement of the appbinting officer 's reasons for removing an employe were required ? In the case of a Postmaster or Collector who desired as rapidly as possible to assimilate the politics of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a requirement would be annoying . It would interfere with . and might at times actually stop the working of a ? Custom House or a Post , Office as a great political machine . But a Federal officer who sincerely believed the first duty of himself and his subordinates to be to ? their employer , the Government , and /not to a political party , would surely . have no objections to stating such reasons as he found to exist for changes in his working force . And we assume that Commissioner EDGERTON , having accepted an office which requires him to devote his time to the enforcement and . application of the civil service law , is really in sympathy with the purposes of that law , and not with those who seek to evade it . The subject of removals in the subordinate service is one to which civil service reformers have given much thought . They are not at present seeking any extension of the scope of the law or of the rules which would restrict the power of removal . But it is impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Philadelphia Post Office , where in two years Postmaster HARRITY has found . places for 192 Democrats in a total Three of 194 employds , as anything else than a contemptuous violation of the spirit of the civil service law . The management of this office , and of the Federal offices in Chicago , except so far as they have been brought under the rules of the classified service in respect to appointments , shows no advanceor improvement over the management of the New-York Custom House under Republican rule , when in a period of five years , or 1,565 working days , 1,678 removals were made . We do not believe that Commissioner EDGERTON would openly defend the policy of wholesale removals which has been followed by some of the men appointed by President CLEVELAND to important Federal offices . But the language used by the Commissioner in his Chicago report awakens some disquieting doubts as to his position upon this important question . If removals merely for partisan and selfish reasons are an evil they scarcely call for words of extenuation from a Civil Service Commissioner or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they may be made with impunity.
