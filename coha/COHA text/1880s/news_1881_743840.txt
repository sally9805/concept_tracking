txt Messrs . C. J. Williams and Harry Hamlin had concluded to remove the American Grape-sugar Works from Buffalo to Des Moines , Iowa . Mr. C. J. Hamlin says : " We were forced to do this by the action of the city authorities in regard to water rates . The Common Council , two weeks ago last Friday , fixed the rates so that our water supply cost us about $12,000 a year . When I read the report I started on the midday train for the West and went to different points to see what advantages were possessed . At Peoria , Ill. , my son joined me . We went through Illinois and a part of Iowa . The citizens of Des Moines called a meeting at the Board of Trade rooms and unanimously passed a resolution asking the Common Council , providing we would build there , to exempt us from all taxes for 10 years . They had already done this ' for C. Gilbert , the starch manufacturer , of Buffalo . who is to erect an immense establishment there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . The action of the Board of Trade was on Monday last , the 16th inst . The Council met Wednesday night and , with only one dissenting voice , passed a resolution as recommended . We have purchased and paid for 28 acres of land . Coal is 50 to 76 cents a ton cheaper . Corn , our principal article , which costs us here 50 to 62 cents . we can purchase there for 27 to 30 cents , which will offset the extra cost of getting our product to the principal markets . There is water In abundance , with no expense except the pumping of it . Within the past year nine or ten grape sugar factories have been built , and none of these , so far as we oan learn , are running at any expense for water , except ours in Buffalo . The works will be removed as soon as the necessary buildings can be constructed . "
