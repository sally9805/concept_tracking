txt New-York readers will not be able to follow the reports of what may be done upon GUITEAU 'S trial with any satisfaction unless they constantly keep is mind that it must proceed according to the law of the District , which on many points is quite different from that of this State . On the subjects which the Constitution commits to Congress there is generally a uniform law for the whole country . But the questions of evidence and procedure arising on a trial for murder , even the grave question of allowing the defense of insanity , depend on the laws of the State , and these may vary indefinitely . The local law of the District of Columbia on such matters is gathered somewhat from a number of acts which Congress has passed from time to time , partly from the usage and practice of the courts , and even more from the law of Maryland which prevailed when the District was ceded to the Federal Government . A very intricate and perplexing question it often is , to ascertain what may be the local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the special acts of Congress . Take , for example , the question of the jurisdiction of the court , about which so much has been said . If the trial were moved in New-Jersey there is a statute which is quite explicit . If it occurred in New-York probably no question could be raised . But , as THE TIMES explained immediately after GARFIELD 'S death , the State laws are of no aid to the District of Columbia court , but it must be guided by the act of Congress declaring its powers , or by old laws of Maryland , or traditional rules . Insanity is another question on which the local laws in different parts of the country vary very materially . This ought not so to be . But each State is sovereign on this question , and if one State sees fit to allow the defense while the other prohibits it there is no remedy . All tile States agree that a man shall not be hanged for murder if he were disabled by mental disease from knowing what he was about ; or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he could not know the nature and quality of his act or could not know that it was wrong . Many journals are citing these two tests as if they were the only ones . No others are allowable in this State . But a third test has been widely urged in recent years , and has been recognized and adopted by the courts of some States . Medical men declare that they find persons who have not lost power to understand the consequences of what they do or to know that it is wrong , but whose minds have been rendered powerless by disease to control conduct in view of knowledge . In other words , a man may have a diseased propensity , a morbid impulse , which may rise to such degree of strength as to be uncontrollable . Ought this to be a defense ? Suppose that , in a case like GUITEAU 'S , there were no great dispute about his being able to understand that the bullet would probably kill , or that the shooting was wrong , or at least punishable , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nervous system had become so diseased by hereditary influences , bad habits , slow decay , long brooding over imaginary claims , and fancied wrongs and like causes , that he had become unable to resist the temptation to shoot . Would this be a good reason for sending him to the asylum instead of the gallows ? New-York says No . The Court of Appeals in 1873 decided emphatically that this moral inability does not excuse from punishment . And the Penal Code has incorporated the same rule . But just across a boundary line , in the very same month when the New-York court made this decision , the Supreme Court of Connecticut made an opposite one . The case was that of a man accused of the murder of his wife , and a defense was that , by long habits of drinking , also by a severe injury , lie had become morally incapable of self-control . The Connecticut court held that a person is not a subject of punishment who is overcome by an irresistible impulse arising from disease . Should such a question be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law of the District . New-York readers can not take it for granted that the New York rule prevails , and that the evidence of irresistible impulse ought all to be ruled out . In some trials in the District the Judges have allowed this defense of uncontrollable impulse . Impaneling a jury is a matter on which Tocal laws and the traditional practice of courts vary . There has been great difficulty and delay upon many important trials-in finding jurors who were iniPartial ; the had not " formed an opinion . " In " this State this trouble has been measurably relieved by statutes passed in 1872 and 1873 . But it is useless to refer to acts of a State Legislature for ascertaining what course ought to be taken in the Criminal Court at Washington . That court must select jurors according to the law which prevails in the District . In general , District of Columbia law is old-fashioned and unsatisfactory . Congress has never given systematic attention to local wants . But a Judge Can not help deficiencies in the law . Rulings which appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some State may be correct , and even necessary , under the local law of the District .
