txt The Secretary of the Treasury very properly does not confine himself to a bare statement of the condition of his department , but gives his views at some length as to taxation , our merchant marine , and the currency . Though his term of office is limited , the country will regard , not the time in Which . he can aid in carrying out his , ideas , but his known ability and experience , which give value to them . Mr. McCulloch recognizes the need of lower taxes in the amount of the surplus , which , including the sinking fund , is this year $104,000,000 and for next year is estimated at $88,000,000 . But he gives still greater weight to the depressed condition of our manufactures and the pressing need of a market for them . He draws a striking . parallel between the present state of this branch of industry and that of agriculture before ' - the rapid building of railways gave the farmer a market corresponding to his power of production . Waiving ... the question of the need of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that for that purpose protection ' was needed , he points out that now the power of production has so far outrun ' the home market that the demands of that market could , in all the great staples , be met with six months . ' product of our mills in* full operation . The only markets available for this surplus . product are the foreign markets , and . these are ; shut to our manufactures by the greater cost of raw materials caused by the duties on imports and by the check to commerce hnposed by general high duties . In the interest of manufactures ; theref ore , and as a measure of the greatest practicable encouragement to them , he advocates the repeal of the tariff on the raw materials and the reduction of those import taxes that weigh most heavily on those least able to pay them . The Secretary of : the Treasury does not indicate specifically the changes he would recommend , but urges that the applica -- tion of these principles should be investigated by a commission , which should be appointed at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the next Congress , in order that they . may have time for a careful study of the subject agd for report at the next session . He urges further that , this commission should bear in mind ? the limitation of the . revenue to the actual needs of the Government and the avoidance of " radical and sweeping changes in the tariff . " As to the internal revenue , he advises the repeal of the tax on tobacco and of that on the circulation of national banks . The views of the Secretary-upon the tariff are undoubtedly sound . He touches the real difficulty with our manufacturing interests when he ' asks that they shall be helped to reach foreign markets , and the real remedy , in great part at least , in the reduction of the cost of raw materials . Whatever may be the action of the present or of the next Congress , nothing is more certain than that the tariff will have to be reformed and in this direction . Regarding silver , the Secretary describes with clearness the bad condition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the issue of silver certificates . He warns Congress that unless both are stopped the time will come , and may come very soon , when silver will be the . controlling element in our currency , ? when the Government will be compelled to pay it out instead of gold , and when the credit of the Gov. ernment and the security of the whole business of the . country . will . be undermined . He further recommends , and very strongly , that the onedollar and two-dollar notes be absolutely withdrawn in order that the silver and certificates already out may find a safe and permanent circulation . The trade dollars , he thinks , should be bought in at a slight advance on their bullion value , to be offered for a limited time , the trade dollars to be recoined in ' standard dollars and counted as part of the annual coinage new required by law . The portion of the Secretary 's report , which will attract the most attention is that in which he argues zealously for subsidies , through payments . for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wed , do not regard his argument as strong , and it appears to us contradictory in its various parts , but coming from so high an authority it deserves , and will undoubtedly receive , careful attention . It is , in brief . as follows : A nation that ceases to build ships ceases , of consequence , to , be a commercial and maritime nation . Our Nation has ceased to build ships , from various causes . Other nations have secured a practical monopoly of the carrying trade . It is too late to do any.good by allowing the purchase of foreign-built ships , because the trouble is not in the too great cost of , ships at home , but in the lack of demand for them . The ' Government ought to aid in creating the demand , while admitting free of duty all material for shipbuilding . It will at once be seen that this argument involves two very important assumptions : first , that it is better for a nation by tax to secure ships for its carrying trade than to get that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; second , that having obtained its ships in this way , it can maintain them in competition with other ship , . ping built under purely commercial conditions . These assumptions should certainly be examined very carefully before they are acted on . The Secretary makes an emphatic but somewhat inadequate plea for placing the national banking system on a more permanent basis . It is to be regretted that he does not explain how this can be dorm.
