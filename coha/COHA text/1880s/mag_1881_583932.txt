THE LONDON THEATERS . THE author of these remarks was on the point of prefixing to them a different title from the one he has actually made use of when it occurred to him that the latter would give a much better idea of his subject . " The London Theaters " stands for something that may , more or less profitably , be talked about , but " The English Stage " is a conception so purely intellectual , so confined to the region of theory , or reminiscence , or desire , that it eludes the most ingenious grasp . There are a great many theaters in London , enjoying various degrees of credit and prosperity ; but there is nothing cynical in saying that there is no such thing in existence as an English stage . The stage is a collective organism , composed of the harmonious vitality diffused through a number of individual play-houses , which are nourished by a dramatic literature native to the country , and expressing its manners and feelings , and which work together to an effective end . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typified to the world , in a theater more distinguished than the rest , in which the education of the actor has reached its highest point , and in which it is the supreme ambition of the dramatic authors of the country to see their productions represented . There is a stage in France , of which the Com*dieFran9aise is the richest expression ; and we are told that there is a very honorable stage in Germany , where two or three excellent theaters-literary theaters - maintain the standard of finished and brilliant acting . It appears to be generally conceded that there was formerly a stage in England . In the last century , the English theaters went hand-in-hand with a literature which THE BATTLE OF NARVA. // sprang substantially from the English mind itself ; and which , though it has not proved of any value to posterity , ministered , for the time , to what we have called the vitality of the stage . At that time the actor 's profession was looked upon as a hill of difficulty , not to be scaled at a bound , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought an easy one to master , and a long probation , an apprenticeship of humility , was the portion of even the most promising aspirants . The two great " patented " houses , Drury Lane and Covent Garden , performed very much the same function that the Com*dieFran9aise has long been supposed to discharge ( in spite of many lapses and errors ) on the other side of the Channel . They protected the drama , and they had a high responsibility . They monopolized , in London , the right to play Shakspere and the poetical repertory , and they formed the objective point of actors and authors alike . They recruited themselves from the training-school which the provincial theaters then supplied , and they rewarded merit , and consecrated reputations . All this is changed , as so many things are changed in literature and art . The conditions of production are immensely different from those of an age in which the demand for the things that make life agreeable had not become so immoderate as to create a standing quarrel between the quality and the quantity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has apparently become a lost one with the English race , who are content to let their entertainment be made for them by a people whose whole view of life is , however ingenious , essentially different from their own . The comparatively simple and homogeneous character of the English stage has become a sort of musty tradition , and in its place we have several dozen smnll theatrical enterprises , some of which are very successful , and others not at all so , but all of which live entirely on what the French call " expedients , " and compass their degree of success by methods decidedly incongruous . It is of the actual , however , that we pretend to speak , and not of the possible or impossible . Talking simply of the actual , the first thing to say of it is that the theater is nowadays decidedly the fashion in London . People go to it a great deal , and are willing to pay high prices for the privilege ; they talk of it , they write about it , and , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the form of a desire to pass from the passive to the active side of the foot-lights . The number of stage-struck persons who are to be met with in the London world is remarkable , and the number of prosperous actors who are but lately escaped amateurs is equally striking . The older actors regard the invasion of this class with melancholy disapproval , and declare that the profession is going to the dogs . By amateurs we mean young men " of the world " ( for of the other sex , naturally , there is much less question ) not of theatrical stock , who have gone upon the stage after being educated for something very different , and who have managed to achieve success without going through the old-fashioned processes . The old actors are probably right from their own point of view  --  the point of view from which a long course of histrionic gymnastics was thought indispensable , and from which the touchstone of accomplishment was the art of delivering the great Shaksperean speeches . That way of considering the matter has lost credit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a line of effect in which their being " amateurs " is almost a positive advantage . Small , realistic comedy is their chosen field , and the art of acting as little as possible has-doubtless with good results in some ways-taken the place of the art of acting as much . Of course , MR . AND MRS . BANCROFT IN " SCHOOL . " // qwq MR . AND MRS . RRNDAL IN TRNNYSON 'S PLAY OF " THR FALCON. ** // amount of pleasure which is represented ( to our possibly too frugal sense ) by two dollars and a half , from a spectacle not unworthy of a booth at a fair . Pleasure , however , is usually expensive in England , and the theater conforms simply to the common law . BQoks are dear , pictures are dear , music is dear , traveling is dear . Play-going , in other ways besides , comes under the usual London disadvantagesthe great distance to be traversed before reaching the theater , the repulsive character of many of the streets through which your resthetic pilgrimage lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressing as if for a private entertainment . These things testify to the theater 's being the fashion among a certain class , and the last luxury of a few , rather than taking its place in the common habits of the people , as it does in France . The difference in favor of the French is indicated by the very much more convenient form that play-going assumes in Paris , where the various temples of the drama are scattered along the clean , bright Boulevard , and are guarded by no restriction , tacit or other , as to the costume of their frequenters . In New York as well , in these respects , we are better off than the good people who embark for an evening of -. - *-  ...  --  7 MISS ELLEN TERRY AS " OPHELIA " // the play in London . The New York theaters are all more or less adjacent to the great thoroughfare of the town , and the ceremony of " dressing " does not , even feebly , impose itself . It must be admitted , however , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your material comfort is greater , too , than it is in Paris , greater , too , than it is in New York . The atmosphere , for inscrutable reasons , is a very much less poisonous compound than the suffocating medium through which the unexhausted Parisian is condemned to witness the masterpieces of Moli*re and Victor Hugo , of Sardou and the younger Dumas . You are much better seated , less crowded and jostled , than in Paris , and you are not bullied and irritated by the terrible tribe of ouvreuses . Your neighbors sit quietly and reasonably in their places , without trooping out between the acts , to the deep discomfort of your toes and knees . You have , in a word , the sense of passing your evening in better company than in Paris , and this , if it be not what you go to the theater for , and if it be but a meager compensation for a lame performance , may , nevertheless , be numbered among the encouragements to playgoing . These encouragements , in all matters independent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in London during the last few years , and have now reached a very high perfection . Everything has b'een done that can be done by beauty of scenery , completeness of furniture and costume , refinement of machinery , to put the auditor into good humor with what he is about to listen to . What will it matter what he listens to if he have real buhl cabinets , Persian carpets , and Venetian mirrors to look at ? These tendencies have fotind a sumptuous home , within a small number of months , in three theaters which divide between them the honor of being the most important in London . To a stranger , inquiring which should be deemed the first of these houses , it would be difficult to give a very definite answer . " Oh , the Lyceum , " it might be said , " because at the Lyceum they play Shakspere . " Yes ; at the Lyceum they play Shakspere ; but the question is , how they play him . The greatest of poets is not , to our mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very high place to the scene of the attempt . At the St. James 's , they play translations of MM . Bayard and Scribe , and original productions of Mr. Tom Taylor . At the Haymarket , they play Lord Lytton and M. Sardou . It is a nice question whether it is a nobler task to render Shakspere inadequately , or to represent with sufficient skill rather pale adaptations of French vaudeviZ/is/es . It is a question , however , that we are not called upon to solve , and we will content ourselves with saying that at the three theaters just mentioned a great many things are very cleverly done . Upward of two years ago the Lyceum passed into the hands of Mr. Henry Irving , who is without doubt at present the most distinguished actor in England . He had been acting at the Lyceum for some years before , while the house was under the management of the late Mr. Bateman , and then of his widow , who has within a few months , with a great deal of courage and zeal , attempted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a theater which had its season of prosperity ( many years ago ) , but which finally , in its out-of-the-way position , was left stranded by ebbing tides . Mrs. Bateman , to whom much of the credit of originally introducing Mr. Irving to the public belongs , succeeded in some degree , we believe , in turning the tide back to the little theater to which the late Mr. Phelps 's revivals " at one period attracted the town . Mr. Irving for the last two years , then , has had his own way at the Lyceum , and a very successful way it has been . Hamlet and Sizylock have constituted the stock of his enterprise , though he has also acted several of the parts in which he built up his reputation-.  - -  Richelieu ; Eugene Aram and Charles I. , in Mr. W. G. Wills 's plays ; Louis XL , in a translation of Casimir Delavigne 's rather dull drama , and Matthias in " The Bells . " During the whole of last winter , however , " The Merchant of Venice " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " Hamlet " the chief place in his list of successes as an actor . Among his triumphs as a manager , the former play , we believe , quite heads the list ; it has every appearance of being an immense financial success , and startling stories are told of the great sums of money it brings into the happy lessee of the theater . It is arranged upon the stage with a great deal of ingenuity and splendor , and has a strong element of popularity in the person of Miss Ellen Terry , who is the most conspicuous actress now before the London public , as the picturesque Shyloch of her Portia is the most eminent actor . Mr. Irving has been a topic in London any time these five years , and Miss Terry is at least // as much of one . There is a difference , indeed , for about Mr. Irving people are divided , and about Miss Terry they are pretty well agreed . The opinion flourishes on the one side that Mr. Irving is a great and admirable artist , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his qualities . He has at least the power of inspiring violent enthusiasms , and this faculty is almost always accompanied by a liability to excite protests . Those that it has been Mr. Irving 's destiny to call forth have been very downright , and many of them are sufficiently intelligible . He is what is called a picturesque actor ; that is , he depends for his effects upon the art with which he presents a certain figure to the eye , rather than upon the manner in which he speaks his part . He is a thoroughly serious actor , and evidently bestows an immense deal of care and conscience upon his work ; he meditates , elaborates , and , upon the line on which he moves , carries the part to a very high degree of finish . But it must be affirmed that this is a line with which the especial art of the actors , the art of utterance , of saying the thing , has almost nothing to do . Mr. Irving 's peculiarities and eccentricities of speech are so strange , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of modulation , of elocution so highly developed , the tricks he plays with the divine mother-tongue so audacious and fantastic , that the spectator who desires to be in sympathy with him finds himself confronted with a bristling hedge of difficulties . He must scramble over the hedge , as best he can , in order to get at Mr. Irving at all ; to get at him , that is , as an exponent of great poetic meanings . Behind this hedge , as we may say , the actor disports himself with a great deal of ingenuity , and passes through a succession of picturesque attitudes and costumes ; but we look at him only through its thorny interstices . In so doing , we get glimpses of a large and various ability . He is always full of intention , and when the intention is a matter of by-play , it is brilliantly carried out . He is , of course , much better in the modern drama than in the Shaksperean ; because , if it is a question of sacrificing the text , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is better to lose the verses of Mr. Wills than to fail to recognize those of the poet whom the French have sometimes spoken of as Mr. Williams . Mr. Irving 's rendering of Shakspere , however , is satisfactory in a varying degree . His Macbe/h appeared to us wide of the mark , but his Hamlet is very much better . In Macbe/h , as we remember his performance , he failed even to look the part satisfactorily  --  a rare mistake in an actor who has evidently a strong sense of what may be called the plastic side of the characters he represents . His Hamlet is a magnificent young prince : few actors can wear a cloak and a bunch of sable plumes with a greater grace than Mr. Irving ; few of them can rest a well-shaped hand on the hilt of a sword in a manner more suggestive of the models of Vandyke . The great trouble with the Hamlet was that it was inordinately slow  --  and this , indeed , is the fault throughout of Mr. Irving , who places minutes between his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Heat , rapidity , passion , magic ,  --  these qualities are the absent ones , and a good general description of him is to say that he is picturesque but diffuse . Of his Shylock during last winter , it was often said that it presents his faults in their mildest and his merits in their highest form . Jn this there is possibly a great deal of truth ; his representation of the rapacious and rancorous Jew has many elements of interest . He looks the part to a charm , or rather we should say , to a repulsion , and he might be painted as he stands . His conception of it is a sentimental one , and he has endeavored to give us a sympathetic , and , above all , a pathetic Shylock . How well he reconciles us to this aspect of the character we ourselves shall not undertake to say , for our attention was fixed primarily upon the superficial execution of the thing , and here , without going further , we found much to arrest and perplex it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all as painfully behind the stroke of the clock . The deep-welling malignity , the grotesque horror , the red-hot excitement of the long-baffled , sore-hearted member of a despised trade , who has been all his life at a disadvantage , and who at last finds his hour and catches his opportunity , - these elements had dropped out . Mr. Irving 's Skylock is neither excited nor exciting , and many of the admirable speeches , on his lips , lack much of their incision ; notably the outbreak of passion and prospective revenge after he finds that Antonio has become forfeit , and that his daughter has fled from him , carrying off her dowry . The great sp*ech , with its grim refrain : " Let him look to his bond ! " rising each time to an intenser pitch and culminating in a pregnant menace , this superb opportunity // hENRY IRVING AS " YANDERDECKEN " ( " THE FLYING DUTCHMAN " ) I // is missed ; the actor , instead of being " hissing hot , " as we have heard Edmund Kean described at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all its points . The best thing that Mr. Irving does is , to our taste , the Louis XL of Casimir Delavigne , a part in which his defects to a certain degree stand him in stead of qualities . His peculiarities of voice and enunciation are not in contradiction to those of the mumbling old monarch and dotard whom he represents with so much effective detail . Two years ago he l ) layed Claude Melno/te for several months , sacrificing himself with the most commendable generosity to the artistic needs of Miss Ellen Terry , who was the Pauline of the season . We say sacrificing himself , for his inaptitude for the part was so distinct that he must have been aware of it . We may mention two other characters in which Mr. Irving composes a figure to the eye with brilliant taste and skill ,  --  the Charles I , of Mr. Wills , and the Vanderdecken , of ( if we mistake not ) the same author . His Charles L might have stepped down from the canvas of Vandyke , and his Vanderdecken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but we do not add that he acts them , for , to the best of our recolJection there is nothing in them to act . The more there is to act , and the less there is simply to declaim , the better for Mr. Irving , who owes his great success in " The Bells " to the fact that the part of the distracted burgomaster is so largely pantomimic . Miss Terry is at present his constant co*djutor , and Miss Terry is supposed to represent the maximum of feminine effort on the English stage . The feminine side , in all the London theaters , is regrettably weak , and Miss Terry is easily distinguished . It is difficult to speak of her fairly , for if a large part of the public are wrong about her , they are altogether wrong , and one hesitates to bring such sweeping charges . By many intelligent persons she is regarded as an actress of exquisite genius , and is supposed to impart an extraordinary interest to everything that she touches . This is not , in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assertion too broadly is to fall into an extreme of injustice . The difficulty is that Miss Terry has charm-remarkable charm ; and this beguiles people into thinking her an accomplished actress . There is a natural quality about her that is extremely pleasing-something wholesome and English and womanly which often touches VOL . XXI. - 26. easily where art , to touch , has to be finer than we often see it . The writer of these lines once heard her highly commended by one of the most distinguished members of the Com*die-Fran*aise , who had not understood a word she spoke . " Ah , Miss Terry , for instance ; I liked he ; extremely . " " And why did you like her ? " " Mon Dieu , I found her very natural . " This seemed to us an interesting impression , and a proof the more of the truism that we enjoy things in proportion to their rarity . To our own English vision Miss Terry has too much nature , and we should like a little more art . On the other side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her finish , by what she has acquired , by the perfection of her art , and the critic I have just quoted , who had had this sort of merit before his eyes all his life , was refreshed by seeing what could be achieved in lieu of it by a sort of sympathetic spontaneity . Miss Terry has that excellent thing , a quality ; she gives one the sense of something fine . Add to this that though she is not regularly beautiful , she has a face altogether in the taste of the period , a face that Burne-Jones might have drawn , and that she arranges herself ( always in the taste of the period ) wonderfully well for the stage . She makes an admirable picture , and it would be difficult to imagine a more striking embodiment of sumptuous sweetness than her Ophelia , her Portia , her Pauline , or her Olivia , in a version of Goldsmith 's immortal novel prepared for the Court Theater a couple of years ago by the indefatigable Mr. Wills . Her Ophelia , in particular , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young lady in white muslin , bristling with strange grasses , whom we are accustomed to see in the part . In Miss Terry 's hands the bewildered daughter of Polonius became a somewhat angular maiden of the Gothic ages , with hair cropped short , like a boy 's , and a straight and clinging robe , wrought over with contemporary needle-work . As for her acting , she has happy impulses ; but this seems to us to be the limit of it . She has nothing of the style , nothing of what the French call the authority , of the genuine eome'dienne . Her perception lacks acuteness , and her execution is often rough ; the expression of her face itself is frequently amateurish , and her voice has a curious husky monotony , which , though it often strikes a touching note in pathetic passages , yet on the whole interferes seriously with finish of elocution . This // latter weakness is especially noticeable when Miss Terry plays Shakspere . Her manner of dealing with the delightful speeches of Portia , with all their play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put it harshly , of the school-girlish . We have ventured to say that her comprehension of a character is sometimes weak , and we may illustrate it by a reference to her whole handling of this same rich opportunity . Miss Terry 's mistress of Belmont giggles too much , plays too much with her fingers , is too free and familiar , too osculatory , in her relations with Bassanlo . The mistress of Belmont was a great lady , as well as a tender and a clever woman ; but this side of the part quite eludes the actress , whose deportment is not such as we should expect in the splendid spinster who has princes for wooers . When Bassanjo has chosen the casket which contains the key of her heart , she approaches him , and begins to pat and stroke him . This seems to us an appallingly false note . " Good heavens , she 's touching him ! " a person sitting next to us exclaimed  --  a person whose judgment in such matters is always unerring . But in truth there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question of demonstration of tenderness on the English stage , and an adequate treatment of it would carry us far . The amount of kissing and hugging that goes on in London in the interest of the drama is quite incalculable , and to spectatdrs who find their ideal of taste more nearly fulfilled in the French theater , it has the drollest , and often the most displeasing effect . Of such demonstrations French comedians are singularly sparing ; it is apparently understood that French modesty may be ruffled by them . The English would be greatly  --  and naturally-surprised if one should undertake to suggest to them that they have a shallower sense of decency than the French , and yet they view with complacency , in the high glare of the footlights , a redundancy of physical endearment which the taste of their neighbors across the channel would never accept . It is wholly a matter of taste , and taste is not the great English quality . English spectators delight in broad effects , and English actors and authors are often restricted to them . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " as the phrase is , to make a lover and his mistress , or a husband and his wife , cling about each other 's necks and return again to the charge , and when other expedients are wanting , this one always succeeds . It is when the embrace is strictly conjugal that it is especially serviceable . The public relish of it is then extreme , and is to be condemned only on aesthetic grounds . It speaks of the soundness and sincerity of the people , but it speaks also of their want of a certain delicacy . The French contention is that such moments , such situations should be merely hinted at-that they are too sacred , too touching to linger upon , and that , moreover , at bottom they are not dramatic . Mr. George Rignold , an actor who has had some success in America , has lately been playing in " Black-eyed Susan , " Douglas Jerrold 's curiously antiquated drama , which tells so strange a tale of what the English stage had become fifty years ago ; and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the unfortunate William presses his devoted spouse to his bosom . It is admirable , but it is too admirable ; and it is as great a mistake to give us so much of it as it would be to represent people saying their prayers . We have a vivid recollection of the tone in which a clever French lady narrated to us her impressions of a representation of Robertson 's comedy of " Caste , " which she had seen at the Prince of Wales 's Theater . One of the principal incidents in this piece is the leave-taking of a young officer and his newly wedded wife , he being ordered away on foreign service . The pangs of parting , as the scene is played , are so protracted and insisted upon that our friend at last was scandalized ; and when the young couple were indulging in their twentieth embrace- " Mais , baissez donc Ze rideau / " she found herself crying " Put down the curtain ! Such things are not done in public " - while the company about her applauded so great a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , *of nature ,  --  a distinction too ofteii lost sight of in England . In speaking of the pefformances of Shakspere at the Lyceum just now as " inadequate , " we meant more particularly that no representation of Shakspere can be regarded as at all adequate which is not excellent as a whole . Many of the poet 's noblest and most exquisite speeches are given to secondary characters to utter , and we need hardly remind the reader how the actors who play secondary characters ( putting , for the moment , those who play primary ones quite aside ) are in the habit of speaking poetic lines . It is usually a misery to hear them , and there is something monstrous in seeing the most precious intellectual heritage of the human race so fearfully knocked // about . Mr. Irving has evidently done his best in distributing the parts in " The Merchant of Venice , " and with what sorry results this best is attended ! What an Antonio / what a Bassanlo / what a Nerissa / what a Jessica / The scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belmont , in which the young lovers , sitting hand in hand , breathe out , in rhythmic alternation , their homage to the southern night-this enchanting scene , as it is given at the Lyceum , should be listened to for curiosity 's sake . But who , indeed , it may be asked , can rise to the level of such poetry ? who can speak such things as they should be spoken ? Not , assuredly , the untrained and undedicated performers of whom the great stock of actors and actresses presenting themselves to the English and American public is composed . Shakspere can not be acted by way of a change from Messrs . Byron and Burnand , Messrs . Robertson and Wills . He is a school and a specialty in himself , and he is not to be taken up offhand by players who have been interpreting vulgarity the day before , and who are to return to vulgarity on the morrow . Miss Marie Litton , an enterprising actress , has lately been conducting the small theater attached to the Westminster Aquarium , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Success , we believe , was at first rather coy ; for about the Westminster Aquarium there hovers a sensibly bad odor . The impurities of its atmosphere , however , are chiefly perceptible after nightfall , and Miss Litton has conjured away ill-fortune by giving her performances during the more innocent hours , and renaming the little play-house the " Afternoon Theater . " It is a dusky and incommodious establishment , with that accidental , provincial look which is so fatal to the spectator 's confidence in a would-be " home of the drama . " But , such as it is , it has lately witnessed an attempt to bring out " As You Like It " in style , as they say at the restaurants . The style consists chiefly in Miss Litton 's doing Rosa lind in Mr. Lionel Brough 's doing Touchstone , and in Mr. Herman Vezin 's doing Jaques . Mr. Herman Vezin , who is of American origin , is one of the best actors in London . He plays a remarkable variety of parts , and plays some of them extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elocutionist-he speaks blank verse more artfully than most of his neighbors . His Jaques , however , appeared to us to lack color and vivacity , humor and irony . The last occasion on which we had seen Mr. Lionel Brough was that of his playing in a fierce burlesque , at the Folly Theater , in conjunction with Miss Lydia Thompson . As for Miss Litton herself , she has this qualification for the part of Rosa/ind* that as Rosalind* during most of the play , endeavors to pass herself off as a young man , so the actress 's natural organism is remarkably man-like . Miss Litton is too bulky for Rosa/md 's nimble wit . But what an artistic education it supposes , a proper rendering of the part ! What grace , what finish , what taste , what sentiment , what archness ! In London there is no House of Shakspere , as there is in Paris a House of Moli*re , and in his undomiciled condition , between the Lyceum and the " fishy " Aquarium , the poor great poet has strange bedfellows . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a changing of hands . The company of the Prince of Wales 's have lately established themselves at the Haymarket , which has been " done up , " as they say in England , with great magnificence ; and that of the Court has transferred itself to the St. James 's , where , for a long time , no such promise of prosperity had reigned . The two forsaken theaters have meanwhile re-opened their doors in creditable conditions . The Prince of Wales 's , indeed , has been the scene of an interesting performance , of which we shall presently speak . The Haymarket has gained by being taken by Mr. and Mrs. Bancroft , but we are not sure that this humorous couple have bettered themselves with the public by leaving the diminutive play-house to which they taught the public the road . The Prince of Wales 's is a little theater , and the pieces produced there dealt mainly in little things-presupposing a great many chairs and tables , carpets , curtains , and knickknacks , and an audience placed close to the stage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written by a cleverish visitor at a country-house , and acted in the drawing-room by his fellowinmates . The comedies of the late Mr. Robertson were of this number , and these certainly are among the most diminutive experiments ever attempted in the drama . It is among the habits formed upon Mr. Robertson 's pieces that the company of the Prince of Wales 's have grown up , and it is possible that they may not have all the success they desire in accommodating themselves to a larger theater . Upon this point , however , it is quite too early to pronounce ; // and meanwhile Mr. Bancroft has transformed the Haymarket-which was an antiquated and uncomfortable house with honorable traditions , which had latterly declined-into the perfection of a place of entertainment . Brilliant , luxuriant , softly cushioned and perfectly aired , it is almost entertainment enough to sit there and admire the excellent device by which the oldfashioned and awkward proscenium has been suppressed and the stage set all around in an immense gilded frame , like that of some magnificent picture . Within this frame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glows with a radiance that seems the very atmosphere of comedy . So much for the house , but for the rest , there is less to say . As soon as we come to speak of a theater of which the specialty is the comedy of contemporary manners , our appreciation stumbles into the bottomless gulf of the poverty of the repertory . There can be no better proof of such poverty than the tact that the genius loci at the Prince of Wales 's was always the just-mentioned Mr. Robertson . This gentleman 's plays are infantile , and seem addressed to the comprehension of infants . Mr. and Mrs. Bancroft 's actors and actresses could not go on playing them for year after year without falling into the small manner . It is not incumbent on us to say that this manner has been found wanting on being applied to larger things , for the simple reason that it has been rarely put to the test . To consecrate his new enterprise , Mr. Bancroft has brought forward the late Lord Lytton 's hackneyed comedy of " Money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be said to make formidable demands . That it should have been brought forward at all at a moment when a brilliant stroke was needed , speaks volumes as to the degree in which an English manager may be unacquainted with the embarras de c/ioix . In opening anew the best of English theaters , Mr. and Mrs. Bancroft were probably conscious of high responsibility ; they had apparently decided that they ought to be local and national , and that it would be a false note to usher in their season with a drama extorted , after the usual fashion , from the French . They looked about them for an " original " English comedy , and it is certainly not their fault if they found nothing fresher nor weightier than this poor artificial " Money , " covered with the dust of a hundred prompters ' boxes , and faded with the glare of a thousand foot-lights . An original English comedy is not to be had by whistling-no , nor apparently even by praying-for it . There are , however , members of the company at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit , some of them , for the best things . The weak side , as on the London stage throughout , is that of the women . With the exception of Mrs. Bancroft , there is not an actress who calls for mention . Miss Marion Terry , who does the young ladies , is a pale reflection of her sister , and , although a graceful and sympathetic figure , has , as an actress , no appreciable identity whatever . It will be interesting to see what they will do at the Haymarket when they have to mount a piece with an important part for a young woman . What they will do apparently will be-not to mount it . Mrs. Kendal ( Miss Madge Robertson ) , at the Prince of Wales 's , used to play the important young women ; but Mrs. Kendal has now passed over to the new St. James 's , the management of which her husband divides with Mr. Hare . Mrs. Bancroft in the line of broad comedy is a delightful actress , with an admirable sense of the humorous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great deal of art and finish . The only other actress in London who possesses these gifts ( or some of them ) in as high a degree is Mrs. John Wood , who is even more broadly comic than Mrs. Bancroft , and moves the springs of laughter with a powerful hand . She is brilliantly farcical , but she is also frankly and uncompromisingly vulgar , and Mrs. Bancroft has more discretion and more taste . The part most typical of Mrs. Bancroft 's best ability is that of Po/ly Eccies , in " Caste , " of which she makes both a charming and an exhilarating creation . She idso does her best with Lady Franklin , the widow with a turn for practical jokes , in " Money , " but the part has so little stuff that there is not much to be made of it . Mrs. Bancroft is limited to the field we have indicated , which is a very ample one ; she has made two or three excursions into the region of serious effect , which have not been felicitous . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dora , " is an example in point . Since we have begun to speak of the ladies , we will remain a little longer in their company-apologizing for our want of gallantry in again expressing our vivid sense of the fact that they do not shine on the London stage at the present hour . It takes more to make an accomplished actress than // the usual Englishwoman who embraces the profession can easily lay her hands upon ; a want of frankness , of brightness , of elegance , of art , is commonly , before the footlights , this lady 's principal impediment . The situation may be measured by the fact that Miss Adelaide Neilson ( whose principal laurels , we believe , were won in the United States ) was one of its most brilliant ornaments . Miss Neilson was a remarkably pretty woman ; but she added to this advantage , so far as we could perceive , none of the higher qualifications of an actress . We shall not soon forget a visit we paid over a year ago to the musty and fog-haunted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Julia in " The Hunchback . " The performance lingers in our mind as something ineffaceably lugubrious . Mr. Herman Vezin did Master Walter ; and Mr. Henry Neville , Sir Thomas Clifford . They are both clever actors ; but either they were very much out of place , or they were playing without their usual spirit ; for a sense of melancholy poverty lay heavy upon the auditor 's mind , which was not enlivened by the manner in which Miss Lydia Foote , an actress enjoying great credit , expressed the characteristics of the merry-making Helen . We have passed some bad hours at the Adelphian establishment which we remember in the " good old " days , as they are called , of Mr. Benjamin Webster and Madame Celeste . Mr. Benjamin Webster used to be very effective in " The Dead Heart , " a drama of the French Revolution , pervaded by the clanking of chains and the uproar of rescuing populace . As for Madame Celeste , who that ever saw her in the " Green Bushes " can forget the manner in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stalked about the stage with a musket on her shoulder , her fine eyes rolling , as the phrase is , all over the place , and her lower limbs , much exposed , encased in remarkably neat Indian leggings ? It is not these memories that are painful , but several more recent ones . We spoke of the Adelphi justnow as a " fog-haunted " house , and literally , from some mysterious reason , of winter nights the murky atmosphere of the Strand is as thick within the theater as outside of it . It is a very palpable presence at most of the London theaters ; but at the Adelphi a. perpetual yellow mist , half dust , half dampness , seems to hover above the stalls , and to stretch itself across the stage , like a screen of dirty gauze . Was it because we beheld it through this unflattering medium that a certain performance of " Nicholas Nickleby , " which Mr. Andrew Halliday had done into a drama , recently appeared to us a terribly abortive entertainment ? We are unable to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vain to attempt to galvanize the drama into life by expensive upholstery , for a public whose taste could resist the shock of such a performance . There was a vulgar ferocity , a shabby brutality about it which were quite indefinable ; and we felt that the taste of the community that could tolerate it really offered no soil in which the theater might revive . If that was possible , better things were impossible . Mr. Herman Vezin , Mr. Henry Neville , Miss Lydia Foote , were again in the cast , together with Mrs. Alfred Mellon , a praiseworthy actress , who many years ago was almost brilliant , and who now , in a costume worthy of a masquerade in Bedlam , gave visible form to the savage humors of Mrs. Squeers . In spite of the valuable aid of these performers , however , there is nothing comfortable in our recollection of " Nicholas Nickleby , " unless it be the acquirement of a conviction . We mean the conviction that it is a great mistake to attempt to transform Dickens 's works into dramas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endangers them for the reader , is doubled when they are presented to the eye . Dramatic effect is not missed , but overdone , and we receive an impression of something intolerably salient and violent . Add to which the simple cutting up of a novel into episodes , tacked together anyhow , is always an abomination . Mrs. Kendal ( to return to the ladies whom we have left ) is a thoroughly accomplished , business-like , lady-like actress , with a great deal of intelligence , a great deal of practice , and a great deal of charm . She is not , we should say , highly imaginative , but she has always the manner of reality , and her reality is always graceful . At the St. James 's she carries the weight of the whole feminine side of the houseshe reigns alone ; and it is a proof of the great value which in London attaches to a competent actress , once she is secured , that Mrs. Kendal does all sorts of business . Yesterday she was a young girl , of the period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sternhold , in a revival of Tom Taylor 's " Still Waters . " The former Court and the former Prince of Wales 's // ( that is , the St. James 's and the Haymarket ) keep very well abreast of each other , and their rivalry is altogether friendly ; but as we cited the recent revival of " Money " at the second-named of these houses as an evidence of scanty resources , so we may say that it was rather pitiful to see Mr. Hare , when he came to open his new theater , with nothing to set out as a birthday feast but an adaptation of a stale French vaudeville of twenty or thirty years ago , entitled " Le Fils de Famille . " This performance had not even the merit of novelty , for it had been played at the Court for many weeks before Mr. Hare left this house . " The Queen 's Shilling , " however , as the English version of the play is called , offered Mr. Kendal some opportunities for very good acting . He and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. James 's , undertook the grave responsibility of making a success of the little drama which Mr. Tennyson has lately contributed to the stage . " The Falcon " is an attempt to convert into a poetic comedy one of the most familiar and most touching of the tales of Boccaccio , a tale which a dozen poets have reproduced in narrative verse . Mr. Tennyson 's verse , in this last reproduction , aspires to be dramatic ; but it works in awkward conditions . The story of the poor gentleman who , to give a breakfast to the proud lady whom he secretly adores , sends his falcon  --  a solitary treasure  --  to the pot , and then learns that the purpose of the lady 's visit ( she is a noble widow , of the neighborhood ) had been to ask for the gift of the bird for her little boy , who is lying ill and has taken a fancy to it-this simple and affecting tale is capital reading , but it is very indifferent acting . The de ' - nouemen/ consists exclusively in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , madam , you have had it for your breakfast ! " - and before an audience with an irreverent sense of the ridiculous such a de'nouement , in apathetic piece , might have provoked a dangerous titter . The English public , however , is not ironical , nor analytic ; it takes things on the whole very simply . " The Falcon " therefore was for a few weeks a moderate success  --  the author having taken the precaution not to bid for loud applause by any great splendor of verse . Mr. and Mrs. Kendal , on the other hand , who recited the text with a great deal of care  --  the former indeed with a degree of ready art remarkable in an actor who has formed his manner . upon current colloquialism , and has had the fear of the artificial constantly in his eyes-Mr. and Mrs. Kendal , in their Italian dresses of the fifteenth century , were splendidly picturesque figures . The arrangement of the stage also remains in our mind as a supremely successful thing of the kind  --  the cool , inclosed light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glimpse of a glowing summer s day outside . So you stand and look , from a window with a deep embrasure , at the country about Siena . We have spoken of Miss Ellen Terry , of Mrs. Bancroft , of Mrs. Kendal ; but we have not spoken of the most interesting actress in London . It is agreeable to be able to say that she is an American ; but as she is doubtless as well known in New York as in London , we ought perhaps to do no more than briefly allude to her . Miss Genevieve Ward 's appearances in London take place at considerable intervals , and she has seemingly never made it her business to obtain a regular footing here . Indeed , to the best of our knowledge , she has not , until within the present year , made what is called a hit . This fact is remarkable when Miss Ward 's exceptional ability is considered . She acts with a finish , an intelligence , a style , an understanding of what she is about , which are as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was born under an evil star , or whether there is an insufficient demand for her peculiar qualities to produce a reputation ; at any rate , the actress strikes us as having hitherto been less appreciated than she deserves . It may be hoped that now she has made a hit she will obtain her deserts ; it is only a pity that her success is not bound up with a more solid opportunity . " Forget-Me-Not , " the piece in which Miss Ward has lately appeared at the Prince of Wales 's under the new management ( she had already brought it out , shortly before the close of the summer season at the Lyceum ) , is the joint production of Messrs . Herman Merivale and Crawford Grove . The play is of a very slender pattern , being almost totally destitute of action , and much overburdened with talk . The worst of it is that the talk is about nothing worth while - hovering perpetually round the question of whether a low French adventuress , whom the authors have not attempted to make anything but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young English ladies in Rome , with whom she is connected by mysterious ties . An English gentleman , befriending his young countrywomen , un // dertakes to dislodge the intruder , who resists with great energy , but is finally eliminated . Of these materials Miss Ward has made herself a part . It is a very bad one , but such as it is , she plays it with uncommon brilliancy . Her natural advantages are great , and , to our perception , she comes nearer than any other actress upon the London stage to being a mistress of her art . At the Haymarket , among the men , Mr. Arthur Cecil is easily first-first , we mean , in the sense of being most of an artist . His art is the art of pure comedy , but it never loses sight of nature ; it is always delicate and fine . Few English actors , we suspect , have ever achieved such a command of laughter with an equal lightness of touch . It is true that we remember Charles Mathews . There was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in quantity ; but we doubt whether he was more exquisite in quality . Mr. Arthur Cecil is young ; but it is his fate to represent elderly menthough when he occasionally does one of his own contemporaries ( Sam Gerridge , for instance , in " Caste " ) he loses nothing of his cunning . An actor whose situation is the same , who in the vitality of youth is often condemned to depict senility , is Mr. Hare , of the St. James 's . He does many things admirably , his line , however , being less humorous than Arthur Cecil 's . He is less genial and less comical , hut his old men , whether natural or grotesque , are always minutely studied , and brought before us with elaborate art . He should be seen in a little piece called " A Quiet Rubber " ( an adaptation of " Une Partie de Piquet " ) , in which his Lord Kildare , an impoverished and irascible Irish nobleman , whose high temper and good-breeding are constantly at odds , is a remarkable creation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ votaries of that quiet realism which brings down on the heads of those who practice it the denomination of " amateurs , " John Hare certainly divides with Arthur Cecil the first place . Among the latter 's coml ) anions , at the Haymarket , Mr. Bancroft and Mr. Conway must be mentioned . Mr. Bancroft has always had a specialty-that of the well-dressed , drawling , empty-headed but presumably soft-hearted heavy dragoon , or man about town , of whom a specimen is usually found in the comedies of Mr. Robertson . Mr. Bancroft represents him with a humor that is not too broad , and in which the characteristics of the gentleman are not lost sight of . But he recently gave proof that he was capable of more serious work ; and his Count Or/ojj in the version of Victorien Sardou 's " Dora , " played at the Prince of Wales 's two years ago , was a vigorous and manly piece of acting . In " Diplomacy , " indeed , several of the performers we have mentioned , with two or three others , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good as the heroine as we have sometimes seen her ; she was too mature for the part . We have also said that Mrs. Bancroft , as the Countess Zicka , showed a good deal of misdirected energy . But Arthur Cecil , Mr. Kendal , and Mr. Clayton were all excellent , and the critical scene of the play , the scene of the three men , which on the first production of the piece in Paris did so much to secure its success , was rendered by the two latter gentlemen and by Mr. Bancroft in a manner which left little to be desired . We may say here , in parentheses , that the part of the mother , in " Diplomacy , " the grotesque old widow of a South American general , was weakly filled . We mention the fact as a sign that on the London stage there is a plentiful lack of accomplished old women . There is no one that seems to us half so good as that wonderful Mrs. Vernon , who for so many years was the delightful old lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom we just spoke , deserves a paragraph to himself-though he has lately , if we are not mistaken , been playing in New York , and taking care himself of his credit . He is one of the best representatives of what may be called the man of the world in the contemporary drama . He has an agreeable combination of polish and robustness , and he cultivates ease without that tendency to underact which is the pitfall of the new generation . He made a great hit some five or six years ago in the " All for Her , " of Messrs . Herman Merivale and Palgrave Simpson , a drama suggested by Charles Dickens 's " Tale of Two Cities . " We remember thinking his acting picturesque , but the piece infelicitous . At the time we write , he is playing Sir Horace We/by , the gentleman who fights a duel with Miss Genevieve Ward in " Forget-MeNot . " The part is a painfully weak one , but Mr. Clayton acts it in a manner which shows that he ' is capable of much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set down above , is at present an ornament of the Haymarket , where he plays the // young lovers . We say an ornament advisedly ; for Mr. Conway 's first claim to distinction is his remarkably good looks , which may be admired , along with those of the other professional beauties , at half the photograph shops in London . Mr. Conway follows the same line as that elegant young actor , the late Mr. Montague , who was for several years , at Wallack 's , the admiration of New York . He acts with care and intention ; but the spectator can hardly rid himself of the feeling that the cut of his garments bears an unduly large part in his success . He has been playing Alfred *Evelyn in the revival of " Money , " of which we have already spoken , and he throws a great deal of effort and animation into the part . But he is overweighted by it , flimsy as it is , and he labors under the disadvantage of a harsh and inflexible voice . We remember seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years since , when the play was brought out at the Prince of Wales 's . He ( lid it better , for Mr. Coghlan is a serious and interesting actor . Mr. Coghlan is par excellence a votary of quiet realism ; the only criticism we shall make of him is that he sometimes confounds the real with the quiet . He has lately been playing in an English arrangement of an American piece - " The Banker 's Daughter . " " The Old Love and the New , " as it is renamed , was brought out by the new management of the Court , with every appearance of success . There is something so truthful , touching and manly in Mr. Coghlan 's acting that it is a satisfaction to see him ; but he should remember that good acting consists in doing , not the real thing , but the thing which from the scenic point of view appears the real thing  --  a very different affair . This would be a guarantee against his turning his back too much to the audience and delivering too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not speak of " The Old Love and the New " without a word of applause for a very clever actor , Mr. Anson , who plays the part of a New York commercial traveler with remarkable comic force . The wonder of it is that the actor is not , as we at first supposed , an American . His rendering of the part is a real study in linguistics . The intonation , the accent of his model , are reproduced with a verity and a sobriety together which do great honor to Mr. Anson 's powers of observation . He has caught the vulgar side of his dealer in " samples " so well that for the actor 's sake we could not wish the former less vulgar . We have reached our limits , and we have left a great many things unsaid and a great many names unnoted . We have pretended only to mention the actors of the moment ; we have no space even for immediate retrospect . We have omitted , for instance , to say anything of Mr. Toole , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an establishment of frivolous traditions , known as the " Folly . " Mr. Toole is a rich and elaborate comedian , whom we remember seeing and enjoying in all his parts when he visited the United States some years ago ; but in London , we must confess , he does not interest us so much as he did in America . This is partly , we suspect , because much of the quality that we enjoyed in him , the savor of the soil , the cockney humor , was generic , as we may say , and not individual . In London this quality is in the air ; every one , in certain classes , has a little of it ; so that it becomes commonplace and ceases to be picturesque . Moreover Mr. Toole sometimes nods , and when he does , it is portentous . No less an adjective than this will express the lugubrious quality of his unsuccessful attempt to produce a great comic effect in Mr. Byron 's dreary little drama entitled " A Fool and his Money . " The source of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actor and author alike , converts itself into a fountain of tears ,  --  tears of humility for our common liability to err . Though we have not said it hitherto , we must here say a good word for Mr. Charles Warner , who for unnumbered months distinguished himself as the Anglicized hero of the dramatization of Emile Zola 's " Assommoir , " which Mr. Charles Reade did into English ( under the name of " Drink " ) for the Princess 's . Mr. Warner 's Coupeau is one of the best pieces of acting seen in London for many a day ; it revealed , as the French say , the actor , who , though he had played much , had never played half so well . His coupeau was an inspiration . We know not whether Mr. Edward Terry , who is the comic gentleman at the Gaiety , ever has inspirations , but it would be a happy one for him that should lead him to escape from the baleful circle of the punning farces and burlesques of Messrs . Byron and Burnand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and strikes us as having a comic vein that might be worked much more profitably than we see it worked in " Little Doctor Faust " and " Robbing Roy . " The same may be said of his comrade , Miss // Nelly Farren , whom we ought to have included in our group of noticeable actresses . Many knowing critics in London will tell you that Miss Farren is a great actress , and that if she only had a chance her genius would kindle a blaze . This may be ; but meanwhile the chance is wanting . We have seen Miss Farren in two or three parts in which she gave a glimpse of original comic power ; but these bright moments were swallowed up in the inanities and vulgarities of the comic drama , as practiced by the indefatigable punsters we have mentioned . Both she and Mr. Terry appear to be sacrificed to that infantile conception of dramatic entertainment which is the only contribution of the English imagination of the day to the literature of the theater . POSTScRIPT. - LONDON , November , i8So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurred to falsify the various judgments they contain . Very little , indeed , has occurred in any way - the months of August , September , and October being usually a period of theatrical repose and sterility . At the present writing , however , most of the play-houses are open , and the winter season may be said to have begun . The writer may add that if he was warranted a few months since in deploring the destitution of the English stage ,  --   - -  its want of plays , of authors , of resources ,  --  he is to-day even more justified by the facts . Mr. Irving , desiring to open his winter brilliantly at the Lyceum , can invent nothing better than a revival of that hackneyed and preposterous drama , " The Corsican Brothers "  --  a piece of which the principal feature is a gentleman of supernatural antecedents , in a blood-stained shirt , moving obliquely along a groove in the stage , under a shower of electric light . " The Corsican Brothers " is brilliantly mounted , with that perfection of detail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ default of more pertinent triumphs , is the great achievement of the contemporary stage . It contains a little of everything except acting . Mr. Irving 's proceedings in the first act of this drama , and especially the manner in which he delivers himself of the long explanatory narrative put into the mouth of the hero , are of a nature to cause a fiendish satisfaction on the part of such critics as may hitherto have ventured to judge him severely . An incident which points in exactly the same direction as this extremely successful , but none the less significant , enterprise at the Lyceum is the production ( unattended in this case with great success ) of " William and Susan " at the St. James 's . " William and Susan " is an arrangement of " Black-eyed Susan . " Douglas Jerrold 's first two acts have been rewritten and provided with scenery as trim and tidy as a Dutch picture-Mr . Wills being the author charged with the delicate task of pouring the old wine into new bottles . Mr. Wills has made a flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charming and touching acting of Mrs. Kendal has failed to infuse the vital spark . Mrs. Kendal is natural and delightful ; she has the art of representing goodness and yet redeeming it from insipidity . Mr. Kendal , who plays the hightoned and unfortunate tar , is a graceful and gentlemanly actor , but he is not another T. P. Cooke . He has not the breadth and body the part requires . The play , as it now stands , is of about the intellectual substance of a nursery-rhyme . The mise en sc ? ne is as usual delightful . By far the most agreeable theatrical event that has lately taken place in London is the highly successful appearance of Madame Modjeska , who is so well known and generally appreciated in America . This charming and touching actress has hitherto appeared but in two parts ; but in these parts she has given evidence of a remarkably delicate and cultivated talent . There are actresses in London whose proceedings upon the stage are absolute horse-play by the side of the quiet felicities of Madame Modjeska . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which the situation of the heroine is enveloped in the most bewildering and mystifying pruderies of allusion ) permitted Madame Modjeska to achieve a success which was not assisted by any element of the real or the reasonable in the character represented . But she has lately been playing a business-like version of Schiller 's " Mary Stuart , " and in this case has shown herself able to handle with brilliancy a part of greater solidity . She is a very exquisite and pathetic Queen of Scots . Madame Modjeska is the attraction of the hour ; but it only points the moral of these desultory remarks that the principal ornament of the English stage just now should be a Polish actress performing in a German play .
