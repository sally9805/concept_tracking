txt Notwithstanding the iteration of ' the cry that the available public lands arc all occupied , the work of selecting and improving this species of landed property appears to continue . Indeed , the report of the Commissioner of the General Land Office shows that there has been not only an increased demand for tillable land , but that the area actually occupied was greater during the last fiscal year than during the like period immediately previous . This increase represents 3,415,769.35 acres as compared with the amount taken in 1881 . The amount of money received by the General Land Office from all sources in connection with the disposal of public lances , during the year , was $7,759,898 , and from the sales of Indian lands $634,617 , the total receipts showing an increase of $2,985,711 over those of the previous year . It may be said , in passing , that the disposal of large tracts of lands heretofore occupied as Indian reservations has much to do with this augmentation of sales and consequent receipts . These figures represent not only a vast area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they suggest the rapid filling up of portions of the national domain heretofore esteemed to be of small value . The periodical complaint of the exhaustion of the supply of arable land suitable for agricultural purposes is largely founded upon a misconception of the actual capabilities of the soil yet unoccupied . Elaborate treatises have been written to show how irrigation and other artificial means may be invoked for the purpose of making tillable land out of arid and naked plains . Assuming that no more soil worthy of the occupation and toil of the farmer or the grazier can be bought of the Government , theorists have endeavored to invent devices to make two blades of grass grow where none grew before . Nevertheless , the tide of emigration into the West has not been stayed for a single day by any discouraging reports of the aridity of the lands open to preemptors and buyers or by the frequent proclamation of the alleged fact that all the public lands are in the hands of speculators . The official figures show a steady increase in the number of actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nevertheless , is the " locking up , " so to speak , of large bodies of lauds owned by railroad corporations . For example , the Union Pacific Railroad Company has the right to claim and received patents for about 12,000.000 acres . The Central Pacific Railroad Company 's grant is estimated to comprise about 8,000,000 acres . But these rich corporations , instead of leveloping the resources of the country by opening their lands to settlement and thereby encouraging the multiplication of towns and villages , hoard the donations made to them by a paternal Government , and allow enormous areas of tillable land to lie idle . They propose to wait until these acres are more valuable than now , and to sell them only in driblets and small parcels , trusting to the . future scarcity to enhance the prices of their long sequestered real estate . The corporations , indeed , even decline to be at the expense of surveying the lands which they claim . Thus it comes to pass that the Union Pacific people have 10,000,000 acres and the Central Pacific 7,000,000 acres of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but for which no patents have been issued , and on which no taxes are paid . When we consider that these large bodies of land are out of the reach of settlers , and that they are made by their greedy owners the basis of a system of bonds and mortgages , and that . they are likely to be locked up for an indefinite period , it is natural that Congress should be censured for refusing or neglecting to take any steps for the rectification of this injustice . The Supreme Court , however , has decided that the failure to complete a land grant railroad within the time fixed in the grant does not forfeit the lands promised ; and this decision continues the practical prohibition of attempts to restoro such lands to the market . And in the case of a railroad company which refuses to complete the formal transfer of the lands claimed , where the road is completed , the solution of the difficulty is yet more difficult . Congress may declare forfeited lands held by companies that have not built their roads , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and means to compel the rich corporations to take the lands lawfully belonging to them and to pay their taxes like other land-holders , or to give up their enormous claims .
