txt Graceful , handsome , and popular Henry E. Dixey , familiarly known to every theatregoer as Adonis Dixey , bad a busy and a jolly day yesterday and a hilarious night last - night among his hosts of friends . It was not because he was more popular yesterday than on any other day , nor that he was more graceful and handsome . That would not be possible . It was because ho last night was to play and did play Adonis for the five hundredth consecutive time . No other actor has played one character so many times in succession . The fact that Dixey was 27 years old on Wednesday , and the wonderful theatrical success the young comedian has achieved since he first came into public notice as the hind legs of the Evangeline heifer , were deemed facts worthy of commemoration by his friends , even if they were a day late of the birthday business . So they showered favors on Dixey as tokens of their appreciation , and he will fairly groan when he retires this morning under the weight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . Dixey was torn from the bosom of his fitmily early yesterday . He breakfasted late , but he breakfasted well , for it was at Delmonico 's at 1 o'clock yesterday afternoon that he sat down , and he did not finish his meal until 4:30 O'clock . Those who helped him eat the meal and who kept the private dining room in a roar were Edward E. Rice , his manager , John Mackay , and George Thorne , the comedians : Joseph Haworth , the tragedian , and Amos J. Cummings , Anson Pond , Dr. C. M. Richmond , Blakoley Hall , Loander Richardson , Walter Price , and J. F. Harley . The fund of stories , jokes ? " chestnuts " and originals  --  songs and general hilarity was such a one as has not disturbed Delmonioo 's walls for many years , if ever , and Dixey made every one feel good by laughing conscientiously- and enthusiastically at everything that was said or done . He got relief from continual laughter only by reason of the fact that the Bijou Opera House orchestra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon playing between the deluge of bright things that were said and done . His tact made every one think he was a very jolly fellow . His friends generally  --  the public  --  that is the small portion of them that could ho crowded into the little Bijou Opera House , gave him a reception , and paid anywhere from $2 to $5 for the privilege of doing so . No one growled over that fact , for Dixey was at his best and there were at the evening performance innovations suoh as one rarely sees . When the curtains were rst drawn to reveal the marble Adonis tiieapp auso wasdeafeninir , and so hearty and long-continued as to give the statue signs of life long before the time came for him to be transformed into a living " masher " in white tights . And the first outbreak was but one of a score or more in which cheering mingled with handclapping . It was a perfect racket when , to the tune of " It 's English , You Know , " Dixey added a new verse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made him their debtor , he declared , I 'll stay , If you want me , 500 nights more . " And many in the audience vigorously announced that he was wanted . To this he replied in verse that he would see them again in 1892 . While Dixey , as the chevalier , was first exercising his powers as a fascinator on the antique but susceptible Dutchess , his suit was interrupted by the sudden appearance of John illackay , who , in the character of Le Blanc , extended congratulations and disappeared from sight before Dixey could catch his breath . He was surprised a second time , when vigorously pressing his suit with the village maiden , by George Thorne , who in the resplendent dress of Ko-Ko had dropped iu from the Fifth-Avenue Theatre to remark : " Eris Imperial Highness the Mikado of Japan has instructed me to tell you that ho has ordered me not to put you on my list , because you would be sadly missed . " The audience cheered , and the gorgeous Japanese costume disappeared in the wings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilson , of the Casino company , who , in his grotesque costume as Castrucci , jumped in . and embraced the impersonator of Henry Irving and remarked : " I bring you congratulations from the Casino company , wish you many happy returns of the day , and new must rush to get my carriage , " and ho disappeared . At the conclusion of the first act Amos J. Cummings in full dress , appeared on the stage in the midst of the glittering costumes , and simultaneously there appeared a huge heifer of pink and white carnations , a magnificent floral easel 7 feet in height , and a host of other floral pieces inscribed : " Adonis , 500 . " The heifer bore a card : " Evaugeline Rice to Adonis Dixey . " ThesoQMr . Cumaiugs , in behalf of their donors , presented , as he also dig a forinal message of greeting from the New-York Press Ciub , Throwing aside his hugo silken badge , which indicated that he was " going to the ball this evening , " he then presented , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an American Indian , the work of Theodore Baur . The feast was a handsome one , the presentation sneech was appropriate and witty , Mr. Cummings characterizing him as an American actor who , in an American play by an American author , bad kicked his way into the hearts of the American public , and an actor who had thrown wit , humor , comedy , and graceful motion Into the crucible of public opinion , and had proved to be pure geld . Then the audience cheered , Mr. Dixie returned thanks very briefly , and , after the members of the company had recovered from their merriment at his embarrassment , they entered most hilariously into the finale of the act . There were more floral presentations in the second act , and new jokes and new music all through the presentation . When the audience left the theatre , each lady carried a handsome souvenir containing three of Dixey 's portraits , and a chuck which will to-morrow entitle them to a statuette of the favorite actor .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
