THE NEW ASTRONOMY . IV . THE PLANETS AND THE MOON . WHEN we look up at the heavens , we see , if we watch through the night , the host of stars rising in the east and passing above us to sink in the west , always at the same distance and in unchanging order , each seeming a point of light as feeble as the glo*v-worm s shine in the meadow over which they are rising , each flickering as though the evening wind would blow it out . The infant stretches out its hand to grasp the Pleiades , but when the child has become an old man the " seven stars " are still there unchanged , dim only in his aged sight , and proving themselves the enduring substance , while it is his own life which has gone , as the shine of the , glow-worm in the night . They were there just the same a hundred generations ago , before the Pyramids were built , and they will tremble there still when the Pyramids have been worn down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granite sides . They watched the earth grow fit for man , long before man came , and they will doubtless be shining on when our poor human race itself has disappeared from the surface of this planet . Probably there is no one of us who has not felt this solemn sense of their almost infinite duration as compared with his own little portion of time , and it would be a worthy subject for our thought if we could study them in the light that the new astronomy sheds for us on their nature . But I must here confine myself to the description of ut a few of their number , and speak , not of'the infinite multitude and variety // of stars , each a self-shining sun , but only of those which move close at hand ; for it is not true of quite all that they keep at the same distance and order . Of the whole celestial army which the naked eye watches , there are five stars which do change their places in the ranks , and these change in an irregular and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward and now back , as if lost and wandering through the sky . These wanderers were long since known by distinct names , as Mercury , Venus , Mars , Jupiter , and Saturn , and believed to be nearer than the others ; and they are , in fact , companions to the earth and fed like it by the warmth of our sun , and like the moon are visible by the sunlight which they reflect to us . With the earliest use of the telescope , it was found that while the other stars remained in it mere points of light as before , these became magnified into disks on which markings were visible , and the markings have been found with our modern instruments , in one case at least , to take the appearance of oceans and snow-capped continents and islands . These , then , are not uninhabitable self-shining suns , but worlds , vivified from the same fount of VOL . XXIX. - 68. energy that supplies us , and the possible abode of creatures like ourselves . " Properly speaking , " it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest to man " ; and if we have cared to study the uninhabitable sun because all that goes on there is found to be so intimately related to us , it is surely a reasonable curiosity which prompts the question so often heard as to the presence of life on these neighbor worlds , where it seems at least not impossible that life should exist . Even the very little we can say in answer to this question will always be interesting , but we must regretfully admit at the outset that it is but little , and that with some planets , like Mercury and Venus , the great telescopes of modern times can not do much more than those of Galileo , with which our new astronomy had its beginning . Let us leave these , then , and pass out to the confines of the planetary system , where we may employ our telescopes to better advantage . The outer planets , Neptune and Uranus , remain pale disks in the most powerful instruments , the first attended by a single moon , the second by four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet known about their physical features , that we shall do better to give our FIG. 1. - SATURN . ( FROM A DRAWING BY TROUVRLOT , BY PERMISSION OF CHARLRS SCRIBNRR 'S SONS. ) // attention to one of the most interesting objects in the whole heavens - the planet Saturn , on which we can at any rate see enough to arouse a lively curiosity to know more . When Galileo first turned his glass on Saturn , he saw , as he thought , that it consisted of three spheres close together , the middle one being the largest . He was not quite sure of the fact , and was in a dilemma between his desire to wait longer for further observation , and his fear that some other observer might announce the discovery if he hesitated . To combine these incompatiblesto announce it so as to secure the priority , and yet not announce it till he was ready - might seem to present as great a difficulty as the discovery itself ; but Galileo solved this , as we may remember , by writing it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have observed the highest planet to be triple " ) , and then throwing it ( in the printer 's phrase ) " into pi , " or jumbling the letters , which made the sentence into the monstrous word SMAJ5M **31;981;TOOLONG , and publishing this , which contained his discovery , but under lock and key . He had rea son to congratulate himself on his prudence , for within two years two of the supposed bodies disappeared , leaving only one . This was in 1612 , and for nearly fifty years Saturn continued to all astronomers the enigma which it was to Galileo , till in 1656 it was finally made clear that it was surrounded by a thin flat ring , which when seen fully gave rise to the first appearance in Galileo 's small telescope , and when seen edgewise disappeared from its view altogether . Everything in this part of our work depends on the power of the telescope we employ , and in describing the modern means of observation we pass over two centuries of slow advance , each decade of which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its completest types , in the great equatorial at Washington , shown in Fig. 2 . The revolving dome above , the great tube beneath , its massive piers , and all its accessories are only means to carry and direct the great lens at the further end , which acts the part of the lens in our own eye , and forms the image of the thing to be looked at . Galileo 's original lens was a single piece of glass , rather smaller than that of our common spectacles ; but the lens here is composed of two pieces , each twenty-six inches in diameter , and collects as much light as a human eye would do if over two feet across . But this is useless if the lens is not shaped with such precision as to send every ray to its proper place at the eyepiece , nearly thirty-five feet away ; and , in fact , the shape given its surface by the skillful hands of the Messrs . Clark , who made it , is so exquisitely exact that all the light of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distant focus into a circle very much smaller than that made by the dot on this I , - a thing we might call incredible were it not certain . It is with instruments of such accuracy that astronomy now works , and it is with this particular one that some of the observations we are going to describe have been made . In all the heavens there is no more wonderful object than Saturn , for it preserves to us an apparent type of the plan on which all the worlds were originally made . Let us look at it in this study by Trouvelot ( Fig. r ) . The planet , we must remember , is a globe nearly seventy thousand miles in diameter , and the outermost ring is over one hundred and fifty thousand miles across , so that the FIG. 2. - THE EQUATORIAL TELESCOPE AT WASHINGTON . // proportionate size of our earth would be overrepresented here by a pea laid on the engraving . The belts on the globe show delicate tints of brown and blue , and parts of the ring are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hut this ring , as the reader may see , consists of at least three main divisions , each itself containing separate features . First is the gray outer ring , then the middle one , and next the curious " crape " ring , very much darker than the others , looking like a belt where it crosses the planet , and apparently feebly transparent , for the outline of the globe has been seen ( though not very distinctly ) f/i rough it . The whole system of rings is of the most amazing thinness , for it is probably thinner in proportion to its size than the paper on which this is printed is to the width of the page ; and when it is turned edgewise to us , it disappears to all but the most powerful telescopes , in which it looks then like the thinnest conceivable line of light , on which the moons have been seen projected , appearing like beads sliding along a golden wire . The globe of the planet casts on the ring a shadow , which is here shown as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rings were suddenly disturbed . At other times ( as in a beautiful drawing made with the same instrument by Professor Holden ) the line seems continuous , though curved as though the middle of the ring system were thicker than the edge . The rotation of the ring has been made out by direct observations ; and the whole is in motion about the globe ,  --  a motion so smooth and steady that there is no flickering in the shadow " where Saturn 's steadfast shade sleeps on its luminous ring . " What is it ? No solid could hold together under such conditions ; we can hardly admit the possibility of its being a liquid film extended in space ; and there are difficulties in admitting it to be gaseous . But if not a solid , a liquid , or a gas , again what can it be ? It was suggested nearly two centuries ago that the ring might be composed of innumerable little bodies like meteorites , circling round FIG. 3. - JUPITER , MOON AND SHADOW . ( BY PERMISSION OF WARREN DE LA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . qwq shows us a little circle of an almost lemonyellow , but the effect of contrast grows less as it approaches the center . Next ( or sometimes before ) the disk is invaded by a small and intensely black spot , the shadow of the moon , which slides across the planet 's face , the transit lasting long enough for us to see that the whole great globe , serving as a background for the spectacle , has visibly revolved on its axis since we began to gaze . Photography , in the skillful hands of the late Professor Henry Draper , gave us reason to suspect the possibility that a dull light is sent to us from parts of the planet 's surface besides what it reflects , as though it were still feebly glowing like a nearly extinguished sun ; and , on the whole , a main interest of these features to us lies in the presumption they create that the giant planet is not yet fit to be the abode of life , but is more probably in a condition like that of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remote that geology only infers its existence , and long before our own race began to be . That science teaches that such all but infinite periods are needed to prepare a planet for man 's abode , that the entire duration of his race upon it is probably brief in comparison . WE pass by the belt of asteroids , and over a distance many times greater than that which separates the earth from the sun , till we approach our own world . Here , close beside it as it were , in comparison with the enormous spaces which intervene between it and Saturn and Jupiter , we find a planet whose size and features are in striking contrast to those of the great globe we have just quitted . It is Mars , which shines so red and looks so large in the sky because it is so near , but whose diameter is only about half that of our earth . This is indeed properly to be called a neighbor world , but the planetary spaces are so immense that this neighbor is at closest still about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we see in our engraving ( Fig. 4 ) - where we have three successive views taken at intervals of a few hours - a globe not marked by the belts of Jupiter or Saturn , but with outlines as of continents and islands , which pass in turn before our eyes as it revolves in a little over twenty-four and a half of our hours , while at either pole is a white spot . Sir William Herschel was the first to notice that this spot increased in size when it was turned away from the sun and diminished when the solar heat fell on it , so that we have what is almost proof that here is ice ( and consequently water ) on another world . Then , as we study more , we discern forms which VOL . XXIX. - 69. 705 move from day to day on the globe apart from its rotation , and we recognize in them clouds sweeping over the surface - not a surface of still other clouds below , but of what we have good reason tobelieve to be land and water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity when Mars comes near , so many of these features have been gathered that we have been enabled to make fairly complete maps of the planet , one of which by Mr. Green is here given ( Fig. * ) . Here we see the surface more diversified than that of our earth , while the oceans are long , narrow , canal-like seas , which everywhere invade the land , so that on Mars one could travel almost everywhere by water . The spectroscope indicates water-vapor in the Martial atmosphere , and some of the continents , like " Lockyer Land , " are sometimes seen white , as though covered with ice ; while one island ( marked on our map as Hall Island ) has been seen so frequently thus that it is very probable that here some mountain or table-land rises into the region of perpetual snow . The cause of the red color of Mars has never been satisfactorily ascertained . Its atmosphere does not appear to be dark enough to produce such an effect , and perhaps as probable an explanation as any is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first . It is that vegetation on Mars may be red instead of green ! There is no intrinsic improbability in the idea , for we are even to-day unprepared to say with any certainty why vegetation is green here , and it is quite easy to conceive of atmospheric conditions which would make red the best absorber of the solar heat . Here , then , we find a planet on which we obtain many of the conditions of life which we know ourselves , and here , if anywhere in the system , we may allowably inquire for evidence of the presence of something like our own race ; but though we may indulge in supposition , there is unfortunately no prospect that with any conceivable improvement in our telescopes we shall ever obtain anything like certainty . We can not assert that there are any bounds to man 's invention , or that science may not , by some means as unknown to us as the spectroscope was to our grandfathers , achieve what now seems impossible ; but to our present knowledge no such means exist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planet with the feeling that it may hold possibilities more interesting to our humanity than all the wonders of the sun , and all the uninhabitable immensities of his other worlds . Before we leave Mars , we may recall to the reader 's memory the extraordinary verifi // cation of a statement made about it more than a hundred years ago . We shall have for a moment to leave the paths of science for those of pure fiction , for the words we are going to quote are those of no less a person than our old friend Captain Gulliver , who , after his adventures with the Lilliputians , went to a flying island inhabited largely by astronomers . If the reader will take down his copy of Swift , he will find in this voyage of Gulliver 's to Laputa the following imaginary description of what its imaginary astronomers saw : " They have likewise discovered two lesser stars or satellites which revolve about Mars , whereof the innermost is distant from the center of the primary planet exactly three of its diameters , and the outermost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours , and the latter in twenty-one and a half . " Now compare this passage , which was published in the year 1727 , with the announcement in the scientific journals of August , 1877 ( a hundred and fifty years after ) , that two moons did exist , and had just been discovered by Professor Hall , of Washington , with the great telescope of which a drawing has been already given . The resemblance does not end even here , for Swift was right also in describing them as very near the planet and with very short periods , the actual distances being about one and a half and seven diameters , and the actual times about eight and thirty hours respectively , distances and periodswhich , if not exactly those of Swift 's description , agree with it in being less tha*i any before known in the solar system . It is certain that there could not have been the smallest ground for a suspicion of their existence when " Gulliver 's Travels " was written , and the coincidence - which is a pure coincidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then , properly speak of " the snowy poles of moonless Mars , " though it does still remain moonless to all but the most powerful telescopes in the world , for these bodies are the very smallest known in the system . They present no visible disks to measure , but look like the faintest of points of light , and their size is only to be guessed at from their brightness . Professor Pickering has carried on an interesting investigation of them . His method depended in part on getting holes of such smallness made in a plate of metal that the light coming through them would be comparable with that of the Martial moons in the telescope . It was found almost impossible to command the skill to make these holes small enough , though one of the artists employed had already distinguished himself by drilling a hole through a fine cambric needle lengthwise , so as to make a tiny steel tube of it . When the difficulty was at last overcome , the satellites were found to be less than ten miles in diameter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light may be gathered from the statement that either roughly corresponds to that which would be given by a human hand held up at Washington , and viewed from Boston , Massachusetts , a distance of four hundred miles . WE approach now the only planet in which man is certainly known to exist , and which ought to have an interest for us superior to any which we have yet seen , for it is our own . We are voyagers on it through space , it has been said , as passengers on a ship , and many of us have never thought of any part of the vessel but the cabin where we are quartered . Some curious passengers ( and these are the geographers ) have visited the steerage , and some have looked into the hold , and yet it remains true that those in one part of our vessel know little , even now , of their fellow-voyagers in another . How much less , then , do most of us know of the ship itself for we were all born on it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outside . No world comes so near us in the aerial ocean as the moon ; and if we desire to view our own earth as a planet , we may put ourselves in imagination in the place of a lunar observer . " Is it inhabited ? " would probably be one of the first questions which he would ask , if he had the same interest in us that we have in him ; and the answer to this would call out all the powers of the best telescopes such as we possess . An old author , Fontenelle , has given us a lively picture of what might be visible in twenty-four hours if we could look down on the earth as it turned round beneath us . " I see passing under my eyes , " he says , " all sorts of faces : white and black and olive and brown . Now it 's hats and now turbans , now long locks and then shaven crowns ; now come cities with steeples , next more with tall , crescent-capped minarets , then others with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oceans , then dreadful deserts ,  --  in short , all the infinite variety the earth 's surface bears . " The truth is , however , that , looking at the earth from the moon , the largest moving animal , the whale or the elephant , would be utterly beyond our ken ; and it is questionable whether the largest ship on the ocean would be visible , for the popular idea as to the magnifying power of great telescopes is exaggerated . It is probable that under any but extraordinary circumstances our lunar observer // with our best telescopes could not bring the earth within less than an apparent distance of five hundred miles ; and the reader may judge how large a moving object must be to be seen , much less recognized , by the naked eye at such a distance . Of course , a chief interest of the supposition we are making lies in the fact that it will give us a measure of our own ability to discover evidences of life in the moon , if there are any such as exist here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while to repeat that scarcely any temporary phenomenon due to human action could be visible from the moon under the most favoring circumstances . An army such as Napoleon led to Russia might conceivably be visible if it moved in a dark solid column across the snow . It is barely possible that such a vessel as one of the largest ocean steamships might be seen , under very favorable circumstances , as a moving dot ; and it is even quite probable that such a conflagration as the great fire of Chicago would be visible in the lunar telescope , as something like a reddish star on the night side of our planet ; but this is all in this sort that could be discerned . By making minute maps , or , still better , photographs , and comparing one year with another , much however might have been done by our lunar observer during this century . In its beginning , in comparison to the vast forests which then covered the North American continent , the cultivated fields along its eastern seaboard would have looked to him like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but now he would see that the golden fringe has pushed aside the green farther back than the Mississippi , and would gather his best evidence from the fact ( surely a noteworthy one ) that man , as represented by the people of the United States , has changed one of the features of his world during the present century to a degree visible in another planet ! Our observer would probably be struck by the moving panorama of forests , lakes , continents , islands , and oceans , successively gliding through the field of view of his telescope as the earth revolved ; but , traveling along beside it on his lunar station , he would hardly appreciate its actual flight through space , which is an easy thing to describe in figures , and a hard one to conceive . If we look up at the clock , and as we watch the pendulum recall that we have moved about nineteen miles at every beat , or in less than three minutes over a distance greater than that which divides New York from Liverpool , we still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all metaphor ) the earth is really a great projectile , heavier than the heaviest of 707 her surface rocks , and traversing space with a velocity of over sixty times that of the cannonball . Even the firing of a great gun with a ball weighing one or two hundred pounds is , to the novice at least , a striking spectacle . The massive iron sphere is hoisted into the gun , the discharge comes , the ground trembles , and , as it seems , almost in the same instant , a jet rises where the ball has just touched the water far away . The impression of immense velocity and of a resistless capacity of destruction in that flying mass is irresistible , and justifiable too ; but what is this ball to that of the earth , which is a globe counting eight thousand miles in diameter , and weighing about six thousand millions of millions of millions of tons , which , if our cannon-ball were flying ahead a mile in advance of its track , would overtake it in less than the tenth part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of latent destruction and death in this motion , that if it were possible to instantly arrest it , then , in that instant , " earth and all which it inherits would dissolve " and pass away in vapor ? Our turning sphere is moving through what seems to be all but an infinite void , peopled only by wandering meteorites , and where warmth from any other source than the sun can scarcely be said to exist ; for it is important to observe that , whether the interior be molten or not , we get next to no heat from it . The cold of outer space can only be estimated in view of recent observations as at least four hundred degrees Fahrenheit below zero ( mercury freezes at thirty-nine degrees below ) , and it is the sun which makes up the difference of all these lacking hundreds of degrees to us , but indirectly , and not in the way that we might naturally think , and have till very lately thought ; for our atmosphere has a great deal more to do with it than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than go out , until the temperature rises very much higher than it would were there no air here . The writer 's own experiments lead him to believe that the direct solar rays would never raise the temperature of the planet 's surface , if that be entirely airless ( even at the equator under the vertical beams of a tropic sun ) , to zero . Thus , since it is this power in the atmosphere of storing the heat which makes us live , no less than the sun 's rays themselves , we see how the temperature of a planet may depend on considerations quite beside its distance from the sun ; and when we discuss the possibility of life in other worlds , , we shall do well to remember that Saturn may be possibly a warm world , and Mercury conceivably a cold one . // We used to be told that this atmosphere extended forty-five miles above us , but later observation proves its existence at a height of many times this ; and a remarkable speculation , which Doctor Hunt strengthens with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ever-increasing tenuity until it touches and merges in the atmosphere of other worlds . But if we begin to talk of things new and old which interest us in our earth as a planet , it is hard to make an end . Still we may observe that it is the very familiarity of some of these which hinders us from seeing them as the wonders they really are . How has this familiarity , for instance , made commonplace to us not only the wonderful fact that the fields and forests , and the apparently endless plain of earth and ocean , are really parts of a great globe which is turning round ( for this daily rotation we all are familiar with ) , but the less appreciated miracle that we are all being hurled through space with an immensely greater speed than that of the rotation itself . It needs the vision of a poet to see this daily miracle with new eyes , and a great poet has described it for us , in words which may vivify our scientific conception . Let us recall the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ praising the works of the Lord , and looking at the earth , not as we see it , but down on it , from heaven , as it passes by , and notice that it is precisely this miraculous swiftness , so insensible to us , which calls out an angel 's wonder . " And swift and swift beyond conceiving The splendor of the world goes round , Day 's Eden-brightness still relieving The awful Night 's intense profound . The ocean tides in foam are breaking , Against the rocks ' deep bases hurled , And both , the spheric race partaking , Eternal , swift , are onward whirled . " So , indeed , might an angel see it and describe it ! We may have been already led to infer that there is a kind of evolution in the planets ' life , which we may compare , by a not wholly fanciful analogy , to ours ; for we have seen worlds growing into conditions which may fit them for habitability , and again other worlds where we may surmise , or may know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least one which has completed the analogy , by passing beyond this term to that where all life has ceased , we need only look on the moon . THE study of the moon 's surface has been continued now from the time of Galileo , and of late years a whole class of competent ob servers has been devoted to it , so that astronomers engaged in other branches have oftener looked on this as a field for occasional hours of recreation with the telescope than made it a constant study . I can recall one or two such hours in earlier observing days , when , seated alone under the overarching iron dome , the world below shut out , and the world above opened , the silence disturbed by no sound but the beating of the equatorial clock , and the great telescope itself directed to some hill or valley of the moon , I have been so lost in gazing that it seemed as though a look through this , the real magic tube , had indeed transported me to the surface of that strange alien world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others with more time to devote to it and more ability to render it , so that we not only have most elaborate maps of the moon for the professional astronomer , but abundance of paintings , drawings , and models , which reproduce the appearance of its surface as seen in powerful telescopes . None of the latter class deserves more attention than the beautiful studies of Messrs . Nasmyth and Carpenter , who prepared at great labor very elaborate and , in general , very faithful models of parts of its surface , and then had them photographed under the same illumination which fell on the original ; and I wish to acknowledge here the special indebtedness of this part of what I have to lay before the reader to their work , from which the following illustrations are chiefly taken . Let us remember that the moon is a little over twenty-one hundred miles in diameter ; that it weighs , bulk for bulk , about two-thirds what the earth does , so that , in consequence of this and its smaller size , its total weight is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , the force of gravity at its surface being only one-sixth what it is here , eruptive explosions can send their products higher than in our volcanoes . Its area is between four and five times that of the United States , and its average distance is a little less than two hundred and forty thousand miles . This is very little in comparison with the great spaces we have been traversing in imagination ; but it is absolutely very large , and across it the valleys and mountains of this our nearest neighbor disappear and present to the naked eye only the vague lights and shades known to us from childhood as " the man in the moon , " and which were the puzzle of the ancient philosophers , who often explained them as reflections of the earth itself , sent back to us from the moon as from a mirror . * Bayard Taylor 's translation . // 709 qwq qwq // the briefest reference to the principal features . The most prominent of these is the great crater " Plato , " which lies in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reader an idea of the scale of things to state that the diameter of its ring is about seventy miles , so that he will readily understand that the mountains surrounding it may average five to six thousand feet in height , as they do . The sun is shining from the left , and , being low , casts long shadows , so that the real forms of the mountains on one side are beautifully indicated by these shadows , where they fall on the floor of the crater . In the lower part of the mountain wall there has been a landslide , as we see by the fragments that have rolled down into the plain , and of which a trace can be observed in our engraving . The whole is quite unlike most terrestrial craters , however , not only in its enormous size , but in its proportions ; for the floor is not precipitous , 7 " but flat , or partaking of the general curvature of the lunar surface , which it sinks but little below . I have watched with interest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not shown in our cut ; for here some have suspected evidences of change , and fancied a faint greenish tint , as if due to vegetation , but it is probably fancy only . Notice the number of small craters around the big one , and everywhere on the plate , and then look at the amazingly rugged and tumbled mountain heaps on the left ( the lunar Alps ) , cut directly through by a great valley ( the valley of the Alps ) , which is at the bottom about six miles wide and extraordinarily flat - flatter and smoother even than our engraving shows it , and looking as though a great engineering work , rather than an operation of nature , were in question . Above this the mountain shadows are cast upon a wide plain , in which are both depressed pits with little FIG. 9. - PLATO AND THE LUNAR ALPS . // FIG . In. - THE LUNAR APENNINES : ARCHIMEDES . From " The Moon , " by Nasmyth and Carpenter . London : John Murray . By permission. mountain ( or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one of which , Pico ( above the great crater ) , starts up abruptly to the height of eight thousand feet , a lunar Matterhorn . If Mars were as near as the moon , we should see with the naked eye clouds passing over its face ; and that we never do see these on the moon , even with the telescope , is itself a proof that none exist there . Now , this absence of clouds , or indeed of any evidence of moisture , is confirmed by every one of the nearer views like those we are here getting . We might return to this region with the telescope every month of our lives without finding one indication of vapor , of moisture , or even of air ; and from a summit like Pico , could we ascend it , we should look out on a // scene of such absolute desolation as probably no earthly view could parallel . If , as is conceivable , these plains were once covered with verdure , and the abode of living creatures , verdure and life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the silence of universal death . But we must leave it for another scene . South of Plato extends for many hundred miles a great plain , which from its smoothness was thought by the ancient observers to be water , and was named by them the " Imbrian Sea , " and this is bounded on the south and west by a range of mountains - the " lunar Apennines " ( Fig. io ) - which are the most striking on oar satellite . They are visible even with a spy-glass , looking then like bread-crumbs ranged upon a cloth , while with a greater power they grow larger and at the same time more chaotic . As we ap proach nearer , we see that they rise with a comparatively gradual slope , to fall abruptly , in a chain of precipices that may well be called tremendous , down to the plain below , across which their shadows are cast . Near their bases are some great craters of a somewhat different type from Plato , and our illustration represents an enlarged view of a part of this Apennine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its companions Aristillus and Autolycus . Our engraving will tell , more than any description , of the contrast of the tumbled mountain peaks with the level plain from which they spring , a contrast for which we have scarcely a terrestrial parallel , though the rise of the Alps from the plains of Lombardy may suggest an inadequate one . The Sierra Nevadas of California climb slowly up from the coast side , to descend in great precipices FIG . Il-VESUVIUS AND NEIGHBORHOOD OF NAPLES . // on the east , somewhat like this ; but the country at their feet is irregular and broken , and their highest summits do not equal those before us , which rise to 17,000 or iS , ooo feet , and from one of which we should look out over such a scene of desolation as we can only imperfectly picture to ourselves from any experience of a terrestrial desert . The curvature of the moon 's surface is so much greater than ours , that it would hide the spurs of hills which buttress the southern slopes of Archimedes , leaving only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremest horizon , while between us and them would extend what some still maintain to have been the bed of an ancient lunar ocean , though assuredly no water exists there now . Among the many fanciful theories to ac count for the forms of the ringed plains , one ( and this is from a man of science whose ideas are always original ) invokes the presence of water . According to it , these great plains were once ocean beds , and in them worked a coral insect , building up lunar " atolls " and ringshaped submarine mountains , as the coral polyp does here . The highest summits of the great rings thus formed were then low islands , just axvash " with the waves of the ancient lunar sea , and , for aught we know , green with feathery palms . Then came ( in the supposition in question ) a time when the ocean dried up , and the mountains were left standing , as xve see , in rings , after the cause of their formation was gone . If it be asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very obvious on the old theories ; but those who believe in them point to the extraordinary cracks in the soil , like those our engraving shows , as chasms and rents , by which the vanished seas , and perhaps also the FIG. 12. - PTOLEMY AND ARZACHAEL. // vanished air , have been absorbed into the interior . If there was indeed such an ancient ocean , it would have washed the very feet of the precipices on whose summits we are in imagination standing , and below us their recesses would have formed harbors , which fancy might fill vith commerce , and cities in which we might picture life and movement where all is now dead . It need hardly be said that no telescope has ever revealed their existence ( if such ruins , indeed , there are ) , and it may be added that the opinion of geologists is , as a whole , unfavorable to the presence of water on the moon , even in the past , from the absence of any clear evidence of erosive action ; hut perhaps we are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are not forbidden to believe that water may have existed here in the past by any absolute testimony to the contrary . The views of those who hold the larger portion of the lunar craters to have been vol FIG. 13. - MERCATOR AND CAMPANUS. // canic in their formation are far more probable ; and perhaps as simple an evidence of the presumption in their favor as we can give is directly to compare such a lunar region as this , the picture of which was made for us from a model , with a similar model made from some terrestrial volcanic region . Here ( Fig. i ) is a photograph of such a modeled plan of the country round the Bay of Naples , showing the ancient crater of Vesuvius and its central cone , with other and smaller craters along the sea . Here , of course , we know that the forms originated in volcanic action , and a comparison of them with our moon-drawing is most interesting . To return to our Apennine region ( Fig. io ) , we must admit , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Archimedes is fifty miles in diameter ) , that they are very different in proportion from our terrestrial craters , and that numbers of them present no central cone whatever ; so that if some of them seem clearly eruptive , there are others to which ye have great difficulties in making these volcanic theories apply . Let us look , for instance , at still another region ( Fig. 12 ) . It lies rather above the center of the full moon , and may be recognized also on the Rutherfurd photograph , and it consists of the group of great ring-plains , three of which form prominent figures in our cut . Ptolemy ( the lower of these in the drawing ) is an example of such a plain , whose diameter reaches to about one hundred and fifteen miles , so that it incloses an area of nearly eight thousand square miles ( or about that of the State of Massachusetts ) , within which there is no central cone or point from which eruptive forces appear to have acted , except the smaller craters it incloses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountain wall opening into the neighboring ring-plain of Alphonsus , which is only less in size ; and south of this again is Arzachel , sixty-six miles in diameter , surrounded with terraced walls , rising in one place to a height greater than that of Mont Blanc , while the central cone is far lower . The whole of the region round about , though not the roughest on the moon , is rough and broken in a way beyond any parallel here , and which may speak for itself ; but perhaps the most striking of the many curious features - at least THE NEW ASTRONOMY FIG. 14. - IDEAL LUNAR LANDSCAPE AND EARTH-SHINE. // the only one we can pause to examine-is what is called " The Railway , " an almost perfectly straight line , on one side of which the ground has abruptly sunk , leaving the undisturbed part standing like a wall , and forming a " fault , " as geologists call it . This is the most conspicuous example of its kind in the moon , but it is only one of many evidences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been not wholly unlike our own . But the moon contains , as has been said , but the oneeightieth part of the mass of our globe , and has , therefore , cooled with much greater rapidity , so that it has not only gone through the epochs of our own past time , but has in all probability already undergone experiences which for us lie far in the future ; and it is hardly less than justifiable language to say that we are beholding here in some respects what the face of our world may be when ages have passed away . To see this more clearly , we may consider that in general we find that the early stages VOL . XXJX. - 7i. of cosmical life are characterized by great heat ; a remark of the truth of which the sun itself furnishes the first and most obvious illustration . Then come periods which we appear to have seen exemplified in Jupiter , where the planet is surrounded by volumes of steam-like vapor , through which we may almost believe we recognize the dull glow of not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth passed through before it became the abode of man ; and then the times in which human history begins . But if this process of the gradual loss of heat go on indefinitely , we must yet come to still another era , when the planet has grown too cold to support life , as it was before too hot ; and this condition , in the light of some very recent investigations , it seems probable we have now before us on the moon . We have , it is true , been taught until very lately that the side of the moon turned sunward would grow hotter and hotter in the long lunar day , till it reached a temperature of two hundred to three hundred degrees FIG. 15. - WITHERED HAND AND APPLE . // Fahrenheit , and that in the equally long lunar night it would fall as much as this below zero . But the evidence which was supposed to support this conclusion is not supported by recent experiments ; and if these be trustworthy , certain facts appear to the writer to show that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perpetual sunshine , must be very low indeed ,  --  lower than that of our arctic or antarctic poles ,  --  and this because of the absence of air there to keep the stored sunheat from being radiated away again into space . As we ascend the highest terrestrial mountains , and get partly above our own protecting blanket of air , things do not grow hotter and hotter , but colder and colder ; and it seems contrary to the teachings of common sense to believe that if we could ascend higher yet , where the air ceases altogether , we should not find that it grew colder still . But this last condition ( of airlessness ) is the one which does prevail beyond a doubt in the moon on whose whole surface , then , there must be ( unless there are sources of internal heat of which we know nothing ) conditions of temperature which are an exaggeration of those we experience on the summit of a very lofty mountain , where water freezes under the full rays of a vertical sun ; and we have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solar rays , while we are shivering at the same time in what the thermometershoxvs is an arctic cold . We have heard of this often , but a personal experience so impressed the fact on me that I will relate it for the benefit of the reader , who may wish to realize to himself the actual conditions which probably exist in the airless lunar mountains and plains we are looking at . He can not go there , but he may go if he pleases , as I have done , to the waterless , shadeless desert which stretches at the eastern slope of the Sierra Nevadas ( a chain almost as high and steep as the lunar Apennines ) , and live some part of July and August in this desert , where the thermometer rises occasionally to one hundred and ten degrees in the shade , and his face is tanned till it can tan no more , and he appears to himself to have experienced the utmost in this way that the sun can do . The sky is cloudless , and the air so clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things is lost . The mountains , which rise in tremendous precipices above him , seem like moss-covered rocks close at hand , on the tops of which , here and there , a white cloth has been dropped , but the " moss " is great primeval forests , and the white cloths large isolated snow-fields , tantalizing the dweller in the burning desert with their delusive nearness . XVhen I climbed the mountains , at an altitude of ten thousand feet I already found the coolness delicious , but at the same time ( by the strange effect I have been speaking of ) the skin began to burn , as though the seasoning in the desert counted for nothing at all ; and as the air grew thinner and thinner while I mounted still higher and higher , though the thermometer fell , every part of the person exposed to the solar rays presented the appearance of a recent severe burn from an actual fire ,  --  and a really severe burn it was , as I can testify ,  --  and yet all the while around us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a perpetual winter which made it hard to believe that torrid summer still lay below . The thinner the air , then , the colder it grows , even where we are exposed to the sun , and the lower becomes the reading of the thermometer . Now , by means of suitable apparatus , it was sought by the writer to determine , while at this elevation of fifteen thousand feet , I/ow great the fall of ' temperature would be if the thin air there could he removed altogether ; and the result was that the thermometer would under such circumstances fall , at any rate , below zero in the full sunshine . Of course , all this applies directly to the moon , on whose surface ( if these inferences be correct ) the mercury in the bulb of a thermometer would probably freeze and never melt again during the lunar day ( and still less during the lunar night ) - a conclusion which has been reached through other means by Mr. Ericsson . Other and direct measures of the lunar heat are still in progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to be already indicated : it is that the moon 's surface , even in l ) erpetual sunshine , must be forever under a more than arctic cold - a cold below the freezing-point of mercury , and in which we can not conceive of the existence of man or of organic life . Here ( Fig. 13 ) is one more scene from the almost unlimited field the lunar surface affords . The most prominent things in the landscape before us are two fine craters ( Mercator and Campanus ) , each over thirty miles in diameter ; but we have chosen this scene for remark rather on account of the great crack or rift which is seen in the upper part , and which cuts through plain and mountain for a length of sixty miles . Such cracks are counted by hundreds on the moon , where they are to be seen almost everywhere ; and other varieties , in fact , *mre visible on this same plate , but we will not stop to describe them . This one varies in width from an eighth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not see to the bottom of it , others are known to be at least eight miles deep , and may be indefinitely deeper . // gets weather-worn and rounded , but here the edge is sharp , so that a traveler along the lunar plains would come to the very brink of this tremendous chasm before he had any warning of its existence . It is usually thus with all such rifts , and the straightness and sharpness of the edge in these cases suggest the appearance of an ice-crack to the observer . I do not mean to assert that there is more than a superficial resemblance . I do not write as a geologist ; but in view of what we have just been reading of the lunar cold , we may ask ourselves whether , if water ever did exist here , we should not expect to find perpetual ice , not necessarily glittering , but covered , perhaps , with the deposits of an air laden with the dust-products of later volcanic eruptions , or even covered in after ages , when the air has ceased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dust during millions of years of windless calm . What else can we think will become of the water on our own earth if it be destined to pass through such an experience as we seem to see prophesied in the condition of our dead satellite ? The reader must not understand me as saying that there is ice on the moon- only that there is probably perpetual ice there now if there ever was water in past time ; and he is not to suppose that to say this is in any way to deny what seems the strong evidence of the existence of volcanic action everywhere , for the two things may well have existed in successive ages of our satellite 's past , or even have both existed together , like Hecla , within our own arctic snows ; and if no sign of any still active lunar volcano has been discovered , we appear to read the traces of their presence in the past none the less clearly . 1 remember that at one time , when living on the lonely upper lava-wastes of Mt . Etna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquainted with so many a chasm and rent filled with these that the dreary landscape appeared from above as if a bit of the surface of the moon I looked up at through the telescope had been brought down beside me . I remember , too , that as I studied the sun there and watched the volcanic outbursts on its surface , I felt that I possibly embraced in a threefold picture as many stages in the history of planetary existence , through all of which this eruptive action was an agent ,  - -  above in the primal energies of the sun , all around me in the great volcano , black and torn with the fires that still burn below , and whose smoke rose over me in the plume that floated high up from the central cone , and finally in this last stage in the moon , which 719 hung there pale in the daylight sky , and across whose face the vapors of the great terrestrial volcano drifted , but on whose own surface the last fire was extinct . We shall not get an adequate idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views one showing a chain of lunar mountains as they would appear to us if we saw them , as we do our own Alps or Apennines , from about their feet , and such a view Fig. 14 affords us . In the barren plain on the foreground are great rifts such as we have been looking at from above , and smaller craters , with their extinct cones ; while beyond rise the mountains , ghastly white in the cold sunshine , their precipices crowned by no mountain fir or cedar , and softened by no intervening air to veil their nakedness . If the reader has ever climbed one of the highest Alpine peaks , like those about Monte Rosa or the Matterhorn , and there waited for the dawn , he can not but remember the sense of desolation and strangeness due to the utter absence of everything belonging to man or his works or his customary abode , above all which he is lifted into an upper world , so novel and , as it were , so unhuman in its features , that he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and this impression gives the nearest but still a feeble idea of what we see with the telescope in looking down on such a colorless scene , where , too , no water bubbles , no tree can sigh in the breeze , no bird can sing  --  the home of silence . But here , above it , hangs a world in the sky , which we should need to call in color to depict , for it is green and yellow with the forests and the harvest-fields that overspread its continents , with emerald islands studding its gray oceans , over all of which sweep the clouds that bring the life-giving rain . It is our own world , which lights up the dreary lunar night , as the moon does ours . The signs of age are on the moon . It seems pitted , torn , and rent by the past action of long-dead fires , till its surface is like a piece of porous cinder under the magnifying glassa burnt-out cinder of a planet , which rolls through the void like a ruin of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface is wrinkled everywhere , till the analogy with an old and shriveled face or hand or fruit ( Fig . I5 ) , where the puckered skin is Folded about a shrunken center , forces itself on our attention , and suggests a common cause  --  a something underlying the analogy , and making it more than a mere resemlDlance . The moon , then , is dead ; and if it ever was the home of a race like ours , that race is dead too . I have said that our new astronomy modifies our view of the moral universe THE PLANETS AND THE MOON 9 // as well as of the physical one ; nor do we need a more pregnant instance than in this before us . In these days of decay of old creeds of the eternal , it has been sought to satisfy man 's yearning toward it by founding a new religion whose god is Humanity , and whose hope lies in the future existence of our own race , in whose collective being the individual who must die may fancy his aims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alas for hopes looking to this alone ! we are here brought to face the solemn thought that like the individual , though at a little further date , Humanity itself may die ! Before we leave this dead world , let us take a last glance at one of its fairest scenes : that which we obtain when looking at a portion on which the sun is rising , as in this view of FIG. 16. - GASSENDI . NOVEMBER 7th , 0867. // Gassendi ( Fig. i6 ) , in which the dark part on our right is still the body of the moon , on which the sun has not yet risen , its nearly level rays stretch elsewhere over the surface , that is , in places of a strangely smooth texture , contrasting with the ruggedness of the ordinary soil , which is here gathered into low plaits , that , with the texture we have spoken of , look " Like marrowy crapes of China silk , Or wrinkled skin on scalded milk , " as they lie , soft and almost beautiful , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the summits cast their shadows illimitedly over the darkening plains away on the right , until they melt away into the night - a night which is not utterly black , for even here a subdued radiance comes from the earth-shine of our own world in the sky . Let us leave here the desolation about us , happy that we can come back at will to that world , our own familiar dwelling , where the meadows are still green and the birds still sing , and where , better yet , still dwells our own kind - surely the world , of all we have found in our wanderings , which we should ourselves have chosen to be our home .
