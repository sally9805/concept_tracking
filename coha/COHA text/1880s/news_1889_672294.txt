txt Within the last few days two topios have come to the surface in New-Jersey which will probably give current to much of the legislation that may be brought to the notice of the houses upon their assembling next month . The report of the arbitrators in the suit brought by the State against the Delaware , Lackawanna and Western Railroad Company to recover about ? , million and a quarter dollars of back taxes will not only provide the text for considerable discussion Among the lawmakers , but seems likely to color all the legislation which is certain to be proposed for the further taxation of the railroads . The impression seems to be gaining ground that the State will not realize largely from the railroad suit . There can be no question that so far as their casual remarks upon the arguments of counsel whom they are now hearing indicate anything , the leaning of both arbitrators ? Judge Dillon , selected by the railroad , and Stevens of Newark , by the State ? is toward the railroad . Ex-Gov . Bedle , who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if the State gets enough out of its claims to defray the expenses of its suit it will be fortunate . There is , on the other hand , a strong public ) sentiment on the question that will not tamely submit to a decree which is not as favorable to the State as circumstances will permit . For years and years the railroad company stood out in bold enhance of the taxing power of the State . Under its charter the old Morris and Essex Railroad Company , now the loasett property of the Delaware , Lackawanna and Western , was required to pay into the State Treasury a tax of one-half of 1 per cent . on the cost of its road as soon as it earned ' 7 per cent . It has made payments to the State under this pro-. vision . But when the municipalities assessed it for local taxes , the company set up a claim that an act of exemption , wnloh it succeeded in putting through one of the Legislatures , was a eontract between it and the State which no subsequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruled against this construction of the act , but on an appeal to the ' United States courts the railroad view of it was sustained , and the company boldly refused to submit to any tax legislation designed to reach it . In the course of time . however , the State secured the upper nand in the controversy . This was when , by its terms , the company 's charter expired , and the State had leave to enter into possession of its franchises . Under the threat of confiscation , the State compelled its compliance with the new tax law of 1884 , and also brought it to book for delinquencies in the matter of the payment outs State taxes in prior years . It was toward the close of his term as Governor that Abbett called attention to some figures indicating that the company had not paid its honest half per cent . tax on the cost of its road , and the result was the institution of the proceedings now pending before the arbitrators . Prior to the passage of the new tax law the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value of the taxable railroad property in the State was that which was given by the companies themselves in sworn annual statements . Each year the Morris and Essex Company turned in to the State Controller a statement under oath . showing the taxable cost of its road . On the figures thus reported the half per cent . tax was levied . The basis of the pending proceedings against the company is the claim that the company did not make honest returns from year to year ; that it failed to disclose a 7 per cent . earning for years when its earnings had reached the tax limit , and that even in the years when it admitted 7 per cent . earnings it had abstracted Items from its taxable " cost of road " and hidden them in other non-taxable accounts . The State alleges that it was earning the 7 per cent . which subjected it to tax , as far back as 1845 , though it was away along in the fifties before it began Lb pay any taxes to the State . It further alleges that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less taxable cost of road than'it owned . Between these two items , the State asserts , the company has wrongfully withheld about $700,000 of cash from the State which rightfully belonged to it . The interest on this sum amounts to about $5Q0,000 more , and so the totalidemand of the State approximates a million and a quarter . An expert was appointed to examine the books of the company , and over 4,000 pages of testimony have been taken . It is matter of . note that the arbitrators listened to none of the testimony . and Stevens , who sits for the State , declared , during the argument one day last week , that he bad no idea of reading the printed transcript of the stenographer 's notes . Their decision will , therefore , be based only upon the information laid before them in the arguments of counsel . These arguments have served to show where are the points of difference between the lawyers . It seems to be an open secret among all engaged as the case that the half million dollars of interest will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim is thus sealed down to little more than half its original size at a single stroke . The railroad Is caviling ingeniously as to the items which go to make up thereat of the bill . One of the questions in the case is where the 7 per cent . earnings exist . The company claims that it has the right to deduct from its earnings the vast expenditures for equipments before earnings which are made the condition of taxation are reached . The success of this plea would postpone the time when the company 's cost of road became taxable many years later than the time at which the company began to pay taxes . Another question is as to the expenditures made by the road for construction . The State claims that that construction expenditures are necessarily cost , expenditures , and that all construction outlays should have been ' counted by the company in its taxable cost account . The railroad company asserts , on the other hand , that all construction is not cost , but that it is for the arbitrators to examine each item @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an item in " cost . " The arbitrators by calling for the items , have practically decided to proceed on the railroad 's theory . When they come to apply the theory they will find many large item which must go in or go out in a lump . Chief among these are the expenditures on uncompleted improvements . It has taken years for the company to oomplete some of its branches for use . The company was digging many years through Bergen too , before its tunnel there was completed . But each year much money was sunk in parrying on these enterprises . Can the State exact tax on these sums as they were laid outs or did the tax become due only when the whole expenditure had been made and the Improvements were in condition for service The State takes the first view ; the latter view is that insisted upon by the railroad . Another large item the arbitrators will have to deal with in determining what part of construction expenditures represents taxable cost is embraced in discounts and interest on bonds on which the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the market for only 90 per cent. , the company claims that 90 per cent , represents the taxable outlay . The State insists that not only must the tax be levied on the face of the bonds , but upon the interest paid to keep them alive as well . The arguments now being conducted by Attorney General Stockton for the State and ex-Gov . Bedle for the company will probably not be finished until Jan. 5 . But it is expected that the arbitrators will have their report ready for the Legislature before the close of the session . The statement of the points at issue shows that there is room for wide divergence of opinion , and it is assumed that as there are enough hooks for the arbitrators to hang any conclusions they may see fit to reach upon , their finding will be a defense of the railroad company , and that it will leave little of the State 's claim to be put in judgment . The tax money involved in the controversy over the taxation of discounts and interest alone is said to reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payment of tax on expenditures for uncompleted improvements the balance of the State 's claim still De practically wiped out It is said , however , that the arbitration is not necessarily final for either side , and the fact that the State may , after the decision has been rendered , take its claim into the courts may move the arbitrators to draw the line as fairly between the two litigants as possible . A too evident leaning to the railroad by the arbitrators will provoke a general attack , in the lower branch of the Legislature at least , upon the railroads of the State , and may lead to tae passage of more stringent laws on the subject of rat trona taxation . Recent Chancery Proceedings instituted by ex-United States District Attorney KettsbeY have aroused the widest interest in labor circles throughout the State , and the labor unions are already holding conferences on the legislation to which they mar lead . These proceedings are those instigated by the boss stonecutters in Newark against the journeymen 's union . The journeymen 's union had passed a resolution that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two men applied for membership , but were excluded under the rule . They applied to various stone-nutting establishments for employment , but were refused it banns ? of the , fear that their employment would drive the other hands engaged in the yards to strike . They thereupon began suit in Chancery to compel the local union not only to eezalt them , but to admit every skilled hand who is willing to Day the fees and abide by the rules of the union . The Court of Chancery decided some time ago that a trades union has no proprietary right in the union label . and could not , therefore , stop a manufacturer from imitating it . That decision was regarded as a serious blow to labor interests in the State . but the question presented in these new proceedings is regarded as of incomparably more serious import . The success of the present suit would , it is claimea Dy the union men , destroy trades unions In Now-Jersey . Employers would take green men off the street , teach them the trade , put them into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not only the stonecutters , bat organizations of laboring mon engaged in all the other branches of industry , regard Mr. Keasboy 's bill in Chancery as the most serious movement that has yet been put on foot for their destruction . Already a number of bills are being prepared by the friends of the unions to meet the issue .
