txt Although the otticlal statements made by the fire insurance companies to the Insurance Departments of the various States will not be published for several weeks to come , there is not the least doubt that the aggregate exhibit for the year 1880 will show a considerable decrease in the net assets of the companies doing business in this country . It is quite possible that the gross assets of the companies will be larger than they were at the first of last year , for within that period there has been great activity in almost every form of mercantile business , and , consequently , there has been an appreciably larger amount of property to be insured ; but the belief of those who are best informed is that the ratio of increase in liability has been greater than the increase in gross assets , and hence , financially , the companies are not in as good a position as they were a year ago . A decline of this kind has but one cause ? insufficiency of premium receipts . To say , as is frequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on account of their fire losses is to confuse cause and effect . Except in the rare case of a sweeping conflagration , like that which destroyed Chicago in 1871 , there is a certain approach toward uniformity in the annual volume of fire losses , that is to say , in this country during the past five or six years the annual amount of loss to companies by fire has not varied to anywhere near the extent that those who have not looked into the matter might suppose , and if the insurance companies had since 1575 obtained each twelve months the amount of premiums that they did that year , there has not been a year since then in which they might not have paid all their indebtedness and still have had in hand enough of surplus to pay good dividends to the holders of insurance stock . That they have not done this is to be solely attributed to the fact that they have been content to do business at rates of premium that would not , on the law of average , reimburse them for the losses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the underwriters have no one to find fault with but themselves . They are in the position of a merchant who sells his wares at less than the goods cost him , and they should be no more surprised than he that they do not reap a profit by the operation . But while it is easy to thus point out in a general way the prime defect in the business as it is now carried on , a defect which is each year reducing the aggregate capital available to meet great losses by fire , it is very difficult to give to such advice individual applicability . If the entire fire insurance business of the country could be carried on by one great company , little trouble would be found in drawing the loss line on the scale of premiums , but where the business is divided among hundreds of competing companies the characteristics that are , true of all the mass frequently seem to find no place in the isolated experience of separate corporations . As we said above , it is highly probable that in surance companies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year 's business , but it is certain that a number of companies that could be mentioned have made money . The effect of this inequality hit experience is plainly manifest . In a business in which competition must be exceedingly high , the rate or price is determined not so much by the necessities of the unsuccessful companies as by the experience of the successful ones . The latter class argue , with a show of plausibility , that there is no good reason why they should increase their Was , while the former , in the hope of being more fortunate in the future , are not willing to drive their customers from them by enlarged demands . Thus , in spite of the evidently unprofitable character of the business as a whole , the effect of existing competition is to make it more and more unprofitable , and the larger the number of companies , and the more varied their experience is , the more difficult it becomes to correct the defect . The tendency of this pressure is in the direction of lessening the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fire insurance corporations have retired from business , but it will need many more withdrawals of this kind before their effect will be made apparent in the unconscious uniformity of action on the part of those companies that are left behind . The only immediate chance for improvement seems to be in the voluntary movement of all , or of a large part , of the underwriters themselves . By taking the aggregate records of the companies for a series of years , it would be easy to determine how much of an advance in rates of premium should be made in order to place the entire business on a paying basis . With data of this kind at their command , a systematic and united effort all over the country could be made to secure the needed increase . This advance would not have to be large , for possibly 15 , and certainly 20 , per cent . would be amply sufficient . But such a change would make the business , on the whole , a paying one , without making it so remunerative as to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
