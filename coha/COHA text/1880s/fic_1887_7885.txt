Longfellow , Samuel , 1819-1892 : TO A FRIEND WITH SOME VERSES . from A few verses of many years ( 1887 ) By cliff and stream and mountain pass Together we have wandered And looked on Nature 's beauteous face And her high mysteries pondered ; And still some bud or leaf or spray Or red wild-rose we 'd gather In memory of the charming scene , Or day of lovely weather . So , on life 's path from time to time Some fair experience staying , I ' ve thrown the feeling into rhyme To keep it undecaying . And now for you within these leaves I these wild-roses pressing Hope that some fragrance you may find , Some sweet perennial blessing . Longfellow , Samuel , 1819-1892 : THE HOMESTEAD . from A few verses of many years ( 1887 ) Home of my fathers ! once again I stand beneath the shade Of those ancestral trees where once A dreamy child I played . Those ancient elms still o'er thy roof Their sheltering branches spread ; But they who loved their pleasant shade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now Their friendly glance I catch , No longer hear , as I approach , The sound of lifted latch ; The ready hand which once threw wide The hospitable door  --  I know its warm and hearty grasp Shall answer mine no more . The red rose by the window still Blooms brightly as of old ; The woodbines still around the door Their shining leaves unfold ; The pale syringa scents the air Through the long summer hours ; But ah ! the old beloved hands No longer pluck their flowers . I wander where the little brook Still keeps its tranquil flow . Where blooms the crimson cardinal , And golden lilies glow ; Or , crossing o'er the wooden bridge , I loiter on my way To watch where in the sunny depths The darting minnows play . That little bridge , the vine-clad elms That guarded either end ,  --  Oh , with that spot how many dreams , How many memories , blend ! When summer suns at morning kissed The dew from grass and flower , I ' ve wandered there ; and lingered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring returns those trees Put on their garments green ; And still in summer hues arrayed Those blooming flowers are seen ; And when the autumn winds come down To wrestle with the wood , The gold and crimson leaves are shed To float along the flood . Thus seasons pass , and year on year Follows with ceaseless pace ; Though all things human change or die , Unchanged is Nature 's face . Yet , when these well-remembered scenes Before my vision glide , I feel that they who made them fair No more are by my side . And one there was  --  now distant far  --  Who shared my childish plays , With whom I roamed in deeper joy In boyhood 's thoughtful days . Dear cousin , round thine early home When truant memory Lingers in dreams of fond regret , Dost thou e'er think of me ? Gorham , 1839 . Longfellow , Samuel , 1819-1892 : EVENING LAMPS . from A few verses of many years ( 1887 ) The trees stand dim along the bank , In the sky float purple clouds ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clouds ! Out from the gray and dusky shore A single lamp now gleams , And , trembling far upon the tide , Its red reflection streams . No other light is kindled yet On the earth , or near or far , And but one lamp in heaven is set ,  --  The holy evening star . Soon shall be lighted other lamps , From every window burn ; And the laborers , guided by their rays , Shall homeward gladly turn . Soon , too , shall countless lamps , God-lighted , In the high heavens gleam , And the traveller , on his way benighted , Shall bless their holy beam . Cambridge , 1839 . Longfellow , Samuel , 1819-1892 : MY BOOKS . from A few verses of many years ( 1887 ) I am a monarch , though my realm is small ; Four narrow walls contain my kingdom all . Yet , low as is my state , No royal potentate Hath wider power than I : Like the Olympian god I do but give the nod , And far and wide my messengers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be alone . Earth 's wisest , noblest , saintliest , and most great Do , at their bidding , wait Around my throne , And lay their treasures at my feet . If I but stretch my hand At once I see Obedient to my command Sages before me stand , Teachers from every land ; The orators unseal their golden tongues , The poets greet me with their sweetest songs , Earth 's choicest inspirations are for me . Such is my throne , Such my dominion , While I sit here , alone ! Cambridge , 1842 . Longfellow , Samuel , 1819-1892 : SONG FOR THE ph. b. k . DINNER . from A few verses of many years ( 1887 ) Drink , weary traveller , drink and pray For the poor soul of Sybil Grey , Who built this cross and well . Marmion . The pilgrim oft in days of old Paused on his weary road Where , guarded by its rude-hewn cross , The fountain 's current flowed : And as upon the sparkling stream His eye delighted fell , He blessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and well . We in our weary pilgrimage Have turned aside to-day , For thick upon our sandals lies The dust of life 's hot way . We drink of Friendship 's living wave In Learning 's sacred dell , And bless in prayer the names of them Who built this cross and well . Longfellow , Samuel , 1819-1892 : MY ROOM . from A few verses of many years ( 1887 ) I wish I could bring you here , If only for a minute , That you might see my room And everything that is in it . But as there are no carpets In these degenerate days , Like those in Arabian story Which could take you from place to place , I must try what my pen can do As a sort of magic wand . I 'll describe to you the room , And I hope you 'll understand . First and foremost , then , you must know That it 's up on the third floor In old Massachusetts Hall That 's a hundred years old and more ; As I dare say you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the ceiling Like so many broad seams . But they are not beams of oak With carvings rich and rare And all grown black with age ;  --  I 'm sure I wish they were . Two windows are in the room , Both on the northern side ,  --  Very pleasant to sit at in summer When they are open wide ; And from them you look out On the elms and the College Green ; To the left the barren Common And the wide street are seen , And that modest little church , So pleasant to the eye , That was built by our English fathers In the years so long gone by . And among the many elms You see that noblest one ,  --  That grand old tree with its broad boughs Once sheltered Washington . All this and more you may see In the pleasant summer-tide ; But now it ' s better within By the cheerful fireside . On the left , between the doors , Opposite the fireplace , You will see my greatest treasures In that old-fashioned case . Yet my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare ; But you 'll find some good old friends , And perhaps some new ones there . Upon the centre shelf Are Shakspere 's noble plays ; And some of the many poets Who sing in our own days . And there is glorious Milton Whom suffering could not bow , And melancholy Dante With wrinkled cheek and brow . On the upper shelf is Schiller ,  --  Youth living in the man ,  --  And next the Greek tragedians ; Greek and Barbarian ! And " visionary Coleridge , " That German-English mind ,  --  Three volumes of his poems And some prose works you 'll find . For philosophy , there ' s Jouffroy , A fair , clear-minded man , And Benjamin Constant , And much-abused Cousin . And now look at this ancient table With its nicely inlaid top And its prettily carved acorns ; Each drawer has its brass drop . And near it the antique chair So very prim and tall , With its straight cane-woven back , And the carved rose crowning all . How many a gray-haired man Has rested in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair ! Or some young loving mother , With half-arrested breath , Has sat and watched her darling Slumbering into death . But now I wish you were in it , Dear heart , so true and fond ! You should be there , this minute , If my pen were a magic wand . 1842 . Longfellow , Samuel , 1819-1892 : ON LAKE SUNAPEE. from A few verses of many years ( 1887 ) The summer night is wooing ; " Come , come , " the lake is suing ; With tender gleam , With witching beam , " Here am I , " Cries the beckoning half-moon in the sky . The boat impatient waiting , Our hearts within dilating , Away , away , In the mimic day ,  --  You and I , And the silver half-moon in the sky . From oar-blades , slowly dipping , Fall drops in music slipping ; We are afloat In charmd boat ,  --  You and I , And the magic half-moon in the sky ! For us the night wind 's sighing , The night-bird 's soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are alone ,  --  You and I , And the silent half-moon in the sky . And now , dissolved in dreaming , The world is naught but seeming ; The shadowy woods Reflect our moods ,  --  You and I , And the dreamy half-moon in the sky . Of time we take no noting , Between the two worlds floating Of soft ideal And misty real ,  --  You and I , And the mystic half-moon in the sky . Our thoughts and feelings mingle , We are not two , nor single ; Our spirits blend , No word we send ,  --  You and I ; And the sinking half-moon leaves the sky ! 1886.
