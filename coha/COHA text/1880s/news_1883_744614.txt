txt The increase of the Alpine regiments and the decree ordering the construction of a new colossal war ship by xio means imply that Italy is preparing for war . The Alpine corps consists of picked men of unusual height and muscular strength , whose duty it is to guard the passes of the Alps . It is a favorite corps , and whenever any proposal has been made in Parliament , during the last three or four years , for the increase of the army , an increase of the Alpine corps has always been urged . The order for the buildinz of the new man-of-war is understood by the Italian press to be a compliment to the firm of the ORLANDI BROTHERS , who built the Lepanto . The latter is the first Italian man-of-war which has been built by a private firm , and the universal satisfaction with her has found expression in the decree that one of the new war vessels which the Government has for some time intended to build shall be intrusted to the ORLANDI BROTHERS . Nevertheless , there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Italy with Austria and Germany will be to compel the Italian Government to keep up the army and navy to a point of efficiency that will make the Italian alliance valuable to the other contracting powers . This will have the necessary effect of increasing taxation , or , at all events , of preventing the reduction of taxation which the country so greatly needs . Such a price would not be too high did Italy need an alliance with Germany and Austria to protect her against France , but as there is not the least probability that France will attack Italy or that Italy will attack France , is it worth while to burden the Italian nation and to risk the disturbance of the financial equilibrium for the mere sake of being admitted to " good society " 2 ? for that is what the alliance really means , so far as Italy is concerned .
