txt An intelligent and at the same time short-sighted physician has discovered that color blindness is very rare among girls , though it is common among boys . From this fact he draws the conclusion that in most cases color blindness is due to a want of early education in discriminating between colors . Girls are taught to become familiar with every shade of color , while boys receive no instruction whatever in colors . Hence boys frequently show an ignorance of colors which is confounded with true color blindness , but which girls rarely show . Thus far the intelligent physician displays genuine intelligence , but when he recommends that boys should receive the same training in discriminating between colors which girls receive he shows a lamentable degree of short-sightedness . He is clearly an unmarried and daughterless man ; otherwise he would at once perceive that the interests of the human race require that instead of decreasing color blindness among boys , color blindness among girls should be carefully cultivated . Let the boys remain as they are , but by all means let us abstain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Think for a moment of what would be the result if our girls knew little or nothing about color , and could not discriminate between red and green , much less between delicate shades of any given color . Shopping would become an easy and inexpensive affair . ' The cost of the material for a dress would be the chief cost of the garment , for the color-blind girl would never dream of . putting $50 worth of gay-colored trimmings on $10 worth of dress . Girls would select some good simple color for their dresses and would stick to it , instead of casting aside good dresses and ordering new ones on the ground that moon-on-the-mill-pond is no longer a fashionable color , ' and the earth-ofAbyssinia is the only color - that a selfrespecting girl can wear . Then , too , color-blind girls would take no possible interest in making green dogs and yellow squirrels in worsted work , and would care nothing whatever for highly colored wax flowers . What this country needs is not fewer color-blind boys , but more color-blind girls , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rise to the head of his profession .
