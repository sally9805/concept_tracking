txt The recent alleged embezzlement by a bank Teller who had for many years been trusted with large sums of money seems to have excited the usual surprise among the Directors and other officers of the bank . They can not understand how the man could have been guilty of the alleged frauds , and are quite unable to see how a Teller or Cashier can be otherwise than honest . This is merely the latest illustration of the lack of - wisdom which characterizes the Directors of ' banks and insurance offices . They are undoubtedly ' intelligent men ? as is shown by their skill in voting themselves salaries  --  but they seem totally unable to comprehend that their subordinates are treated in a way that places the greatest possible temptations to dishonesty in their hands . The defaulting Teller to whom allusion has just been made was paid the extravagant salary of $2,400 per annum , and yet the Directors wonder that his accounts are in an . unpleasantly suggestive condition . The real trouble with bank Tellers ought to be evident to everybody . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luxury . They are ridiculously overpaid and are kept without sufficient employment . The work that a Teller has to do is notoriously very light . He merely has to handle and be responsible for a few hundred thousand or a few million dollars daily ; to keep a few dozen books , and in a general way to attend to the business of the institution with which he is connected . In most instances he is only required to work from 9 o'clock in the morning until 5 or 6 in the evening , except during the busy season , which seldom lasts over nine or ten months of the year , when he is , of course , expected either to spend the evening at his desk or to take home work enough to occupy him until midnight . With so much vacant time on his hands he feels as though he were not earning his $2,000 or $2,400 per annum . In other words , he is compelled to acknowledge to himself that he is dishonestly accepting pay to which he has no moral right . When a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a salary which he knows he does not earn , he is no longer an honest man , and is ready to fall before the first temptation which presents itself . Then , too , idleness is universally acknowledged to be the parent of vice and crime . The time hangs heavily on the Teller 's hands , and he longs for some exciting occupation that will make the time pass swiftly . Were he kept steadily at work , he would in most cases be happy and honest ; but his days and nights of idleness furnish him with opportunities for crime , which , alas , he is only too apt to improve . Even worse than idleness in its effects upon the Teller is the absurdly large salary which he is ordinarily paid . To take an idle man and fill his pockets with money is the surest way to lead him into evil paths . What can a moral and sensible man do with an income of $2,400 per annum ? Let us suppose that he has a large family to support and that he keeps them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose that he puts a good round sum in the savings bank every week as a provision for the day when the Directors will dismiss him on the ground that he has served faithfully for forty years and is getting too old for his work . - When all this is done there is still the surplus of his salary to be spent . Having more money than he can get rid of in decent and reputable ways , the Teller is tempted to spend it in foolish or vicious ways . He goes into gambling-houses and wastes his time and money at " faro , " or he takes still another step in the downward path , and goes into Wall-street . Whether he wins or loses , he becomes demoralized and loses his relish for the wholesome and simple pleasures of book-keeping . He becomes addicted to expensive wines , and lavishes money on fast horses and women to the like effect . Rich as he is , the day comes when an unfortunate turn of the cards or fall of the Wall-street dice strips him of his wealth ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tellers . When this melancholy day comes he " borrows " the money of the bank to make good his losses , is detected and ruined , and then the very Directors who are mainly responsible for his fall , since they have maintained him in idleness and luxury , wonder how he could possibly have betrayed his trust . The way to make bank Tellers and . Cashiers honest is to give them work enough to keep them from idleness and to pay them moderate salaries . It would be well if every bank were to require its Teller to sweep out the building ; feed the furnace , and bring luncheon to the President and Directors . He might also be required to keep two or three extra sets of books . It does not make much difference- what sort of work is given him to do , provided there is enough of it . Were the Teller to be made to work from 5 A. M. until 11:30 P. H. every day  --  with no time allowed for eating ? he would be preserved from many temptations which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it should depend somewhat upon his circumstances . While $400 would be quite enough for a single man , a generous Board of Directors would probably be willing to pay a Teller with a large family $410 : Thus the temptations incident to the possession of too much money would be removed from the Teller 's path , and the money saved by cutting down his salary to a just and wise amount could . be added to the salary of the President . Owing to the defective state of our laws , a bank can not buy its Tellers as a Turkish merchant buys his servants . Its aim should be , however , to reduce the Teller as nearly as possible to the position of a slave , having no salary and doing unlimited work. , . The nearer this ideal can be approached the fewer will be the cases of embezzlement of bank money by idle and extravagant Cashiers , Tellers , and Clerks .
