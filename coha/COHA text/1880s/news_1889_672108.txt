txt M. WALTERS AND THE MUSEUM . Mr. WALTERS of Baltimore , one of the most beral and judicious of American collectors f works of art , has declared , over his own ignature , that he has offered to the Metroolitan . Museum the sum estimated to be ecessary to make its collections available a the public on Sundays for three years . e has been - willing , he says , for some ears to do this as " a tribute to Sunday pening " without regard to the pecuniary ecessities of the Museum . This avowal makes it difficult for the Trustees of the Museum to defend their course with relation to Sunday openings . There may be , no doubt , men among the Trustees or the benefactors of the Museum who conscientiously believe that it would be wrong to expose the treasures of the Museum to those who wish to see them on Sunday whether or not they are able to see them on any other day . Such an objection must be respected , even if , it is disregarded , and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the men supposed to entertain this ' view is questioned it appears that it is not he , but somebody else of whom he has more or less vaguely heard , in deference to whose views the Sunday opening is refused . It is also reported that some gifts have actually been made to the Museum upon condition that it should not be opened on Sunday , and . the owners of other valuable works of art are suspected of a willingness to be-. stow them upon the Museum provided it be not opened on Sunday , and . to withheld them in case it is opened . The Secretary of the Museum has lately declared that all gifts coupled with this condition are rejected . It any have been accepted upon this condition heretofore they could be concealed . from the sight of Sunday visitors . For some time past the only tangible objection to the Sunday opening has been its expense , and the generous offer of Mr. WALTERS , all the more generous because he is not a New-Yorker , deprives this objection of all force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned have published their opinions that the attendance on Sunday would not warrant a large increase of expenditure , even if the Museum were much richer than it is . Clearly that is a question that can be answered only by experiment , and the experiment must be carried on for a considerable time in order to determine it satisfactorily . There may be an objection to the use of the funds of the Museum for this purpose . What possible objection can there be to trying the experiment at the expense of a benefactor who offers the money for this express purpose , and who offers money enough to protract the experiment until its demonstration of the extent of the public demand for the Sunday opening shall be absolutely decisive . We can conceive of none apart from the objection that to show or to look at works of art on Sunday is a sin . This is a proposition which nobody can be found to avow that he entertains , nor is it in the least likely that any owner of pictures in this city refrains from looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guests on . that day . Secretary DI CESNOIA is the only person who has appeared to oppose the acceptance of Mr. WALTEns 's offer . The Secretary of the Museum is not a Puritan , and he is not - publicly known to be afflicted with such a supersensitiveness of conscience as would incline him to regard money given to the Museum as defiled even if it were given for - the purpose of securing Sunday openings . He has alleged ' that the sum offered by Mr. WALTERS was too small for the purpose . Mr. WALTERS explains that his offer was of the sum estimated by one of the Trustees of the Museum to be necessary and that it was to be supplemented by further contributions if required , until a more wholesome sentiment compelled the Trustees to make the experiment permanent . Secretary DI CESNOLA 'S statement , it is evident , does not indicate the tenderness of conscience which we have a right to expect . from so rigid a Sabbatarian . It is plain enough that the Secretary is opposed to Sunday openings , and that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be done by the Trustees in disregard of his advice , if that is conceivable . They may very probably find , if they inquire , that he has magnified the difficulties and expenses of the Sunday opening .
