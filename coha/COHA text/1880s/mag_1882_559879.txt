" A wrong not resisted is approved . " O* the 27th of June last , the people of Iowa decided , by a majority of nearly thirty thousand , to place in the Constitution of the State an amendment , which declares that " No person shall manufacture for sale , or sell , or keep for sale , as a beverage , any intoxicating liquor whatever , including ale , wine , and beer . " Asked by the REVIEW to state the reasons which led to this action , I have to say , first , that the measure alluded to is not , properly speaking , a " sumptuary law . " It is not directed against the individual 's right of use , but its sole aim is to destroy the business of manufacturing and selling intoxicating liquors for use as a beverage ; provision still remaining for the manufacture and sale for all necessary purposes . Hence the campaign for the adoption of this measure took on the features of a direct crusade against the saloons , the churches and the temperance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Great influence was exerted by these organized forces , and especially those in which the influence of woman was prominent . Beyond question this was the most striking feature of the campaign : it was not a force of controversy or aggression , but a subduing appeal for the protection of the family and the home . The issue was squarely joined between the saloons and their long-time enemies . Personal considerations did not govern the result . There were many instances where men of high character and rigidly temperate habits worked and voted against the proposed amendment . On the other hand , large numbers of persons of grossly intemperate habits voted for it . Thonsands of those who favored the measure were men of temperate , though not abstemious habits , whose personal custom it was to use liquors for // refreshmeiit , or as a beverage on occasions , but who were still brought to demaud the destruetiou of the driuking-saloon business . Separated as the issue was from mere personal considerations , it was also wholly divorced from party politics . The election was a special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , in the strictest sense , non-partisan . Every attempt to make prohibition a party issue in this State had failed . In pre vious years prohibitory parties had been formed and candidates nominated , but the vote obtained was insignificant . The voters refused to support the proposition so long as it was complicated with questions of party or candidates , but demanded that it be presented in bold relief , regardless of party , and as a broad question of public policy . The most significant feature of the result is to be sought in the influences which brought so many moderate-minded voters to the support of rigid prohibition . In round numbers , one hundred and fifty-five thousand electors voted for the adoption of the amendment . A large proportion of them had not been known previously as professed prohibitionists . They had inelined toward moderate views and great tolerance toward others , were disposed to regard temperance reform as the work of personal effort rather than legal enactment , and were reluctant to adopt extreme measures in regard to any question of social custom . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dass into rigid prohibitionists that the full significance of Iowa 's action is to be found . The action taken is only to be understood by tracing the steps which led up to it through many years of patient experiment and sore trial of the charity which snifereth long . Prohibition is not a new idea in Iowa . It was brought here by the first settlers , and soon became a strong factor in the public sentiment of the community . Possibly this statement may surprise those who are disposed to the vague idea that a new State of the West must , from the nature of its circumstances , be addicted to the easy customs of the frontier and have about it a flavor of mining-camp morality . An entire mistake ! A mining region , with its wild excitements , its lack of home influences , its great fortunes , and attendant poverty , furnishes no parallel to an agricultural State like Iowa , even in the earliest days of its settlement . Such a State attracts hardy and enterprising immigrants through the certain and thrifty rewards it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wives and children with them , and they come to found homes as well as fortunes , and to gain both by industrious , thrifty lives . Frugality and industry were the cardinal virtues of the pioneer farmer who first turned the soil of the prairies . Years of self-denying effort made up the price which the early settlers paid for the homestead farms where they now dwell in comfort and plenty . Habits of thrift and temperance were thus introduced here at the outset , and soon became , in good measure , " native to the soil . " The early settlers and seekers after homes and homesteads were men of temperate habits , and soon established a state of society in which the waste and idleness of intemperance were held in great disrepute . This sentiment soon found its way into public affairs . The first Governor of Iowa , in his inaugural address at the opening of the first Territorial Assembly , - urged the necessity of strong laws against intemperance . Attention was drawn in this direction because there had gathered about the trading-posts an element which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prairies . Grog-shops were opened in some of these places at an early day . The first evil developed was in the sale of liquor to the Indians , who soon acquired an insatiable appetite for strong drink . Wherever these grog-shops were established , the Indians were reduced to great degradation and poverty through their consuming thirst for liquor . This was one of the first evils to call for legislative action in the new Territory . Addressing the Territorial Assembly in 1841 , Governor John Chambers said , with righteous indignation : " Humanity shudders and religion weeps over the cruel and unrelenting destruction of a people so interesting , by means so dastardly and brutal , that the use of the rifle and sword , even in a time of profound peace with them , would be comparatively merciful . " Convinced of the evils of the sale of liquor to the Indians , the legislators of that day did not hesitate as to the best means of meeting the danger . The first statute book of the Territory of Iowa bore on its pages an absolute prohibition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This seed was not sown in the sand . It established in Iowa the principle of prohibiting the sale of liquor whenever it proved to be an evil incapable of control . Although the Indians have long since disappeared , the statute has passed into the codified law , and stands unchal // THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW . lenged and unrepealed ; nor am I aware that its repeal was ever advocated , or other objection made , except that its penalties were not sufficiently severe . " How far that little candle throws his beams ! " It was inevitable that , when the prohibition of sale to one class was found to work for its benefit and the good of the State , it should come to be asked , with increasing emphasis , why it would not prove an equal blessing to others . The principle of prohibition was established ; the extent of its application remained to be frxed by the necessities of the time . The idea of " legal suasion " grew in favor in the hamlets and on the homestead farms of early Iowa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire prohibition was reached . So long ago as 1851 - years before the completed " Maine law , " and when there were probably not more than thirty saloons in Iowa ,  --  a law was enacted which declared every dram-shop a public nuisance , and prohibited the sale of intoxicating liquor at retail under heavy penalties . In 1855 this was replaced by an act of sweeping prohibition , with penalties better arranged for its enforcement , and forbidding all sales of liquor , except for necessary purposes , and then only under stringent regulations . In the same year the measure was submitted to a vote of the people , and was approved by a majority of nearly three thousand in a total vote of forty-eight thousand two hundred . Three years later there came a change . The introduction of the railway system had stimulated the growth of the large towns , introduced a transient population , and hence brought new factors into the State . About this time the effect of a heavy immigration from other States and foreign countries was also felt , and , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was modified in 1858 , so as to permit the sale of beer and . wine in cities and towns favorable to such license , with " local option* ' providing for entire prohibition where the community favored such course . This remained the law from 1858 until the adoption of the constitutional amendment in June last . * urelt was believed this modified " local-option * law was the incasbest adapted to a rapidly growing State where great extremes met . In many localities the original prohibitory sentiment had been overbalanced by the great inpouring of immigration . In some instances whole townships were taken up by immigrants from foreign countries , who thus sought to preserve the social life // and customs of their fathers secure from puritanical intolerance . This was off-set in certain villages of New England settlement , where the deed to every town-lot provided for a reversion of title in case intoxicating liquors were ever sold on the premises described . It was between such extremes that the Act of 1858 sought to draw the line of a golden mean . It was believed this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes of citizens , and tend strongly to suppress intemperance . It was argued that entire prohibition could not be enforced in some localities , and that the constant violation of the statute created a disrespect for all law . It was asserted that the use of such mild beverages as beer and wine would tend to drive out the stronger liquors , and introduce an era of arcadian simplicity , wherein the people would use the mild beverages in the temperate and praiseworthy manner said to prevail in some countries of Europe . It was represented that the brewers and wine-makers were the mortal enemies of the distillers , and the wine-drinking countries of Europe were adduced as examples of the blessed results soon to be reached in Iowa . With such liquors as brandy , whisky , and rum outlawed , and beer and wine provided as substitutes , it was believed the best possible law was provided . Stringent provisions were made against selling even beer and wine to minors , intoxicated persons , or persons in the habit of becoming intoxicated . Under this law the saloon-keeper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selling nothing but beer and wine , and these only to persons of upright walk and conversation . The argument in support of this law was plausible , and seemed to have a good foundation in the experience of other countries , and it was finally adopted in the firm belief that it would prove a panacea for many of the evils of intemperance . Municipalities could still prohibit the sale of all liquor ; the temperance societies were to continue reforming inebriates and pledging individuals to total abstinence , and no means of " moral suasion " was to be left unemployed . Many of the original prohibitionists had no faith in this law ' . They contended it would prove but a cloak for the evils it aimed to prevent ; that nothing short of entire prohibition could reach the end desired . Almost from the outset they could point to the conffrmatiou of their fears . The great body of the people held , however , that it would take time to effect the change , and steadily resisted the frequent attempts to repeal the law and // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , they were brought to face the complete failure of the experiment . It was found that saloon-keepers engaged in their business for the sole purpose of gain , and that avarice never permitted the restrictions of the law to stand in its way . At least four-fifths of the saloons systematically defied every regulation . Liquor of every kind was sold , and sold to minors , to intoxicated persons , and persons in the habit of becoming intoxicated . The use of beer and wine seemed but to create an appetite for the stronger drinks . The privilege of selling these beverages was used as a license to deal out anything the most depraved appetite could demand . The violation of law was systematic and notorious . The courts were burdened with liquor prosecutions , and the costs in many of the counties became enormous . The most euergetic attempts to enforce the law led to but partial success . Under this statute the liquor traffic held sway to work evil continually . It led more or less directly to crime : breaking the order of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doors of jails and almshouses ; bringing poverty to many a family and a dishonored death to many a victim . The law was violated in the tippling-shop and evaded in the courtroom . The saloon re-wrote the definition of perjury , and taught its customers , when in the jury-box or on the witness-stand , to aid in the evasion of the law . The forbidden liquors were sold under the name of those permitted , and witnesses would declare they were unable to tell which they had bought . Jurors were found to sympathize with the witness who was not an expert in chemistry . The partial license law , which had been adopted with such high hopes , was torn and dishonored in every part , and men usually truthful were taught a new code of morals , so far as its enforcement was concerned . The saloons were sheltered behind the presumption of legality ; the privilege of selling beer and wine was the cloak under which all the manifold evils of the liquor traffic were secreted and protected . Not content with blocking the courts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an organized force in the politics of the State . It had greatly extended its power during the long experiment of the wine and beer law . It had long been confined to the cities and large towns , but the rapid extension of the railroad system furnished quick transportation for liquors in bulk to every part of the State , and the saloons thus began to // thrust their malign influence into the rural communities . The managers of the liquor traffic no doubt realized the alarm which the extension of the saloon system was creating , for they made every effort to band themselves into a strong political force . Their vote was to be solid against any man who demanded the enforcement of the law . Witnesses , prosecutors , and all who sought to uphold the law of the State were proscribed . It was in this state of affairs that the great mass of moderate-minded people were converted to the support of rigid prohibition . They found the situation to be precisely what Governor Foster says it now is in Ohio , viz. : that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will control them . " In Iowa the saloons assumed this bold front , in face of the fact that strict prohibitory laws had passed the Legislature in 1851 and again in 1855 , and the principle had been approved by a popular vote . All that had been granted the saloons was a matter of concession ,  --  a matter of grace and tolerance ; but they seized upon and used it with intolerance and defiance . They appealed to the sword to perish by it . The managers of the liquor traffic , of their own choice , took the broad way leading to destruction . They not only determined to punish every citizen who demanded the enforcement of the law , but at last resolutely insisted that the people should not have the opportunity to express their will in regard to the liquor traffic . With threats and defiance they opposed even the submission of the question to a vote of the people . Thus their action could not be regarded merely as the evasion of a police regulation , but became a defiance of one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people to express their sovereign will , as they had always defied the law of the majority . The late President Garfield , with his power of touching the heart of a great question , once said the central thought of all American life was in this sentence from the Pilgrim covenant , made on the " Mayflower " : " We agree , before God and each other , that the freely expressed will of the majority shall be the law of all , which we will all obey . " It is easy to trace this idea into Iowa by direct importation ; no power had ever questioned it successfully here ; and when the liquor traffic made its defiance open and absolute , the people determined not to endure it . There could be no evils in prohibition so great as those from which they sought escape . They // might not be able to enforce the proliibition against the sale of liquor any more than they had been able to put an end to burglary and murder ; but they could , at least , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule where it belonged , as an offense against the fundamental principle of the State . Would prohibition prove impossible of enforcement ? Such had been most emphatically true of the partial license law . Would its violation tend to a disrespect for all law ? Surely its effect could be no worse than the license law in every day of its history through twenty-four long years . The people found the argument that prohibition would be violated and create disrespect for all law completely answered in their own experience . The only towns in the State where the law had been decently observed and respected were those which , by " local option , " were already under absolute prohibition . Where saloons were tolerated at all it was found that four-fifths of them violated the law constantly and systematically . The evidence was complete . The liquor traffic had defied all control , and the people accordingly passed on it judgment of death . Surprise has been expressed that such a result should be reached in a State having a voting population at least one-fourth foreign-born . It had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supporters of the liquor traffic . In truth a majority of the saloon-keepers are native-born citizens . The defiant attitude of the saloon-keepers aroused the indignation of the foreign-born citizens as much as any other class of the community . The election returns have demonstrated that thousands of this class voted for prohibition . In some counties threefourths of them were for the amendment . The election returns show just this : the foreign-born voters can be depended on to oppose prohibition only in localities where they are massed together in great numbers . The Scandinavian people were an exception to this rule , for under all circumstances they were unanimous in demanding the abolition of the liquor traffic . Of some other nationalities we have communities in Iowa where children of the second generation on this soil speak the language , wear the garb , and adhere to the customs of the fatherland . These localities were solid against prohibition , largely , it is thought , for the reason that in these communities there was less of the evil of saloons run on the " American plan , ** @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great indignation elsewhere . But the // election demonstrated very clearly tliat foreign-born voters are not so bound by traditions or old country customs as has been supposed . They come here with the same purpose as the immigrant from the Eastern States , - to found homes as well as fortunes , and to become members of a thriving , temperate , orderly community . Whether it be the influence of climate , the adulteration of liquors , or the nervous constitution of the people , may be disputed ; but thousands of our foreign-born citizens declare the fact that the use of liquor is attended with greater danger in this country than beyond the ocean . Where blended with other elements of population , and not massed together in close communities , our foreign-born citizens are as quick to abandon customs not adapted to their life here as they are to cast aside a garb unsuited to the climate . It is asked what assurance there is that the will of the people can be enforced against the great power of the liquor traffic . The answer must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in the spirit and character of the people who have adopted this measure , and who are determined to have it enforced . With a population gathered from every part of the world , it must be held remarkable that Iowa has been a State of such rapid assimilation . Iowa is an agricultural State ,  --  a land of homesteads and homes , where no great diversity of classes is to be noticed . It was truly said of this State , in the Iowa address at the Centennial , that there was " perhaps no other country on earth where so few people are either rich or poor as in Iowa . " Comfort and thrift are general ; great fortunes rare . Circumstances of independence and comparative equality have developed a high degree of public spirit . Actively engaged as the people are in their private affairs , they find time to exercise a watchful and exacting care over their public concerns . On all questions their opinions are pronounced and emphatic . I know no better illustration of this marked character of the people than is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New England blood which was early infused in Iowa made it one of the most determined anti-slavery States . John Brown , returning from Kansas , found unfailing aid and counsel in Iowa . After his wild exploit at Harper 's Ferry , when Yirgiuia was seeking eagerly for the fugitives who had fled from her jurisdiction , some Northern States , in their eagerness to placate the Old Dominion , strained and tortured the law in order to surrender // the persons accused ; but one who took refuge in Iowa found himself sheltered under every legal and technical right of citizenship . Governor Kirkwood absolutely refused to surrender him until Virginia had complied with the very letter of the law . A proclamation was fulminated by the Virginia Legislature , virtually accusing Iowa of treason to the Federal compact , but the people rejected the charge and warmly approved the resolute action of their executive . During the war , Iowa was one of the most radical of Union States , adhering to the tradition that the majority should rule . Afterward , it was the first to declare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiment with popular prejudice , but Iowa was for the proposition with a characteristic majority . Although the recent prohibition of the liquor traffic was declared at a strictly non-partisan election , and without regard to party , IL cite the political history of the State as the best illustration I can give of the spirit and character of the people . A mere vote is nothing ; the character of the people behind it everything . The action taken in Iowa is of deep significance only when it is shown that in their public policies generally the people have been pronounced , unchanging in opinion , and resolute in enforcing their will . Such is the record . For example : We know nothing here of the strange tendency in other sections of the Union toward a wavering balance between parties . Political parties elsewhere seem to have their feet in the sand , but Iowa stands like a rock . After twentyeight years of Republican control , the people have no desire for a change for the sake of a change . We know little of the theory that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of power . The affairs of the people and the affairs of the State alike were never in better condition than in this twentyeighth year of Republican sway . Iowa has grown from a frontier State into a young empire , its farms harvesting an annual produce greater in value than the yield of the gold and silver mines of the west , and its government directing the public affairs of a people numbering two-thirds of the population of the Republic over which George Washington presided . It has perfected one of the finest school systems of the country ; has reduced the ratio of illiteracy in its native population to the lowest found anywhere ; has made splendid public improvements and developed a noble system of charities ; while the public // 535 ledger shows the State wholly free from debt . A people who have conquered so many difficulties , and been so determined and unyielding in the enforcement of their policies , could not submit tamely to the domination of their greatest enemy . In recent years the liquor traffic has cost the people of Iowa *1O , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other respects much more . It blocked the courts , terrorized officials , and thrust itself boldfaced into politics . It was against the genius and traditions of the people of Iowa to endure it any longer . Lord Chatham said , in 1775 , in the House of Commons , that the true strength and stamina of a country must be looked for in the men who till its soil . " In the simplicity of their lives is found the simpleness of virtue , the integrity and courage of freedom . " In this state of " happy homes and agricultural life " it is such a people who have declared the outlawry of the liquor traffic . The spirit of the people gives every assurance that the effort to enforce the prohibition will be prosecuted with unflinching determination . Prudent , also , they will not attempt to gain in a day the results of years , nor adopt measures so extreme that they would defeat themselves . Just now there is a pause , owing to a doubt as to the legal effect the Constitutional amendment works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not it makes further legislation necessary . Cases now in the Supreme Court will determine this at an early day , and the path will then be clear . The effort will be worth all it may cost . A State which produces six tons of grain annually for each inhabitant can gain wealth ; with a public school system marshaled by twenty-one thousand teachers , it can reach a high grade of intelligence ; and surely it could refuse no just effort to shield its people from the untold evils of the liquor traffic . A State of thriving , prosperous people , set free from intemperance and the evils following , has been the dream of ages , and no citizen can hold a better aspiration than that such a result may be reached here ; that the name " Iowa * - given this great prairie between the Mississippi and the Missouri-may in its favored translation be made truly descriptive in this meaning of good hope- " This is the place .
