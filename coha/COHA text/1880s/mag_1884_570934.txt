ARTICLE IL-DARWIINISM AND CHRISTIANiTY . From the German of William Bender . By EDWARD G. BOURNE . DuBoIs IREYMOND , the standing secretary of the Academy of Science in Berlin , at the usual meeting in memory of the noted dead of the past year , gave expression , somewhat exuberantly perhaps , to the thought that Darwin had rendered the same service in the interpretation of organic nature that Copernicus was celebrated for rendering in the interpretation of our planetary system . The comparison of Darwin to Copernicus reminds me at the outset that the Christian faith , or what is commonly so called , is not involved in a conflict with natural science for the first time . This conflict is as old as the emancipation of science from the authority of the Church . When science , toward the end of the 17th century , began to attribute to mental and physical disturbances certain diseases which hitherto had been explained as coming from the influence of the Devil and evil spirits , theologians , lawyers and physicians vied with each other in shouting that Christianity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the devil deprived of his just claims . But Science has advanced and taken under its powerful protection those unfortunates who used to be racked and burned for alleged possession by the devil . If theologians have ventured to take delight in the interesti fig chapter on devils and demons , thenceforward only to be found in the less prominent parts of their dogmatics , the Christian faith has thereby suffered no loss . We have become accustorned also to esteem the Bible stories of the devil and demons as belonging to the notions of the distant past , but he would be a strange man who should wish to maintain that our belief in God and his Providence had lost its old power because we no longer earnestly believe in the devil and his fellows . The alleged struggle between Faith and Science had at that time appeared only under the form of a struggle between two voIJ. vii . 12 // theories of medicine : one , obsolete and theological ; the other new , rising into favor , and scientific . Advancing science rendered faith a great service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirits . Much the same state of affairs existed in another quarrel of those times . If we venture to believe the theologians of the 16th and 17th centuries the Christian faith was threatened by no greater danger than the rise of the Copernican system . To.day that system is taught in the schools . But on its first appearance it seemed to be nothing less than an outrage on the soul of the Christian faith . Not only was Galileo persecuted on account of the Copernican heresy by those who claimed infallibility , but Kepler , also , had to be warned by the Protestant consistory at Stuttgart not to throw Christ 's kingdom into confusion with his silly fancies . * Well into the 18th century the theologians resisted all acknowledgments of the Copernican theory as the most dangerous error . If we will go back in thought to that age we shall be able in a measure to understand the matter . The earth till that time was considered the solid center of the universe . Above , the vault of heaven was outstretched ; and far down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place of the miserable who were damned . In that solid vault of heaven rose the throne of God from which Christ came down to redeem men from the wrath of God through the shedding of his blood . And thither he returned in the body , borne up by the clouds , to prepare a place for his followers in the upper world of the blessed . Now came the Copernican theory to teach us to recognize in the earth but an atom of the whole universe ; to break through the solid vault of heaven where were enthroned God and the blessed , and to spread open to view the immensity and infinitude of the universe . Where was now that heavenly place , the throne of God from which Christ descended and to which again he ascended ? Where were the mansions of the blessed for which all Christendom had been hoping ? All had been swallowed up in that infinite space where for teons the constellations had revolved , full of inspiring majesty , indeed , but cold and dumb before the question of the human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home of the blessed was forever snatcbed from its eyes . Indeed , he who knows how religious faith always adjusts itself to a world , appealing to ideas of sense , understands how it must have felt shaken to its very foundations as it saw these fundamental notions explained away as illusions . Yet what was the result of this struggle between Faith and Science which lasted through two centuries ? I might express it in this way : the old theological cosmology had lost and Christian faith had gained by it . The notion that the earth is the center of the universe , that the heavens are a solid place above us , and hell a no less fixed place be . neath us-in short all those views of nature which the Bible shared with antiquity are irreparably gone . We know that we know nothing of the heavenly world in which we believe . We know that all our ideas of heaven and hell , of being lost and being saved , of resurrection and going to heaven , are only symbols which we use to designate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to evolve a topography of heaven as a physiology of our heavenly bodies can never be renewed . But though the Copernican theory has made a more powerful attack on the old ideal world of the theologians than the later philosophical criticism , yet it has not been able to destroy the religious belief in immortality , in salvation , and in judgment . On the contrary it has transferred this belief from the realm of sense to the realm of spirit by showing that it can only be based upon the ideal data furnished by the history of civilization and upon the eternal postulates of human feeling . The alleged struggle between Science and Faith at that time developed into a struggle between the obsolete theological and the new scientific cosmology . If we wish to understand the quarrel historically , we must be careful to remember that in the middle ages theology was the universal science , which would derive from the Bible not only the laws of moral and religious living but also the laws of physics , medicine , astrology , psychology , etc . Thus it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence on all subjects and that the principles of natural science , medicine , psychology , were presented to the world as religious truths to be received on faith . // Therefore the history of the development of science since the Reformation has assumed the shape of a history of the emancipation of science from theology ; while theology itself , when its claims to the character of the universal science had been disputed on all sides , was forced to set limits to its ambition and to retire into its own peculiar field  --  the moral and religious side of life . But even to-day , the theology of Rome maintains in all its fullness the right to bear sway in the whole realm of knowledge with its infallible Bible . The Protestant theologians , too , occasionally assert it in a modest way . Now I will return to my subject . Is the question which is involved in this strife between Darwinism and Christianity after all only a conflict between natural science and theology and not between science and faith ? Or , to express myself a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the case with the Copernican theory , a conflict between old theological nature and modern exact science ? Or have we really this time a coliflict between the Christian faith and advancing science ? In answering this question we must clearly distinguish between the doctrine of the descent of man , properly speaking , and dogmatic Darwinism which has been inclined to work this doctrine in the interests of materialism . This doctrine of the descent of man is undoubtedly opposed to certain traditional views of theological anthropology , but not at all with any of the vital interests of the Christian religion . This is the first thing we have to show . But where this doctrine is enrolled in the service of materialism , we find assuredly an irreconcilable opposition between Christianity and dogmatizing material science , which in deriving dogmas from its hypotheses , gets out of its proper sphei-e just as much as theology did when from its religious beliefs it derived theories of anthropology . This is the second point . We can not too strongly insist on the weakness of our comparison between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved scientific truth , while Darwinism , in the first place , is neither more nor less than scientific hypothesis . What it asserts is well known . According , to conjecture the different species in organic nature ,  --  since they are the first subject of discussion ,  --  have not always existed side by // side without variation , nor did plants , animals , and man come rn their perfection , from the Creator 's hand , as plants , animals , and man . According to conjecture , the organism , in the course of infinite periods of time , developed into well-defined species , and in the following manner . Under favorable external conditions the lower species passed into higher , plants were transformed into animals , from which , mankind . As was said , this doctrine of transmutation , of the variation of species , of the development of the higher species from the lower , is , in the first place , still an hypothesis . But it is an earnest , scientific hypothesis which , as a principle fruitful in discoveries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural science . The hypothesis , too , is so ingenious and , superficially regarded , so luminous , that we can not be surprised that , even before scientific proof has been brought forward , it has met with extraordinary recognition and circulation far beyond the ranks of professional men . Further , the probability of the hypothesis appears the strongest on just the point where the religious interest is set aside . For the investigations of the last year in the history of language and civilization and in anthropology has shown , almost beyond a doubt , that our race has developed from comparatively rude beginnings . The development of the human race has been upward , not downward . There can scarcely be any doubt on the point . If we compare the tribes , who , to-day , are said to be in the state of nature , with civilized people , not to mention idiots , we certainly can say without exaggeration that we know human beings separated from us by as great a gap as the beasts of the field are . It is at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men ? rom animals simply as an absurdity and to expose it to cheap mockery . It is much more expedient , in view of the spread of the hypothesis among the lower ranks of people , earnestly to ask , in case it is sooner or later proved , what losses we must suffer in respect to our Christian faith or what correction of it we have got to undertake . // Now I maintain that the doctrine that man , during the immemorial past , was developed from one of the higher species of animals , does not put an end to our belief in his higher destiny , or in what is commonly implied in the expression " being in the image of God . " This belief remains what it was before , an ideal , moral postulate of our spirit . But the doctrine of the descent of man does most surely put an end to the old theological anthropology which in junction with the Old Testament teaches that man came forth immediately from the hand of God in a state of absolute perfection only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the animals , yes , even lower than the animals , so that a second creation was necessary to restore the image of God in him . This latter theory , to be sure , long before the rise of evolution , had been corrected by modern theology or laid aside . We have alluded to the idea that the belief in the moral endowment and destiny of man , leading to a likeness to God , has nothing to do with any means of outlining a history of the origin of the human race , nor can it have any paramount interest in the questions about the earliest development and growth of mankind . If we go back to the New Testament , which must be our standard in judging Christianity , we find nowhere any tendency to set up a theory of the appearance or of the descent of man , nowhere any attempt to outline a history of the origin of the race . The decisive question in the Christian religion is not about our descent but a question about our destiny . The Christian revelation teaches us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of true happiness . In the teaching and life of Christ the redemption offers us the means for the realization of this design , that we should have a likenes* to God , or " be in his image . " The New Testament looks so invariably at the ideal goal of the race that the question of its origin is hardly brought up . But where the question is touched upon , the New Testament only gives expression to the belief that man must be adapted for moral perfection , and that , as his human worth is certainly to be attained only in it , he exists or has been created by God chiefly for this ideal , moral task . Indeed , the New Testament is so thoroughly permeated with a feeling of the permanent value of this ideal // aim of life that it expresses the belief that the whole worhi chiefly exists for the sake of the kingdom of God , or what means the same , that it was made through Christ and with Christ in view . But at the same time , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives expression to the practical necessity which compels man to pass judgment on the whole world in which his human aims are to be worked out according to the standard of that which appears to him the highest aim of life . We know nothing about the origin of the world but " we perceive by faith that it exists through the word of God . " The first and great word of Christianity is not the belief in creation , but the belief in the destiny of man for a kingdom of God , in which he is to attain not only the fulfillment of the divine moral law but also the perfection of his own life . Belief in the creation of the universe is perhaps the necessary consequence of this belief in the moral aims of human life but in no way its basis . We find nothing in the New Testament to tell us how this ideal adaptation and endowment became a part of human nature , whether it is original or acquired . There is still less to tell us how , indeed , God made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the reflecting , intelligent , moral creature , or whether it pleased *him in his wisdom to suffer man to advance from lower forms of existence through gradual processes of development . In short , the New Testament addresses itself to the irrefutable existence of man surpassing in intelligence and ethical character all other creatures ; it does not ask how the " crown of the creation came into this existence , it gives no genealogy of our race . But if now the doctrine of man 's descent should be proved , if the proof should be brought forward that man did not come from a clod of earth as the Old Testament says , but from one of the higher animal species , could it impair our belief that this same man is endowed with spiritual adaptations and capacities which raise him above the animals , which show him to be a being capable of infinite perfection , a personal intelligence , a moral person , and , at the same time , the peculiar and unique image of the highest intelligence and perfection ? // I answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our race should be disclosed ; if to-day proof should be brought forward that some thousands of years ago we had reached about the rank in civilization which the Fuegians occupy , and several thousands of years further back , lived the kind of life led by the intelligent animals , should we form our judgment of man and his adaptati6ns and destiny from the point of view of the Fuegian or of the monkey ( which generally speaking would be incapable of one ) , or rather , as before , from the point of view of civilized pt*ople of Christian training which we have now reached . Our judgment of man can not be according to any degree of advancement whatsoever which mark his beginning ; it must be formed upon the whole history of his development . If we , according to the standard of our present Christian culture , are obliged to find our own essence in the intelligence which rules nature , and in the ceaseless impulse toward moral perfection , which takes hold of the conditions of our natural life , we shall in like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world according to the ideal standard , which the history of our civilization has established , and according to no other , whatever may be shown to have been our origin . We shall further keep fast hold of the belief that our destiny lies not behind us but before us ; that our life tasks are to be prescribed by the moral law of our spit-it , and not by the physiological laws of our development ; that we are to receive the rules and laws of our life in the world , not from the problematic book of our origin , but from the clear words about our destiny offered by Christian revelation . I repeat therefore : religious faith is concerned with the question of our own human lifedestiny , and we shall continue to think as Christians about our moral destiny to become like God , how much soever we may be obliged to change our view of our physiological origin . In so far , too , as we feel in wardly compelled to place the moral interest in the rank of unconditioned rules and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral government of the world , in which we live , and in an intelligent , moral world-cause , though we can make no declaration at all , with the help of faith which certainly is not knowledge , as to how things began and as to the methods of the divine guidance of the world . // But the deficiency of the traditional theology as well as the ground of its conflict with exact science lies in this , that instead of interpreting and establishing Faith on a sound basis it has given much more thought to the derivation from it of scientific propositions about the mode of the creation of the world and man . We have then , no longer , a struggle between faith and knowledge , but one between theological and scientific anthropology . To be sure the objection will be made that the old theological anthropology is derived from the Old Testament if not from the New , and must be unconditionally preferred to every modern system of anthropology because the Old Testament is as much inspired as the New . Quite the same argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advocates of the theological cosmology against the theory of Copernicus . What can be urged against it ? Right here we might ask the question : what kind of an idea of divine inspiration and revelation is that which would include under them , perforce , a communication on the ways and means used by God in the creation of man ? So far as I know , the character of revelation has been ascribed in the Church only to such doctrines and events as stand in some assignable connection with the salvation of man . Bat how in the world can it be shown that our salvation depends upon any revealed or not revealed theory of the origin and development of organic nature ? Granting , however , that the Old Testament account of the creation of man came through inspiration , how much more do we know about the problem of the origin of things ? We find this process of origination just as problematic with the Old Testament as without it . It has been truly said that we know nothing at all about the beginning of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story as revealed or not . Such also must have been the opinion of the apostle Paul who , at all events , had once an opportunity to make a declaration about the history of creation , namely , in the Epistle to the Romans , where he sets forth in so impartial a way the prerogative of the Jews as compared with the Gentiles . There he declares that the Gentiles had the moral law written in their consciences , while the Jews possessed it in palpable shape in the tables of // Moses ; the Gentiles had recognized God 's creative power from his works-be does not continue while the Jews possessed an inspired account of the manner of creation . If Paul had seen in the Bible history of creation what certain Jewish Christian theologians would even to-day see in it , it would have been inexcusable in him to omit that opportunity to extol the advantages ' of the Jews . But disregarding the fact that , when we measure the Bible story by the standard of scientific requirements , it gives no disclosure about the origin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious cosmogonies of antiquity , with a judgment of faith in rather than with an inspired scientific theory . It answers Faith 's question , how the pious Israelite represented to himself the beginning of the world , rather than the scientific question how the different kinds of existing things came into being . The fact that this faith-knowledge is arrayed in historical form does not change its character . The fact that it is in a certain degree illustrated by the naive views of nature entertained by antiquity has just as little effect upon it . The value of this story lies not in its historical dress nor in its form as history of nature , if we may use the phrase , it lies in the notion it gives of the relatively high and pure idea of God and his relation to men , formed centuries before Christ by the pious Israelites . But if we take the story just as it is , it tells us nothing about a condition of perfection surrounding men in the beginning , it finds the image of God like ancient philosophy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to rule nature . The moral quality which Christianity has taught us to regard as the specifically human attribute appears there , though still materialistic as in all Israelitish religion . Yet whatever may be the bearing of the Jewish cosmogony , it rests in any case on that untenable view of the universe which regards the earth as the center . It has already , on this point , been disproved by the Coperrncan theory . We need not wait for the proof of the doctrine of descent . The biblical history of creation is as valuable as testimony of the ancient Jewish belief ,  --  the belief in the intelligent , holy Creator of the world which we Christians share , as it is valueless when we apply the test to see how far it furnishes // a scientific solution , at all satisfactory , of the problem of the origin of the world and man . T hold this position , then : theology has absolutely nothing to do with deriving cosmological or anthropological theories from religious belief . It should show how and why we come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that man is in the image of God , how and why we can retain the belief in its strength in the face of IDarwinism as well as Copernicism . Thereby it will fulfill its task as a science of religion and not of nature . We have now advanced to a stage in the discussion where our conflict is no longer to be considered as a conflict between obsolete theological and earnest scientific anthropology . If we have reproached the theologians with having derived scientific propositions from religious belief under a misconception of it peculiar nature , we must now reproach their opponents with having derived dogmas from the propositions or hypotheses of exact science under a like misconception of its proper limitations , dogmas , too , which assuredly have a direct bearing on the sphere of religion and are only too often in open antagonism. with Christian faith . This has been done by the advocates of evolution . This hypothesis has been used to support and spread a belief in materialism . To furnish instances I need only mention the names of Strauss and ilackel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scientific hypothesis , evolution , and dogmatic Darwinism . Christian faith can with difficulty become satisfied with that hypothesis , but with the dogmatic conclusions drawn from it , it can never be reconciled . Now then we have no longer a conflict between science and faith , but between faith and faith , namely , between old Christian faith and materialistic faith newly arrayed with the help of the evolution doctrine . Let us look at this a little closer . Without entering the field of natural science we may as laymen draw a distinction between the doctrine of the descent of man itself and the doctrine of natural selection . The first only says , conjecturally , that the higher species have developed out of lower forms . It // does not decide whether this development was the result of outside influences only , or whether these outside influences were only the means , under favorable conditions , of setting free latent powers , especially those of a spiritual nature . The doctrine of natural selection , on the contrary , if I understand it correctly , recognizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , climate , time , etc. , immediately the causes and the only causes of the appearance of the higher species as well as of mental life . Now nobody disputes that the development of mental life depends upon physical conditions , but th' t these physical conditions are the causes of the development of mental life is an hypothesis which can not yet be clearly represented in ideas , much less supported by a single example . The notion that mind has developed out of sense is almost equivalent to saying that mind is merely a function of the physical powers . It has not been possible and probably never will be possible to show how nervous action becomes consciousness , or how a muscular movement changes into an act of the will . Certainly it is a gross self-deception to consider mind as a mere function of matter . If we begin in earnest to regard matter as the cause of logical , sasthetic , or moral and religious functions , we begin to regard as matter something which is no longer pure matter , if I may so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers we regard it in reality as spirit , and the whole conflict between materialism and idealism turns out to be a mere question of words . When we accept the doctrine of the descent of man , what more do we know about the essence of matter , of mind , and of the relations which subsist between these two fundamental principles which our thought must not only necessarily separate from each other but also unite together ? Viewed in a scientific light this doctrine has given us nothing , absolutely nothing , which has brought us even a single step nearer the solution of that eternal riddle . Therefore the working out of this hypothesis in support of dogmatic materialism is thoroughly arbitrary and unnecessary ; and further , we may judge about the grounds of belief in materialism after the rise of evolution in exactly the same way we were justified in judging of them before . // Here again now we can not insist too strongly on the point , that , when we discuss the contradictions between materialism and Christianity , just as before , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world , two kinds of belief , and not at all with the contradictions of science and religion . Materialism as a general view of the world does not come under the category of science , but under the category of religion . It has then to be measured by the standard which we , generally speaking , are able to apply to religious belief in accordance with its peculiarity . Therefore we may say that correctness and truth are to be attributed to every general view of the world according to its capacity to call forth and guarantee a true moral culture . In the first place we have to consider its qualifications to give us a general , satisfying , theoretical interpretation of the world which shall be equally just to spiritual and to physical facts . Every religious view of the world must base its right to life on its value as a means of culture . The capacity of a faith morally to ennoble men , to reconcile them to their condition in the world , to make them relatively happy in the best sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will always be the chief proof of its truth , if truth is the proper word . No faith at all , neither materialistic nor Christian , is theoretically capable of proof . But if we look at the practical value of these two as means of culture we can scarcely institute a comparison or raise the question of rivalry between them . What could materialism oppose to Christianity 's ideals of life ? Where can we find a view of the world which as a means of culture is to be compared with Christianity ? We ask the question because very many of our contemporaries have become unconscious of the immense value of the ideas of Christianity as a means of culture and chiefly on account of the unhappy mixture of scholastic theology and Christian faith . Surely , too , we have not only to deal with the moral ideas of Christianity but also with its specifically religious ideas . The belief that the guidance and government of the world is under the control of a highest Intelligence and a just Will ; the religious belief that above us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always ready to forgive , is certainly of just the same eminently practical meaning as the moral belief that our worth as men is no , t derived from the accidental circumstances , which condition birth and fortune , but only from our moral destiny . We have , however , been brought by a lazy habit into so external and mechanical a relation to these ideas on which our true living depends that moments of special illumination seem to be needed to enable us to feel and understand how they are bound up in us . The ideas and ideals which Christianity sets up are not our only subject . The real historical guarantees of their truth which it gives is : the incomparable historical helps for , their realization which it has had the disposal of , claim our attention . We need not remain standing in the porch , we should enter the Holy of Holies of the Christian religion , if we want to exhibit its incomparable worth as a practical means of culture . Is it possible to desire to retain the moral ideal of Christianity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means which the teaching and the life of Christ furnish us , for its realization , the certainty of reconciliation with God , the moral power of his Spirit which alone deserves the name of Holy Spirit , the hope in the coming perfection of the individual as well as of the world ? Indeed , only such hints as these are necessary to make the attempt , to attribute to the materialistic belief such value as a means of culture as is possessed by Christianity , appear either ridiculous or frivolous . But what , says , some one , is the good of laying so much stress upon the value of Christianity as a means of culture if so-called scientific truth is not on its side but on the side of materialism ? This prejudice is very wide-spread , but it is only a prejudice , as hinted above . But even on this point we may insist that purely theoretically considered materialism has no advantage over the Christian faith . Suppose the Christian view of the world to be one-sided , taking the moral interests of human life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a consideration of nature in a no less one-sided manner ? If the former is unable to solve the problem how the bodily world came out of spirit , the latter // is as little able to show how spirit is developed from matter , or how matter produces spirit . When looked at in a strictly scientific manner each view of the world leaves as many problems unsolved as the other . But when we test the capability of each , the materialistic as well as the Christian , to give men a satisfying explanation of their existence in the world , then , on the theoretical side the superiority of Christianity seems to be beyond question . We should also clearly maintain that general views of the world , so-called , do not , on the whole , admit of a strict scientific form , and that we have in them always a free explanation of the total life of the world from that standpoint which regards man as the center . We men seek a satisfactory explanation of the total life of the world , with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel satisfied with such a judgment only of the world as does not take away from us the ideal and moral interests , which are our standards , but gives validity to its own meaning when used to explain the world . From this point of view we may assert that , since Christianity makes the spiritual , not the physical world , its starting point , and consequently explains nature as a means of attaining the ideal aims of man , it interprets the world only by the standards of precedence things have for men . We do not need to become ascetics , if this attitude and the judgment of the world from it are explained as the one necessary for men and therefore true . Every one who accords to the ideal and moral interests their superior value must also recognize that from them our general view of the world should be derived . The truth , or as I should prefer to say , the just claim of Christian idealism take root thoroughly in the moral aims which by the power of the practical force of attraction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals as well as by society , as the standard laws of our existence as men . If any body wanted to make proselytes for the materialistic faith with the natural consequences he would have to give up our moral culture and bring Christian society back to the stage of men in the state of nature . But who would earnestly propose // such a thing . No fanatical adherent to materialistic dogmas will ever desire it . Therefore no one should dispute our right to judge of the world , its origin and final purpose in a manner corresponding to our moral culture gained essentially through Christianity . It ought to recognize that the Christian faith is not only the necessary consequence of our stage of moral culture , but also that it is the correct interpretation of the world by the standard of that moral culture .
