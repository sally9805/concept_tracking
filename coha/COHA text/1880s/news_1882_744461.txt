txt There are good reasons for believing that the Administration will before long , and not later than Dec. 1 , correct one of the errors committed by it during the recess of Congress . The error referred to was the removal of Major W. H. Daniels from the position of Collector at Ogdensburg . That removal , made upon what were believed to be trumped-up charges ; did more to inflame the Republicans of the northern and western counties of the State than any other act committed in a partisan spirit that has been attributed to President Arthur . To resent it the St. Lawrence Republicans did all that could be done , in conventions and through the newspapers , to have their opinions made known . It was rumored at the Saratoga Convention that attempts were made to appease the feeling of opposition by intimations that the wrong would all be righted if St. Lawrence would " do the right thing . " Everybody knew what that meant , and Assemblyman Abel Godard never lost an opportunity of explaining the meaning of the words when their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to exercise influence . Since the convention , and here in Washington , some facts about the removal hitherto not known have come to light . It appears that Assemblyman Godard is credited with originating the movement which resulted in Daniels 's removal and the appointment of Col. Harvey L. Jones . A party of Administration agent : , including John F. Smyth , DeWitt C. Wheeler , Stephen 13 . French , and one or two others , were at Alexandria Bay . To them ' was broached the scheme , with assurances that the removal of Daniels and the appointment of Jones would enable Godard to secure the delegates to the State Convention from the First St. Lawrence Nsblot for Folger . The Secretary of the Treasury was at home in Geneva . President Arthur Was in New-York . An order for the removal pf Daniels and the appointment of Jones was telegraphed iron New-York to the capital , and a few days later the news reached Ugdensburg thilt Daniels 's head had been taken off upon charges always believed to have been manufactured by malicious persons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ReDaniels expressions of confidence in Major Daniels were made by the people of the district . Go:lard 's part in the business was mown , and he iwrrowly escaped defeat at the polls in the recent electio. for no other cause while Folger got a large majority . It is now asserted by those who say they are correctly informed that Secretary Folger regarded the removal as a distressing mistake and would have prevented it if he had been in Washington . Collector Jones can only hold the place until the meeting of the Senate , or a little while thereafter , the law requiring that the President must , within 30 days after the assembling of the Senate , send in the nomination with the reasons for the removal of Collector Daniels . As Secretary Folger is reported to have swept aside the charges against Daniels as unworthy of consideration , it is difficult to see upon what pretext they can be renewed . It is understood that , iu justice to a good officer , who stands high in the estimation of his neighbors , Major Daniels will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permitted to resume his place . He came here on Monday and went home again last night , having had several talks with Secretary Folger on the subject , and having received satisfactory assurances of confidence from him . Expecting reinstatement as a matter of course , Major Daniels had nothing to say as to what course would be pursued in case of refusal or neglect on the part of the Administration to repair the injury to him as a man . From a well-informed politician from New-York it is ascertained that , in case Daniels is not reinstated and Jones is nominated to the Senate , Daniels will come to the capital prepared to defend himself to the last extremity , and to protest against the confirmation of Jones . If the fight is made , it will be a hot one , and can result only in intensifying a spirit of opp , sition to the President which is impatient and ready to break out in a renewal of the old fight in the shortest possible time .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
