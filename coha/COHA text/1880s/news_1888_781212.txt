txt The Court of Appeals yesterday rendered a decision reversing the sentence of the lower court and ordering a new trial in the case of Arthur J. McQuade , one of the Aldermen of the board of 1881 who was convicted of having received a bribe in the interests of the Broadway Surface Railway Company . aMcQuade , was sentenced to seven years in State prison at hard labor and to pay a line of $5,000 . Judge Andrews writes the opinion , which is very long , and in the result Judges Ruger , Earl , Danforth , and Finch concur . The reversal is made on errors committed on the trial , on the organization of the jury , and on the reception of the evidence admitted . The evidence principally objected to is that relative to the acts and condnet by other parties alleged to be connected with the bribery , and not made known until long after the termination , of the conspiracy which way organized to carry out the granting of the franchise of the Broadway Surface Railroad . The court holds that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It also holds that there were errors committed in handling the jury , and that incompetent men were allowed to sit upon the jury ; also that the court erred in overruling challenges . Judge Peckham dissents from the portion of the opinion treating of the order in which peremptory challenges should be made , on the ground that the statute is directory only . and not a matter of exception upon which to grant a new trial ; also from the portion of the opinion treating of the rejection of a competent juror as being an error upon which an exception might be taken . He agrees upon other matters digcussed in the opinion . Judge Gray dissents from the grounds of the conclusion in Judge Andrews 's opinion , but votes for reversal and new trial on the around that it was an error to charge the jury that the evidence of good character itself did ? not tend to prove that a man is not guilty or an offense . This error , he says , was not cured by anything in the rest of the charge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is entitled to a new trial . The announcement of the decision was , received in this city with eonsiderable surprise . During all of yesterday afternoon it was the one theme of discussion among politicians around the City Hall . District Attorney Fellows seemed to be in an unusually good humor wnen asked for his opinion of the decision .. Ho apparently took the oiltoome as a matter of course , but would not express an opinion until he should have read the full decision . His assistant , Mr. McKenzie Semple , on the other hand , was very blue over the result . Mr. Semple was notified by telegraph during the afternoon that the appeal had been granted and a new trial ordered . He stated that any movement for a new trial would necessarily depend on the points touched upon in the decision . It would , he said , depend upon these whether McQuade would be tried again , and how soon . - He was not prepared to say whether McQuade 's third . trial would occur prior to the trial of Cleary and Richmond , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of McQuade - would affect the case of O'Neill , who is now in Sing Sing Prison . Richard S. Newcombe , who was one of his counsel . hada conference with Col. Fellows yesterday , and again at the Hoffman House last evening . He requested that the amount of bail to be required should be less than before MoQuade 's sentence . Col. Fellows would not say what the result of the conference was , but he had previously stated that the bail would be the same as before ? $25.000 . Mr. Newcombe did lot care to discuss the decision until tie had read it carefully . It was enough for his present happiness that he had won the case for his client before the Court of Appeals . Gen. Tracy , who ' argued the ease for McQuade before the Court of , Appeals , said that he was delighted with the result . He said that McQuade would be brought- from Sing Sing to-morrow , and then would be released On bail . When asked if he had anything to say in regard to the evidence at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be determined in a great measure by the nature of the decision , and then the case may never Come to trial again . " De Lancey Nicoll said that he could not , of course , express an opinion until he had read the hill text of the decision . MoQuade 's case , he said , was tried and argued after the expiration of his term of office , consequently he had no feeling in the matter , excepting such as any citizen might have . Col. Fellows . when acquainted last evening with the points upon which a new trial has been ordered , said : " Of course I can not as yet give any extended opinion as to the effect of this decision upon the trial of the ether bribery cases . It will be necessary for me first to read the entire text of the opinion and learn all the reasoua for the different points . This much I can say , , however : The matter of the evidence in regard to the conduct of other parties alleged to be connected with the bribery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight of certain parties may be perfectly well left out without materially affecting the case . The point which is of especial importance is that in relation to the formation and handling of the jury . But here agtaih my opinion can as yet be only conjectural . " If the decision is merely upon a question of the method of selection and of the extent of the people 's right of challenge when the challenges are exhausted , and so oh ; it will be easy enough to change our methods in the future . But if , on the other hand , the court means to decide that the fact that a juror has formed au opinion in regard to the case makes him incompetent to sit as a juror , the decision will very seriously affect future oases . It would unquestionably in that case be impossible to obtain a jury in this county , for every man of reasonable intelligence must have formed some opinion on the matter . " I did not think that the court would find an error in the evidence identifying the accused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That would have been a very serious point , but as it is a question of quality of evidence , and not a question as to the legality of evidence , it would hardly have come within the province of the Court of Appeals In its justice to decide . To ho , " Ve made suolLa point would have been to try the case themselves . " Cal . Fellows was unable to say when the case would again be opened . " That is another thing . " said he . " which I can not tell until I have seen the full text of the decision and considered it . I can only conjecture as yet ; of course , how the particulars of the decision may affect the procedure . That is true also of alt the bribery cases . " When some or the points dwelt upon by the court as the foundation for a reversal of judgment were mentioned to Assistant District Attorney Semple last evening he said that , so far as he could determine upon a hasty- judgment . there was nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people in another trial of McQuade . The errors ' pointed out by the Court of Appeals would be avoided in another trial , and would not occur in the proceedings against the other persons under indictment who were yet to be tried . Mr. Semple regarded the reference in the decision to errors in the . reception of certain evidence as too obscure to warrant him in basing an opinion upon it . It might be of vast importance or it might amount to nothing at all as far as MoQuade 's next trial-or the trials:of the others were concerned . It would be necessary for him to know just what evidence was referred to before ho could state anything positively in regard to it . Errors in the organization of the jury and in the manner of handling it and errors of the court in overruling challsngee might not occur in further proceedings either against McQuade or the men still to be tried . As far as he could see there was nothing in the points presented ' to him which had " any bearing whatever upon the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could well be who saw a prospect of liberty before him , when seen at Bing Sing last night . Ho learned . of the decision of the Court of Appeals by a dire patch from his brother , Bernard , which lie had received at 3 o'clock in the afternoon . It simply said : " You are-granted a new trial . " - McQuade said it was no more than he had expected all along . He ought never to have been in the prison , for he Was uniustly convicted . He was glad to receive the news , and to got out on bail as he expected to do , although he had no definite idea how soon it would be ' effected . He added that he only recognised Gen. B. F. Tracy as his counsel , and said Richard S. Newcombe had nothing to do with his case . When asked about his prison life McQuade said that he had worked hard and enjoyed the best of health . He was in the laundry for sight months ; and for the last year had been an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had had good rations , and all the keepers , especially Principal Keeper-James Connaughton , has treated him first-rate . Mr. Connaughton said McQuade had been a very good man , doing his work thoroughly , and as he had never been ' reported for.any infraction of rules he had . never been punished . Ex-Alderman Henry W. Jaehne and John O'Neil ; when informed of the decision-in the McQuade case , expressed their satisfaction . Jaeline is still- at:work in the tobacco house . cutting and packing tobacco for the convicts , and.O'Neil is a-Walter'in the State shop . When Gen. Traoy was told that McQuade had stated that he onlyrecognized him as his counsel he said , emphatically . " He certainly spoke without knowledge . If I am to act as counsel for num so will Richard S. Newcombe . " The charge of bribery was preferred against McQuade on Aug. 29 , 1884. and an indictment was found against him by the Grand Jury then sitting . Ho was first arraigned for trial in the Fan ot 1886 , and this resulted in a disagreement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Nov. 29 , the second trial lasting until Dec. 15 . At this trial he was found guilty and sentence was pronounced on Deo. 20 , after a motion for a new trial had been denied . McQuade Went to Sing Sing the next day . McQuade appealed , through his counsel , from the judgment of the court to the General Term . The appeal to the General Term was argued by Col. Fellows on March 14. 1886 . A decision was rendered last May affirming the sentence . On May 19 McQuade appealed from the judgment of the Ger . eral Term to the Court of Appeals . The appeal was argued by Gen. Tracy for McQuade , and by Assistant District Attorney Semple for the people , in the latter part of June , 1888.
