John Walters Yes , we may thank our heels for the safety of our necks this time , my covey : I wonder if we will ever be so fortunate again ; but where the devil can Dick Darvil be ? Arm . Armstrong He ca n't be far off ; but I say , John Walters , did you ever see any one like Dick Darvil in all your life ? He hates the rich as though he had been wronged by them more deeply than ever man was wronged before ; it is easily seen that Richard Darvil was not always what he is now . Enter Darvil , R. 1 E. Dar . Richard Darvil You 're right , worthy associates , and most honorable comrades , I was not always the friend and fellow of beaten hounds , who feel the lash , yet lack the heart to show their fangs  --  brave men ye are , could ye but fight one half as well as ye run : he 'd be a hero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from your own shadows , that had not fright rendered you scant of breath . I should have scarce overtaken you  --  oh , he may boast himself a man , that excels the bettermost of you  --  especially in running . Wal . John Walters Why , the odds were too much against us , and how were you to escape else ? Had we made any resistance , to a dead certainty they 'd planked you  --  how did you escape ? Dar . Richard Darvil How ! Which way did poverty ever escape power by violence ? How ! Had I not the sledge-hammer in my hands , and in my heart the will to use it ? How escape ! Even as I would from a baying cur that flew upon my throat  --  dash him down and spring upon his body . Since I am to be hunted like a beast of prey , it will go hard but I dip my fangs in blood . Crosses , L. H. Wal . John Walters Humph ! Murder is a big word , Darvil , and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked together , we have stolen together these several years , but to take the actual life of a man  --  is  --  Dar . Richard Darvil Crosses . C Better than to lose ours by starvation ! Every man 's hand is against us , why not our hands against every man ? Per dition ! had you ever known the wild delight of having your clutch upon a rich man 's throat  --  to hear the lordly accents whine for mercy  --  to see him quail and shake beneath the power of the poor man he oppressed you 'd give your life , aye , twenty lives for such another triumph . Wal . John Walters Hush ! That sort of gab will string us up to dance on nothing one of these days . No , no , Darvil , a better way might be found to touch the ready  --  in your own little Alice there at home . Dar . Richard Darvil What of the girl ? Wal . John Walters Why , she 's mighty beautysome , and there 's many a rich cove would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dar . Richard Darvil Wretch ! would you have me sell my flesh and blood  --  make a market of my daughter 's shame ! Hark ye , sirrah , there be ties that have made a devilish bond between us , and I endure the brutish nature of the thing I use  --  but breathe you no more words against that girl as you would hope to live ! Arm . Armstrong Oh ! damn your sentiment ; Dick , you 're on your high horse , to-night , so good bye . Here , John , take the lantern , I 'll see you again in the morning . Exit , L. H. Wal . John Walters Well , now . I meant no harm  --  we are safe now , let 's go home . Dar . Richard Darvil Home  --  ave , to starve ! Home  --  to a cold hearth and a penniless purse , and with an ungratified hate  --  foiled and beaten , we must sneak back like hungry wolves to our lair . Ern . Ernest Maltravers Without R. H Hallo ! Hallo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scragged if the bulkies ar' n't after us . I heard voices , and as soon as Oliver ( moon ) peeps out , we are lost chickens . Dar . Richard Darvil Not without a deadly struggle first . He 'll be a bold man who leads the chase when the boar 's at bay . Looks out , R. H. Ernest halloos . No , no , ' t is but a single man  --  what can bring a man to this lonely common at this time of night ? Back , back , I say , and watch him ! They retire  --  Storm increases Enter Ernest , R. H. Ern . Ernest Maltravers Hallo ! Hallo ! No sign of human form or habitation on this lonely waste ! No guide , but those distant watch-fires that glimmer with a preternatural glare amidst the darkness ! How am I to make my way to the village . I think the wandering spirit of the Will o ' the Wisp must have led me here so late . Shall I never forget that I am no longer a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ernest Maltravers , heir to the oldest and wealthiest family in Cumberland , and just returning to my paternal home . What the devil shall become of me to-night in all this pitiless pelting ? Hallo ! Dar . Richard Darvil Advancing , R. Who calls ? Ern . Ernest Maltravers Ha ! thank heaven . I have a companion in my wanderings !  --  Save you , friend , can you direct or guide me to the nearest shelter ? I have lost my path in this wild common . Dar . Richard Darvil The village is far off  --  full five miles distant . Ern . Ernest Maltravers So far , and I am fearfully tired . Will you accompany me ? Dar . Richard Darvil It is very late . Walters advances L. , with lantern . Ernest . Ernest Maltravers Draws out watch . Stoop your lantern  --  yes , half past eleven . Crosses . L. H.  --  Darvil and Walters exchange signals . But it matters not complaining , if you will accompany me , friend , I will pay your trouble handsomely . Takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir , you 're a grandee , but if you would condescend to rest beneath my humble roof , it stands hard by , and I will go with you at daybreak to the village . Ern . Ernest Maltravers Offence , indeed , to a man ready to drop , and beaten to numbness by the storm . Lead on , friend , any shelter will be welcome , however poor , so it be honest . Dar . Richard Darvil Of its honesty , sir , you shall be better convinced before we depart . Ern . Ernest Maltravers On , then  --  but stay  --  I dropped my valise but now from sheer , fatigue , with the prospect of present shelter I can endure to recover it ; wait one moment . Exit , M. H. Dar . Richard Darvil Hell fights for us  --  the watch  --  the money  --  follow us to the house , but keep quiet until I summon you . Wal . John Walters Why not rob him here with less ado ? Dar . Richard Darvil No , it is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a desperate resistance  --  the body too would soon be found , and so near our dwelling , cause suspicion . Wal . John Walters The body !  --  why , you wo n't mur  --  der him ! Dar . Richard Darvil Wretch ! did you not bid but now a father sell his child for gold ?  --  for gold pollute the pure and vital stream that flows from his own veins ?  --  for gold hurl down the only holy thing that remains to plead for him above ! yet , you would have me tremble now , as if a stranger 's blood was dearer than my own ! Go to , hide yourself in the shed behind the house  --  there shall be no murder as you call it . Wal . John Walters That 's right , Dick it be n't safe  --  hush , he 's here . Re-enter Ernest with valise , R. 1 E. Dar . Richard Darvil Now sir , if you please . I 'll show you to a place of rest . As Ernest passes out , L. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bring the sledge-hammer with you . Music .  --  They exit  --  Walters carrying the hammer which Darvil had left on , R. H. SCENE II .  --  Interior of Darvil 's Cottage  --  every thing presenting the appearance of wretched poverty  --  before a few embers , L. H. , Alick is discovered kneeling and blowing them in a flame  --  A Door , R. 2 E. , and a Staircase the door fastened by a rough bar of wood through two staples , R. H.  --  Door in flat , L.  --  window in F. used . Furious Storm . Alice . Alice Rises . It is almost midnight , and yet no signs of father  --  what a dreadful night  --  how the rain plashes from the leafless branches of those weird-like trees , and the blue lightning streams over the wild common as if the earth were all on fire , in such a night I have heard that terrible murders have been done , and pale spectres arisen from their graves to fright the living into madness . Thunder and lightning . It is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no ear , no help within miles , save ONE  --  that which is above  --  on such a night , too , it is said the evil one has power to tempt poor wretches to sell their souls for gold . Heaven preserve us ! The door is shaken , and Lumley Ferrers calls softly Alice , Alice ! Alice . Alice Ha ! have my thoughts conjured a spirit ?  --  yes , the human spirit of evil ! He the tempter to infamy ! but he shall not enter . I am cold and hungry , poor and ignorant , but I am honest , and will keep so . Lumley calls again , Alice , Alice ! What shall I do ? Would that my father were here , stern as he is , he is still my father , though rough be the stem the root is nature 's planting . Ferrers dashes open the window and looks in . Alice Darvill ! Alice . Alice Ha ! you here again ? Fer . Lumley Ferrers Undo the door and let me speak with you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , pray be gone . I have no dealings with you  --  you shall not enter here Ferrers leaps in at the window . Fer . Lumley Ferrers There go two words to that , my pretty one . I am wet to the skin . Throws off his cloak so now , kiss me , my pretty Alice she turns away what , girl , do you know whom you refuse ? Alice . Alice Yes ; I have your word that you are a gentleman , your actions scarcely bespeak you a man . Fer . Lumley Ferrers Come , come pretty one , all this dignity is very becoming but very much out of place  --  I am a man of fortune and birth , in love with you  --  you are the daughter of the most notorious thief , vagabond  --  poacher  --  that  --  Alice . Alice Silence , sir ! whatever may be my father 's failings , his daughter 's ear is not the one to listen to their detail ! Fer . Lumley Ferrers Then I 'll speak of yourself  --  here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life , you , whose budding youth and excelling beauty might well become a coronet . Alice . Alice True , sir , I am often cold , thinly clad , and hungry ; where 's the remedy ? Fer . Lumley Ferrers In my love , my sweet little cowslip of the common , trust yourself to me , and I will wreathe that perfect brow with pearl and fold those graceful limbs in silk ; thou shalt sleep on down , eat off gold , and have no care save to vary pleasure . Alice . Alice And when that pleasure surfeits to be turned forth to suffer bitterer poverty without that best of antidotes  --  an honest heart !  --  oh , sir , sir , poor and ignorant as I am . I can confound your rhetoric . You talk of love ! I know that love exalts , not debases its object , you despise the peasant Alice too much to call her wife  --  she scorns you too much to be your wanton ! Crosses , R. H. Fer . Lumley Ferrers Aside . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silly here Aloud . All this is very fine , Alice , but in two words take my reply . I love you , you are necessary to me , if you will not listen to reason , you shall be mine by force . Approaches her . Alice . Alice Attempt no violence here  --  I am not alone Fer . Lumley Ferrers The devil you 're not  --  why , who protects you ? Alice . Alice Takes up a gun R. H. Myself and this . You called my father " poacher , "  --  a poacher needs a gun , and his child knows how to use it . Fer . Lumley Ferrers Aside . What a virago ! Well , Alice , I see you have a spice of the devil in you , and that will fit you the better for me . Farewell , this time , the next time I come for you it will not be alone . Exit door F. , which he leaves open . Alice . Alice What have I done thus to be singled out for insult ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , should he win my father to his purpose !  --  Hark ! he comes . Oh , heaven ! there are two steps  --  my father ushers the seducer to his child ! Sinks in a chair , L. H Darvil and Ernest enter D. F. Dar . Richard Darvil How 's this , what means the door unfastened . Alice girl , daughter , see you not the gentleman ! Alice . Alice Sinks at her father 's feet and hides her face in her hands . Father , father , force me not to look upon him  --  am I not your child ? Dar . Richard Darvil Are you besotted , girl !  --  fool I ever knew , but now you must either be mad or drunk . Up , up , I say ! Ern . Ernest Maltravers Do not be so rough , friend . Raises Alice . Look up , my pretty maid , and tell me if my presence here be painful to you !  --  if so , I 'll brave the storm , and quit this shelter instantly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harm you . Alice . Alice Looks up in confusion . A thousand pardons . I thought  --  I feared  --  excuse me , sir , I will come again instantly . Exit , R. 1 E. Dar . Richard Darvil The girl 's gone mad . I think Why . Alice , bring what we have for supper . Calling . Are you known in these parts , sir ? Ern . Ernest Maltravers Oh no , not now . I have been abroad for years , and am just returning home . Dar . Richard Darvil Probably they expect you ? Ern . Ernest Maltravers No , not for these six months  --  but , why do you ask  --  are you a resident here ? Dar . Richard Darvil I am . Ern . Ernest Maltravers And work in the factories . I suppose ? Dar . Richard Darvil My employments are various  --  but , here 's your supper . Enter Alice , with supper , R. 1 E. It is but little we have , sir , but you 'll fare better to-morrow . Ern . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; this supper , and this chair for a bed , are luxuries compared with a night passed on the common . Dar . Richard Darvil No doubt you will sleep sound to-night . Ern . Ernest Maltravers To Alice . Prettiest of lasses , after having frightened you so much on my entrance , I must hear from those sweet lips that I am welcome , ere I can eat with pleasure . As he kisses her hand , Darvill locks D. F. , and takes away the key . Alice sees him and is going to speak to Ernest when Darvil comes between them . Dar . Richard Darvil Eat , sir , eat . Alice is country bred and understands no fair words . I will fetch more fuel , and then leave you to sleep . Exit with gun , R. 1 E.  --  Music .  --  Ernest sits at table  --  Alice examines the door , looks for the gun , and finding that Darvil has taken it , softly approaches Ernest . Ern . Ernest Maltravers Sweetheart , these coarse crusts would be well digested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Alice Hush ! Have you much money about you ? Ern . Ernest Maltravers Advancing . Oh , the mercenary baggage ! Does she sell her kisses so high ? Why , my dear ? Alice . Alice Give it to father , or it may cost you your life ! Ern Ernest Maltravers Ha ! what mean you ? Alice . Alice I hardly know , yet I fear for you  --  escape when we are gone ; rain , wind , and darkness are better to brook than the envy with which poverty views wealth . Hist ! he is here . Enter Darvil , R. 1 E. , with faggots .  --  Music .  --  He comes between them and throws off Alice with fury . Dar . Richard Darvil Forward wench , begone !  --  and you , Mr. gentleman , take notice that my daughter is no safe manor to poach on  --  come , mistress . Alice . Alice I follow you . Music .  --  As Darvil , makes up fire , Alice , in pantomime , tells Ernest not to sleep  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 'll not let the fire out if you please !  --  good night . Pray remember ! Ern . Ernest Maltravers I shall not forget . Alice and Darvil go off , L. 2 E. , up stairs . Darvil takes the bar of the door with him . Forget  --  if I die to-night , or live till age chill my blood , I shall never forget you , lovely , generous girl ! Fool that I am , shall I never learn prudence ? Well , here I have at least the kitchen poker , and , at the worst , it is but man to man  --  he will not find and easy prey . Thus I await him . Takes up poker and stands in attitude of defence as Scene closes . SCENE III .  --  The Shed behind the Cottage , 1 G.  --  Dark . Enter Darvil , L. 1 E. , with Lantern and Hatchet . Dar . Richard Darvil Why should I hesitate ? It is but a blow , and one that ensures me wealth for months to come . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?  --  is not self-preservation the first law of nature ? Shall I rot by inches and see my fair girl pining to the grave , to save a stranger 's life ? One too of those accursed Gentlemen who think because they roll in gold they may insult the poor . and pollute their children with impunity . A low whistle heard . Ah ! Walters is here , then his fate is fixed . Come in , fool , why do you linger , his purse and watch are worth two hundred guineas ! Alice . Alice Who has entered , L. 1 E. And how does that concern you , father ? Dar . Richard Darvil Death  --  Alice here ! I thought ' t was Walters I spoke to . Alice . Alice And what should bring John Walters here at this time of night ? What work is on hand ? Dar . Richard Darvil Fool ! what 's that to you But , since you must know , we intend to-night  --  Alice . Alice To commit a murder . Dar . Richard Darvil Ha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?  --  why are you here ?  --  what bloody work needs the aid of Walters ? Father , you would murder the stranger for his gold  --  but , you shall not ! Dar . Richard Darvil Fool that you are , think you I would risk my neck ? Should I not lose my life ! Alice . Alice Aye , and deserve to lose a thousand ! Father , he who lifts his hand against a sleeping guest , is guilty of a crime that has no name save that of horror  --  he who violates the sanctity of faith and breaks through nature 's holiest rites , deserves to be thrust forth from man , and herd alone with beasts . You would do this  --  but you shall not ! Crosses , L. H. Dar . Richard Darvil I shall not  --  who will prevent me ? Alice . Alice I will prevent you  --  you shall strike through my heart ere you harm a hair of that noble stranger 's head . Father , I have said it ! Exit , L. 1 E. Dar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Walters ! Enter Walters , staggering , R. 1 E. Wal . John Walters Heigh , ho ! Dick Darvil , is that you or the devil ? Dar . Richard Darvil Silence , beast ! Death and hell , have you been soaking when most you need your senses clear ! be silent and be sober , brute , or I will begin this night 's work of blood by dashing out your brains ! Wal . John Walters How you talk , Dick . By the hokey , man , there 's no knowing what to make of you ; some times when I hear your big words and see you hold your head so high , I think you were not always Darvil . Dar . Richard Darvil You 're right : I was not always the wretch I have become . Listen to me , and then wonder if you can that I hunt the proud ones of the earth with a hatred unto death . I was born a younger brother , to a race possessed of fortune , rank and power , but because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slavish acquiescence to my father 's will , he cast me from his heart , and gave my eldest brother that love which was once my soul 's inheritance . God , how I once loved that brother ! Even now , when I recall his noble features , courteous accent , and winning smiles , which made all hearts his own . I feel my heart grow womanish ; let me remember how he wronged my love , and turn my tears to blood . I loved  --  the object was rich in beauty and in worth , but poor and lowly born . I married her , for I had n't learned the cruel cunning of the great to trample all beneath me , and for that I could not be a villain , my father called me a disgrace and cast me from his heart and doors . Wal . John Walters Cursed rough , to be sure . Dar . Richard Darvil We wandered forth as outcasts and beggars for years , my young and lovely wife was made to suffer the bitterest gnawings of poverty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes  --  I snared a hare to give her food , was seized , manacled , and dragged before the great man whose game laws I had broken  --  that great man was my brother . Wal . John Walters Oh , hookey ! Dar . Richard Darvil My proud father had gone down to the tomb of his ancestors , my brother was the sole lord of house and lands , and not ( as I then thought ) offered to share them with me . Fool that I was  --  dolt , idiot ! I believed his smooth professions and gave him from my heart the deepest warmest gratitude . To my wife he seemed the kindest , gentlest ,  --  the most damned of villains ! She became , for the first time , a mother . Alice was born , the loveliest thing the earth e'er shone upon , but hell rose in my heart , for I thought the infant smiled too like my brother ,  --  then I saw the cause of all his cursed care . Maddened with my wrongs . I struck the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her seducer 's blood , before my faithless wife , cursed her in the bitterness of soul . I saw her fall senseless to the earth  --  I could not , no , I could not take her life , but I seized the unconscious infant and rushed away to be a hunted criminal and a branded felon  --  she died , they said , withered like a broken lily  --  so , so . I struggled to forgive her in my heart and cherish little Alice for her sake , but I have revenged her fall upon the proud oppressors of the land , and deeply sworn to lay her cursed betrayer low as his perfidy hurled down his hapless victim . Walks away agitated . No more of this ; remember the business for which we are met ; the time has come . Wal . John Walters You 're a desperate man , Darvil ; it 's true I 've been lushing a little , but I 'm not so boosey as not to remember the work on hand , so do n't begin flashey but tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swell cove when we have finished him ? Dar . Richard Darvil Yonder deep pond shall answer for it , forward , now remember to strike one blow and a sure one . Music .  --  Exeunt , L. 1 E. SCENE IV .  --  Same as Second Scene Ernest discovered . Ern . Ernest Maltravers This then is the end of all my wanderings to be murdered within a few miles of the home I 've not seen since boyhood . Can it be so ? Courage , courage , Ernest Maltravers , and you will baulk the villain yet  --  let me but once get out upon the common and I will trust my life to my speed , but first I 'll prevent their return for a while . Goes to door , R. 2 E. By heavens ! the staples are empty , the bar is gone , their plan is deeply laid , nothing remains for me but flight goes to door in flat locked and the key gone !

Away  --  you are free  --  I have saved you ! Ern Ernest Maltravers Generous maiden ! thanks for your kind endeavors , but I can not fly , the door is locked . Alice . Alice Produces key Behold the key  --  I watched him where he laid it  --  I waited until he left the house  --  I besought your life in vain  --  I told him he should not harm you , and he shall not .

Fly ! each moment is laden with your life  --  away ! away ! Alice . Alice Farewell awhile , we will meet again , sweet Alice , and then I 'll say how much I love you . Presses her to his breast and exit , D. F. , she stands looking out and calls after him . Alice . Alice To the left  --  to the left ! Keep to the left hand of the river .

Alice You can not , it is firmly barred . Dar . Richard Darvil Liar ! the bolt is gone . Alice . Alice Aye , but into the staples I 've thrust my arm , and he who enters . first must break it . Wal . John Walters Leaps in at the window . You forget the window , my covess . Music Chord .  --  He drags her from door . Darvil enters with hatchet . Dar . Richard Darvil Down , R. H.

Maltravers You are a very sensible young man , Mr. Lumley Ferrers  --  a very extraordinary young man , as I may say  --  and I only wish it had been my luck to have had such a son and heir instead of my headstrong , brain-sick , romantic Ernest . Fer . Lumley Ferrers ( R ) Oh , sir , you do me too much honor ; but you must remember that my friend Ernest is yet very young , and  --  hesitates  --  perhaps he has not fallen into the very best hands . Sir Wm . Sir W. Maltravers Oh , sir , there you touch the very life , the very marrow , as I may say , of my apprehensions . What else can account for his long absence from home , and his perverse indifference to the beautiful heiress Lady Florence , whom I have chosen for his bride ? Here he is away mystifying at Gottingen for five years : he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a thunder-clap , looking like a ghost , and with a long rigmarole story about being waylaid and murdered by the way . Fer . Lumley Ferrers Smiling . Not quite murdered , sir . Aside . Though I wish to heaven he had been . Sir Wm . Sir W. Maltravers Well , I introduce you to him : he has made your acquaint ance before , he praises your courage , vows he owes his life to you , opportune arrival , an , when curiosity is at the highest , declares he has bound you in honor to be silent . Is not this aggravating , and , as I may say , devilish conduct ? Fer . Lumley Ferrers Why , it is rather annoying . I must confess , but that promise must plead my only excuse for not satisfying your very reasonable curiosity . Sir Wm . Sir W. Maltravers Ah , Lumley , my dear fellow , be a good boy and give me a hint . Not tell , you know  --  oh ! no  --  but just drop a hint of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  my honor ! Sir Wm . Sir W. Maltravers But I will put it in an honorable point of view . You told me that you owe money . I have a few loose hundreds much at your service ; you can pay your debts , and that is honorable conduct . Fer . Lumley Ferrers I confess , sir , your arguments are most conclusive . Well , suppose  --  only suppose , you know  --  Sir Wm . Sir W. Maltravers Aye , yes  --  suppose  --  or , as I may say , imagine . Fer . Lumley Ferrers That Ernest had become entangled  --  only entangled  --  Sir Wm . Sir W. Maltravers To be sure  --  only entangled  --  or as , I may say , taken in with  --  Fer . Lumley Ferrers Yes ; taken in with  --  with  --  a woman . Sir Wm . Sir W. Maltravers The devil ! Oh , the vicious  --  or , as I may say , the shameless young dog ! Keep a girl !  --  abominable ! Fer . Lumley Ferrers Aside . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half a dozen did n't serve him . Aloud Oh , fie ! my dear sir , for shame ! I did n't insinuate such a thing at all . Ernest is too virtuous . No ; if he is indeed connected with this female . depend upon it she is his wife . Sir Wm . Sir W. Maltravers His wife !  --  What ! By all the blood of the Maltravers ! you stagger  --  as I may say  --  astound me ! His wife !  --  What ! he darr to marry a nobody knows who ?  --  and he the heir to all the Maltravers ! I 'd rather he 'd kept a seraglio ! I 'll turn him out of doors ! Let him marry Lady Florence or look to it ! Fer . Lumley Ferrers Pray , sir , remember he is your son . Sir Wm . Sir W. Maltravers Son me no son , sir . Go to him , Ferrers ; talk to him ; tell him what I say . For I swear to you , if he has done this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , by all the blood of the Maltravers ' !  --  and I 'll marry Lady Florence myself . Exit , R. H. Fer . Lumley Ferrers So , the first stone of the building is well laid . Ernest has married Alice Darvil , and , if I mistake not , begins to be rather sorry for his romantic Quixotism . This fury of his father 's will finish his disgust for his cottage bride , and the pretty Alice will be very much at Lumley Ferrers ' service . Lady Florence , too , if I do not flatter myself , casts softer glances at the obseqaious Lumley than on the indifferent Ernest , and her large fortune is quite desirable . Ha ! here she comes . Enter Lady Florence , Lady Florence singing , R. H. " And it 's oh dear what will become of me , Oh dear , what shall I do ? There 's nobody coming to marry me  --  Nobody coming to woo . " What , Lumley Ferrers , the gallant and gay , imitating the cold philosophy of Ernest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemplations in the lonesome cells . Pray , what may be the subject of so unusual a reverie ? Fer . Lumley Ferrers Bows . As the subject now presents itself , any attempt to describe the picture would be useless . Flor . Lady Florence Looks cautiously round . The original ! Might a body see it ? Fer . Lumley Ferrers By glancing in yonder mirror you will . Flor . Lady Florence Excellent ! What , then . you mused on me ! Well , now I know the text , may I not hear the commentations ? Fer . Lumley Ferrers Certainly . The first division was beauty , the second grace , the third virtue , and the whole wound up with love . Flor . Lady Florence Then the subject was vastly ill-argued The preface should have been fortune , your first chapter treated of filial obedience , your second of neglect , and indeed you might have summed up with pity . Turns aside , agitated . Fer . Lumley Ferrers Kneels and takes her hand . Pity !  --  pity you !  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  can pity be connected with you ? Yes , it can ! I pity myself that I have ever seen  --  have ever loved you ! Flor . Lady Florence Oh ! pray rise , Mr. Ferrers ; you know I must not listen to this language . I came here indeed by my father 's will to be courted , but not by you , unless Mr. Ernest Maltravers has delegated the disagreeable office to you as his proxy . My friendship , however , is yours , and were I blessed with a free choice , it might  --  Fer . Lumley Ferrers Ripen into love . Thanks !  --  thanks ! Flor Lady Florence I ca n't tell , but I will sing you a song about it . SONG . " TEMPLE TO FRIENDSHIP . "  --  Moore 's Melodies . A temple to Friendship , said Laura , enchanted , I 'll build in the garden  --  the thought is divine . Her temple was built , and she now only wanted An image of friendship to place on the shrine . She flew to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendship the fairest his art could invent , But so cold and so dull that the youthful adorer Saw plainly the way not the idol she meant . Oh never , she cried , could I think of enshrining An image whose looks are so joyless and dim . But yon little god upon roses reclining . We 'll make , if you please , sir , a friendship of him . So the bargain was struck . With the little god laden She joyfully flew to a shrine in the grove . Farewell , said the sculptor , you 're not the first maiden Who came but for friendship and took away love . She acts as she sings to Ferrers.  --  End of song Enter Ernest , reading , R. 1 E. Flo . Lady Florence Crosses to Ernest . A fair good morning to you , most serious , solemn and sagacious cousin . May we in all humility inquire of your wisdom what it is you study so profoundly ? Ern . Ernest Maltravers Bows stiffly . It is a German work , madam  --  Zimmerman on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! doubtless you are his admiring disciple . Mr. Ferrers , I know not how you may receive the hint . but my woman 's wit interprets it into an intimation that Mr. Ernest Maltravers wishes to be alone  --  Zimmerman revered  --  good-morning . Curtsies and exit , L. H. Ern . Ernest Maltravers Ferrers , give me your advice ; my situation is replete with difficulties . I am acting like a brute to a lovely , amiable woman , and she pesters me with entre dies to acknowledge her as my wife . Fer . Lumley Ferrers Doubtless  --  doubtless she is in haste to claim her new-honors , Ernest . I am sorry to give you cold comfort . Some officious , prying busy-body has given your father a hint of this ; he 's enraged beyond bounds . He questioned me and bade me tell you if that were true , you were no more a son of his . Ern . Ernest Maltravers Gracious heavens ! he is likely to keep his word . My grandfather as I am told disinherited my uncle Richard for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connections are not only poor , but shameful . What shall I do ! Fer Lumley Ferrers There is only one way to escape ruin . Your father may forgive your not marrying Lady Florence , but never your union with Alice Darvil . That he has heard of her it is plain . Alice must be content to call herself your mistress . Ern . Ernest Maltravers By heaven ! Lumley , you are mad ! Never would I consent to such a scheme . You do not know Alice if you believe she would . I tell you there is more pride of virtue in that low-born girl than in twenty women of rank and fortune . Fer . Lumley Ferrers Humph ! Ernest , do you believe me your friend , and can bear to hear the truth ? Ern . Ernest Maltravers Can you doubt it ? You are my only adviser . Fer . Lumley Ferrers Then hear me with calmness and with patience . The character of Alice Darvil was not unsuspected when you married her . Ernest starts angrily . Nay , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have forced me to reveal this did you not by the obstinacy of this very girl stand now upon the brink of ruin . Ernest Maltravers , you have often asked me how I came so opportunely that night upon the common . Now I answer you  --  I was going to Alice Darvil . Ern . Ernest Maltravers Seizing him wildly . Wretch ! and yet you stood by and saw me married to a wanton ! Fer . Lumley Ferrers By heavens ! you would not hear me ! I did but notice to you that her father called her vile , and you were ready to strike me dead !  --  you would not eat , drink , sleep , or scarcely breathe , till you were married to her . Ern . Ernest Maltravers Fool ! dolt ! idiot that I was !  --  the dupe of a lascivious wanton ! But I will break the marriage  --  Fer . Lumley Ferrers Be calm , and you may : the clergyman is dead , and I , your friend am the only witness . Yet be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as your mistress ; so shall you see if love to you make any motive to her deception . Farewell , and pray be patient Exit . R. H. Ern . Ernest Maltravers Yes , as a criminal on the rack !  --  to seem so purely , so proudly virtuous ! Damned , designing , deceitful woman ! Exit , L. H. SCENE II .  --  A Garden with trellissed arbor , in which a small table is set with wine and fruit .  --  In the back a neat little Cottage is seen through trees .  --  pen , ink and paper at arbor .

Sink quickly sun and bring the welcome night which brings my Ernest here ! Enter ( L. H. ) Ernest , muffled in large rough coat  --  she springs to his embrace . My life . my love ! Ern .

Brings down chair , L. C. Ern . Ernest Maltravers Aside . Can this be art that wears the loveliest face of truth ? Could Ferrers be mistaken ! No . Was he not himself that night to meet her . Aloud . Words . Alice , are air ; actions are the heart 's index ; my evil fate forces me to test your gratitude and love ! Alice . Alice Springing up . Oh , joy ! joy ! joy ! past all expression .

You can not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you that I braved my father 's anger , the loss of my inheritance , and far more than wealth , my rank and standing amongst my fellow-men . Alice . Alice Forgotten ? Ernest ! Ern . Ernest Maltravers This danger has come to pass ; my father has discovered your retreat , and knows you live here under my protection . Alice . Alice Will that move his anger ! Ern . Ernest Maltravers Will it ? Are you mad , girl ! Will it incense the proudest man in England  --  the head of a family , so high in their own standing , that they have refused a peerage ! Will it incense such a man to know the heir of his house and blood is married to Alice Darvil , a common felon 's daughter , to be connected with whom , even in the sixtieth degree would tarnish all the honors of a king ! Alice . Alice Sinks gradually to his feet . Alas ! my father 's crimes are not mine ! Ern .

How can I avert his wrath ? Ern . Ernest Maltravers By denying yourself to be my wife .  --  A father will easier pardon a son 's immorality than disgrace ; say what you will , so you say not the truth ! This may redeem me ! Alice . Alice Rising . And brand me with the name of wanton ! No , sir , if your honor sleeps , mine remains awake ; I will not so wrong myself and you as to stamp infamy upon your wife . If , while rich in honesty and fame , I am unworthy to share your name , how shall I dare assume it when blighted with the withering mildew of my shame .

Why should I fear ? Do I not go on nature 's holiest errand ? Woman 's faith reclaiming recreant love ! Ha ! I see lights ! who at this time frequent the woods ? poachers or thieves , I fear , who may molest my path : I will retire and watch them . Music  --  Alice retires .

My wayward son , Ernest , has been to night attentive , or , as I may say , particular in his devoirs to Lady Florence : and my good friend , Ferrers , assures me that he will prove in all things conformable ; yet neither the lively dance or joyous song could amuse me for an instant , and I have retired alone to wonder at my melancholy .

Lady Florence Wealth , my dear father , is a poor caterer for the heart ; and as to accomplishments , the arts of music , drawing and dancing , would have been just as serviceable to Robinson Crusoe on his desert island as to me here .

To you I have ever been a fond , foolish , indulgent father , but from your very childhood my heart has been set upon this union .

See , the moon is shining brightly and will betray us to any lurking spies , let me entreat you to turn back . Ern . Ernest Maltravers You urge in vain ; the tale you told has set my blood on fire ; lost as she is to me for ever , I will once more behold my poor ill-fated Alice  --  will speak of peace and comfort to her distracted brain  --  will take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some holy sisterhood , then take a sad farewell , and in some foreign battle throw away my worthless life . Fer . Lumley Ferrers Heaven comfort you in this terrible affliction . Ern . Ernest Maltravers It does ; the deepest sting of anguish was to think my Alice guilty .

Music  --  Ferrers bends his head respectfully  --  Ernest motions to go  --  they go off , R. H. Enter Armstrong .

Ah ! who 's here ? answer , or die ! Enter Ferrers A stranger in our lair  --  by heavens , the very one whom I this morning captured . Ho ! what ho , there ! Brigands awake ! treason and treachery .

Richard Darvil What , two men on one ? and he armed with only a sword . Shame on ye ; put up , if ye be men . And you , sir  --  Turning to Ferrers ha ! is it possible , Lumley Ferrers  --  do I again behold you here ? Arm . Armstrong You do  --  for the last time . Draws a pistol , and fires at Darvil , who staggers and falls  --  at the moment , Ernest rushes in , and is attacked by numbers  --  Ferrers is wounded , staggers , and falls dead  --  Ernest is overpowering Castruccio , when Armstrong rushes to him . Arm . Armstrong Die ! die ! Ernest Maltravers , your life is a forfeit . Ern . Ernest Maltravers Ah ! villain ! robber ! murderer ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is on your sword . Arms . Armstrong And yours now mixes with it . Ernest overpowered , falls on one knee . L. H.  --  Armstrong raises in the act to strike him , when a wild scream is heard , and Alice rushes down between them and catches Armstrong 's uplifted arm . Alice . Alice Hold ! hold ! or strike thro ' my heart  --  it is the shield of his ! Music  --  All the Brigands rush to L. H. , and present their carbines , but immediately lower them , and fall on their knees , as Montaigne appears with Soldiers R. H. , who secure Armstrong . Ern . Ernest Maltravers Eternal heavens ! what do my eyes behold ? Alice regards him fixedly in a wild and wandering manner ; then with a scream , falls to the ground  --  Ernest regards her with horror .

Alice Sure , I have slept a heavy sleep ; the last chimes of the village bells are ringing  --  my father 's late . No , my husband . Did I dream that I was married . Alas ! I tremble .
