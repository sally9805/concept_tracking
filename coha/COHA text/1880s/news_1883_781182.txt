txt A number of outrageous acts have been committed on the line of . the Gwynnet and Walton Counties by four men . Last Saturday night John Stroud , James Tanner , Charles Buckhanan , and Ed Thompson bought a gallon and a half of whisky . They went to Mat Forster 's house , called him out , and told him they came to kill him . Seeing the men drunk and with pistols he withdrew into the house , barred the front door , and ran out through the doorway in the rear . Thinking he was in the house . they cut down the door , went In and demolished the furniture . The bed was cut into fragments , tables and looking glasses were broken into pieces , the bed-clothes were torn into rags , and a churn of milk was thrown all over Mrs. Forster 's clothes . Thelmen then left and went to Mr. Thompson 's house . They asked him whether be had a daughter , usiug vulgar epithets . Thompson took to his heels , followed by the man for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oaughters took to flight , and the wife was shot at just as she stepped into the yard , the ball lodging above the door . The men returned and entered the house , and acted in the same manner as at Forster 's house . They then prodeeded to Bonnifield 's house , but at this place they found more men than women and were driven off . The passions of the community are inflamed to a great extent . The drunken ruffians are at the bean of a pond near Windsor well armed , and have friends who act as informers to notify them of any approach of the people . They defy any one to arrest them . The citizens of Monroe have raised a purse to be given to the posse that arrests the men .
