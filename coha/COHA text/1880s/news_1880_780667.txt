txt The friends of ex-President Grant declare that there has been ap Jarent in the dispatches recently sent to the East from Chicago an intention on the part of the senders to misrepresent the ex-President 's strength in Illinois , and to assign to Mr. Blaine a great many delegates who were well known to favor the ex-President 's nomination . They do not hesitate to say that they believe the machinery for the transmission of political news from Illinois has been unfairly used in Mr. Blaine 's interest , for the purpose of inducing Eastern people to think that the ex-President is unpopular in his own State . Instances are referred to in which the sentiment of counties has been misrepresented in a shameless manner , and although it is believed that the influence of such statements will be short-lived , their character has aroused considerable indignation . Since the return of Gen Logan to this city from the West the supporters of Mr. Blaine have assiduously circulated reports that he has said that the ex-President can not expect to secure the vote of Illinois in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more confident of the ex-President 's success in Illinois than Gen. Logan , and he brands all such reports as those just referred to as unmitigated falsehoods . Gen. Logan informed the correspondent of THE TIMES to-day that there was not a shadow of a doubt that Illinois would send to the convention a solid delegation for ex President Grant . The great majority of the delegates already chosen , he declared , are supporters of the exPresident , and the sections of the State where the sentiment for Grant is wellnigh unanimous are yet to be heard from . The efforts made by Mr. Blaine 's supporters to misrepresent the strength of Gen. Grant in Illinois are having the effect upon conservative and fair-minded men which might be expected . Like the attempts which Mr. Blaine is making through his costly bureau to prejudice the people against the ex-President , they betray Mr. B.laine 's real weakness , and will alienate from him many good men who , under other circumstances , might be willing to give him their support .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
