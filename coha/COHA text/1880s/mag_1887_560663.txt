IF twenty or more intelligent gentlemen-several of whom would certainly be independents-finding themselves by chance together in any part of the country , should discuss the prospects of the election of Mr. Cleveland and Mr. Blame in 1888 , these two questions , about equally perplexing , would at once present themselves : 1 . Which do the people prefer ? 2 . What are the chances that the parties will allow the true wishes of the people to prevail in the nominations and elections ? These gentlemen would thus , without either of them , perhaps , noticing the profound significance of the fact , recognize party interests adnd aims as something distinct from those of the people-as a vast , separate , political force to be dealt with . Thus distinction and antagonism are emphasized by the remarks so frequently heard , that the Democratic party-referring to it , of course , in a technical sense , as speaking by its partisan managers-is probably opposed to the re-nomination of Mr. Cleveland , and that the Republican party-in the same sense , and speaking in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; while it is generally believed that the people , for whom these managers respectively assume to speak , would , if allowed a free expression of their wishes at the polls , elect Mr , VOL . CXLIV. - NO. 367. 36 // Cleveland and defeat Mr. Blame . In another article , I may , perhaps , refer to the probable consequences in the next election of this cnrious state of public opinion ; but now a still more important aspect of political parties must engage our attention , after considering which , we may , possibly , have a clearer view of the significance of the contest to be waged in 1888 , and of the partisan and Independent forces which will take part in it . The facts referred to make it plain that political parties , as we now have them , are by no means what they should be ; that is , convenient agencies for combining and expressing on a grand scale and with a true freedom the real views and interests of the people . They are very generally regarded as highly complicated organizations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power for their own benefit and for coercing and baffling the people . We need not stop to consider how disastrous it is to the purity and dignity of all political and official life , to have , in the whole domain of politics , the largest and highest expression of national sentiment thus weighed down and suppressed by a vast selfish organization , prctending to act for the common good and in the spirit of patriotism . The specific evils thus produced are not confined to the long and alarming array of abuses and corruptions which have been more and more in recent years charged against party managers and their vicious methods . These evils have developed a vicious antagonism , on the part of great numbers of worthy people , toward all parties , as being needless , even if they be not dangerous , enemies of the State . A recently published volume , taking this ground , has been largely sold ; and , what is yet worse , a large and increasing number of patriotic citizens are*declining to vote or to take any active part in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , corrupt barter of votes for places , and mere management and intrigue , under the control of partisans and demagogues , great and small , defeat all disinterested efforts for the public welfare . Public opinion now tends to such disastrous extremes as prevail concerning the liquor question ; that is , to the formation of a party against party itself . The late elections in the several cities in the West and in Rhode Island , where the Independents have defeated the parties , the enactment of laws in several States for diminishing the frequency of party elections by increasing the terms of governors and judges , the making of the ses // sions of the Legislatures of many States biennial , the acts -- lately passed in several States-for subjecting party caucuses and conventions to penal provisions , the exclusion of various subjects from legislation by constitutional amendments , the passage of the Civil Service acts by Congress and by the States of New York and Massachusetts for the suppression of partisan removals and appointments , and the collection of political assessments-thereby eliminating powerful elements of party despotism and corruption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the greater boldness and vigor of the criticism of party methods ( even on the part of what may be called party journals ) which now demands that the State , and not the parties , shall furnish all ballots and pay , in part , at least , and rigorously limit and regulate election expenses-all these facts are not only decisive evidence that the independent sentiment which decided the elections of 1884 is deeply seated in the public mind , and likely to continue , but that there is a profound purpose to suppress by law the despotism , venality , and usurpations of political parties . Nearly the whole periodical literature of the country is now substantially independent in politics-if , indeed , there is a single periodical of any rank which does not condemn the theories and methods of our party managers generally . We have but to go over the names of the most recent and successful journals in New York , Boston , Philadelphia , and all the great political centres to discover that they maintain an independence of parties comparatively rare not long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which made the results of the last electi@ns possible , and no thoughtful man will overlook it when considering the probable results in 1888 . These questions at once present themselves . Whether the attempt should be made to suppress parties ? Whether the parties we have are a legitimate growth , and are in harmony with our government ? Whether parties may be so organized and managed as not to be oppressive , but to fairly combine and effectively express the opinions and interests of the people ? Let us consider these questions . It is useless to talk about suppressing parties . Parties of some kind will always exist . It is as much a right of persons having convictions and interests in common in the sphere of politics to combine and act lawfully together as it is for those having views in common to thus unite // and act on the subjects of religion , charity , education , or amusements . On the other hand , the theory accepted by partisans and muddle-headed politicians , that a party is a great creative purifying power , almost as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of providential , sacred order of political life , into which every man is born , and which he can not leave without being a traitor-this whole theory is altogether nnfounded , and is so repugnant to the great facts of history that no well-informed person can accept it , save as a common delusion about which he has never reflected . Limited to their true sphere , and acting by open , honest methods , parties may , with great advantage , serve the people and the State . But the view so generally expressed by party leaders and demagogues seeking office and trying to commend themselves to a gathering of partisans ,  --  that parties make nations and governments , or that they are the source and strength of those exalted sentiments and noble acts by which nations become great and strong , is shallow in conception and repugnant to the plain facts of history . No party gave our fathers the conception of the revolution or the c6urage or support needed for its trials . Not one of the bold patriots who adopted the Declaration of Independence had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was represented in the convention which framed the Federal Constitution , nor has that instrument a line which expresses a party spirit or was intended to serve a party purpose . The heroic and creative period was past before a party had been known in our politics . During Washington 's administration , if it can be said there was a party in any sense , it was of that kind which the party managers of our time repudiate , and was led by such statesmen as they never follow . The first four acts which can be said to have been dictated by a partisan spirit were the alien and sedition laws , the midnight signatures of John Adams , and his refusal to attend the inauguration of Jefferson . The war of 1812 was fought , and peace was made , without making such questions mere party issues . No party was in power under Presidents Madison and Monroe , but a party established and perfected the spoils system under Jackson , Polk , and Van Buren . The earliest contests about slavery were not party , but sectional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first arraigned , and finally overthrew , slavery , did not come from a // party , or from any collision of parties , but were born in the hearts of noble men and women , who had the courage and independence to rise above that party spirit and policy which , for a generation , persecuted them and put their lives in peril . They overthrew one great party and made another . The Whig party and the Democratic party alike rejected the great issue of liberty which the independents had thns raised , in the same blind and selfish spirit which our party managers now reject the issue of civil service reform , which has decided one presidential election , and may yet decide another , if not destroy a party . Having always acted with the party which those earlier independents created , I gladly nnite with its other adherents in exalting all the high qualities which it exhibited in the long war it nobly sustained ; but let ns not forget how vastly greater were the patriotism and courage needed to create that party , and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that party has allowed to grow and which have enabled the old Democratic party to return again to power . Let us not forget that soldiers and generals of all parties fought together on every battlefield . It was party managers , greedy for patronage , who enacted the disastrous tenure of office law , but an independent , non-partisan spirit which repealed it . It was demagogues and partisans , seeking party ends , who carried the vicious pension bills of last winter , but an independent president who vetoed them . The history of all the great efforts in behalf of justice and purity in political affairs has shown a few brave spirits-true independents-in the lead , opposed , defamed , sneered at by party managers , until they have forced the party to recognize the higher sentiments which they have made formidable . So it is now with the temperance movement and the movement for purifying our elections . As a rule , parties neyer espouse a cause because it is righteous , but only to gain strength . It is not only true that parties are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grand efforts which purify and exalt nations , but it is also true that party spirit and mere party policy are subordinated and made contemptible whenever the patriotism , honor , and the manhood of a nation are deeply moved . So it was in our wars , and so it was in Great Britain during the war in the Crimea and in India . So it would be to-day if we had a great war on our hands . // Nevertheless , in face of such facts , there is a class of politicians who confound the claims of party with those of the nation , and treat the tie which connects a citizen with his party as being as sacred as the allegiance due to his country . They seem to think that the springs of patriotism would be dried up , and that all unselfish efforts for the public good would cease , if the organized despotism and selfishness which now exist in political parties , and which have carried their efforts far beyond their true sphere , should be suppressed . They seem utterly unable to comprehend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in politics must have not only the courage and patriotism needed to go with the party majority , but also the higher sense of duty needed to confront that majority , and perhaps part company with friends . What is a political party ? A clear definition is necessary not merely for a proper understanding of our subject , but to meet issues involving titles to office , which may any moment become grave practical questions in the courts . The habitual abuse of public authority for party ends , through party zeal and corruption , has compelled legislatures and Congress to try to protect the people by requiring " adherents of different parties " to be placed on various boards and commissions . The English race has never produced a statesman more competent than Edmund Burke to give a sound definition of a party . He declared it to be " a body of men united for promoting , by their joint endeavors , the national interests upon some particular principle in which they are all agreed . " No one whose authority is worthy of respect has ever disputed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is neither an end in itself nor a combination to promote interests of its own . It must promote only the national interests . It is not , therefore , an organization based on patronage or for securing offices or majorities . It must stand on principles . Speaker Carlisle declared , in a late speech at Cincinnati , that " a political party can be of no use in any country unless it has principles and is ready to stake even its existence upon them . " It is not a body gathered around a chieftain whom all must obey , but around a principle as to which all are agreed and to which every adherent must be faithful . In other words , a party is a free , natural , and honorable union of efforts and influence for serving the country . A true party , therefore , can not be a mere club , having other tests of membership besides its principles . It can not , therefore , // save by mere usurpation , exact pledges to obey orders or to vote for all party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corrupt political combinations in New York and other great cities in past years , which are generally called party machines . These and all other schemes for carrying elections , extorting money , putting favorites into office , and making the trade of politics profitable , may be properly called factions , rings , cliques , or conspiracies , but they are not political parties . A party must be free to all adhering to its principles . A party has no right to make nominations in order to reward favorites , to pay off workers , or to gain profits for itself , but only to serve the public interests . A breach of this rule , not less than a disregard of its principles , dissolves every pledge an adherent can honorably make to act with his party . This view of parties and party action makes them honorable , identifies them with the public interests , appeals to patriotism and sense of duty , and involves no compromise of conscience or of a manly self-respect on the part of their members . It makes it plain that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region of principle , political thought , legislation , broad measures of internal and foreign policy , gathering , combining , discussing , expressing the sentiments , thoughts , and interests of the people , and bringing into office those officials , and those only , who will make the laws the people demand and execute the policy which they have approved . Manipulating elections , coercing voters , or meddling with the details of military , naval or civil administration , or with judicial affairs of any sort is , therefore , plainly to depart from the sphere and true nature of party action . A party is not a body to do the public work , or to coerce public opinion . It simply expresses that opinion . It is obvious that , for leaders of such parties , there are required , not shrewd manipulators , not adroit evaders of great issues , not a cunning , conscienceless facility in bartering with political opponents and suppressing independent thought , not busy intermeddlers with local affairs all over the country , not facile , plausible demagogues , but men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of broad knowledge of public opinion and industries , of sound , candid judgment , and a patriotic and statesmanlike conception of the national honor and interests . A party thus led , faithful to its principles , and putting good men in nomination , would develop to the utmost // whatever patriotic sentiment and courage can come from the consciousness of power and the kindling enthusiasm born of vast numbers working together for a common and noble end . Such a party might keep itself in power for generations , instead of speedily sinking into corruption . It is plain from this conception of a party that its utilitythat the justification for even its existence-depend on three things , ( 1 ) the tendency of its principles to advance the welfare of the whole people , ( 2 ) the faithfal support of these principles by the party itself , ( 3 ) the nomination of the most worthy for office . Lacking these , it would be better to have no parties , as under Washington , Madison , and Monroe . The principles of a party and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its existence , the source of its strength , the bond of its union , and the test of its fidelity . They draw the people to a party and inspire them with an honest , salutary zeal in its behalf ; quite irrespective of securing offices and the control of the government , substantially for the same reasons that the people support the vast numbers of churches , charities , schools , and other organizations requiring the devotion of time and money , without honor or reward beyond what follows the doing of one 's duty . Such strength , such a bond of union , such a test , which is applicable alike to the party as a whole and to all its subdivisions and managers , obviously can exist only where its principles can be enforced and where they are the very issues immediately before the people , upon which their judgment is to be directly given . In this fact we see the reason why the principles of a national party are no restraint and have no proper application in municipal affairs , and in only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles are but a mask and false pretense . The power of the party organization is recklessly used for mercenary and coercive purposes far beyond and below the sphere of all true party action . Extortion , bribery , and oppression in their manifold and most repulsive forms are only aided by a complicated system of party machinery utterly needless for any useful purpose in municipal government . We have yet to create a municipal system wholly separate from mere party politics . It hardly need be stated that it is an utter departure from its true sphere for a party to coerce removals and to force its minions into those subordinate administrative places of the gov // eminent , federal , State , or municipal , where its principles have no application , where political opinions are no test of capacity , and where the public work should be done in the same way whichever party elected the President or the Governor , or is in majority in Congress or in the Legislature . The practice of doing this on a vast scale , and of using the whole power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective workers for its candidates , and ( 2 ) to compel these officials by threats of removal to pay large assessments on their salaries to be used by the party leaders for their own purposes ,  --  generally to bribe voters and buy the public press ,  --  is not only utterly repugnant to all true conceptions and functions of a party , but is a kind of despotism so insulting , corrupt , and degrading that we may well be astounded that it has been so long , endured by a free people . It is against these latter abuses of parties that the Civil Service Reform movement has , with growing strength and encouraging results , mainly directed its efforts , and in these facts we find the cause of the bitter hostility of mere politicians and party manipulators to that reform which is so seriously threatening their trade . No party deserves to live a day which needs to resort to the enslavement and robbery of the public servants to pay its expenses and do its work , which , in other words , can not safely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its principles and merits of its candidates . The highest obligation which a good citizen can be under to join , remain in , or give time or money for , a party must surely exist in favor of a party bascd on principles , and faithful to them . Let us see whatthat obligation is , according to the true and normal relations between the people and the parties . I do not , therefore , refer to those who servilely scheme for offices in the gift of parties , nor to any man who has made a special promise , express or implied , base or honorable , as a delegate or officer of a party organization , which compromises a manly independence . But has man a right to come under a pledge to any party which deprives him of his liberty to do his duty as a citizen according to his own judgment and conscience ? Let us do full justice to the facts that nearly all political action , and especially the making of platforms , the selection of candidates , and the enactment of laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerable compromise in point // of principle . Good citizens must make whatever concessions are essential and honorable in order to secure the requisite harmony and vigor of action . But who is to be the judge on this pointwho is to decide whether a candidate is trustworthy and capable  --  the citizen or his party ? If the party , then it is at once recognized as being a power as tyrannical and irresistible as any mediaeval despot . All personal manhood would , in a free nation , be prostrate before a tyranny unknown to the constitution and the laws . Considering the citizen as free to choose his party , is he not equally free as to what he will do for it , how long he will adhere to it , and which of its candidates he will support ? There is , I must think , some limitation , not in favor of the party , but of the country , to absolute freedom of this latter sort . The moral and political duties of patriotism and national allegiance are of universal obligation . They existed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have survived the death of many parties , and will remain unimpaired after all existing parties , and all the issues they raise , are known only to history . These duties require every man to bear his due proportion of the expense , and do his fit part of the work , and the voting needed for maintaining the government . There may or may not be parties with whom he can co-operate . If there are , the question is open for him to decide whether he can best discharge those paramount daties in the ranks of a party or otherwise . As he decides that question at any time , it will be his duty to work and vote with the party , or to defy its wrath , at whatever cost , by doing his duty to his country in a better way . It does not follow that he leaves his party because he opposes a bad candidate or a bad measure . No man can have a higher sense of the duty of voting than the true independent who braves obliquy to vote according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secrecy . A good citizen will not , without good reason , refuse to go with his party when great issues are involved . He should decide in full view , not only of direct , but of collateral and ultimate consequences . For it may well happen , as President Woolsey has pointed out , that one conspicuous act of heroic moral courage may awaken a whole party to the supreme claims of patriotism . If a party is made to feel certain that by nominating an unworthy candidate , or shaping its action to the interests of its most venal adherents , it will inevitably lose the votes of the // noblest characters by which it is adorned , it may , if not too far gone on the road to ruin , change its policy . It is a sad time for a country , and an hour of peril for any party , when the only independents in its ranks whom it fears and courts are its independent rascals-its gamblers , its grog-shop keepers , and its venal voters , who fix their own price . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or so distrustful of its leaders , as when I hear them berate those true independents who act from a sense of duty , while not daring to utter a word against those corrupt independents who fix their own terms and exact them at every election . Is the man who asserts his independence for conscience sake the only citizen who should be denounced for asserting it at all ? When we see how many vicious and venal influences are constantly inviting party managers down the road to ruin-how nearly certain history shows it to be that no party can long maintain the moral elevation of its birth , and how few are those who have the courage of their convictions in party politics-we need not fear there will be too many ready to act the part of true independents . But I repeat that the whole course of events for the last decade , as well as the significant legislation I have cited , indicates a steady increase in the strength of the sentiment of independence in politics . The dominant party in the House of Representatives last winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself was in some respects the greatest independent in the country . He who expects the influence of the independent spirit to be weaker in the election of 1888 than it was in 1884 is , I think , greatly deceived . The young voters are more and more rebelling against partisan despotism and machine politics . Clubs of a novel kind and very independent in spirit , and largely composed of young men , have lately been formed at the great political centres . Even the new party clubs for public discussion are a sort of independent protest and rebellion against the old party managers and the secret caucuses . These clubs tend to a change of leadership and of the centre of political power . The chiefs of the despotic primaries do not like them , and will be compelled to yield to their influence . It is one of the strange delusions of the old party managers to suppose that true independents seek , or need , to form a new party either to attain their ends or to make themselves a far greater political force . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in polities save by a party . It is the whole political world to them . They do not comprehend , any better than Mr. Conkling , the higher public which a few can express but the greatest party despot can not withstand . Nothing can be more nnfounded than the assumption that for a few men of character and patriotism to become a great political force they must form a new party or tamely act through the old ones . It was not thus that a few courageous friends of liberty drove the Democrats from power , and a few disinterested friends of administrative reform drove the Republicans from power . In no way can 50 or 500 citizens of character , capacity , and conscience become so great a power in politics , or do either their party or their country so great a service , as by publicly contrasting the doings of the party with its duty , and resisting every bad measure and bad candidate which the party may approve . In no way can such men become so insignificant and so contemptible , even in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and keeping silence because the party majority is against them . The supreme need is not to form a new party , but to make the old parties open their eyes to truth and duty . The way to bring about a reform within a party is for those having the courage to do so to speak plainly and justly , at its meetings , of what it does and what it ought to do . The nearer ruin a party is , the more fiercely will it resent such truth . There never was anything more absurd in politics than the theory , so common , that a man ought to apologize for refusing to violate his conscience and his judgment by going servilely with the majority . An apology for such a vote is a gross act of cowardice . We shall never have parties on a true basis , nor the worthiest for leaders , so long as every speaker feels compelled at all party gatherings to utter nothing but fulsome praise for his own party , and defamation of their opponents . Such meetings mi*ist be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courage of our convictions . The logic by which supreme party allegiance is defended is curious indeed . Because a man has adhered to a party for a time , in the expectation that it will stand by its principles and perform its duty of nominating the most worthy candidates , it is claimed that he has thereby bound himself to accept any platform it may offer , and support any candidate it may nominate . If he refuses , // he is to be ejected , persecuted , and regarded as a traitor . The party is assumed to be the sole agency through which a citizen can discharge his duty to his country . This is the precise doctrine which church hierarchies in despotic times enforced in the domain of religion . It hardly need be pointed out that the whole theory of partisans is in keeping with that view of party politics , when they insist that every officer , national , State , and municipal , and even the laborers , chimney-sweeps , and scrub-women , shall be of their faith , work for their party candidates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow no liberty of thought or action anywhere , not in the interest of the party , as defined by its managers , who enforce a sort of semi-military discipline over private citizens and public officers alike . Managing politics , in the view of many , is a sort of trade which must be made to yield profits in the treble form of offices , assessments , and rich contracts . A party is a sort of joint stock corporation for sharing these profits . To this whole theory a true independence in politics is fatal . We have no space for going into questions of casuistry as to how far a party delegate , under peculiar circumstances , may have come under an obligation of some kind to sustain the choice of the majority , however bad ; but that rapidly growing sentiment which demands that party action for making nominations and managing elections shall be subject to provisions of law against fraud and corruption , and that the State shall provide for proper election expenses , will not long tolerate the theory that a public delegate may contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by helping a scoundrel of his own party , * rather than a good citizen of the other party , into a public office . It looks now as if the next great issue between the partisans and independents would be upon the question whether the State 01 these managers shall prepare and deliver the ballots to the voters and provide for election expenses . The whole politician class will fight hard for their profitable and vicious monopoly on these points : Let the State but do its duty by requiring a public account of all election expenses , and furnishing the voter with his ballot and whatever facility he needs to freely and honestly vote according to his conscience , without incurring expense and without liability of being cheated and frightened by party manipulators and partisan bullies , and most of the corruption attending our elections will // be suppressed . The experiment has been amply tried with the most salutary results in Great Britain . One or two of our States have enacted laws of this character within a few weeks . No kind of legislation could do more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine , to make political activity unattractive to the worst class of voters , or to encourage the manly independence in politics which we so much need . It is a hopeful and significant sign of the times that a great club , made up of the leading young men of all parties in New York City , has taken charge of procuring such legislation for New York . It is a novel spectacle in American politics to witness the free , bold , but good-tempered , discussions of vital political questions which fill up several hours after its monthly dinners . They are not given to boasting about what either party has done in years past , but to considering what good citizens and all parties can do , and should unite in doing now , and in years to come , especially in the way of removing notorious abuses . While these pages are being written , a New York City club ,  --  recently formed , - all of whose members are adherents of my own party , has made it appear , if we may judge from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this metropolis , or the great questions of national administrations , which had such intimate relations with the defeat of that party in 1884 , as deserving any share of the club 's attention . These facts certainly add interest to the question whether greater harmony or greater divergence is to exist between partisans and independents in the immediate future . It is certainly being found more and more difficult , in all the leading nations-conspicuously so in England , France , Germany , and Italy , as well as in the United States  --  to keep all citizens within the lines of two great parties . A greater number of groups and more and more independence of speech and action is demanded as intelligence and civilization advance . Mere party discipline and hope of spoils are being found more and more ineffective for their suppression . Wise is that party which comprehends the tendency and acts accordingly . Nowhere , certainly , more than here , is such freedom in harmony with the theory of the government and the spirit of the people . A glance at the growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some light on the probability of its future development . When despotism in church and State had so far // relaxed that parties became possible , under William III. , a very severe party domination in the despotic spirit of the times was naturally provided for . The Prime Minister was to be selected from the dominant party in Parliament , and he was to name the other members of the Cabinet . The veto power was no longer to be exercised . The Prime Minister ,  --  or Cabinet Government , thus constituted , speaking through him ,  --  was not only to wield directly all executive power , but was really ( though nominally through the King ) to appoint , not only all civil , but all military and naval officers , and also all the great dignitaries of the State church . The same authority took the lead in legislation , gave pensions , conferred orders and titles , and made removals . The party was thus made supreme through the whole domain alike of legislation , of royal favor , and of executive administration . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parliament a new government was to come in . Thus was party government , close akin to party despotism , established . That system is now failing in Great Britain . A long time ago most of the higher officials not of the government itself began to be treated as removable only for cause . Civil service examinations next suppressed mere partisan appointments and removals in all but a few score of places . The system has otherwise been taken out of partisan favoritism . Our Constitution allows no such partisan system . It provides for the veto ; that is , for different policies and politics on the part of the legislative and the executive depart* ments . It contemplates that the majorities in one or both houses of Congress will not be of the same party as the President ) and such has very generally been , and is now , the fact . No administration is to go out because without a majority in Congress . Each branch is to be independent largely of the other . Party government in the English sense , or in any true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole matter of religion , and many other great subjects which were controlled by the party majority in Great Britain , and gave interest and dignity to party politics and administration , are fixed by our Constitution , or , in other words , excluded wholly from the sphere of party government . Our Constitution , therefore , allows far less power to parties , and hence assures far more liberty and independence to the citizen than the British system . It denies the utility of a universal party control . It makes it possible for the government to go on , // and requires it to go on , even if there be no party whatever . Until Jackson 's time , the government was administered according to its true spirit , and not at all on the British theory of despotic party management . Jackson and his imitators did what they could to substitute the old British party despotism , which responds directly to the politician 's love of power and the partisan 's greed for patronage . For a time they were very successful . But patriotism challenged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts were made to suppress some of the abuses of this naturalized British system in the same way that they had been suppressed in the parent country-that is , by tests of merit through examinations-the partisan friends , of the British system were the loudest in denunciation of what they called a British reform . They only wanted a British abuse , or forgot the origin of the spoils system so dear to them . A British remedy was unendurable . Is there not good reason to believe that the movement , which has already suppressed some of the evils of this imported British system , will go on with increasing force until our parties and our administration get into harmony with the spirit and the principles of our Constitution ? Until that time it is certain that the issues the movement raises will be among the most vital and decisive in our politics , however much party managers may seek to suppress them . DORMAi B.
