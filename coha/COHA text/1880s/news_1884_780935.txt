txt Judge Fisher , in the Baltimore Circuit Court to-day , delivered his opinion in the suit of Ernault Williams against his father , George H. Williams , to break a deed of trust executed by the son on May 31 , 1882 . The opinion is in favor of the son and sets aside the deed .

Ernault has ever since lived with the Hazlitt family and is the father of a healthy-looking baby , of which he is very proud . About a year ago he began the suit to set aside the deed of trust which to-day was decided in his favor .
