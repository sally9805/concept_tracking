txt At the time of the great lumber fires some weeks ago it was generally believed that an organized attempt was being made by somebody to burn the town , but no clue could be found to unravel the mystery . The Cleveland police being weak or inefficient , the Board of Trade took steps on its own account , and what it discovered is not yet even known to the Cleveland police or public . The board set aside $3,000 for the purpose of finding the guilty parties . A Pinkerton Captain was brought from Chicago at S25 per day , and brought six detectives , who worked here for some weeks without being discovered by the Cleveland police . One of them was at one time under arrest on charge of suspicion , and some trouble was bad in getting him clear without confession as to who ho was . The similarity of all the fires suggested certain things , and a man who was discovered to be in town and who was known to be connected with Chicago Socialists was shadowed for a long time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drug store and write out a prescription , which was filled . The detectives secured it , and had it again made up , the result being a colorless mixture . This was applied to a door panel and also to paper . It left no stain , but in half an hour began to blaze . This suggested the methods of the man , who could easily sprinkle his liquid over a heap of rubbish or on a pile of lumber and be two miles away before the fire would break out . The man was closely watched with the expectation of seeing him in the act , but ho in some way took alarm and left the city . The Pinkerton men have his description and undoubtedly have him under supervision wherever he is . A boy who was seen with him , and who was caught setting tire to a Connotton Railroad car , was placed in jail , and a detective lodged with him as a fellow-prisoner , but could get no confession out of him . One of the Pinkerton force also joined a Socialists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered that would warrant any arrests . After the suspected man left the town the incendiary fires ceased , but not until several million dollars worth of property had been destroyed .
