THE GIFT OF FERNSEED . I , ARTHUR SAYCE , am now thirtyseven years of age . I was born in New York State , was educated at Utica , New York , and at Columbia College . Having taken my medical degree , I spent two years in New York hospitals , after which my next five years were passed in Europe : one year studying medicine in Berlin ; two walking the hospitals of London , - St. Thomas 's and " Bart 's ; " and two in Paris , - the first in private study , and the second as an interne des h&amp;pitaux of the French capital . For the last eight years I have been a practicing physician in New York city , until three months ago , when I started for the North Pacific coast on a prolonged hunting trip . I give these details to show the reader that I am not ignorant of the world , no recluse , nor one likely to be easily mystified or juggled with . In no sense can I be called visionary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have never been subject to fits , faintings , trances , delirium , or hallucinations of any kind . It is impossible that I can have been deceived in any of the sensations which I experienced in the events that I am about to describe . However incredible the following narrative may seem , it is the simple* sober truth . With this introduction ( in writing which , I believe the reader will , after he has read what follows , readily acquit me of all egoism ) , I will proceed to the narrative itself . It was on the 10th of May , late in the afternoon , that I arrived at the Carnr d'Al'ene Mission , in one of the five log cabins attached to which this story is written . I was alone , my traveling companion of the last two months , Lester Hemsley , having been recalled to New York by a message which reached him at Fort Ceur d'AThne , forwarded from Portland , Oregon . As I rode up , the sun was already low enough in the west to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher slopes of the mountains beyond , now all dark with the level stretch of pines , were then snow-covered ( for the snow lies late on the Bitter Roots ) , showing in the evening sun alternations of intense black and white . On the right wound the Ca*ur d AThue River , fringed with scattered pines , on which the ospreys had built their nests , and patches of undergrowth of blackthorn and hazel . In addition to the five cabins and the Mission itself , there was a seventh building , if such it could be called , a little nearer to me , on the lower ground , an Indian teepee . On the slope to the left grazed a bunch of ponies , at sight of which my own little " buckskin " pricked up his ragged ears , and seemed to take an interest in the proceedings for the first time since we left the fort . We had advanced to within one hundred and fifty paces of the teepee before any human life appeared . Then a party of four Indian bucks , muffled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from behind their hut . Presumably jhe action of their own ponies on the hill had told // them that something unusual was in sight . For half a minute they stood looking at me , and I could hear their voices raised in babbling astonishment . Then they all started together towards me , on a kind of running trot . At a distance of some thirty paces from me they relapsed into a walk , - or rather into the shambling , half-sliding , go-asyou-please gait which serves the Indian of the prairies for a walk . When about a dozen yards away , one of them , the oldest ( and judging from the superior brilliancy of the red ochre with which the roots of his long black hair were dyed , and from the osprey feathers twisted into his locks , one holding some authority among them ) , darted quickly forward , and , grasping my bridle in his left hand , raised his right with a longbladed knife gleaming in it , as if to stab me . In a moment the muzzle of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of me , was at his chest and my finger on the trigger . For fully two or three seconds we remained so ; his arm upraised , and my rifle almost touching the blanket where it overlapped on his chest . Neither moved his eyes from the other , and what wickedlooking orbs they were that I gazed at ! Suddenly the Indian dropped his arm and broke into a laugh , in which the other three joined . Then he loosed his hold of my bridle , and the whole party shambled off up the hill in front of me , chattering and cackling with laughter , all of us heading for the Mission building . It was probably the noise which the Indians made that brought a white man ( I confess that I was glad to see him ) to the door of the cabin next to the Mission , while we were still some fifty yards away . As he stepped out the sun fell full upon his face , and I could see him plainly ; much better , evidently , than he could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light . Dressed in the long black robe of a priest , he looked something above medium height , spare of figure , but active-seeming and hardy . His feet were cased in moccasins . The strong sunlight in his face made him droop his head forward , so that his chin rested on the heavy black cross on his breast , his eyes looking out at me from under his prominent brows . His head was partially bald , what hair he had being of a dark iron-gray . He suffered me to approach within a dozen paces , when as I dismounted , the Indians standing silently on one side , he came towards me with outstretched bands . Taking one of my hands in each of his , he kissed me on the forehead . " Peace be with you , my son ! You are welcome , " he said . This was Father Francis , of whom I had heard at the fort . Father Francis was very cordial at our first meeting , with a quiet courtesy of manner , and we had not long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had given him a fairly detailed history of myself and of the reasons of my arrival at the Mission . He , in turn , told me of himself and the Mission : how he had lived for a quarter of a century among the Indians ; how he had been almost alone for the last eleven months , since the Mission was deserted in the preceding June ; and how the four Indians who had welcomed me so curiously bad been there but a few days , having come down from the reservation ostensibly to see if the trout were beginning to run up from the lake yet , but really , as he said , more for the pure love of wandering than anything else . The eldest of the party ( my friend with the osprey feathers and wicked-looking eyes ) was one Tsin-shil-zaska , one of the oldest members of the Ceur d'AThne tribe , and a medicine man of no small repute . Two of the others he called respectively Good Bear and Laughing Brave . The third was named Timothy.1 // All , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shil - zaska in particular as well as the ordinary cultivated white man , and considerably better than the average of frontiersmen or of the private soldiers of the fort . These facts I subsequently verified by my own experience ; and it is often the case that Indians who have learned their English from the priests , and not from trappers and miners , speak purely , and frequently after a somewhat biblical fashion . Father Francis talked at length of Tsin-shil-zaska , and always in praise of his intelligence . But it was not long before I had a better opportunity of judging the medicine man for myself than our first brief meeting had afforded . When we had been sitting talking for perhaps an hour , and just as Father Francis was rising to make preparations for his evening meal , the Indian walked boldly , and , as it seemed to me , with rather an insolent air of importance , into the cabin . His three companions stood outside , peering in at the door . The father was already standing , so I arose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salute to Indians , " How ! How ! " His reply was given with an air of rather lofty rebuke , in good if guttural English : " How do you do , my friend ? You are welcome . " I smiled , partly at his implied rebuke , and partly at the statement that I was welcome , after his manner of receiving me outside . " You did not tell me so before ? " I said interrogatively . " No . Tsin - shil - zaska tried you , whether you were a coward or not . " " And am I ? " " He can not tell yet . A man is brave the first time , and a coward the next . in a minority of cases that these cling to them . Usually the English translation of the old name is used , as in the case of Good Bear and Laughing Brave , or , when not too im A man who is a coward the first time is always a coward . " Father Francis then asked him how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and after a few more desultory remarks the conversation dropped . It had not been my intention to stay at the Mission more than one day . I have now been here for three months . The causes of this change of p*ogramme , and the circumstances through which my first instinctive dislike of Tsin-shilzaska ripened into an open quarrel with him , I will tell as briefly as possible . The morning after my arrival , Timothy met with an accident . He was cutting a branch from one of the thorn bushes by the river , when his knife slipped , and , with the whole strength of his arm behind it , cut a terrible gash in the poor fellow 's thigh . His companions carried him into the father 's cabin , where the good priest dressed the wound with a simple poultice of wild parsnip as deftly and effectively as it could have been done by the best of surgeons ; declining my proffered aid on the grounds that the Indians had full confidence in him as a physician , and that his own knowledge was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the operation , Tsin-shil-zaska had stood looking on with an air of supercilious contempt which exasperated me . Later in the day , when Timothy was lying on the grass by the side of the teepee , I happened to pass close by at the moment when Tsin-shil-zaska was operating upon him in his capacity of medicine man . He had removed the father 's carefully placed bandages , and was going through some incantation accompanied with extravagant gesticulations . These mummeries completed , he spat upon the wound , and replaced the bandages with at least as much clumsipracticahle for a civilized mouth , the old one itself . Tsin-shil-zaska is the Kalispel word ( the Co*ur d'AThnes speak a patois of Kalispel ) for " horse . " // ness as the father had used dexterity . The sight made me inwardly furious , and it was with difficulty that I restrained myself from rudely interfering then and there . It was the custom of Father Francis to hold prayer twice daily , morning and evening , in the Mission House . These services any stranger who was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That evening , upon issuing from the building after service , Tsin-shil-zaska , who had preceded me , was standing close by the door , looking westward at the setting sun . My resentment was still strong within me as I stopped to ask him , rather sneeringly , how his patient prospered . " The treatment of the good father is always successful , " said he , without removing his eyes from the horizon . " But you have taken this case out of the good father 's hands . Did I not see you doctoring Timothy yourself ? " " Huh ! " ( The Indian never loses his guttural ejaculations . ) " Tsin-shil-zaska does what he can to help the good father . " The idea of his professing to be able , with his fooleries , to give any assistance to Father Francis provoked me further . I do not know now quite how the conversation that followed ran , but it resulted , and that quickly , in my telling Tsin-shilzaska plainly what I thought of him and his skill as a practitioner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " which he probably did not understand , and a " hypocrite , " which he evidently did . Then for the first time he shifted his eyes from the far-off landscape , and they gleamed more wickedly than ever as he fixed them on mine . " Huh ! Tsin-shil-zaska does not speak so to the **25;703;TOOLONG . " ( So , as I had already learned from Father 1 It is curious , that this same story was told centuries ago by 2Elian . " The Cretans , " he says , " are skillful archers . With their darts they wound the wild goats that feed upon the Francis , the Indians had , in reference to a 44-calibre Colt 's which I carried , named me . ) " He has not said that you are a hypocrite and that you know nothing . The medicine man can not cure ? Huh ! The wild goat on the mountain , when shot with an arrow , knows what plant to eat to make the wounds close and the arrow fall . ' The hurt beaver medicines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to eat what leaves he chooses , makes himself invisible . The dog , there , has learned when to eat the grass to make him vomit . The birds of the air know what food will hurt them and what will do them good . Has the Indian , being wiser , learned nothing of all these ? The **25;730;TOOLONG will know better . " With which he buddled his blanket closer around his chin , gave one more guttural grunt , and shambled noiselessly away ; his retreating figure black between me and the red sunset sky . The next day saw me in better temper . Tsin-shil-zaska did not appear , and the statement of Good Bear that he had gone into the mountains " to find medicines " only made me laugh . The day following I went out for a long excursion , on foot , up the river , taking my rifle in the hopes of a shot at a bear . Deer there were in plenty , but , though no lack of " bear signs , " no bear ; and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired . The whole day had been spent in climbing up hills and over crags , and scrambling through brush skirting the snow . The sun was hot ( as the Pacific sun can be in May ) , and my shoulder was fatigued by the weight of the rifle . On my return , I determined to undress and take a sponge bath in my cabin ; so , having drawn a pail of water from the well and carried it inside , I moved the table mountaias . The goats , when struck , immediately go to eating the herb dictanius . As soon as they have tasted it , the dart falls from the wound . " // into a corner , and proceeded to strip off my clothes . As I was standing " mother naked , " sponge in hand , looking at the water , and wondering whether the first douche would be too abominably cold , the door was suddenly pushed open , and Tsin-shil-zaska walked unceremoniously in . I was indignant at the intrusion and the high-handed manner of it , and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , feeling a natural bashfulness , I cast about for something wherewith to cover my nakedness . In my hand was nothing but the small sponge , and no garment lay within easy reach . But , on reflection , it occurred to me that my visitor was , underneath his one blanket , but little more dressed than myself . The Jndian has , in the matter of nudity , no sense of what we are pleased to call the proprieties , and I doubt whether the medicine man had any idea of the awkwardness which , however illogically , I could not help feeling . But subsequent events convinced me that he had been watching me through some cranny in the log wall , - which contained plenty , - and had chosen the moment of his entrance with deliberate intent . His back was , of course , to the light , as he entered , and even when he had shuffled close up to me I could not see his face . When within a few feet of where I was standing , he thrust out one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - zaska has brought the **25;757;TOOLONG some medicine , " he said , " that he may know the Indian has learned something . " In the hand which he extended to me was a small vial , - given him , presumably , at some time by one of the fathers , - corked with a knot of grass . The vial was almost full of a brownish liquor , of the color of tincture of arnica , - perhaps a tablespoonful or more . I looked at him and then at the vial . " And what am I to do with it ? Drink it ? " " Huh ! " with an accent of assent . " The **25;784;TOOLONG will see whether Tsin - shil - zaska knows anything . " " And does Tsin-shil-zaska take me for a fool ? " The only response was a decidedly non-committal grunt . The question of my foolishness was an open one . The hand with the vial was still extended to me . " How do I know that it is not poison , and will kill me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " But I am not sick , and need no curing . " And then silence , the Indian 's strongest and favorite argument . At last he spoke : " Will not the Man-with-the-little rifle-drink ? Will the man who was brave the first time be a coward the next ? " The wily old savage ! Still I hesitated . " So this is only to test my courage ? And if it kills me ? " " Tsin-shil-zaska would not hurt a friend of the good father 's . If the **25;811;TOOLONG had come to Tsin-shil-zaska , and said , Drink , ' he would have done so . " Again , as in the wrangle of the preceding evening , I felt that he had distinctly the advantage of me in argument . I was discomfited . " What is it ? " I asked , reaching out my hand for the vial . He let me take it readily . Holding the liquor against the light , I saw that it was semi-opaque , with small particles of fibrous matter floating in it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I took out the grass stopper , and smelled the liquor . The odor was new to me , - pungent , but not strong , and very berby . " What is it ? " I asked again . " It is precious , and Tsin-shil-zaska knows no name for it . " " But what is it going to do to me ? " // " Will the Man - with - the - little- rifle drink it and learn ? " If I could only see his face ! But the strong light of the door behind me made it impossible . However , I reasoned , if it had been really a dangerous drug , he would never have come to me so openly with it . At all events , it is a physician 's duty to experiment with new medicines on himself , if no more convenient subject offers . I remembered Emerson 's advice : " Always do what you are afraid to do ! " So I walked across the cabin , laid the sponge , which I was still holding in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a tin cup . As I was about to pour the liquid into the cup , Tsin-shil-zaska reached forward and took both from me . Dipping up perhaps a wineglassful of water from the pail which was to serve as my bathtub , he emptied the mysterious liquid into it , finally rinsing the vial out in the mixture , which he handed to me . I hesitated a moment , smelled it , sipped it , and then swallowed it in a couple of mouthfuls , and threw the cup on the bunk . It had no particular taste ; or rather it tasted faintly , as it smelled . " Well , what now ? " I asked . " Huh ! The **25;838;TOOLONG will soon know . " And with that he gathered his blanket closer around the neck , and shuffled off . I laughed rather angrily at myself fdr the ridiculousness of the whole affair , and ( for I was beginning to feel chilled ) ran briskly across to fetch the sponge , and returned to resume my interrupted bath . Stooping to plunge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drug was beginning to have some effect upon me , and straightened myself up again . Yes , there was no doubt of it . I felt a distinct sensation as of incipient intoxication . I was exhilarated and slightly dizzy . I braced myself , and , planting my feet firmly , threw my shoulders back , to try to shake the feelings off . No ; they only increased with great rapidity . The blood was bounding through my veins , and my spirits rose higher ( for I am a sober , matter - of - fact person ordinarily ) than I ever knew them to in my life . I laughed aloud at myself , and jumped into the air from very joyfulness . Then the absurdity of my conduct struck me , and I proceeded gravely to remonstrate with myself , aloud . The next moment I had kicked the sponge up to the ceiling , and upset the pail of water over the fiooi* , - a joke which struck me as so irresistibly humorous that I was obliged to sit down on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hysterical guffaws . There followed a series of sensations which I will do my best to describe accurately , for they were sensations such as no man , as I firmly believe , who has ever walked the hospitals of New York , London , or Paris , has felt , either before or since . I have spoken of dizziness . That increased in intensity with every second , and I seemed to be passing in rapid succession through all the stages of intoxication . Stories of various drinks of savage people came into my head , and I distinctly remember that the account of a native Burmese drink of which I have read somewhere , which will dissolve a Martini Henry rifle-ball in thirty seconds , flashed into my mind . " And now , " I maudlinly commented , " it is dissolving the Man-with-the-littlerifle himself ; " and again I laughed uproariously . But the hilarity was of short duration . As the dizziness continued to increase , the cabin began to sway and the floor to heave , until I had to rock myself backwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep from falling off the stool . Nausea succeeded , and I made two or three ineffectual attempts to vomit , like a man in the extremity of seasickness . So far , however , the sensations had // not differed from those of ordinary intoxication . But now a new one nungled with the nausea and dizziness . In my time I have experimented upon myself with , I think , every narcotic and anodyne known to the pharmacopceia , and have described the sensations of each experiment in my diary . The one which I now experienced differed from anything that I had ever described myself or seen described by others . In fact , it almost baffled analysis or description . Even now , I am not entirely sure that my memory of it is not largely tinged by the subsequent knowledge of its results . As I remember it , it commenced first in my extremities , but had soon distributed itself over my whole frame . There is only one word by which I can describe the process which then seemed to be going on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of my body , solids and fluids , bone , blood , and tissue , was in independent and multitudinous motion , as if each tissue were resolving itself into its component cells , and each cell into its primordial atoms . It was not painful . But for the accompanying nausea and dizziness , it might have been positively pleasurable . The sensation , though intense in each member , was not to be located anywhere , but was evenly distributed from the marrow of my spine to the cuticle of my finger-tips . The motion of the particles seemed to grow wilder and more rapid . My whole being seethed and boiled . It was as the ultimate dissolution of my very fabric . Almost blind in my dizziness , I rose from the stool , and staggered to the buiik . I fell on my knees as I reached it , and then dragged myself laboriously up and on to it . The cabin rocked and swayed ; the motion in me appeared to grow into - not to produce , but to grow into - sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surging of chaotic but rhythmical murmurs . Things grew indistinct before any eyes . The motion in me communicated itself to surrounding objects . Everywhere was wreck , chaos , dissolution . Just before final blackness closed in on me , I remember seeing the form of Tsin - shil - zaska , almost filling the doorway . That was my last definite impression . Then came deathly nausea , retching that racked my very life , external blackness and unutterable tumult ,  --  and I lost consciousness . When I emerged from the state of coma which ensued , it was early morning , dull and misty and gray , as I saw through the cabin door , which stood wide open . There was no difficulty in picking up the thread of memory . As soon as my consciousness returned , I found myself lying , still " mother naked , " on my back . I recollected perfectly where I was , how I came there , and all the incidents of Tsin-shil-zaska 's visit and the drinking of the drug . My first serious thought was about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful narcotic . Violent in its operations , certainly ; but the medicine man had given me a pretty strong dose , as my long lethargy ( which must have extended over some fifteen hours ) sufficiently testified . In skillful hands , and after careful experimenting to ascertain its strength , it might prove to be of considerable value . I must make Tsin-shil-zaska show me the plant . Having arrived at which conclusion , I proceeded to raise myself on my elbow and sit up . Somehow I did not feel quite myself yet . I was perfectly conscious and had all my senses , except , apparently , one . My hearing was good , for the monotonous " see - se - se-sawaw-aw of a myrtle robin came at regular intervals from some tree behind the cabin , accompanied now and again by the hurried tap-tapping of a woodpecker somewhere in the further distance . I could certainly see , though there was not much to look at , the interior of the cabin , dim and dark , the door being // merely a parallelogram of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of smell , - that was excellent , as the pungent scent of moist earth which came in on the morning air , telling of rain during the night , assured me . But I had no sense of touch ! Since first consciousness returned I had been aware of a curious sensation of - what shall I say ? - unsubstantiality . You know how , in the moments between sleep and waking , you lie insensible of the contact between yourself and the bedclothes , yourself imponderable , the bed beneath and the covers above you without substance . That same sensation had been present with me since my awakening , but with an infinitely greater sense of reality , for I was not now anything but wide awake . When I put my hand on the wooden side of the bunk and raised myself to a sitting posture , there had been no sensation of contact as my palm touched the wood . I reached out my fingers to the rough logs which composed the wall . It was the same . I could feel nothing . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members were not dead . The circulation appeared to be normal , for I had perfect control over all my limbs . When I raised my leg and let it fall on the bunk again , it fell quite naturally ; not at all heavily or lifelessly , as in a case of ordinary perverted sensation . Still , I could not feel it strike the bed . The more I became assured that this senselessness was a fact , the more convinced I was that the drug which had caused it would be of considerable value to surgeons as an ana*sthetic . I must learn its nature at once . With this resolve , I flung my legs over the edge of the bunk , and dropped to the floor . Strange ! I was certainly standing , but without sense of anything under my feet . I walked . My limbs obeyed me . My feet rested normally on the floor . There was no tendency to lose my balance ; my muscles supported me perfectly ; but I could feel nothing . I jumped into the air , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result was the same . So I sat down ( having to look behind me to be sure that my person was actually in contact with the stool ) to think it all over . As I sat , it occurred to me that the room had been changed since I last saw it ; and - where were my clothes ? Then it became plain to me . That miserable Tsin-shil-zaska had drugged me with deliberate intention of robbery . I remembered his coming into the cabin just before I became insensible , and doubtless he had then carried off my wardrobe . Yes , my rifle was gone , too , and my revolver . He had made a clean sweep while lie was about it . No , my saddle , with an India-rubber saddle-bag attached , was left , and I could dress myself in the shirt and pair of socks which were all the change of wardrobe that I carried , and so make my way to the cabin of Father Francis , and lodge complaint against the medicine man . The table stood in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projecting end of the bunk . The bag was beneath the foot of the bunk , and therefore partly under the table . It would be easier for me to move the table than to creep under it on my hands and knees to reach the bag . So I took hold of the table to niove it . I grasped it , as far as a man with no feeling in his finger-ends could grasp anything , and pulled . Not an inch did it stir . I pulled , and pushed , and shook ( or tried to shake ) , and pulled , and pushed , and shook again . It would have done as much good to have pulled , and pushed , and shaken at the Rocky Mountains . If I could only have had the satisfaction of feeling that I was really grasping it , that would have soothed me somewhat . But this utter numbness was maddening , and my wrath against Tsin-shil-zaska grew strong . However , there was nothing for it // now but to get into the limited costume at my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to headquarters and make my complaint . So I dropped on all fours , without feeling when my hands rested on the floor , and , crawling under the table , endeavored to grasp the bag . I say " endeavored , " because I really could not say whether I did grasp it or not . I thought that I caught hold of it , and so far as my eyes could teach me my fingers were actually inclosing a part of it . But it was rooted as firmly as the table . If I pulled at it , my fingers simply came away from it , no matter how firm a grip I thought I had taken . They did not slip off , they simply came away , - ceased any longer to be in contact with it . My hand was as nerveless as it was senseless . I was still tugging and gripping with what seemed a preposterous waste of energy , considering the smallness of the object that I was tugging at , but without the smallest result , when I became aware that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not dignified , - my head and shoulders under the table , and the rest of my naked person protruding into the light towards the new-corner , whoever he was . So I scrambled out b*ckwards as fast as I could , and rose to my feet . It was the father . His back was to the light , but as I arose I saw by the , motion of his head that he was looking around the room in search of something or some one ; then he deliberately turned around and walked out again . " Father ! Oh ! Good-morning , fa-ther ! " But he evidently did not hear me . It was very curious . If his face had not at one time been directed full towards me , I could have declared that he had not seen me . It was true that the light was dim , but a naked man , six feet and one inch in height , suddenly springing from all fours to his feet , is a fairly conspicuous object at the distance of some three paces , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ordinary clearness of vision . I ran to the door , and , resting a hand on the post on either side , thrust my head out . The father 's retreating form was some ten yards from me . I called him , and called again . He kept on his way , turned into the door of his cabin , and disappeared . Certainly he did not hear me . Was he deaf as well as blind ? But my voice , I was obliged to confess to myself , was weak . I called again , as an experiment . Yes , it was very weak , - thin and bodiless . It was not the fault of my hearing , because the distant scream of an osprey came plainly to my ears , and a flight of Alpine grosbeaks ( birds which are very plentiful about Lake C5ur d'AThne ) , which flew jerkily over the cabin at that moment , filled the air with twittered music . For fully a minute I stood there wondering what I was to do . I could not feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , though they were visibly doing so , or I should have fallen forward on my face ; nor could I feel that my feet touched the ground . Then I commenced feeling all over the door and the rough ends of the jutting logs , where they had been chopped off to leave the doorway space . How solid , and hard , and unsympathetic it all was to my numb touch and nerveless fingers ! In pure exasperation , I slapped the door-post with my open hand , and a new horror dawned upon me . There was no noise when the hand came in contact with the wood . I tried again , and again , and again , harder and louder ; not a sound . I clapped my two hands together , but neither sound nor scnse of touch told me when they met . It was very ghostly . I searched for anything that was resonant to strike . I smote the flat surface of the door . It neither trembled nor emitted any sound . I went back to the table , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simultaneously with all my force . It was // useless . When my hands reached the wooden surface on their downward course , they stopped , ceased to go any further , but the impact had not the smallest effect either on the table or on my hands . And an unutterable terror crept into me ; a hideous , indescribable feeling of unreality , as if I were out of all relation to the world around . Was it , after all , a dream ? I reached out my hand to the walls , and could feel nothing . I struck the table again , and not a sound came from it . Was I in a world of shadows , or - and my heart sank as the thought came to me - was I a shadow in a world of realities ? How utterly nerveless , powerless , unsubstantial , I was beside these great , black , rugged , unresponsive log walls ! I called aloud , and my voice came to me thinly , as if from a distance . An ineffable hopelessness came over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table , and buried my numb face on my senseless arms All the horrors that followed have failed to weaken the memory of that moment of overwhelming and nameless terror . As I sit now writing at that same table , and look around at these same rough walls , an echo of that feeling of hopelessness comes back to me , and I smite my clenched knuckles on the resounding board , to make sure that it rings at the stroke , and that things are realities once more . How long that supreme sense of terror lasted I do not know ; probably some ten minutes or a quarter of an hour . But slowly a feeling which had from the first been combating , and to some extent mitigating , the miseries of the situation began to possess me , and to restore me to my normal self , - the feeling of professional curiosity as to the nature of the drug under the influence of which I then was . A very devil 's potion it seemed . Certainly its action on me had been violent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more important its addition to the pharmacopa*ia would ultimately be . As I rose to my feet from my kneeling posture , a blue jay fluttered down witk a dissonant " charr-rr-rr , " and perched itself , head inside the cabin , in the doorway , looking dull and bedraggled in the damp air . I raised my arm and cursed the bird in stern Anglo-Saxon , whereat it tumbled precipitately backwards , and flew clamorously headlong into the mist . Come ! It was a comfort to find some external thing that would still recognize and respect my existence . I yet had some relation to the things of the world . Walking to the door , I leaned against one of the posts and looked out . Four figures were approaching from the direction of the father 's cabin ; and it was with something which was almost joy that I counted them , and knew that Tsin.shil-zaska was still at the Mission , and that I might hope to recover my properties and revenge myself . They advanced slowly : the father with bowed head and downcast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the mist , as if they rested on the distant landscape beyond . They were evidently coming straight to my door , so I drew a pace or so inside , and awaited them with a deprecatory smile , apologetic for my nudity , on my face . The father , after a moment 's hesitation in the doorway , stepped in first , and his lips moved in murmured blessing . Tsin-shil-zaska followed . The others remained outside . I stood a yard and a half , perhaps , back from the entrance , waiti*ig awkwardly for the good priest 's salutation . But - Even now , sitting writing this on almost the very spot on which I stood then , and with every detail of what passed imprinted - ah , how clearly - on my memory , I can not accurately describe the utter horror of the minutes which followed . In the first place , no salutation came . The eyes of the Indian , as he entered , // shifted in one rapid glance around the cabin , and then fixed themselves , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Father Francis began , with an expression of deepest anxiety on his face , to search the cabin in detail with his eyes . I was standing in front of him , slightly to his left hand ( what a sailor would call on his port bow ) , directly between him and the table where it stood pushed into the corner . His scrutiny began at the corner to his and the doorway 's left , to my right , and , after resting there a moment , passed along the wall , shifting from the floor upwards to the table - and me . For fully a minute again his eyes rested on me , - on my chest , dropping to my knee , passing from right shoulder to left , and from left elbow back to right . But I knew that it was not I that he was looking at , - not my chest , nor knee , nor shoulder , nor elbow . lie was looking through me at the table , under it , up to the bunk , from one side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , up to the ceiling . It is useless for me to attempt to describe the sensation of that moment of terror . People have been buried alive , conscious the whole time , and have lived to tell of it . Men have kneeled on the scaffold , awaiting the fall of the axe which never fell , and have recalled afterwards the sensations of those last moments before the joyful shout announced the reprieve . But never , as I believe now , has such mental agony been allotted to mortal man as in those moments seemed to arrest my very being . I strove to speak , but my tongue refused his office . I reached out my hand , and let it feebly fall again . Again I tried to articulate , and at last the word came : - " Father ! But how thin , and weak , and how far away ! Obviously he heard it not . Even I could hardly say whether I heard it , whether it had actually come in external words to my ear , or whether it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my nerves . It was Father Francis who spoke : - " You have not heard the report of his rifle , my son , since he left ? " " Huh ! " with negative accent . " Yet one of you , with your keen hearing , would surely have heard it had he fired ? " Huh ! " This time in the affirmative . And it was I of whom they were speaking as of one absent ; I , who stood here so close to the father that we could have clasped hands without either of us moving ; I , who heard their every syllable , but could not make my voice heard in reply ; I , present here before their very eyes , in daylight , unseen and - invisible ! And the memory of Tsinshil-zaska 's words came back to me : - " The wolf , when hunted , if given time to eat what leaves he chooses , makes himself invisible . Has the Indian , being wiser , learned nothing of all this ? " Of the events which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my condition had passed , my memory is vague and confused . I remember them only as a man may recall some stray shreds of the tangled visions which came to him in delirium . Father Francis and the Indian stayed some time in the cabin , I know , the father at intervals advancing suggestions as to my whereabouts . I know too that in those moments I called and prayed to them to see me . I brandished my hands in their faces ; fell at their feet , and clutched the skirts of the father 's robe , which moved not as my nerveless fingers touched it . I struck Tsin-shilzaska in the face with my clenched fist , and not so much as an eyelid trembled . I raved and wept , and shouted in their ears , and they stood unconscious of my presence . I flung myself before their feet as they turned to go , and their feet brushed me aside , without my feeling the contact or having strength to resist . // They did not so much as check in their gait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " apparently , to them , I was . Once , when they had traversed half the distance to the father 's cabin , I still following , and clinging , or trying to cling , to them as they went , the good priest stopped , and turning abruptly to his companion said : - " And thou , my . son , knowest nothing of him ? " Gravely , sternly , searchingly , he looked the Indian in the eyes . But the other , - the red scoundrel ! - how firmly he bore the scrutiny ! Not a muscle of his face moved . He assumed no look of injured innocence . There was no over-acting . Unconcerned , imperturbable , he gazed back into and through the father 's eyes . " Of the Man - with - the - little - rifle ? Tsin-shil-zaska knows nothing of him . " " But you quarreled with him , my son ? " " huh For an instant longer the father looked him in the face ; then turned and walked on . It was impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I longed to tell him to go on questioning , - to thrust home and spare not , and probe till lie had forced the truth from the Indian 's heart . But I could not . I was powerless , hopeless , substanceless . As the day wore on and the white mist began to lift from the mountain slopes , lingering in thick flakes and scarves about the pine boughs , Father Francis organized a search expedition for me . The Indians started in a body up the river - bank , while the father himself struck into the hills behind the Mission . I stayed behind , desolate and hopeless . Soon after noon , - a dull , sodden day it was , - the Indians returned ; and an hour or so later , the father too came back . The father spent most of the evening on his knees , coming out occa sionally into the air to look and listen for any signs of me , while I would stand hopeless by his cabin door , and try again and again to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the night his candle burned , reddening the rough inside of the cabin , and just showing the outline of the black figure that kneeled before the crucifix in prayer . Another day caine and went . The forenoon was again spent in search for me , - though the Indians only started off in a perfunctory , listless way , and returned again within an hour , - and all the evening and night the good priest remained on his knees , praying , as I knew , for me . For myself , I needed neither sleep nor nourishment . At night I wandered about the moonlit slope , wondering whether ghosts felt as miserable as I ; or sat in the doorway of my cabin ; occasionally , but rarely , throwing myself on my bunk , and lying there , longing to know how long this would last , and cursing Tsin-sliil-zaska in my heart . Whatever change had come over my being , however thin and substancel*ss I might be ( I had soon discovered that I threw no shadow ) , it was evident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the atmosphere . I walked , and sat , and moved , - the law of gravitation affected me , - as though I were still solid and of ordinary fleshly weight . Only in relation to other substances and beings did I feel inferiority ; and there were moments of solitude when I would actually forget my condition . Nor , in those first days , did it ever occur to me that my disembodiment , or etherealization , could be anything more than a temporary affection , which would last only so long as the operation of the drug continued active . But one day I made a discovery , - curious at first , horrible afterwards . It was on the afternoon of the third day - a variable afternoon of alternate cloud and sunshine - that I was standing in // front of the Mission , in the centre of the crescent of cabins , when the five ponies , which wandered at will on the foot-hills , unhobbled , came walking in single file towards the river . I was directly in their line of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small dapple-gray , rat-like animal , with pink nose and ropy tail - I reached out my hand to its forelock . The animal at once flung its head aside and avoided my touch . Could it have been only an accident ? I hurried after it , and placed myself again in its path . Again it swerved aside , and deliberately walked around me . I laid my hand on its flank . It winced , shambled on a step or two , changed feet , and broke into a lope . The second pony had reached me by this time . The same series of experiments had a like effect , and all five were soon going at a canter towards the river . There could be no question of it . The ponies recognized my presence . Here , as I have said , was a discovery ( and now I remembered the blue jay ) which might prove useful to me . At any rate , it was infinitely consoling to know that I still had some appreciable properties . It detracted something from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some shadow of a semblance of companionship in my solitariness , and I proceeded to make the most of it . I have once referred indirectly to the presence of a dog at the Mission , - one of the hungry , half-coyote , pariah curs which are attached to every Indian camp or caravan . When the ponies had left me , I turned my attention to this dog , which was lying on the grass beside the teepee . As I drew near , his eyes opened and his ears went back , and when I reached out my hand to pat him he drew his head away , sat up on his haunches , - still keeping out of my reach , - and at last got up and slunk off . He trotted a few paces around me in a half circle , and then lay down again , but evidently uneasily . I approached once more ; and again he evaded me . So , for some minutes , I kept him shifting his ground , until he refused to lie down at all , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go and leave him alone . That I refused to do . Presently he grew tired of being hunted , and commenced to whimper , - a low , whistling whimper at first , and then growing louder and louder . Finally , as I made a pounce at him , he fairly turned tail and fled , howling dolorously , into the teepee . " The dogs howl with icy breath When Azrael , Angel of Death , Takes his flight through the town . " The quotation from the Koran came into my mind , and then a sudden horror seized me . " Angel of Death ! " The time since my first awakening from the coma had been divided into three stages , or periods , by three moments of supreme terror . The first was the terror of unreality , when the feeling of my lack of relationship to the substances around me had first come over me . The second was the terror of invisibility , when I first knew that Father Francis and the Indian did not see me . Last came the terror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead ? Again and again , at night-time chiefly , I had thought of myself as ghost-like . But was I really a ghost ? How could I deny it ? What knowledge had I of the state beyond the grave , to be sure that this was not the common form of departed spirits ? I thought of all the men of whom I knew , from Socrates downwards , who have believed in the presence of demons , or angels , or genii , or the spirits of dead fellow-men , invisible , on earth . What assurance had I that my condition was exceptional , - that I was not sharing the common lot that comes to all men after death ? I needed no food to support me . Perhaps it was only an ordinary , though to me // unknown , poison that had been given me , and no drug of mysterious potency . But no , I thought , with sudden relief , that can not be . Where , if so , is my body , - my ( how I shuddered at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was short-lived . Why could not Tsinshil-zaska have hidden my body as easily as he had hidden my clothes and rifle ? And I found myself actually sweeping the horizon with my eyes , to see if anywhere over the tree-tops I could see hovering the tell-tale buzzard* or carrion crows , to show me where my own corpse lay . For the first time it occurred to me with any force that perhaps my state was something more than a temporary affection , dependent upon the continued action of a drug . For the first time I thought that an eternity of this wretchedness might lie before me . How could I tell that there were not other spirits around me , invisible to me as I was invisible to living men ; or , if not here on the lonely hill slope , how did I know that in the cities and haunts of men there might not be walking millions such as I ? The thought was horrid in its possibility , utterly overwhelming in its bewildering immensity . Then I fell upon my knees on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the supremest agonies can pray . From that moment I have never ceased to be devoutly thankful for the sustaining hope which was always with me . I arose from my knees full of confidence . It was easy for me to prove by irrefutable logic that the probabilities were enormously in favor of my being dead , - that I must be dead . But I never in my heart convinced myself , logic to the contrary notwithstanding . I knew inwardly that I lived still as mortals live , - that the life which enabled me to move , and think , and pray , was yet , in spite of the awful change that I had suffered , the same life as had always animated me , and as now animated other men . An instinct which I could not justify to reason bore me up against my own arguments , and that instinct , implanted , or at least first developed , in those moments of prayer , alone , I believe , prevented my reason from being dethroned . Henceforward , however , the pleasure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would stop to pat the dog or make a pony move from its path , to assure myself that I still had some hold upon the world of external things . But such experiments were ever accompanied with a chilling return of the thought of death and an echo of those agonies of doubt . I did not often try them . So day followed day , and I still wandered about the Mission , naked in my own eyes , invisible to others , voiceless to all human cars but my own , insensible to the changes of temperature , needing neither sleep nor nourishment , and senseless and numb of touch . The father had given up the search for me , though his eyes would wander mournfully from my cabin to the distant hills , and from there to heaven , when his lips would move in silent prayer . How , in those days , I learned to love and honor Father Francis ! And for Tsin-shil-zaska my hatred increased . He and his three companions still hung around the Mission , ostensibly to wait till they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up stream . They divided their time between sitting on the ground about the teepee and sitting on the ground by the river 's hank . Occasionally , they mounted their ponies and went off , aimlessly as it seemed , for half a day 's ride over the plains and foothills . Timothy was still an invalid . I had lived thus for a week , - what a week ! - when I made another discovery , of more importance than the last . It was mid-afternoon , - still and hot as a Pacific coast spring day can be , - the air shimmering with heat , and the // last year 's butterflies , which fluttered round the walls of the Mission and sat fanning their wings in the warni rays , seeming the only things moving . I was sitting listlessly in the door of my cabin . Opposite me , the flap of canvas which made the door of the teepee was caught back with a twopronged peg of bone , and in the shadow within , I knew , lay Timothy , alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and entered the tent . In spite of the open door and central hole at the apex of the roof , the air within was thick and heavy with that oppressive smell - part grease , part dirt , and part humanity - which clings to the Indian wherever he goes . In the gloom I could just distinguish the form of Timothy , stretching almost from side to side of the narrow tent . The only other contents of the place were a heap of skins and furs , scraps of dried meat , tin cups , saddles , rope , and innumerable other miscellaneous but indistinguishable things , such as the Indian loves to accumulate , which covered probably one third of the entire floor space . Timothy was evidently asleep . There was no other seat there , so , conscious of my imponderability , but with no particular intent , I seated myself on him . As I rested on him he moved , muttered uneasily in his sleep , and then rolled round from his right side to his left , throwing me off . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . iNo sooner had I done so , however , than he commenced to toss again , this time suddenly , and heaving me , staggering , against the further side of the tent . Could it be possible that he was conscious of my presence ? I did not believe it , but determined to see . So , dropping on my knees by his side , I passed my hand once or twice over his face . Yes , he felt it . Drowsily he shook his head , as if to free himself from my hand , and , when I removed it , lay still again . By this time I had become excited and keenly hopeful . Again I touched his face , weighed against his side , and passed my hand over his frowzy , tangled hair . Yes , he stirred as before . " Timothy ! " I called . " Timothy ! Wake up ! I am here ! Do you hear me ? Timothy ! " Slowly his head rolled from side to side , and his lips began to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he made only an indistinguishable murmuring . Again I called and shook , or tried to shake him . Once more his lips moved , and brokenly among the mutterings I caught my name , - " Manwith-the-little-rifle . ' " Yes ! Yes ! Timothy , " - how I was thrilling with excitement ! - " the **25;865;TOOLONG is here ! He is speaking to you now ! Do you hear him ? Timothy ! " But the response was inaudible . Excited almost to frenzy , I called and called again , shook him , and threw myself upon him . Suddenly he reached out his arms , and , with a cry of pain , awoke . There was a startled look in his eyes , I could see in the gloom , as though he expected to find somebody there . I waited , hardly daring to breathe in my suspense . But the look died away . Evidently I was as invisible to him as ever . He pulled himself up to a half-sitting posture , and , leaning against one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes staring out through the open door into the sunlight . Awake he was utterly unconscious of my presence , but asleep he was sensible of my touch and heard my voice . Was it possible that between human beings , when asleep , and myself there existed some such affinity as was evident between myself and brutes ? Altogether incapable of making my presence felt by people when awake , was it possible that I could place myself en rapport with them when asleep ? So it must be ; // and I sat and watched Timothy , hungrily waiting for the first signs of returning somnolence , like a vulture waiting the approach of death to a wounded man . But Timothy was incorrigibly wide awake , as he reclined there , gazing with unfathomable eyes at the distant landscape . Presently the sound of cantering hoofs told that the others were returning , and I left the teepee to wait impatiently for nightfall . Never , it seemed to me , did the sun sink so deliberately behind the horizon . When night did come , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How late he read ! At last the volume was placed carefully aside . Then the light was extinguished , and I knew that a prolonged interval of prayer would elapse before he went to bed . I drew near , and sat in the doorway , from whence , in the gloom within , I could vaguely distinguish the outline of the dark-robed figure kneeling beneath the crucifix . Sometimes the murmur of his voice reached me , fervent but low , and more than once my heart was stirred deeply as the cadence of my name caught my ear . At length he rose , and was soon lying on his bed of cedar boughs , a rough and unaccommodating couch for so aged and good a head . I approached , and stood by the bunk side , waiting till the regular breathing told me that he slept . Then , with intense if suppressed excitement , I commenced my experiments . First , I leaned over him , and whispered his name several times in his ear . Next , lightly and reverently , I passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or three such passes a certain irregularity in the breathing told me that his slumber was disturbed . " Father ! Father Francis ! It is I , Arthur Sayce , your son , who speaks ! " Wearily he rolled his head from side to side ; a faint murmur broke from his lips , and then - he awoke ! The disappointment , when his sudden movement and the change in respiration told me that he had awaked , was intense . But there was nothing for it but to wait till sleep again asserted itself . This did not take many minutes , but to me , in my impatience , every moment of delay was irksome . At length he slept ; but , as he had awaked so easily before , I knew that it would be better to allow him to become more deeply immersed in slumber before recommencing my experiments . So I left the cabin , arid sentenced myself to walk twenty times from the door to the Mission and back , before returning . This time I was more cautious , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any sense of touch , I could regulate my muscles perfectly ) and breathed his name more lightly in his ear . Whenever he moved , I ceased , - waiting breathless with fear lest he should wake ; then I commenced again to touch and whisper to him as soon as the regularity of his breathing was resumed . It was a stealthy and seemed an unholy work , and more than once I started guiltily at the hoot of an owl or the cry of a distant wolf . * I thought to myself , " is how the midnight murderer feels . " Many a time he murmured indistinctly in his sleep , but it was not till the night was far advanced , after hours of striving in alternate hope and despair , that I caught the sound of my name from his lips . " Arthur Sayce ! " he murmured brokenly . " He has not returned . My son ! My son ! He will not come to me , but I may go to him ! " " Yes ! Yes ! Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has come to you ! It is I , father , speaking to you now ! " But he was awake again . Once more , when he fell asleep , I exiled myself from the cabin , and resumed my old task , increased this time , by sentence of the court , to thirty turns outside . Returning , the same slow work // of establishing communication with the slumbering mind commenced . By many repetitions , alternately insisting and desisting , I brought him once more to speak my name . By slow degrees , going again and again over every step of ground , and always fearful that he was on the brink of wakefulness , I told him all the story , - I told him how Tsinshil-zaska had given me a drug ; and at the twentieth repetition of the fact , perhaps , the sleeper gulped , and the muscles of his throat went through the motions of swallowing in his slumbers . I told him of my sickness and of my coma , and in the responsive , uneasy tossings of his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sickness and pain was with him in his sleep . I told him of my waking and of his coming to my cabin , of the discovery of my powerlessness ; and as I did so , repeating each phrase many times , the name of the medicine man fell from his lips , and in the mutterings that followed the word " unrepentant " caught my ear . The excitement of the narration and of the eager waiting for signs that he understood was intense . Merely as a psychical experiment , the operation was keenly fascinating ; but added to that was the fact that , as I trusted , my life itself hung dependent on the experiment 's success . Again he awoke , and again , with unflagging eagerness , I went through all the story , repeating and again repeating every detail of it . The final fact that I had to force upon his mind was that Tsin-shil-zaska , and he alone , as far as I knew , had possession of the secret , and from him , if from anybody , must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drug be learned . How often and in how many forms I repeated that fact I do not know . But the gray light of morning came , and found me still struggling with him . Then I left him , that he might have some space of peaceful slumber , and went out into the open air to wait for day as impatiently as I had waited for the preceding night . At the first movement inside the cabin , I returned . Father Francis was just rising . I was beside him as he stepped from his bunk , crossed the floor , and fell on his knees before the crucifix . His first sentences of prayer were audible words of thanksgiving , - " In that Thou , 0 Lord , hast esteemed my service worthy of continuance for yet another day of earth , " - and of supplication for the welfare during the day of " Thy servant and those whom Thou hast allotted him to labor with , as well as for all Thy children upon earth . " Then his words became unintelligible even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joy that I caught them rising again : " Strange visions , 0 Lord , Thou knowest have come to me in my sleep in this the past night , but I know not whether they were of Thee , and sent as of old when Thou spakest to Thy servants in dreams and symbols , as also not seldom in later times . If in truth Thy laws have been broken , and one of Thy children has had the life which Thou gayest him taken from him contrary to Thy will , and if thou hast appointed me as a minister to rebuke the offender , Thou knowest , 0 Lord , that Thy servant is waiting to do what Thou dost command . " Again his voice became almost inaudible . Breathless with eagerness , I endeavored to catch the murmured syllables , but it was useless . How I longed for the power , only for one moment , to tell the father that what he had heard in his sleep was true , to urge him to follow the clue thus given to him ! But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I turned into the open air again , as the father rose from his knees . I waited anxiously for the first meeting of the father and the medicine man . It came after the morning prayer , when the sun was a-glitter on the mountain peaks , though the Mission lay yet in 1889. 247 // shadow . On issuing from the building , the father called Tsin-shil-zaska to him , and with him reentered the cabin . For some moments both stqod silent : the father keeping his eyes fixed on the ground ; the Indian , with frowzy hair and blanket muffled round his chin , gazing into vacancy . At length the father raised his eyes and looked at the Indian , while I stood trembling by . " Tsin-shil-zaska , my son , I have had strange dreams during the night . " " Huh ! " And there was a whole monograph of skepticism condensed into the monosyllable . " Once more I must ask thee : thou knowest naught of him who is lost ? " " Of the Man - with - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in the negative and with one slow shake of his head . " In my dreams , I thought thou knewest of the manner of his death ; nay , that thou hadst the power to produce him again . " " Tsin - shil - zaska has no power to bring the dead to life . The good father is a greater medicine man than he . " " When didst thou last see him ? " " The good father was with the Manwith-the-little-rifle last before he went away . Tsin-shil-zaska might ask the good father whether he knows anything of him . " " My son , " said Father Francis , " thou knowest that I have never unjustly accused any one , - that I have quarreled with none and done no man wrong . Thou knowest that I would rather love thee than hate , and if thou canst show me that my suspicions are unjust it will be gladness and joy to me . " The Indian 's face remained utterly without expression during this appeal . " The good father has no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Again there was silence . The father looked anxiously at him for some seconds ; then , - " I trust it is so , my son . If thou hast done any wrong , be sure that fhe Lord will convict and punish thee . " With that he moved away to the farther end of the cabin . Then for the first time a gleam of expression came into the Indian 's eyes , - only one flash , but a flash of such malignity and hatred as I have never seen in human eyes before or since . A moment later he shuffled out on the cabin . That day formed another epoch in my period of exile from the world . Then arose the fourth terror , which held a longer sway than any of its predecessors . This was the terror of murder . After the events of the preceding night , the intense strain and mental agonies of those hours of darkness , I was possessed with a strange restlessness all day . It was a curious feeling , - feverishness , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fever ; intense nervousness , if nervousness could attach to a being that is nerveless . The Indians had shambled off afoot in the morning , and the place was lonely even to me , accustomed as I was now to the supreme isolation of my condition . About midday , I , for the first time since the drinking of the drug , left the Mission , and wandered aimlessly towards the river . The stream was running brimful , and muddy with the melted snow from the mountains . Most unlike a trout stream it looked , as it hurried past in thick eddies and rapids , flecked with bubbles . Reaching the bank , I turned down stream , following the winding water through patches of woodland , and beds of purple iris , and round smooth lawns of grass . Arriving at one unusually dense patch of woodland and brush , it became necessary to leave the stream , and skirt the edges of the thicket . When I was half-way round , the sound of voices from the other side of the intervening brush caught my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the rhythmic cadence of an Indian // chant , - the rising and falling of that simple song without words which is common to all the Northwestern Indians : " **29;892;TOOLONG ! " and so on in endless strophes of " Hi-yiyi ! " and antistrophes of " Ha-ya-ya ! " 0n rounding the end of the woodland , I came upon the party from which the song proceeded , - my friend and enemy , Tsin-shil-zaska , and his two satellites . Just now all three were revolving in a common orbit round the same centre . From a distance I could not see what that centre was ; but on approaching I found it to be a simple stake , some four feet high , driven into the ground , on the top of which a dead scarlet-crested woodpecker was impaled . Whether the woodpecker was an accidental victim , or whether the old bird of augury still has for the red man of the Northwest any supernatural properties , I do not know . However , there Picus lay , or hung , evidently the central figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was new to me , and I have a suspicion that it was invented for the occasion by Tsin-shilzaska . Their blankets were thrown aside , and all were , except for a waistcloth , from the sides of which depended the straps by which the leggings , which reached a little above the knees , were supported , entirely naked . They were revolving in a circle , some ten feet in diameter , each equidistant from the other , of which the impaled woodpecker was the centre . Their attitudes and gestures were the same , and those which are adopted by , I believe , all Indians in their solemn dances : the knees slightly ben.t ; the bronze body leaned a little forward , as if in eager , stealthy march upon some enemy ; the head erect , and turning stiffly and in jerks from side to side ; the left hand pressed upon the groin ; the Tight upraised , as if about to stab with the large knife which each held in his fingers . " Hi-yi-yi-yi ! Hiya-a-a ! Ya-ha-ha-ha ! " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ad libitum . Each sang without reference to the time of the others , and moved his feet , raising them at each step very high , and planting them fiat and firmly , only to the cadence of his own voice . At intervals , Tsin - shil - zaska , who was evidently coryphiens , would , in addition to his regular revolution in the common orbit , make a quick secondary revolution on his own axis , - turning round on his heels as if suspecting some enemy behind , and quickly resuming his place in the circle , to recommence hi-yi-ing with renewed vigor . For fully a quarter of an hour I watched them treading their weary round ; then Tsin-shil-zaska quickened his step . The others followed suit . Quicker and quicker they revolved , till all were fairly on the run . Meanwhile their voices were rising , and the chant grew faster and wilder , till at length it culminated in that strange yelping noise into which all Indian chantings resolve themselves in the crisis of a dance . They brandished their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapidly from side to side . Keenest excitement was on every face . The yelpings rose higher and higher yet ; faster and more furious grew the dance , till suddenly , with one demoniacal howl in unison , all three sprang on the poor woodpecker with uplifted knives . A sudden stab from Tsin-shil-zaska 's hand loosened the bird from the stake , and it dropped to the ground . In an instant all were on their knees beside it , and in rapid succession the three knives were plunging into the mangled body , - so rapid that it seemed a wonder that none stabbed a comrade by mistake . For half a minute , perhaps , they were on their knees , each stabbing as fast as his muscles would work , and throwing into every stroke the strength of a deaththrust . It was unutterably horrible and savage to watch . I felt my own being // thrill with excitement , and the muscles of my hands twitched responsively as the Indians stabbed . When they rose from the ground , a few small shreds of bloody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gray - were all that remained of the sacred bird . It was a very Dance of Death . Whether or not anything as to the meaning of what I had witnessed had yet formed itself in my mind , I can not say . I knew that it made me shudder ; that it was horrid , - the condensed expression of all the bloodthirstiness of savage nature ; and , vaguely , that it had somehow a terrible significance . It was not long before I knew what that significance was . After a moment 's rest , Tsin-shil-zaska proceeded to gather up the feathers and fragments of flesh in his hands . Advancing to the edge of the swollen river , which was not ten paces away , he scattered them over the water , to be swirled away into eddies as soon as they touched the stream . This action he accompanied with the low chanting of what I knew must be a curse . Most of it was unintelligible to me , being in his native tongue , but twice the words " good father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ceasing , he turned round , took half a pace towards the Mission , and stood , the knife clasped in his right hand at the level of the thigh , the left foot forward as if about to make a spring , and every muscle in his body strained and rigid . The other two at once caught the spirit of the pose , and , similarly grasping their knives , threw themselves into the same attitude , facing in the same direction . A yell broke from Tsin-shil-zaska 's lips . He raised his knife as if to strike , and all three started to run abreast towards the Mission . At first I thought they were really about to " run amuck to the father 's cabin , and murder him in their present frenzy . But after some ten paces they halted , brandished their knives , with a ferocity that was indescribable , in the air , in the direction of the invisible buildings , gave one yell , and suddenly relapsed into perfect Indian apathy . It was awful to see the completeness with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wolves savage with the lust of blood ; and now , with their bronze skins still flashing in the sun from the perspiration which the excitement and exercise had forced from their pores , unconcerned and listless as if after a day of idleness . I did not wait by the river , but started at once for the Mission . There was no longer the shadow of a doubt in my mind as to the significance of what I had witnessed . The ferocity of the final feint in the direction of the Mission could not be misunderstood , even if the repetition of the father 's name in Tsinshil-zaska 's curse had not already given the cue . That a murder , and a murder of the most revolting kind , was about to be committed I knew , without any argument or the necessity of putting my knowledge into words . The medicine man was , of course , the instigator of the horrible conspiracy , with no possible motive for his crime but malice and jealousy , with perhaps a touch of fear , awakened by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of myself should be discovered . The dance , with its bloody symbolism , - whether improvised or of traditional observance on such occasions , I could not guess , - was undoubtedly intended to give to the crime some semblance of religious sacrifice in the minds of the other two . All this I realized without formulating my apprehensions into words , as I ran , in dazed , staggering haste , back to the Mission . Arrived at the father 's cabin , I found him seated on a stool , lost in meditation , with his eyes fixed upon the ground , his hands folded in his lap . I threw myself kneeling at his feet , rested my elbows on his knees , and gazed in an agony of // supplication and despair into his eyes . If I could but tell him ! If by the lightest sign I could only make known my presence to him , then it might be that in some way I could put him on his guard ! If it were only night-time , when I could speak to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before another night came it might be too late , and I would only be able , having witnessed his murder , to implore , in the perhaps more perfect communication of invisible with invisible spirit , his forgiveness . Was it quite impossible to establish a means of correspondence with his waking mind ? All my life I have had the supremest contempt for what I have considered the charlatanry of spiritualism , and mind-reading , and " Christian science ; " but in those moments of agony , how I wished that I had given even the smallest study to the methods which I had been so quick to despise ! Kneeling before him , I gazed with all my soul into the great grave eyes which , at a distance of scarcely a foot , looked through mine , and struggled to project some impulse of my mind into his . If ever man was enabled to influence and inform the mind of another , surely I , I thought , in the intensity of my endeavor , can influence him . Striving my utmost , contracting my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my eyes closer and closer to his , I watched with tingling anxiety every light and shade that flitted across his face . Sometimes serene in quiet meditation , then ruffling under the passing shadow of troubled thought , then again placid and smooth as if sunlit with the light of piety , I watched his eyes , as one may watch the surface of the lake on a day of fickle cloud and sunshine . More earnestly still I attempted to compress my whole being - heart and thought - into my gaze , and to force my mind into communion with his , trying to cut my attention from wandering even so far as to recognize the changes of expression on his sad , sweet face . Whether or not I influen*ed him , certainly he was influencing me . I felt myself drawn more near and yet more near to him ; my very life seemed to merge and lose itself in the soft light of his eyes ; a sense of dependence came over me , - of oblivion . I ceased to realize my own corporeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearer , purer atmosphere than I was used to move in . My mind was wrapped , engulfed , in his . A sense of quiet and of holy awe to which I was a stranger came over me . I knew that his temper was absorbing mine , or rather infusing itself into me . With an effort I strove to undazzle my sense , and with my heart as much as with my lips I murmured , " Murder ! " And it seemed to me as if it were he who murmured it , not I , - or at least that our two beings murmured it as one . Suddenly his brow contracted . His eye darkened , as if some thunder-cloud obscured the light . His lips moved . The charm was broken , and my mind freed itself from his . Hastily he rose and paced to the door ; then returned , and gazing for a moment , with clasped hands , at the crucifix where it hung against the rough log wall , in the further shadow of the little cabin , dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord ! I know not whether these presentiments , so often recurring , are sent of Thee , or whether they are but the unworthy forebodings of a fearful heart . Thy will be done , 0 Lord ! In the days past , Thine arm has upheld me in the presence of death , when the knives were already lifted against me , and Thy goodness has softened the savage hearts . Lord , Thou knowest that Thy servant awaits Thy bidding , and that if it be Thy pleasure that I should now die by the hand of violence I am willing to suffer . But I pray Thee , // O Lord , that this act be not laid to the charge of him who does it . Of Thy infinite mercy , I beseech Thee to pardon him " . *1 And here his voice became inaudible . I hctd influenced him ! At least I had been able , however dimly , to warn him of the danger which impended ; but I knew , and sickened at the knowledge , that he would take no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it resignedly as a manifestation of His will . The rest of that day was terrible to me , as one long waking nightmare . But at last the time for the evening service arrived . The father , who had been on his knees in prayer since mid-afternoon , entered the Mission building . The Indians came up the hill , with their long shadows in front , and followed him into the sacred edifice . Then they sat silent , expressionless , indifferent , while the man whom they were about to murder prayed for them . Perhaps they did not hear him , or surely his gentle words must have softened their hearts . His prayers were short . Doubtless he felt the mockery of it all . His words were chiefly a supplication in behalf of the three visible members of his congregation ; a hope that they might be blessed and purified , and made to live in the way of peace and gentleness , forgetting more and more the untaught manners of their fathers , and leading with every day a life of greater humanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , never changing countenance , and , when he ceased , rose and shuffled down the aisle , shutting the sunlight out of the door as they stepped into the open air . The father remained , as usual , a few minutes on his knees , and then passed out with bowed head . The Indians were waiting outside for his customary evening greeting , which was given with greater earnestness than usual , and which . they acknowledged doggedly , and with a brief , ungracioussounding murmur of response . Their faces did not change , - the same stolid , expressionless features , and the eyes fixed on the further dusk of the evening . It was all , to me , inexpressibly pathetic and very terrible . The father lingered in his cabin doorway for one last look at the now halfhidden sun , and I thought that I saw ; " in his eyes the foreknowledge of death . " Very deep and sad the eyes were , while the whole cabin , his face , his very robe , and the hillside beyond were flushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Indians shuffled off , their three figures black and large against the sky . The father was soon again upon his knees , and I sat crushed and weary in the doorway . The last tinge of rose almost faded from the western sky . The song of the meadow-lark and the osprey 's shrill scream ceased , and the night - hawks wheeled overhead . The mist hanging over the river shut out all the landscape . Once the father rose , and paced up and down his cabin ; and when he stopped in the doorway I rose , and laid my hands on his shoulders , endeavoring to bring my mind once more into communication with his , to piece out the imperfect warning of the afternoon . But it was useless . His eyes were looking up to heaven , " filled with the sacred imagination of things which are not , " and I knew that his mind was on a plane to which I could not climb , - holy and unapproachabk in its serenity . It awed me , and I soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came over me , causing sudden hop.e to thrill through me . But it passed , though I sat with head thrown back and muscles relaxed , inviting it to return . Darkness fell . The father prayed on . Hours passed , - nine o'clock - ten - eleven . My strained ears had as 5ret heard no sound from the direction of the teepee . At last the father rose , and lit a small remnant of candle , which was placed on a shelf just below the crucifix , // so that that only caught any light , the kneeling figure below and the bunk being in complete darkness . Looking out into the night , I gave a sudden start . Something moved there in the further , faint candlelight . Yes , there were figures approaching , - one - two - three ; and I knew that the supreme hour had come . But once more the dizziness was on me . This time the fit did not pass away so quickly ; and what followed is all indistinct in my memory . I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed him in . I saw the father standing and facing the Indian . Then sinking on my knees behind and almost touching the latter , as he stood beside the table , I swooned . When I recovered consciousness , it was to suffer again all the internal rackings , the nausea , and the dizziness that had beset me after the drinking of the drug . Through them I was dimly conscious of a certain hopefulness , - hope that this second agony might mean that the potion had exhausted itself . But hope was soon blotted out again by physical pain . Brokenly , as if from a distance , voices reached me . A movement in the blanket just before my face suddenly attracted my attention . The Indian 's right arm had dropped stealthily down , and the long blade of the knife that I had seen twice before protruded from under the folds to within a few inches of my cheek . Again the fit came over me , and I sank lower to the ground , resting with my knuckles on the sawdust floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came dimly to me : I became aware that I could feel a sensation of weight upon my hands , - a sensation to which I had long been a stranger . Hope ? Oh , I was hopeful in a vague , weary way . Everything was strange and unreal . I knew that I was becoming myself again ; that my flesh gained substance once more . I knew that my horrid trance was ending ; but I knew also that murder was about to be committed before me , and above all was the sense of intense sickness and great physical pain . I knew what was going on , - knew it acutely ; but I did not seem to care . The Indian fumbled the handle of the knife in his fingers ; and I heard his voice : - " Tsin-shil-zaska has not the power to bring the dead to life , but he can nake the living dead . " The crisis had arrived . I saw the fingers moving nervously on the knife handle , as if preparing for the final grip . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Clearly , as in a burst of light , it all came to me . Had I strength ? I knew not , but with a sudden spring I had clutched the murderer 's hand in both of mine . The left grasped his wrist . The right wrenched the knife from his unsuspecting fingers . I jumped to my feet . He turned quickly to confront me . The candle , long apparently dead , shot up into sudden brilliancy , and a gleam of terror came into his eyes , as he saw who it was that faced him . In a quick movement of fear he raised his left arm , and with it the blanket from his breast , and I drove the knife with all my strength into his heart . We fell together to the ground . Neither had uttered a sound . Then , as I lay , came the nausea again , - deathly retching ; everything swam around me ; my head seemed bursting ; then blackness , and once more I was unconscious . When I awoke it was afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in at the open door , throwing a long , pointed patch of yellow across the floor . I was in the father 's cabin , lying on the bunk , with a blanket thrown over me . I knew at once that I was again as other men are . Father Francis kneeled by my side . " Father ! " // " My son ! " " Can you see me ? " " Assuredly , my son ! With a long sigh of relief , I turned on my side , and gazed out of the open door at the sunlit landscape , my whole being filled with a sense of dreamy pleasure , such as one feels between sleep and waking , - an inexpressible contentment . There was no alloy whatever in the pure enjoyment of the sensation of new-found life . And now for my object in writing this . It is in no wise to be regarded as a confession of crime ; though indeed , if at any time , through the information of any of the other Indians , accusation should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , herein lies his exculpation. iNor is it simply written to catch the public ear by the narration of experiences which I believe to be unprecedented . It is chiefly for the benefit of my brothers of the medical profession , many hundreds of whom will know my name . To them I speak . Somewhere on these western slopes of the Bitter Roots , not far from the Ceur d'Al*ne River , and so near to the Mission that the Indian could procure it within a day 's journey , is to be found a drug of properties entirely new to science . A physician will not need to be told that the action of the potion was not that of any ordinary acid or alkali . Its operation on me was something more than one of mere chemical dissolution , - no simple resolving of matter into its elements . With some subtler action than chemist has ever been called upon to analyze , - by means of properties the very genus of which can not be guessed at , - it works upon the vital forces themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the language of prescriptions : " the gift of fernseed " in the hands of every qualified pharmacist in the United States ! And during the two months in which I have been searching for the herb with the pungent , well-remembered smell , there is not a fern on the mountain side that I have not examined and experimented with again and again , with some vague , halfsuperstitions hope that the old myth may somehow help me to the truth . I have visited the reservation , and cross-questioned the only medicine man now holding any authority , but am convinced that he knows nothing of the secret . Perhaps , had I considered that I was destroying the only clue within my reach , I might have stayed my hand from the death-thrust . But I doubt it . Terror and hatred were strong within me . I do not purpose leaving this section until the secret is *in my hands . Once only have I had any hint of the presence of the plant that I am seeking . It was in a patch of dense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rises abruptly from the river 's edge . I was forcing my way through the tangled brush , when suddenly there was a movement a few feet ahead , and a great she cinnamon bear rose in the dim light from behind a rotting log , where she had been lying with her pair of cubs . I knew that I should have to fight , and at once brought my Winchester to my shoulder . The brute scranibled over the log towards me , and as she rose on her haunches on the nearer side , scarcely fifteen feet away , I fired . She dropped , but rose again and charged . The flash from the muzzle must almost have scorched her face , as my second bullet crashed through her skull . So close to me was she that , in falling , one of her fore-paws struck me just above the ankle , and sent me rolling backwards into the brush . In that moment when I was falling the well-remembered scent came clearly to my nostrils .
