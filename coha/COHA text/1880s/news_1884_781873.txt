txt Mr. W. D. LEE hastens , " in justice to Mr. BLAINE , " " to say that his letter to the Hon. H. S. BUNDY , dated Bar Harbor , Me. , July 22 , * * * is true , " and he then proceeds to show that it is false . One of the statements in Mr. BLAINE'S. letter was as follows : " Nor have I at any time owned a share of stock in any coal , iron , or land company in the State of Ohio . " Mr. LEE says : " In 1880 I solicited Mr. BLAECE , through the Ron . Thomas EwrsG , my attorney , to subscribe for one share in what was styled the ' Hope Furnace Tract Association , ' for which he was to pay $25,000 . This subscription was made and paid upon the condition that if at the end of two years Mr. BLAINE should decide not to take the one share , then , upon notice to that effect , I agreed to refund the amount paid with 6 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a loan . " And he goes on to say that , " at the end of the two years , " Mr. BLAINE gave notice and got a promise of repayment and $50,000 bonds of the Standard Coal and Iron Company as collateral . This statement on its face shows that Mr. BLAINE 'S declaration that he did not " at any time " own a share in a land company in Ohio was false , for Mr. LEE says that he subscribed for such a share and paid the subscription . If Mr. LEE afterward bought that share at par and interest it was not the less in the interval Mr. BLAINE 's share and no one else 's . The receipt BLAINE held was for " $25,187 50 , being payment in full for one share in the association formed for the purchase of lands known as the Hope Furnace Tract . " It may be added . that the lands were purchased , and from the 17th of December , 1880 , when the receipt wasgiven , to the 25th of May , 1882 , Mr. BLAINE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company . The explanation given by Mr. LEE not only shows the falsity of Mr ! BLAINE 'S assertion , but it does not explain the documents in the case . He says the transaction was to be regarded as a loan , on notice to be given after ' ? two years , and , that " at the end of the two years " the notice was given , and $50,000 bonds were placed in Mr. Euass 's hands for BLAINE , as security for payment . But Mr. BLAINE subscribed and paid for the share of the Hope Furnace Tract Association Dec. 13 , 1880 , and got his receipt under date of Dec. 17 . The bonds were turned over to ErAnNs on the 25th of May , 1882 , seventeen months afterward , and seven months before " the end of the two years . " The discrepancy is not important except as showing the looseness of Mr. LEE 'S statements . - Again , Mr. ' BLAINE says the alleged loan was made five years ago ; Mr. LEE says it was made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loan was for $12,500 ; Mr. LEE says it was for $25,000 . The effect of these contradicis.to bring out more'clearly the hopeiessness t of . Mr. BLAINE 'S propensity for telling untruths . To this Mr. J. HENRY BROOKS adds the information that if BLAINE really bad a secret understanding with Mr. LEE , acted in the not " strictly honorable capacity of stool pigeon . It is ' a. surprise to maw how Mr. Bnt , : prn , with his reputation for " shrewdness " and " smartness , " gets himself so tangled up in falsehoods every time ho undertakes to explain a personal transaction . But the explanation is not far to seek . Mr. BLAINE 'S acuteness has been developed in the lower range of politics , in the field of intrigue , chicane , and cheap partisanship . Here his transactions have been necessarily secret and confidential . No record was kept , no accountability was required or was possible . Few persons were admitted . to a knowledge of what was going on , and these had the strongest motive to stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BLAINE 'S habit of statement has been acquired in the same school . He has cultivated the art of making plausible declarations and explanations in an open and apparently frank fashion for the effect of the moment , appealing to the passions and prejudices of partisans , not to the calm judgment of impartial critics . When ho has been required to make a logical statement , based on facts , and ? addressed to the . reason of , well-informed persons , he has uniformly , broken down . His diplomatic document ; were loose tissues of reckless assertion , mistaken law and misplaced zeal , which it was impossible to sustain , and which were treated with ' ill-disguised contempt by even the minor diplomats . His " History , " when it left the field of party politics , was marked by inexactness , and in that field was marked by the most unpardonable misrepresentation . The faults of his character and his training come out strongest in his personal statements . His habit of sweeping assertion and disregard of facts betrays him . He forgets the record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He flounders on from one falsehood to another , sinking deeper with every effort to get out . He has long since reached the point where any man attempting to defend him injures not only Mr. BLAINE but himself . Mr. PHELPS was the first example . Mr. LEE is the latest , but he will not be the last .
