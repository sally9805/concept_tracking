txt A WESTER BANK RUPT BILL . As is very well known , a good deal of the opposition to the passage of the National Bankrupt bill , generally- recognized as the " Lowell bill , " came from Western and Southwestern members of Congress . We have never thought that these men fairly represented the opinion of the mercantile class in their several States , but their opposition was a fact to be counted with and aided in preventing the passage of the bill after it had twice been very maturely considered and debated and approved by the Senate . It is an encouraging sign that a bill has been prepared and will be presented to Congress at its next session which has been perfected on the principles of the Lowell bill , approved at two successive sessions by a convention of commercial bodies , in which all the more prominent cities of the West and Southwest were represented . These conventions were called by the Wholesale Grocers ' Association of St. Louis , and the purposes to be accomplished . in the proposed . law were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call . They were , in substance , to protect the honest merchant , to punish the dishonest merchant , and to provide for a prompt equitable distribution of the assets of bankrupts at a minimum cost . It would be difficult to frame a definition of the legitimate ends of a national bankrupt law that should be more comprehensive and more sound than this . It excludes the defects of the laws that have been on the statute books at three different periods in the past , and embodies the best features of the laws that have been proposed since the repeal of the last one in 1879 . Practically , the general plan of the law is for the distribution of bankrupt assets by Trustees appointed by the court on the nomination of the creditors . These Trustees act under the immediate supervision of referees appointed by the court , with a review by the court itself . The courts are the district courts of the United States or the Territories and the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia . The referees are appointed by the courts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which a certain minimum number of cases shall be pending . Where this number is not reached , the district is united to an adjacent one or more , under one referee . The expenses under the law are paid out of the United States Treasury , from a fund derived . from a small percentage fee collected . from the estates . There is to be a fee of $10 at the time of filing the petition and when the case is concluded 1 per cent . of estates over $5,000 , or one-half of 1 per cent . if a compromise is reached and approved . The referees are paid $1,000 a year for the time actually employed and $10 for each case concluded . Their expenses must be reported in detail and approved by the court . Trustees receive collectively 5 per cent . on the first $5,000 paid out in dividends , 2 per cent . on the second $5,000 , and 1 per cent . on additional amounts . Thus it will be seen that pains have been taken to avoid the wasting of assets in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law  --  apart from the expenses , which were indefinite and were levied . on the particular estate  --  were the abuses of involuntary bankruptcy , and . the inequitable division of assets through fraudulent preferences . Both these evils are avoided in the proposed law . Involuntary bankruptcy requires the filing of a petition by three creditors , unless the creditors are less than twelve in number , and their claims must amount to $500 in excess of securities ; and process issues and . the controversy is determined by the court . if defense is made . There is what appears to be a very strict series of provisions regarding compromises , preferences , and all attempts at an unfair advantage . Any compromise may be set aside within six months or a discharge under the law within one year , if fraudulently or improperly obtained . Among the acts of bankruptcy is making a conveyance while insolvent for the purpose of giving a preference , or dealing in options while insolvent , and among the bars to a discharge are failure to keep proper books of account , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excuse of his duties by a bankrupt , giving a preference that has not been surrendered , or knowingly making a false statement . Further , if a preference has been given and . the person benefited . thereby shall have had reasonable cause to believe that a fraud . was intended , the property or the value thereof may be recovered by the Trustee . The fact that the transfer was not made in the ordinary course shall be prim afacie evidence of fraud by the debtor and " reasonable cause of belief " by the other party . Still further , the following are made crimes punishable by imprisonment , with or without hard labor , for a period . not to exceed three years : Omissions from schedule of assets and list of creditors ; false oath ; obtaining goods on credit with intent not to pay for them , obtaining goods to give a preference or to increase assets in bankruptcy ; disposing of goods otherwise than in the ordinary course of trade ; secreting or concealing goods to prevent process , or secreting , concealing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relating to property . Col. JAY S. Tones Y of St. Louis , who drafted this bill , deserves credit for the firmness and , clearness with which it follows sound principles . Its chief advocates are very confident that it will pass the next Congress , and if the public opinion of the country be as largely favorable to it as would seem from the action of commercial bodies , its passage would be a very great gain .
