txt The debt of the United States was reduced during the month of April by $14,415,823 74  - -  in round numbers , fourteen and a half millions of dollars . During the ten mouths which have gone by since the opening of the fiscal year the total reduction of the debt has been $128,748,214 . If the average reduction for these ten months be kept up for the two remaining months of the year . the total reduction will amount to about $155,000,000 , and if the debt is reduced as much during the next two , months as it was during the last two , the total reduction will be over $160,000,000 . There will not be found want . ing a goodly number of patriots to congratulate each other and the country on this evidence of our " prosperity . " The prosperity is not to be questioned ; the occasion for congratulation is not so clear . Thai any people is rich which can be made to contribute for every hundred dollars required for the expenses of its government sixty dollars additional toward the payment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a people of whom this extraordinary contribution is exacted is governed intelligently , prudently , and in a way to develop its resources and increase its prosperity as much as possible is not only a proposition to be denied , but it is a proposition which can not seriously be maintained . Glance a moment at the sources of the revenue with which this enormous payment of the debt is being made . Last year two hundred of the three hundred and sixty millions of revenue came from Customs duties ? in all 55 per cent . This year the total from Customs will be larger , and the proportion larger also . Of the total amount received for Customs , six leading classes of imports contributed 69 per cent . These were : deleted table The average duty on sugar and molasses was 5i per cent . and over ; on the grades principally imported it was from 55 per cent . to 58 per cent . Every family in the country paid this heavy tax , and those who could least afford it paid proportionately by far the largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty was 67 per cent . This , too , was paid by every family , and relatively the larger part fell on the poorer consumers . Ikon and steel and their manufactures paid an average duty of 47 per cent . It fell not only on the dwellings of all , but on the fences of the farmer , the tools of every workman , the machinery of every factory , and through these and the increased cost of transportation on the food and clothing of the whole people , and with the fatality of tariff taxes it rested heaviest on those who felt it most . Cotton goods paid an average duty of 33 per cent. , and flax and linen goods 35 per cent . These fell not only on the clothing of all , most onerously on that of the most laborious and least wealthy classes , but it fell with special force upon such classes as the sewing women , the worst paid and hardest worked members of the community . In short , to pay off our war debt within the life-time of a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , clothing , tools , and machinery , the very things which of all . others should be exempted from taxation as long and as far as possible . To save a few dollars in interest each year it is loading down the instruments of trade and industry , the means by which the common people earn their living , or else those by which life is sustained . " You do take mine house when you do takes the prop that doth sustain my house . "  - -  Nor is this the most unfortunate feature of the present system of raising and expending the revenues*. . - The - taxes which . are paid into gie Treasury on the imports of food , metals , and clothing are only a part , and by far the smaller part , of the taxes actually paid by the people . The Government 's share is levied on the importations made in spite of exorbitant duties ; but these duties enable favored capitalists to exact higher prices from the consumers , and the money thus obtained , which it is pretended goes to the employes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profits inordinately or to compensate them for mismanagement , incapacity , or laziness . In no case does the working man get more than the market rate for his labor , while he , in common with the rest of the community , is taxed in every branch of his living expenses . And this singularly clumsy and costly , unequal and unfair , method of taxation is the one with which Congress professes itself utterly incapable to deal , and proposes to turn over to an outside commission to investigate , with the single aim of avoiding any definite action upon it . It is a serious mistake for the leaders of the majority to suppose that a policy of this dodging and cowardly character will satisfy the public opinion which is steadily be. - coming more clear and more urgent in regard to the whole question of taxation . The country does , not desire , and is in no danger of desiring , either free trade or any near approach to free trade ; but it is awakening to the costly nature of the tax system which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are wholly inconsistent with the present condition of the country and the real needs of the Government .
