THE JOURNAL OF A HESSIAN BARONESS . " BLACK hearts , " says Jean Paul , C* are like lAack eyes : when closely observed , they are found to be only brown . " It would perhaps be difficult to conceive of a deeper shade of black-heartedness than was popularly attributed to the " hireling Hessians " by the more violent and unreasoning of American patriots during our Revolutionary War . Upon that unfortunate body of men , really more deserving of compassion than scorn , was poured out the concentrated essence of the hatred and bitterness called forth in a liberty-loving people by unnecessary oppression . But the passions are dead which were so 1 In the year 1799 , Connt Henry XLIV. of Reuss-Kistritz , son-in-law of the Baroness , collected and had printed for circolation among friends and relatives , the American letters and journal of his mother-in-law . That edition was stirringly alive one hundred years ago , and time , which has softened down King George from a tyrant and a monster into a stupid , obstinate , blundering old gentleman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own best interest , has also bleached out the hessians into at the worst a very light shade of brown . ' The letters and journal of the Baroness von Riedesel may do even more than this , for they unconsciously give a pleasant picture of a hessian woman 's courage and devotion ; of her homely , housewifely qualities , and her cheery fortitude under most trying circumstances . When Duke Charles of Brunswick succeeded in the following year hy one intended for public circulation . The extracts given in this article are takeis from a new edition of the book published in 1881. // March , conceived the brilliant idea of paying his enormous debts and providing the means for further extravagance by selling his subjects to King George of England at a few shillings a head , Friedrich Adolf von Riedesel was a young officer serving on the duke 's staff . His family belonged to the old nobility , and he himself was born in Lauterbach , in Upper Hesse , in 1738 . At the age of fifteen he was sent to the University of Marburg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marburg at the time , and the brilliant uniforms and gay life of the soldiers proved infinitely more to the young baron s taste than the black robes and dry study of the law . A change of profession was effected , notwithstanding his father 's unwillingness , and in 1753 the young man was sent to England with his regiment , which had been hired by King George . On their return to Germany , the Hessian troops came under the command of Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick , and young Riedesel soon became a favorite with the duke . He was rapidly advanced in rank , and in all the trusts reposed in him he displayed so much courage and ability that Frederick the Great himself invited him to enter the Prussian service . This , however , he declined to do , from a feeling of attachment to his own duke , - a decision he afterwards regretted deeply when lie found himself transferred to a service which brought him neither emolument nor honor . His wife , whom he had married in 1762 , was the daughter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourteen untroubled years together , when in 1776 Colonel von Riedesel was appointed to the command of the Hessian troops to be sent to America , with the rank of major-general . Their family consisted of two young daughters : Augusta , aged five , and Frederika , aged two years . A third daughter , Caroline , was born a few weeks after the general 's departure . It had been settled that he should be followed by his wife as soon after her confinement as her health and that of her child would permit . The prospect of such a journey , with three little children , one a baby of ten weeks , across a much-dreaded ocean , into a wild country , among a hostile people , could not have presented any very alluring features to the mind of an unadventurous German woman ; but the spectre , more terrible even than this , which haunted Madame von Riedesel was the thought of separation from her husband . Her friends , who seem to have been somewhat of the pattern of Job 's , tried to reinforce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would have to undergo , though without shaking her purpose . She did not shrink from the perils of the awful sea ; she was ready to risk being scalped by the Indians ; and even the chance of being forced to follow the general American custom of living on the flesh of horses and cats did not terrify her . But when her mother wrote to remonstrate with and reproach her for her intention , her grief was great . " Your last letter , " the daughter wrote in reply , " drove me nearly frantic . I could not endure the idea of being separated from you for so long a time , and yet the thought that you could ask me , could even command me , to remain here makes me shudder . To stay here would be impossible , when the best and kindest of husbands permits me to follow him . Neither love , duty , nor conscience would allow it . it is a wife 's duty to forsake all and follow her husband . My love for him is well known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the children . " Fortunately for her comfort on the journey , she was accompanied by an old servant of her husband 's , who had insisted on following his mistress 's fortunes , and who devoted himself to her // and her children with untiring fidelity during all the years of their wanderings . The little company set out on the 14th of May , 1776 , impelled by almost as desperate a courage as that which sustained the passengers in the Mayflower , on its first voyage across the unknown sea . Traveling in Germany itself , at that time , seemed hardly more safe than it had been pictured to her in the wild country to which she was going . " In Maestricht , " she says , " 1 was warned to be on my guard , as the roads were very unsafe on account of highway robbers , one hundred and thirty of whom had been executed within a fortnight ; part of them having been hanged , and the rest put to death in various ways . These , however , were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were hanged without trial wherever they happened to he caught . This information terrified me greatly , and I determined not to travel by night ; but as the horses I was provided with were very poor , I was obliged to pass through a dense forest just at dusk , when something swinging from a tree was suddenly thrust through the open window of the carriage . I caught at it , and as I felt something rough I asked what it was . It proved to be the body of a robber who had been hanged , and my hand had come in contact with his woolen stockings . " Before I had recovered from the shock of this encounter , I was still more frightened by the stopping of the carriage before a very lonely house in this same wood , the postilions declaring they would go no farther . The place was called Hune , and I shall never forget it . A man of suspicious appearance received us , and led us into a very remote chamber , where I found only one bed . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the huge fireplace . Our supper consisted of tea and very coarse bread . My faithful Rdchel came to me with an anx 853 ions face , and said , I am sure things are not all right here . There is a room full of firearms out there , and most of the people seem to be away . I have n't the least doubt that they are robbers . But I shall sit up before your door all night with my gun , and I will sell my life dearly . The other servant shall sit in the carriage with his gun , too . ' " All this naturally made my slumbers anything but tranquil . I sat down on a chair and laid my head on the bed . But at last I fell asleep , and my joy was great , when I awoke and heard that it was four o'clock in the morning , and that everything was ready for our departure . I put my head out of the window , and perceived in the wood which surrounded us a great number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the terrors of the past night . " The songs of the nightingales proved a favorable omen for the travelers , for they had no more adventures of an unpleasant nature , and arrived safely at Calais . To the home-keeping German woman the terrors of this unknown sea were almost as great as those of the robberhaunted forest . To quote her own words - " I was obliged to spend two days in Calais , 01 ) account of unfavorable winds . At length I was summoned to the ship . I must confess that my heart began to beat faster . My elder children were very happy , for in order to keep up their courage I had told them that when we had crossed the sea they would see their father . I appeared as brave as I could , so that they should not be afraid . We drove to the wharf . The boatmen took the two elder children and carried them to the boat . I had the youngest in my arms . I looked round after the children , and saw , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boat , and were jumping about among the sailors . I had my baby lifted in , too ; and then I had The Journal of a Hessian Baroness . // magnets enough to give me courage to follow myself , and I did not find it so bad as I had thought it would be . " Madame von Riedesel had expected to proceed at once to America ; but she was detained in England month after month , by various circumstances for which she was not responsible , and it was not until April 16 , 1777 , that she finally sailed from Portsmouth for Quebec , where she landed safely after a voyage of two months . Here she learned , to her great disappointment , that her husband had already left Quebec to join the army in the field , and she made preparations to follow immediately . The weather was frightful , and it was a weary journey , made partly in a small boat , partly in an uncomfortable Quebec cah*che , and partly in a birch-bark canoe , in which she had to cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When she at length arrived at Trois-Rivi*res , the Hessian officers who met her threw up their hands in horror at the bare thought of the risk she had run in her frail bark with three little children , where the slightest movement would have been almost certain destruction . Though the weather still continued to he stormy , the stout-hearted baroness determinedly pushed oii to Chambl6 , only to find , when she reached there , that her hushand had started to meet her , had missed her on the road , and could not be back until the following day . When he did arrive , they had only two happy days together , and then General von Riedesel was obliged to return to his troops , while his wife went back to Trois Rivi*i*es , where she led an anxious life until permitted to rejoin her husband at Fort Edward . Only a few days after she had reached the camp , there came the announcement that they were cut off from Canada by the American forces ; so that this proved to have been the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three years . She kept with the army from this time until the surrender of Burgoyne at Sarato*a . The army began to move on the 11th of September , 1777 . " At first , " she writes , " all went well . We had the pleasant hope of certain victory and of coming into the Promised Land ; and when we passed the Hudson River , and General Burgoyne said , Englishmen never give in , ' we were all of good courage . But wi at surprised me most was that tl ) e officers ' wives knew beforehand all the expeditions that were to he made ; and this seemed all the more extraordinary to me , as I had observed in Duke Ferdinand 's army , during the Seven Years ' War , that everything of the kind was kept a profound secret . Here , however , the Americans were informed in advance of all our plans , and wherever we went they were all ready for us , greatly to our disadvantage and loss . On the 19th of September there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obliged us to make a halt at a place called Freeman 's Farm . When we continued our march I had a large cal*che made , in which I had room enough for my three children and my two women ; and so I followed the army among the soldiers , who sang and were merry and eager to conquer . We passed through dense forests and a magnificent country , which , however , was deserted , as all the inhabitants fled before us , and flocked to the army of the American General Gates . This was unfortunate for us , as every one of these country people is a soldier by nature , and can shoot extremely well ; and besides , the thought that they are fighting for their country arid for freedom gives them all the more courage . At length the whole army was obliged to encamp for a while . . . . On the 7th of October my husband , with all the staff of generals , again broke camp . From that moment all our misfortunes began . I was at breakfast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was about to occur . General Fraser , and I think Generals Burgoyne and Phillips also , were to dine with me that day . I noticed a great commotion among the troops , but my husband said there was to be a reconnoissance , which did not strike me as anything remarkable , as it often happened . As I was going back to my block-house , a great many Indians met me , in full war-paint and with their guns . When I asked them where they were going , they cried out , War ! War ! ' That meant that they were going to battle , and I was quite overcome . I had hardly reached home when I heard shots , and the firing gradually grew louder , till at last the noise was dreadful . It was a fearful cannonade , and I was more dead than alive . About three o'clock in the afternoon , instead of the company who should have arrived , poor General Fraser , one of the expected guests , was brought in on a litter , mortally wounded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , and a bed was put up in its place for the general . I sat in a corner of the room , shivering and quaking . The thought that my husband might be brought in like that was horrible , and tortured me unceasingly . " At last , toward evening , my husband came . Then I forgot all my trouble , and thanked God that he had been sparcd to me . We had been told that we had the advantage , but the sad and downcast faces that I saw proved the contrary ; and before my husband left me he took me aside , and told me that things were going very badly , and that I must get ready to start at any time , though without letting my preparations be perceived . So on the pretext of moving into my new house on the morrow , I had everything packed up . " We set off on the evening of the 8th . The utmost stillness was enjoined upon us ; fires were made up and many tents left standing , to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And so we went on during the whole night . Fritzchen was afraid , and often began to cry ; and I had to keep my handkerchief before her mouth , so that we should not be discovered . " At six o'clock in the morning we halted , to the surprise of all . General Burgoyne had the cannon brought up and counted , which displeased every one , for with a few good marches more we should have been in safety . . . . At length we set off again ; but we had marched scarcely an hour when another halt was made , because we had caught sight of the enemy . there were about two hundred men , who had come out to reconnoitre , and our troops might have captured them easily if General Burgoyne had not lost his head . The rain poured in torrents , and Lady Acland had her tent put up . . . . The Indians had become disheartened , and one after another deserted . They turn cowards at the slightest obstacle , especially when there is no plunder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair and bewail her hard fate . . " Towards evening we reached Saratoga , which was only half an hour 's journey from the place where we had spent the whole day . I was wet through and through by the rain , and had to remain so the whole night , as I had no opportunity of changing my wet garments . So I sat down before a good fire and undressed my children , and we lay down together on some straw . I asked General Phillips , who came up to me , why we did not continue our march while we had time , as my husband had engaged to cover our retreat and bring the army through . Poor woman ! ' he replied , I admire you . Wet through as you are , you still have the courage to go on in this weather . I wish you were our commal ) ding general ! He feels too tired to go on , and is going to spend the night here , and give us a supper . ' " It is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spent // March , half the night singing and drinking with his mistress , the wife of a commissary , who was as fond of champagne as he was . " At seven o'clock in the morning of the 10th , I drank a little tea , and we hoped every moment that orders would be given to start . General Burgoyne ordered the beautiful houses and mills in Saratoga , which belonged to General Schuylcr , to be set on fire . An English officer brought some excellent broth , which he insisted on sharing with me , and we began our march again , though only to another place not very far distant . The greatest misery and the wildest disorder prevailed in the army . The commissary had forgotten to distribute provisions among the troops . We had cattle enough , but not one had been slaughtered . More than thirty officers , who could not bear their hunger any longer , came to me . I had coffee and tea made for them , and divided among them all the provisions which I always had in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although he was an arrant knave , understood his business very well , and often crossed the little rivers in the night , as we afterwards discovered , and stole sheep and fowls and pigs from the country people , which he made us give more assistance I called to Adjutant- General Patterson , who came by just then , and said to him with some vehemence , - for I felt the matter deeply , - Come and see these officers , who have been wounded in the common cause , and who are quite destitute because they have not received what is due them . It is your duty to represent the matter to the general . ' " He was moved by my words , and the consequence was that a quarter of an hour after , General Burgoyne came to me himself , and thanked me with a great deal of pathos for reminding him of his duty . He added that a commander was much to be pitied when he was not well served and his orders were not obeyed . I replied that I begged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I well knew , was not a woman 's province , but that it was impossible for me to keep silence when I saw so many brave men suffering and I had no more to give them . He thanked me again ( though I feel certain that in his heart he never forgave me for this ) and going from me to the officers , he told them that he was sorry for what had happened , but that he had made everything right by his orders . Why had they not come to him , as his kitchen was always at their service ? They replied that English officers were not in the habit of visiting their general 's kitchen , and that they bad taken food from me with pleasure , because they felt assured I gave it with my whole heart . Upon this he gave the strictest orders that the provisions should be properly distributed . However , this lasted only a short time , and then things were no better than before . - - " Our carriages were got ready for departure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband engaged  --  to make it practicable provided no more time should be lost . But General Burgoyne could not make up his mind to it , and lost everything through his hesitation . About two o'clock in the afternoon we again heard cannon and musketry , and all was consternation and alarm . My husband sent me word to take refuge for the present in a house not far distant . I got into my calbehe , with my children ; and we were just approaching the house , when I saw on the other side of the river five or six men , who were pointing their muskets at us . Almost unconsciously I thrust the children into the bottom of the cah*che , and threw myself over them . The men fired at the same moment , and shattered the arm of a poor English soldier who was already wounded , and was also going to take refuge in // 357 the house . Immediately after our arrival a fearful cannonade began , which was chiefly directed towards the house where we had taken shelter ; probably because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streaming towards it , that the generals were there . Alas ! there was no one but women and the wounded . were at last obliged to go into the cellar , where I camped down in a corner near the door . My children lay on the ground , with their beads in my lap . We remained thus through the wholenight . Thehorriblesmells , my children 's cries , and more than all my own anxiety prevented me from closing my eyes . " The next morning the frightful cannonade began again , but from the other side . Eleven cannon-balls crashed into the house , and we could hear them rolling over our heads . A poor soldier , who bad been laid out on a table to have his leg taken off , had his other leg shot away in the mean time by a cannon-hall. flis comrades all ran away ; and when they came to him again they found that he had rolled himself into a corner , in his terror , and was scarcely breathing . I was more dead than alive , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that of my husband , who , however , often sent to ask how we were , and to let us know that he was well . " We passed this night like the previous one . My husband came once to visit me , which lessened my anxiety and gave me courage again . In the morning we began to arrange our quarters a little better . Major Hamish and his wife and Mrs. Reynolds made a little room for themselves in a corner , with curtains before it . They offered to arrange another for me in the same way , but I preferred to stay near the door , so I could get out easily in case of fire . I had some straw piled up and laid my beds on it , where I slept with my children ; not very far away were my women . Opposite were three English officers , who , though wounded , were determined not to stay behind in case of retreat . They all three swore solemnly that if we were obliged to retreat suddenly they would not leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my children on his horse . My husband 's horse was always kept ready saddled for me . He often thought of sending me to the Americans , to remove me from danger ; but I represented to him that it would be far harder than anything I bad yet endured to be with people to whom I must be under obligations , while my husband was fighting against them ; so he promised that I should keep on with the army . Sometimes , in the night , my fear lest he might have marched away without me became so strong that I would creep out of my cellar to reassure myself . When I had seen the troops lying about before the fire , in the already rather cold nights , I could sleep more quietly . " Our cook kept us supplied with food , but we found it hard to get water ; and I was often obliged to quench my thirst with wine , and to give it to the children . . . . At last we found a soldier 's wife who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a task which no one had been willing to un ( lertake , because the enemy shot all the men who went to the river . They did not harm this woman out of respect to her sex , as they afterwards told us themselves . " We were six days in this dreadful condition . At last there began to be talk of capitulating , as we had hesitated too long , and retreat was now impossible . An armistice was proclaimed , and my husband , who was quite exhausted , was able for the first time for weeks to go to bed within four walls . In order that he might not be disturbed , I had a good bed made for him in a small room , and I slept with my children and my women in the adjoining parlor . But about one o'clock in the morning , some // one came *nd asked to speak with him . Sorely against my will , I was obliged to waken him . I could see that the message was not an agreeable one , as he dispatched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down again . Soon after General Burgoyne summoned all the other generals and staff officers to a council of war , to take place early in the morning ; at which he proposed , on the strength of a false report which he had received , to break the capitulation which he had already concluded with the enemy . But it was at length decided that this was neither advisable nor practicable ; a fortunate circumstance for us , for the Americans told us afterwards that if we had broken the capitulation they would have massacred us all , which they could the more easily have done as we had not more than four or five thousand men , and we had allowed them time to collect more than twenty thousand . " On the morning of the 16th of October my husband had to return to his post and I to my cellar . . . . On the 17th the terms of capitulation were completed . The general surrendered to Gates , the American commander in chief , and the troops laid down their arms and gave themselves up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent a messenger to me to say that I was to come to him with the children . So I seated myself in my caE*che , and in driving through the American camp I made the comforting observation that no one looked at us with insulting glances ; that they all greeted me , and even showed compassion in their faces at seeing a woman with little children . I confess that I had felt afraid of going among the enemy , which was quite a new experience for me As I approached the tent , a very fine-looking man came towards me , took the children out of the carriage , kissed and caressed them , and then , with t*rs in his eyes , helped me to descend . You are trembling , ' he said to me . Do n't be afraid ! ' " No , ' I replied ; for you look so kind , and you have been so tender with my children , that you give me courage . ' " He then led me to General Gates 's tent , where I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very friendly footing with the former . Burgoyne said to me , Have no further anxiety , for your troubles are all over now . ' " I answered that I certainly need not feel anxiety , since our commander in chief had none , and I saw him on such good terms with General Gates . All the generals stayed to dinner with General Gates . The same officer who had received me so kindly came up to me , and said , You would find it embarrassing to dine with all these gentlemen . Come with your children into my tent , where I will give you a dinner ; frugal , it is true , but offered with hearty goodwill . ' I am sure , ' I replied , you must be a husband and father , because you are so kind to me . ' Upon this I learned that he was the American General Schuyler . 1-Je furnished me with excellent smoked tongue , beefsteak , potatoes , and good bread and butter . I have never enjoyed a dinner so much . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were so ; and what was more than all , my husband was now entirely out of danger . " When we had finished dinner the General invited me to stay at his house , near Albany , and told me that General Burgoyne would be there , too . When I asked my husband what I should do , he advised me to accept the invitation ; and as it was a two days ' journey , and it was already five o'clock in the afternoon , he urged me to go on before , and spend the night at a place about three hours distant . General Schuyler had the kindness to send a French officer to escort me thither . When we reached the house where I was to stay , he left me and went back . . . // " Two days after we reached Albany , where we had so often longed to be . But we did not come as conquerors , as we had expected . We were received by the good General Schuyler and his wife and daughters , not as enemies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatest attention to us , and to General Burgoyne as well , though he had had their beautifully furnished houses burnt down , and , as every one said , without any real necessity . But they behaved like people who knew how to forget their own losses *n the misfortunes of others . This generosity touched General Burgoyne greatly , and he said to General Schuyler , how can you show so much kindness to me who have done you so great an injury ! Oh , that is the fortune of war , ' replied the noble man . Let us say no more about it . ' " We stayed with them three days , and they were reluctant to let us go . " Though the perils of war were now over for our baroness and her family , they had by no means said good-by to all disagreeable adventures . They traveled slowly from Albany to Boston , where they were to spend the winter . To keep off the cold the baroness had had her carriage covered with coarse painted linen , which gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ menagerie . This so aroused the curiosity of the people of the villages through which she passed that she was often obliged to descen ( l from her carriage and show herself , to gratify their curiosity to see the Hessian generaLs wife . This she did with great good-humor , finding it only a source of amusement ; but to her husl ) and , already depressed by ill-health and a gnawing sense of failure and disgrace , it added one pang more to the bitterness of his captivity . Her impressions of Boston were not very favorable . The family were lodged in the house of a countryman , and were all crowded into one room under the roof ; sleeping on straw , which they 359 strewed on the floor . As a favor , their host permitted them to take their meals in his room , where all the family ate and slept . The woman of the house , to revenge herself for the trouble they gave her , always took occasion , while they were at dinner , to comb out her children 's hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for the operation . The baroness pronounces Boston a very pretty city , " but inhabited by ardent patriots , and full of disagreeable people . " r1*hey remained here three weeks , and then were removed to Cambridge , where they were sumptuously lodged in one of the finest houses in the town , which had formerly belonged to a wealthy royalist . In this house they spent a comfortable and pleasant year , at the end of which they were ordered to Virginia . During this journey they endured many privations , often being quite without food , owing to becoming separated from their provision-wagon . In Virginia , she says , " we passed through the most picturesque scenery , but so savage in its wildness that it made me shudder ; and we often risked our lives in passing over the breakneck roads , where we suffered greatly from the cold , and , what was worse , from want of food . When we entered Virginia , and were only a day 's journey from our place of destination , we had nothing left but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get anything . One man gave me a handful of dried fruit , on the way . At noon we reached a house , where I begged for something to eat . The people refused it with hard words , saying that they had nothing foi- dogs of royalists . . . . The roads weie frightful , the horses overloaded , my three children quite white and fainting with hunger , and for the first time I felt quite discouraged . . . . At length an adjutant obtained from a guide a small piece of old bread , which had been gnawed all round , as it was too hard to break . . . The Journal of a Hessian Baroness . // " One evening we cam e to a pretty place , but our provision-wagon was unable to follow us , and we could not endure our hunger any longer . As I saw an abundance of meat in the house where we had taken shelter , I begged the hostess to let me have some . I have all kinds , ' she replied : there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watered as she spoke . Give me some , ' I said , and I will pay you well . ' She snapped her fingers in my face , and said , You shall not have a bit of it . Why did you come out of your own country to kill us and to devour our substance ? Now you are prisoners , and it is our turn to torment you . ' But see these poor children , ' I pleaded ; they are nearly dead with hunger . ' She remained unmoved ; but when my three-years-old Caroline went up to her , took her band , and said to her in English , Good woman , I am very hungry , ' she could hold out no longer , but took her into the kitchen and gave her an egg . No , ' said the little girl , I have two sisters . ' The woman was touched by this , and gave ber three eggs , saying , I am ashamed of myself , but I ca n't resist the child . ' She afterwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milk . " Such scenes were of frequent occurrence on the journey . The family reached Colle , their destination , in the middle of February , 1779 . A lack of space precludes the possibility of giving many details of the life of the captives in Virginia , where they built them a house and were surrounded by a pleasant circle of friends , among whom were Madame Garel and General Washington 's f*m il . G eneral von Riedesel 's health suffered fieri the climate , and his spirits from the galling sense of captivity ; while his wife was always busy and cheery , saddened only when anything went wrong with her husband and children . In August of that same year , they traveled to New York , with the expec tation of being exchanged ; visiting Madame Garel at her plantation on the way . Here Madame von Riedesel was much struck by the beautiful aspect presented by the vineyards , which were planted on the slope of a hill ; the vines alternating with roses and amaranths , making a perfect bower of bloom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the vineyards , as he proved brusque and unamiable . They had scarcely arrived in New York when it was announced to them that the exchange had not been effected , and they must return to Virginia at once . This was a seveye blow , especially to Madame von Riedesel , who was in a delicate state of health , and had suffered greatly from the journey . However , they were permitted to await the decision of Congress at Bethlehem , where they lodged with a Moravian brother , who proved his indifference to this world 's goods by bringing them in a bill , at the end of six weeks , of thirty-two thousand dollars , for the hoard of sixteen persons . This appalling sum was in paper money , however , and sounds more moderate when reduced to two thousand dollars in gold ; though even then board in Bethlehem could hardly be considered cheap . In November , they were allowed to go to New York on parole . here a fourth daughter was horn to them , whom they named America , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the English officers , who visited them frequently . " The last time General Clinton came to us , " writes the baroness , " he brought with him the unhappy and since famous Major Andrd , who started the next day on the fatal expedition on which he was captured by the Americans and hanged as a spy . It was very sad that this admirable young man should have been the victim of his zeal and kindness of heart , which led him to undertake such a very doubtful enterprise in order to // 361 spare another and older officer , whose risk would have been greater because he was so much better known . " In 1780 General von Riedesel was exchanged , and was given command at Long Island by General Clinton . For some months the family were obliged to be constantly on the alert , for fear of being captured in their beds ; and General von Riedesel 's dread of again being a prisoner was so great that he could sleep only when he was sure that his wife was awake . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still more upon his already broken health , and at his own desire he was transferred to Quebec , where he and his family remained until their return to Germany in 1783 . Here a fifth daughter was born , whom they named Canada , and who lived only a few months . Madame von Riedesel gives an interesting account of her life in Quebec . In September , 1783 , they arrived in England , where they were welcomed most graciously by the King and Queen . " One day when we were at dinner , " writes the baroness , " Lady Howard , the Queen 's lady in waiting , sent us word that the Queen would receive us at six o'clock that evening . As my court-dress was not done , and I had nothing else but a very simple Anglaise , I sent apologies at once , which I repeated myself when we had the honor to be presented to their majesties , who were together . But the Queen , who as well as the King received us with extreme graciousness , replied very kindly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are glad to see . ' She was surrounded by all the princesses , her daughters . We all sat down around the hearth in a half-circle , - the Queen , the princesses , the lady in waiting*and I , - while my husband stood before the fire with the King . Tea and cakes were passed round . I sat between the Queen and one of the princesses , and had to tell them all my adventures . The Queen said to me , I have followed your movements all the time and have often inquired about you , and always heard with pleasure that you were well and happy and were beloved by every one . ' " I had a terrible cough , and Princess Sophia went herself to get some black currant jelly , which she recommended as a very good remedy , and insisted on my taking a pot of it .

We stayed till ten o'clock , the King talking a great deal about America with my husband , and in German too , which he speaks perfectly . My husband was astonished at his wonderful memory . When we took leave of the Queen , she had the kindness to say that she hoped we would not leave England very soon , as she would like to see me again . But as we learned that the fleet which was to convey us with our troops back to Germany was waiting only for us , we had to hasten our departure , so that we could not wait upon the royal family again . It was with tears of thankfulness that the baroness returned to her home , but it was not a triumphant home-coming for her husband .

" This feeling never left him , nor did he ever again have an opportunity o distinguishing himself in the field . His misfortunes in his professional life were balanced by peace and happiness in his domestic relations .
