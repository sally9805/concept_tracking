txt I hasten to put on the wire a sensational statement made to me tonight by one of the best informed men in London , without in the least vouching for more than that he has extraordinary facilities for knowing what is going on underneath the surface of diplomacy . He believes that there is going to be a speedy and sudden smash-up between Italy and France at a time when everybody least expects such a thing .

" I believe this is the warmest praise it has yet had from an acknowledged English literary authority . The long-standing Russian Censorship against the admission or Carlyle 's " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works has just been removed .
