txt The fact that Democratic orators and newspapers are assailing the Treasury Department because of its policy in applying the surplus revenue to the purchase and cancellation of its interest-bearing bonds not only shows an utter ignorance of the law touching the sinking fund , but furnishes evidence that the Democrats have not even a proper conception of those correct business principles upon which the Treasury should be administered . The bonds purchased by the Secretary of tho Treasury with the surplus revenues have been for the most part 6 per cent . bonds of 1880 and 1881 . The last named bonds will mature on July 1 next , and 6 per cent . interest must be paid on them until that date . Every dollar of surplus revenue invested in those bonds results in a saving of 6 per cent . on the amount thus invested , less the amount paid fpr premium , and every business man will appreciate the wisdom of a , policy which thus applies idle money to the liquidation of outstanding interest-bearing bonds . It should not be forgotten that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtained with the consent of the holders , for the reason that the privilege of the Government to redeem will not be available until the date of maturity . The mere statement of the resulting benefit to the Government of the purchase of 6 per cent . bonds will explode the Democratic arguments against the policy of the Treasury Department . Take for illustration a 6 per cent . bond of the denomination of $100 , due July 1 , 1881 , purchased by the Treasury on the last offers of these bonds in New-York , and we have the following result : Paid , full value of bond , $100 ; interest already due and premium , 84 52 ; total paid for bond , $104 52 . If redeemed at maturity the Government would pay the full value of the bond , $100 ; interest , $6 ; total , $106 , thus showing a saving by purchase and redemption on each $100 bond of Si 48 . On Wednesday last the Secretary purchased interest-bearing bonds amounting to $2,500,000 , and the profit to the Government by this single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of these bonds which have been thus far purchased with the surplus revenues , the saving to the Government is $4,134,685 . This may be bad financiering according to Democratic theories , but it will strike every intelligent business man that it is good administration .
