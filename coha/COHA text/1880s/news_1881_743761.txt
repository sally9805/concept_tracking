txt Reports have recently been sent from Washington to the effect that the President has virtually decided upon calling an extra session of Congress , to convene late in April or early in May . These reports may at least be said to be premature . It is , perhaps , true that within the past few days , in consequence of the importunities of those who desire an extra session , the President 's mind has undergone , a change on this subject , but it can be confidently stated that he has not yet derided the question and still has it under consideration . Among members of Congress now here opinion as to the necessity and policy of calling an extra session is decided , the preponderance of opinion among Republicans being against it . Several Republicans , including Messrs . Robeson , Keifer , and Belford , called on the President today and earnestly protested against convening Congress in advance of the time appointed for the regular session , and these gentlemen report that the President , although incliningrto the belief that an extra cession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to avoid an extra session if it be possible to maintain the public credit and provide , under existing laws , for taking care of the maturing obligations withDub serious embarrassment to the Treasury . Those who are opposing the session have represented to the President that the entire amount of 6 per cent . bonds now outstanding can be paid before next December with the surplus revenues and a portion of the available cash reserve now in the Treasury , and that it would be better in every sense to reduce the interest charged by sredeeming $200,000,000 , or even $150,000,000 , of these high rate bonds in this way than to disturb the business of the country and put the Government to the expense of an extra session of Congress . It is estimated at the Treasury Department that the surplus revenue for the 10 months , of the present calendar year will be $109,000,000 , and should this sum be realized there can be no doubt that the Secretary of the Treasury would be able to take up and cancel $150,000,000 of the outstanding 6 per cent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result from such a course , when the expense of an extra session Is considered , would equal that which would be effected by any refunding measure that might be passed at an extra session . These facts and considerations were presented to the President to-day , and , in addition , it was urged that should an extra session be called , an imperfect refunding bill be passed , or should anything be done that would disturb business , the Republican Party would be held responsible , and would inevitably suffer damage in coming elections in consequence . The President was also informed that it was a mistake to suppose that the Republicans would stand solid for a refunding bill with a higher rate of Interest than 3 per cent. , or that they could be held together against such a provision as the Carlisle section of the vetoed bill of the last session . " It is easy , " said one of the President 's visitors , " to convene Congress , but what will you get when Congress is convened ? Will you get such a refunding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress stop legislating when such a measure is perfected ? " The President expressed surprise when informed of a division among Republicans on refunding , and said he would carefully examine the matter in all its bearings before deciding to convene an extra session .
