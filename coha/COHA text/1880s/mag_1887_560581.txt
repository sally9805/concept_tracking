Tim subjoined article is published as an illustration of the inadequacy of our laws to guard the liberty of citizens suspected of insanity . As the author explains , she was imprisoned nearly thirty years in an asylum , and then discharged with the unanimous declaration of an official board of examining physicians that she was not insane , and had never been insane . EDITOR . I DO not think any woman in America is better qualified than I to supply the material for a good sermon on insane asylumsfor I was locked up in one for twenty-eight years . During those years I never lost my reason-it is a wonder I did not  --  and so what I say may be relied upon as being truthful . The authority for my statement that I am not insane is the Committee* on Lunacy of the Board of Public Charities of Pennsylvania , through whose influence , in the summer of 1885 , my unjust imprisonment came to an end . My story is simple . I was put iu the asylum for two reasons : the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What a lot of asylums there would be if all people whose natures were like mine had to be locked up ! The other reason was that my family wanted me relieved of the disgrace of being publicly accused of obtaining goods under false representations , by resorting to the insanity defense , which , nowadays , seems reserved for the use of defendants in murder or arson cases . But to begin . I was born in 1825 , and am , therefore , now sixty years old . My father was William Draper Brinckl6 , a physician , who lived in Girard Row , Philadelphia . My mother died while I was young . On July 13th , 1857 , I was placed in the State Hospital for the Insane at Harrisburg , Penn. , on the commitment of two physicians , * This committee consists of Philip C. Garrett , Philadelphia , Chairman ; Henry M. Hoyt , Philadelphia ; Thomas G. Morton , M.D. , Philadelphia ; E. Coppee Mitchell , Philadelphia ; W. W. H. Davis , Doylestown ; A. J. Ourt , M.D. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other a stranger to me . An excuse , perhaps , for the difficulty in which I became involved was that I had no own mother to guide me . My father , occupied with his professional duties , was of course much away from home , so that I grew np , wandering at my own pleasure . Yet my education was by no means neglected ; for I received a thorough training in the ordinary English branches , became quite familiar with the French language , and acquired a thorough knowledge of music . I was naturally of a gay temperament and inclined to extravagance , and I knew that I had my father , and an uncle who resided in our family , to help me out of possible financial straits . My father 's property was invested in the mercantile business of the uncle to whom I have referred . In the year in which I was placed in the asylum there was a general panic in mercantile circles , and my father and uncle were unable to pay my debts . The particular difficulty in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit , for a parlor which I had rented in the home of two old ladies , distant relatives of my father 's family . Their house was small and I had no room for a piano . Having been musically educated it was a great deprivation to me to have no piano ; I therefore moved to a larger house in the same neighborhood , securing furnished parlors . Having no use for the furniture which I had purchased for the smaller house , I sold it . This proceeding came to the knowledge of the dealer from whom it had been purchased , and he prosecuted me . Before the time came for my appearance in court I was placed in the asylum . My father was advised to take this course by the late Judge George W. Woodward , then of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania . The examination of both physicians was very brief . My father asked me a few simple questions and then took his departure . The late Dr. George McClellan , the other examiner , inquii7ed how I was in bodily health . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea that the visit was made with an alleged view of determining my mental condition . He also asked me if I was able to take a journey and where I would like to go . I replied that I was quite able and willing , and would like to go to Long Branch , remembering that my health generally had been much improved on a former occasion at that place . My father subsequently informed me of the purpose of the examination and of the determination to send me to an asylum , explaining to me that he did not think I // was insane , but that it was all that could be done under the circumstances . I remember very distinctly that on the way to Harrisburg I did not relish the idea of being classed with lunatics , but Judge Woodward , who accompanied me , represented that it was better than being imprisoned in a jail , and that insanity was after all the bluntest horn of the dilemma , because it preserved family honor . So , on that eventful day , I was led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time the superintendent of the institution ( now in charge of the State Hospital at Warren , Pa. ) , and Mrs. Cole , its matron . To these people Judge Woodward , in my presence , spoke of my extravagant tendencies ; what he said when my back was turned I do not know . He wished me good-bye rather sorrowfully , and I think when he left it was with a little remorse at what he had done . Everything in the institution was strange to me . I felt that I , as sane a person as any of the attendants , or any one else for that matter , was in the asylum under false pretenses . I make the hint of the distinction between the state of mind of the nurses of the insane , and the state of mind of members of the general community , because my observation convinced me that the nurses at the Harrisburg Hospital , for some reason or other , were not all rational beings . Perhaps it was the contact with mad women . Perhaps the fact that some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , made this seem to me true . They put me in the best ward at first . I found life insupportably dull . The only things that made existence tolerable were music , which I loved passionately , and fancy work , which I liked less because of its monotony . It was a change , however , from the sameness of idling . My nurses were Susan Spiegelmyer , and Ruth Noble . Susan had had erysipelas , and had lost most of her hair , which afterward grew in very abundantly . An incident happened in connection with Susan 's hair that will show the character of the women who were my daily associates . Susan was accustomed to go into her room every night to put her abundant locks in curl papers . In going to her apartment for the purpose named she bumped up against the bed of a patient , invariably waking her up . The patient , who was nervous and irascible , complained every time , but the bumping went on in spite of it . One night // the patient calmly got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the curls and tore it out in its eutirety and by the roots , leaving a bald spot the size of a dollar , quietly remarking as she did it , " Susan , I do n't like the way you do your hair . " Susan never bumped that bed again . At the end of a year in the asylum , under the kindly care of these nurses , an attack of dyspepsia , from which I suffered prior to my incarcerati6n , disappeared . I think the regular way of living and the plain food effected that cure . In June , 1858 , my father came to see me for the first time , and complimented me on my rosy cheeks and generally healthy look . That was all very well , but I wanted to get out , and I told him so . He promised me that if I would wait until the troubles caused by my debts had blown over he would have me released . Then he went away . I never saw him again , and he died four years later . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave me the impression that my release would be a more difficult matter than I had anticipated . The man who can be said to have managed my detention was Judge Woodward , whose visits to me were frequent . Referring to the letters written to me by my father reminds me of the matter that he wrote mostly about . Soon after my arrival at the asylum , I met at a picnic given to all the patients a young inmate of good family . He was a son of a judge of one of the upper counties of Pennsylvania , well-bred and entertaining . After meeting several times we became engaged to be married . He was not considered insane , but it seems his family thought the hospital would be a good prescription to cure a certain intemperate disposition with which he was afflicted . He was addicted to the use of wine . My father and Judge Woodward wrote to Dr. Curwen , asking him to put a stop to our meeting . Thereafter , when my affianced and I happened to be going out walking on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without an attendant ) , he was allowed to go out by the front door and I was smuggled out by the back . The matron had previously smiled upon our engagement , and asked us together to take tea with her . All that was now stopped . All we could do was to correspond , letters being carried to and fro through the kindness of a night watchman . I rarely caught glimpses of the young man . For seven years , however , we wrote letters to each other , and we were all along determined that // when we both should get out I should become his wife . It was the knowledge of his being near me that made me less active in my efforts to escape . We once arranged that whoever left the asylum first should aid in the efforts of the other to obtain freedom . My friend was , at the end of the seven years of which I have spoken , removed from the asylum , I think to the Pennsylvania Hospital for the insane in Philadelphia . I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is . At any rate , I have completely lost trace of him . These things I remember so vividly because they were , as I said , all I had to relieve the monotony of life . A gentleman who was at one time Consul from Maracaibo , who had been very attentive to me before my incarceration , tried to see me but was not allowed to . He had two women-cousins in the institution . One was an opium eater and the other was insane on religion . Mrs. Dr. S was one of the patients in my ward who gave a great deal of trouble . She was a woman who was subject to fits of great and unusual excitement , and we had to humor her . One day she arranged the hair of a little girl-inmate somewhat differently from the usual style in which we were accustomed to see it . The effect was extremely ridiculous . She asked me if I did not think it a great improvement over the old method . In an unguarded and frank moment I admitted that I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did not think anything of the matter , and walked away from the dining table which we had just risen from , toward my room . Presently there was a whirring sound , and a large dish flew over my head and smashed itself on the floor in front of me . Having missed her aim , the finger of plates rushed toward me , picking up on her way some of the broken pieces of china . I ran rapidly through the corridor . The first person I stumbled over was little Mrs. H , an inmate , who always sat at the door of one of the wards , guarding it as she thought . We called her the " Watchwoman . " She became frightened and joined me . We sped together to the end of the ward , and barricaded ourselves in a storeroom by piling trunks against the door , and in a few moments our pursuer was captured by an attendant . I saved my life on several other occasions of similar character , by fastening myself in my room as best I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Untrained nurses in a hospital for the insane know no more // about treating insane people than I know about prescribing for a case of fever . The secret of proper conduct toward the insane is management . It requires tact . The ex-laundry-woman or factory girl who becomes a nurse can not understand such a problem as the mind , and when the patient is refractory she can only meet it with brutality . That is wrong . Those who are deprived of reason can not understand violence , nor has it any good effect on them . They can only turn their poor puzzled eyes in apologetic rebuke to those who assault them , and wonder what it all means . I have seen a patient who had been struck look in surprise at the nurse who struck her , and ask , " Why do you do that ? What have I done ? " Many patients can not be made to comprehend that what they do is not right , and violence to them is worse than useless . We may just as well thrash a cripple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man because he can not see . The only way in which patients can get on the right side of sane nurses is by doing their work for them . They are often expected to help to sweep and clean np . Of course to coerce the insane to do this is criminal . They should be regarded as human beings whose misfortunes entitle them to sympathy and pity , and not as scape-goats and laughing-stocks because of their uselessness to society . I saw a harmless patient who was sitting listlessly on a heating register attacked and beaten because she would not work . One nurse knocked her down and then called another nurse to her assistance . Together they got a patient afflicted with homicidal mania to join them , and the three pounded the unfortunate creature until she was black and blue . Her brother and husband happened to call and see her that very night , and to them some untrue story of the cause of her bruises was given . They were not satisfied , however , and they removed her . One of the patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her head wedged between the transom and the door-frame . She was quite dead . How she had ever got in that position was a mystery . Probably one of her associates helped her up with a chair and then removed it . One of the inmates suggested to a weak-minded companion in an adjoining ward to tie a handkerchief around her ( the companion 's ) neck and to pull it tight . The poor demented creature did as she was told , and it was not until she became very black in the face and was evidently // suffocating , that her tempter became alarmed and called for help . In doing so she calmly remarked to the nurse : " I have a suspicion that Mrs. So-and-so is trying to kill herself . " One man who was wrongfully placed in the asylum got out . He crossed the Susquehanna River far ahead of his pursuers , who left the hospital in full chase after him . He eluded them , pawned his watch to raise money , rallied his friends around him , and shortly afterward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had never been insane but was committed to the hospital , through some conspiracy , on the certificate of irresponsible physicians . During my twenty-eight years ' sojourn there , we had four or five fires . One of the most eventful of them happened at night . We all managed to get out . At another fire , Mrs. L , an inmate and a sister of one of the governors of Pennsylvania , ran away , and for three weeks lived like a tramp in the neighborhood . She was finally caught and brought back . She always insisted that during her absence the birds of the air had fed her , and she could give no other account of herself for the time during which she was missing . When I was playing a melodeon or doing embroidery , I watched the peculiarities of those around me . One thought that all those in the ward were her dead relatives , and she would address them by name . She believed a fellow patient to be her deceased sweetheart . During lucid intervals she was conscious of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any . * Mary , a patient from Carlisle , who was admired for her self-possession , smiling face , and quiet demeanor , took up a chair , one morning , and attacked an attendant with it . The latter eluded her , and the chair went against the wall with so much force as to break the plaster . She was tired of life , and thought that if she killed some one she would be hanged for it . One woman , a German , insisted on calling me Madame Lind , and wanted me to sing . A victim like myself was a Mrs. Z , who , with her baby , was in the hospital . I knew her well and was certain that she was not insane . Her husband was thriftless , she sued him for support , and he , out of revenge , put her in the asylum . Her friends * Another had an invariable answer for all the iniquities she heard of- " The fiery furnace is waiting for them ; " and , as she said it , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gave her auditors a sense of unrest . // soon applied to the court and she was liberated . A patient had to be tied to her bed to prevent her from hanging her feet out of the window . Mrs. B , an inmate , while every one was at supper , got a match , set fire to herself , and was burned to death . That was her mania . I do not think the nurses behaved with propriety in removing the remains of dead patients . They made a frolic of the occasion . The poor , half-witted wards of the State remarked upon the disrespect with which the clay of their dead comrades was treated . It was in much the same manner that patients were moved from one ward to another . My observing powers were concentrated during my stay on such persons as these : One man who had cut his throat ; a murderess of her own child ; a woman who had been a nurse and who killed an infant under her care ; a woman who had severed her child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; one who became insane through accidentally killing her child , and any number of patients with suicidal mania . Some lunatics seem to live in a world of their own . An old lady once astonished and amused us by exclaiming , without any warning or provocation , " Two cats and the bird of paradise are waiting to convey you to your heavenly home , and you are to sit for nine days between the cats and the bird of paradise . " Then she stopped , and forgot that she had said anything . It was like an alarm clock suddenly going off , startling every one by its unexpected meddling with what is going on , and ceasing just as quietly and surprisingly . A patient lived in the bath-room , and made friends with the rats ( they were numerous ) , for whom she had a great affection . They would actually do what they were told . Some one else thought she was the wife of President Buchanan , and had the hallucination that her husband frequently ran a locomotive through Washington Avenue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to remind her of the annoying fact that in her young days she had been a milliner . There was a Mrs. W , in one of the back wards , who was injured for life by a patient . One of her delusions was that she had enjoyed herself in previous years riding on the back of a dolphin at Cape May . I am happy to certify that during the entire period of my incarceration I personally received mild and courteous treatment // from the superior officers of the institution , as well as from the attendants . Possibly it was the conviction on their part that I was not insane which induced the attendants especially to avoid imposing upon me . Altercations with patients are , of course , frequent from the very nature of their maladies , and the position of a nurse or attendant in an insane asylum is a very trying one . It requires great patience and force of character , accompanied by a high order of intelligence . No two cases are alike . I have seen those who were insane every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other year . Some were apparently in full possession of their faculties , though sunk in deep melancholy ; while others varied from periods of intense excitement to moments of sadness amounting almost to stupor . In the fall of 1884 a notice , which the new law required , was posted up in our ward , telling ns that if we had any grievances , we could write freely about them to the Committee on Lunacy of the Board of Public Charities . Before I had time to avail myself of that opportunity of getting a hearing , I was taken very ill and was too weak to do anything for some time . When I recovered I found that the patients had torn up and otherwise destroyed the printed law the committee had had posted up ; and I did not remember the name of any gentleman upon it . Fortunately Miss Annie Drinker , a convalescent , recollected the name of the medical member of the committee , and wrote to him on September 27th , 1884 . We waited for weeks , expecting a reply or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter miscarried . We did nothing until December 31st , 1884 , when we wrote again . That letter reached the committee , and my appeal for liberty was at once looked into . On March 16th , 1885 , I sent a letter to Dr. A. J. Ourt , secretary of the committee , and shortly afterwards I was visited by him , Dr. Morton , and Mr. Philip C. Garrett , chairman of the committee . Soon after this the committee fully investigated my case and ordered my immediate release , and I was allowed to go free . As my means were limited ( my board had been always paid out of funds left to me ) , and as I hardly knew what to do , I went to the Convalescents ' Retreat , Glen Mills , Pennsylvania , where I now am . I do not think my story can create in the mind of the reader any but the one impression-that I am a wronged woman , and that there has been something amiss in the system of dealing with those alleged to be insane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible for my incarceration . My counsel informs me that an action will not lie against the State or the hospital authorities , as my commitment was made in due form of law . Apart from this , all those who procured my incarceration have long since died . My release came about solely under the operation of the new lunacy law of Pennsylvania , and the zealous efforts of the gentlemen whose duty it is to carry the law ( of May , 1883 , ) into effect . Before the law was passed , appeals from inmates of an insane asylum generally fell upon dull and unheeding ears . The only method of release legally provided was an application to a court of law . In the absence of outside friends this was practically impossible . The law requires the Committee on Lunacy to personally examine the complaint of every asylum inmate , and since the investment of its power and authority , others , who , like mysel , f , seemed doomed to a living death , have been freed from their bonds , and have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so cruelly removed . At their knock , the door of every asylum , public or private , within the broad confines of this State , must open . At their command the shackles on every lunatic must be loosed , and the blackness of the dark cell has been made to give place to light and air . Handcuffs , straightjackets , balls and chains , iron rings , and all other such relics of barbarism , are things of the past in Pennsylvania . To the gentlemen of this committee I am , under a gracious Providence , forever indebted that , after more than a quarter of a century , and at the age of sixty years , I am once more free . Even for this much I thank Him in whose unfailing love , in the darkest hours of my trial , I never lost faith . There are some who , while not responsible at all for my early incarceration , have assisted from time to time in restraining or opposing my efforts to be free . They are , unlike my poor parent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unkind word here . Suffering has softened all feeling of hate . Twenty-eight cruel years of torture have swallowed up the natural resentment of a once proud spirit . I leave them to Him , who for some wise reason visited chastisement upon one of His humble creatures , and who now in His own good time has opened to her the gate of mercy . ADRIANA P.
