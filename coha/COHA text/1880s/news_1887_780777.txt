txt The steamer Plover , running between the northern ports of this island and the capital , arrived here at 11 o'clock to-day . At 10 last night , while crossing Trinity Bay , she had a collision with the schooner Trixie H .. of Heart 's Content . The schooner left St. John 's Saturday morning with fishing supplies and a general cargo , bound home . She had 16 persons on bOard , including 10 passengers , three of whom were women . Unusual darkness had settled over the water , and a strong gale from the northeast , with a heavy sea , prevailed . A few seconds before the collision each vessel observed the other 's lights , and the usual orders under such circumstances were given . The Trixie was then running up the bay , and the steamer was crossing from the north to the south side . Although the orders from the officers of the watch were promptly obeyed , and both vessels seemed to answer their helms readily enough , yet the Plover struck the schooner amidships , cutting her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flow in so rapidly that she filled in a few moments and lay over on her side with her companionway and hatches completely under water . All were on deck at the time of the collision except the women , and these had time to get out of the cabin before the water rushed in . No attempt was made by the Trixie 's people to launch their boats , which were smashed and rendered useless by the collision . Ten of the men and one woman succeeded in climbing up on the side of the vessel , still out of water , where they remained until taken off by the Plover . After the shock the steamer backed clear of the wreck and immediately launched her lifeboats , Capt . Manuel being resolved to render all possible assistance . They approached the wreck with great difficulty , owing to the high wind and sea , but the steamer 's orew are brave fellows and they managed , at the risk of their lives , to rescue the 11 survivors and place them safely onboard the Plover .

The Plover remained in the neighborhood of the disaster till daylight . No sign of the wreck or the lost ones being visible , the steamer resumed ber course across the bay . Capt . Percey , of the schooner. was saved . The drowned were two of his brothers . a niece , a policeman , and a woman whose name is not available . They all belonged to Trinity Bay .
