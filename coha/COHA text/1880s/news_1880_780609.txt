txt The Observer , commenting on the performance of Edwin Booth as Hamlet last night , says : " Momentary , sat-isfaction alteruates with disappointment throughout the whole of Booth 's performance . A soliloquy which begins with a promise of natural effect ends in mere rhetorical display . A clever piece of new or unusual business dies away in measured obedience to the artificial mannerisms of conventional tragedy . Booth is at his best in the highly difficult interview with Ophelia ; at his worst where anything like ease or humor is required . The general impression we received from the performance is that he belongs to the large class of uninspired actors who have learned their lesson carefully . It is only just to admit that there are certain inter  - -  esting details of his performance and reading , the merit of which can not here be worthily discussed . His rendering of several of the most important . passages is that of a thoughtful scholar cramped by tradition . " The Standard says : Mr. Booth 's performance was a disappointment . It awakened re.spect rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of considerable merit . , He ' himself is a pfacticed actor , but throughout there is something wanting , and the sympathy . of the audience is untouched . He is over-emphatic in speech and gesture . He does not ' soliloquize , nut recites a set speech . In some parteMr . B Mr. ooth. gives proof of having made a comprehensive and independent study of the character . In the scene with Ophelia his tenderness is touching . " The Daily News says : " No popular favorite on our stage could have enjoyed a more cordial reception . Though there were some slight tokens of opposition from some parts of the house , yet on the whole the welcome was extremely enthusiastic . His Countenance is striking . and ' . express - ive . His features are quick to indicate fleeting shades of thought or feeling . His movements are remarkably graceful , and his gestures and tones are always appropriate . tlis performance is not any now conception . In the play scene he falls somewhat short of the excitement of the situation . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depth of pathos while he is dying in the arms ' of Horatio is sacrificed in his restless movements . Altogether , Mr. Booth 's impersonation does not leave the impression of a great performance , though it is essentially refined . " The Times says the performance was eminently interesting and successful : " Mr. Beath was master of his resources , and gave a thoroughly intelligible and consistent reading of his part . He departs less than we are accustomed to fi om the text , and is so much the more acceptable . The part is carried out with scholarly attention to detail . His delineation has the effect , though sometimes spelled by exuberance of gesture , of being beautifully musical and distinct . His expression of fear at . the first appearance of the ghost offered rather a bad augury in the beginning . His acting here was labored and tricky , but as ho proceeded Booth quite d.spelled apprehensions . The wit of the part was effectively brought out , and the dry conceits which have become as familiar as household words seemed novel from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very warm reception , and Was enthusiastically applauded by the whole house . Mr. Booth has been invited to appear in Germany . " The Daily Telegraph rays : " Mr. Booth was received with a cordiality that occasionally rose to genuine enthusiasm . There was an important representative audience to Welcome him as a student of tried excellence . Though we are occasionally disposed to doubt the absorbing influence . of Mr. Booth 's performance ; yet he made such an impress:on that every new part in which he plays can not fail to absorb attention . The naturally ideal Hamlet seems , however , to have been omAted from the programme . Although the audience was fascinated by Mr. Booth 's clear , measured delivery , the performance was academical and correct to a. fault . It is toward the close of the farewell to Ophelia that there are , for the first time , evidences of a human , natural Hamlets Mr. Booth 's manner wants sympathy , ideality , and persuasion , Mr. Booth made the least effect in the play scene . The performance was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene Mr. Booth revived wonderfully , and interested the audience at a late hour , but the fencing and death scenes were singularly ill-managed and ineffective . He did not lose his hold on the audiende , however , during the entire performance . " The Post says : " Mr. Booth 's personal gifts are favorable to the physical representation of Hamlet . To his affection for Ophelia he gives very tender expression , but the vehemence and celerity of his performance rob it of its pensive philosophy and meditative grace . The earlier scenes of the play were good , but after those Mr. Booth no longer acted with continuous Skill and spirit . The play scene was languid , but Booth rallied brightly in the last scene , and his fine fencing was universally admired . The performance bears invariable evidence of conscientious study and frequent proofs of true passion , but Mr. Booth is apt to fall into artificial grooves that prevent proper development Of his power .
