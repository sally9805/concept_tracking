txt When Mr. Blaine arrived here to-day to address the campaign meetings he found the third party men on hand anxious.and angry at his attacks upon the Prohibitionists . They had flooded the great audience present with circulars entitled : " Mr. Blaine Defines ist His Position , " and quantities of them were thrown upon the speakers ' stand . The circular read : " Mr. Blaine , in his speech at North Berwick , declares himself in favor of Government liquor taxation and a distribution of the liquor revenue among the States . Would not this result in fastening the liquor traffic upon the Republicans 7 How , as a Republican prohibitionist , can he advocate such a doctrine 7 Since Government taxation of the traffic recognizes the sale of liquor and demands compensation for the privilege of the manufacture and sale , does not Mr. Blaine place himself in the light of an open advocate of- a national license law I " PORTLAND , Me. , Aug. 27 . ? It has been decided to hold a great Prohibition rally at Sebago Lake Sept. 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blaine , and Gen Neal Dow will also pay his . respects to the Maine statesman . " We propose , " said a leading Prohibitionist , " to show ' Mr. Blaine that we are strong : enough to defeat him again . He deceived Neal Dow , slapped u ; all in the face , went back on his word ; now we shall fight him down . That 's all . " Ex-Gov . St. John is quoted as saying : " Mr. Blaine reminds me of the Irishman who knocked down a Jew because he had just found . out who crucified the Saviour . You 'd think , to hear our friend Mr. Blaine talk , that he had just heard of the Prohibition movement . it is a promising thing that the Republicans are beginning now to notice our existence . Mr. Blaine would have us believe that the Republican Party was the father of prohibition in Maine . He knew that to be an untruth . Why , the very thing . that drove Neal Dow out of the Republican Party was their failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blaine ought to have told you the whole truth . It ' would be bad enough for one of us little fellows to make a mistatement. but the gigantic mind of a great statesman should not be used that way . Mr. Blaine says the third party in their convention cheerfully testify that prohibition has been so well enforced by the Republicans that in their judgment Maine is a quarter of a century ahead of the license States in. all that pertains to temperance reform . That is unfair . It is notorious that many saloons are now open in Portland under Republican rule , where , under the Democrats two years ago , not a saloon was open . Give the devil his due . We do n't want any high sounding relations or buncombe . We want good faith . I 'd rather have two years of actual representation of the liquor traffic than all the ingling resolutions you could give me . Blaine is n't progressive and he is n't fair . He is fighting the Prohibitionists to-day and will carry the fight beyond the State . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prohibitory party in the Nation . I have no fear of the result . We ' are right , and therefore stronger than Mr. Blaine.
