txt Senator Sawyer 's countenance wore its broadest smile an hour after the Senate met to-day , and he strolled about the chamber chatting with Senators here and there in a way that showed how happy he felt . The Senate had just passed the Sturgeon Bay and Lake Michigan Canal job in the River and Harbor bill with a majority that was very pleasing to all interested in the scheme .. Mr. Spooner , the colleague of Mr. Sawyer , proposed a substitute for the Commerce Committee 's item , which was simply another way of reaching the same result . He made a speech in favor of the canal job , and as the committee had no objection to make to his substitute it was adopted . Then a roll call was ordered on the question of inserting the amendment in the bill . When the call was finished the canal Senators had polled 36 votes against 16 in opposition to the scheme . Among the Senators who supported thejob to make the Government pay $150,000 for a canal built out of the proceeds of 200,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government were Messrs Evans , Frye , Harrison , Hoar , Manderson , Miller , Payne , Teller , Spooner , Sawyer , Vest , MeMillan , Dawes , Cullom , Brown , and Wilson of Iowa . The 16 who were unwilling to aid the scheme were Messrs . Berry , Butler , Cockrell . Colquitt , Edmunds , Earns , Hawley , Ingalls , Maxey , Platt , Pugh . Saulsbury , Vance , Whitthorne , and Wilson of Maryland . The neat job in the his is the item of $350,000 for the purchase of the Portage Lake Canal . This will be reached to-morrow , and its advocates have little reason to fear that it will be thrown out by the Senate after the favor shown to the Sturgeon Bay propositiou to-day . The Republicans of the House of Representatives proceeded to-day upon the assumption that the President 's vetoes of private pension bills are to be unpopular and not to be sustained by public sentiment . If that was not the assumption of Mr. Browne , of Indiana . who was for the time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leader of the minority , then the minority flew in the face of the public sentiment that the Democrats look to to sustain the President in refusing to approve some of the pension bills passed . The veto messages were read , and when the time came for disposing of them the Republicans insisted that they should be referred to the Committee on Invalid Pensions , with instructions to report them back on or before Monday . This made the issue , and upon this the speeches were delivered . The Republican speeches were intended to be very severe upon the President , but were quite as plainly bids for political support as they were evidence of spontaneous patriotism . One answer made by Mr. Matson to some of the complaints was interesting . He declared that many of the cases rejected by the President had already been vetoed by a Republican Commissioner of Pensions . It came out during the discussion that the present Committee on Invalid Pensions had reported more bills than any committee that has considered such measures for years . Having pushed the bills to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a specified day , the Republicans opposed the Democratic demand on a third bill for the previous question , and used up the rest of the day in filibustering.
